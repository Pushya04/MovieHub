One of the best cinematic experiences ever...,"Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***Â½/****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's an experience! A magical one.,"I was waiting for this day for the longest time. I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released. So never got to watch it back then. But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away! This is nothing short of a masterpiece! It's beyond belief how a film like this could've been made. Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget. I'm definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough.Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fascinating concept .Must be seen cannot be described,"I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic journey.,"You know the feeling when you start watching a movie, realizing it's almost 3 hours, and saying to yourself - ""Well this is probably gonna be mostly boring"", well, the creators of this movie didn't let that happen, rest assures.From the beginning up until the ending, every scene is perfected, with amazing acting, stunning directing, great visual effects, and astounding sound effects.The story building is just great , characters are well-developed , and the concept is brilliant.The only thing that's missing to me, is a fitting-soundtrack which could've give some scenes a great boost.I avoided watching this movie for a long time, because it just seemed a little ridiculous to me (Come on there are blue people) but I'm so glad I finally decides to give it a chance, and boy did it serve.Loved it. 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually mind-blowing, but lacking in the story","I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as ""Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichÃ©d, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Technically outstanding. Originality: oh well....,"Well, I just saw Avatar this morning, one of the press premieres which are running on these days. My opinion: you've seen this story a hundred times, but never like this. Finally 3D is what it's supposed to be, an instrument at the service of the movie. You'll enjoy the visual experience, no doubt.As for the story, some of the ""inspirations"" are so huge and so obvious that mentioning two or three of them would REALLY ruin the movie for you, and I'm not willing to do that. Lots of mysticism and ecology, if you like that stuff. If you're 15 or so, you'll have a great time thinking that it's the first time somebody makes something like this. If you're an experienced movie watcher, better leave your skepticism at the door, bring lots of pop corn and enjoy with the usual action-flick-with-moral-and-loads-of-clichÃ©s.I liked it, however: ""the movie that re-invents movies""??? No way.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible scope and spectacle,"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichÃ©d and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichÃ©d despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A NEW WORLD.....,Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I've never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That's why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don't miss this one on the big screen if you haven't seen it. It's a total new world experience. Can't wait for the PART 2....,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar - Breathtakingly Beautiful,"When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it's industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it's audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it's an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90's, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the ""Avatar Program"", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70's, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40's - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it's time.4 Stars out of 4 Stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Looks great, I just wish I cared what happened in it","""Avatar"" is not the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings."" It might be the next ""Matrix,"" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next ""Matrix Revolutions."" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after ""Return of the King."" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the ""Na'vi,"" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Heck, even ""Dead Man."" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, ""we have to fight terror with terror."" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about ""Star Wars"" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember ""Jake Sully."" 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually amazing, but otherwise average at best","Yeah this movie took several steps forward in terms of cinematography and filming technology, but that is all that can really be said to be what makes this film worth seeing. Everything else that makes a film great is totally lack luster.There is no deep character development. Why does Jake Sully really want to become a part of the Navi? What was life on Earth like? What really makes him want to break away from his roots there? Is it just the ability to walk? I mean are there no more Native Americans or Buddhists left on Earth (which is clearly who the Navi were based off of) to give him that spiritual satisfaction? How does he feel about filling his brother's shoes? Twin relationship? The conflict between scientists and the military is not developed. Every supporting character was a stock character. Michelle Rodriguez somehow manages to have a place in Hollywood after literally playing the same type of character in every film she is in (Fast and the Furious, SWAT, Blue Crush...yeah just put her in a futuristic helicopter and thats her in this one). Was Sigourney Weaver supposed to be a mother figure? How did the bad guy from the Last of the Mohicans feel about faking a Native American language? The plot was totally predictable, and the dialogue was crap. It was like James Cameron turned in his dialogue assignment a day late.This movie deserves no award nominations at all outside of those in technical categories.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually Spellbinding!,"I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local ""Event Cinema"" BCC in 3DNow this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi's faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...So for those of you who have not seen this yet...

Technically impressive and important but beyond that there is not a huge amount to talk about,"Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me â particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first ""big"" film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally â it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The ""look it's in 3D"" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great â the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about ""how did they do that shot"" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious â others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as ""Unobtainium"" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is ""so-so"", Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichÃ©d that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Masterpiece for eye and soul...,"This movie actually blew my mind! I have to admit that it's quite easy to impress me, but when i left the cinema I was just amazed by the feelings this film left. First of all to say is that the visual effects and the whole setting of this movie is absolutely unique yet and will be for a few years still, I think. The Sorrounding on ""Pandora"" doesn't let you breathe for several minutes in which you just cannot close your mouth. But this is NOT what makes this movie unique and so awesome! The story is really a great part of it, and gives the film its spirit. OK, it IS predictable, but many tiny parts that are unexpected just give it the suspense it needs. This is no ""switch off your brain""-movie!!!In my opinion this film is worth 9-10 stars, I'm giving 10 for the goose-flesh it still gives me every time I see the trailer or hear the soundtrack.

Escapism at it's best,"Just go! The people who made this movie, most of which are just average working people making a normal salary deserve it for what they have created. This movie accomplishes what most people go to movies for. To escape from reality for a little while.Not only is this what I consider a milestone in the evolution of state of the art movie making, it's a good story with a simple message.A bit annoyed at some of the criticisms. I don't see anything political in the metaphorical message this movie presents. If Republicans hate the idea that getting close to nature is good and war is bad then too bad so sad for them! There is only 1 directly political reference to Bush. That is when the military offensive is referred to as a ""shock and awe"" campaign. If people are going to get their panties in a bunch over that then again, sucks to be them!Also don't understand the criticisms about the similarity to Dances with Wolves. Dances with Wolves was not a unique idea. Modern society has been screwing over aboriginals for centuries. What is so bad in pointing that out once in awhile in a way that most people can relate to? By seeing it through the eyes of someone from this modern world.I loved every minute of this movie. There were a couple tiny teeny little things in the dialog I would have done differently but no matter how you slice it, this is a masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I watched it twice within 24 hours!,"Never before have I felt the need to express my views about a movie online except when I saw Lord of the Rings for the first time.Let's get it straight- the ONLY thing ordinary about Avatar is its screenplay. It's not bad, just ordinary. Story is clichÃ©d, but very relevant. Everything else about the movie is just out of the world, literally! This is not a movie like Pulp Fiction or Fight Club. It doesn't require intelligence to understand the plot. But seriously, who cares? The visuals are so stunning and wonderful that you are sucked into Pandora. You feel like you are living on Pandora and watching the actors over their shoulders. This is where 3D filming has been put to great use in this movie. I can only speak for myself but I related to the characters so well that I was almost emotionally attached to them an hour into the movie.The two main messages of the story are environmentalism and peace. Both of them are extremely relevant today. But then again, the purpose of this movie is not just to carry those messages across. It's to show a completely different world in stunning detail and to let the viewers relate that world to our own. To me, it talks also about fighting injustice, even if it is perpetuated by ""your own"" people. The biological theory of connections between all the living things on the planet was pretty cool and is truly, the worldwide web.The acting doesn't stand out as mind-blowing but blame it not on the actors, but the visuals. James Horner, as always, delivers with the music. It is so inextricably linked to the scenes that you probably won't be able to imagine enjoying the movie without it. Special effects, needless to say, are outstanding! CGI on this scale for hundreds of characters is no mean task. Dialogs, as I mentioned before, are not extra-ordinary but then again, you don't expect a marine to be Shakespeare in his linguistic articulation. They definitely fit in with the plot.This definitely is another milestone in movie-making and will definitely spawn a lot more special-effects filled movies. All in all, the movie rises above others of its class for the way in which this rather simple-minded story is told. I still can't stop playing through the scenes in my mind. Go watch it and let go of your worries and live in Pandora for 166 minutes and trust me, it's a wonderful life!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
There is So Much to Say About James Cameron's AVATAR,"I'm not sure where to begin with James Cameron's Avatar. I could start by saying I've been waiting 12 years for this film. I could start by saying Terminator 2 is my all time favorite movie, and I've watched it a thousand times since I was a kid. But I'm going to start with the most positive thing I could say. James Cameron is a special filmmaker. He revolutionized film-making in the 1980s with The Terminator and Aliens. He did it again in the 1990s with Terminator 2 and Titanic. So after 12 years of anticipation and hype, and all the reports of the record budget being somewhere between a mind-boggling $300 and $500 million, I expected Avatar to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.And sadly, it wasn't. Not even close. I will admit that the visuals in the film were stunning, and sometimes made you feel like you were dreaming. Cameron has definitely spent his time wisely creating a new universe all his own, and inventing a totally new world, one that leaves us in awe. However, for a filmmaker like Cameron, the whole IMAX 3D element of the film really wore on me. After a while, I couldn't wait to take off those uncomfortable glasses which helps us ""see"" the stunning visuals, as Cameron wants us to, which are quite nauseating, particularly for a movie that is almost three hours in length. I've never seen a film in 3D or IMAX before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But now that I've seen it, it begs the question, why? Hey Jimmy, you're James frickin' Cameron! You don't need 3D to make good movies, man! I feel like 3D is like cheating on a test that you've studied for your entire life. Why is Cameron trying to overcompensate for no reason? He can make superb films without any of this IMAX 3D CGI stuff.As for the plot, well there is none. Avatar essentially features no plot, or story, other than the typical love angle, which can only be classified as being beyond cheesy. If there is a ""story"", you've seen and heard it many times before. A man sent in to infiltrate a band of aliens grows close to their ways and in the end turns against his own kind when the two sides battle each other out. You've seen it in Dances With Wolves, you've seen it in The Last Samurai, hell, I could even go all the way back to 1956 and cite John Ford's The Searchers as a movie which features characters who are pulled into another society or world only to become one of them. Now, before you go and crucify me and say ""well every movie can be traced back to something else"", which is true, you need to understand that James Cameron is a trend-setter. HE is the one that makes the most refreshing movies, HE is the one that everyone else copies. HE doesn't need to copy anyone else. HE used to create films with creative plots and likable characters, but there's nobody to like in Avatar. After all, it's not easy to relate to a CGI-made 10 foot tall blue alien.I really expected more out of this film. The graphics were amazing, sometimes. Other times, it was just migraine-inducing. I wanted something to happen. And nothing really happened. Cameron could have made one of the all time great films if he had just put some more thought into it, and created a good story, with fleshed out characters, and a climax that doesn't come off as being a thoughtless, cookie-cutter finale. Armed with a budget of this enormity, and over a decade between narrative films, you'd think ""the king of the world"" would have come up with a better movie.But I do think people will love most of the visuals, I certainly did. But after nearly three hours, it suddenly dawns on you, ""is there anything else to this movie?"" Because while staring at the Mona Lisa is a very thought provoking thing to do, eventually, you move on! And that's what this film felt like. A beautiful painting come to life, but one that eventually gets tired and predictable. Sadly, and despite what most of people will say, because they loved the visuals and have never seen anything like it, James Cameron's Avatar was extremely disappointing and I'm not sure if I'll ever forget this kind of disappointment for a long, long time.I still love Terminator 2, and I still love James Cameron. But I feel like I've been waiting through a 12 year war for my loved one to return, only to see them come back a completely different person, one whom I simply don't know and can't trust anymore. Take this for what it is, an honest review from ONE viewer. Most will not be in favor of my thoughts, because it's not overly positive. But it is what it is. Avatar is not exactly a movie. It is something else. A $400 million cartoon perhaps. Or a $400 million live-action video game. It will probably be copied a million times over the course of the upcoming decade though. Maybe, hopefully, by the end of it, Cameron will return to making movies with real people again. Maybe then, everyone will copy him once more, and all movies will go back to being about real people again. I think that's something that we all want deep down inside, but, for some reason... we just won't admit it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Its too god to be true,"Avatar was probably the greatest movie i have ever seen in my life. The special effects were jaw-dropping, and i didn't even see the movie in 3-D. But i will go see it for the 3rd time this week, in Imax 3-D.The emotions displayed on the characters faces were incredibly detailed, especially Neytiri. It all looked so real. If i didn't know better, i would of said that they just went to a distant planet and filmed aliens. It looked so real... This was probably the first movie that i actually was disappointed that it ended. i really wanted it to never end.

7 For Chutzpah,"You put your glasses on and you're in. A feast for the eyes at least for the first hour. The brain, however, remains asleep. How strange that such an ambitious enterprise could ignore its most important aspect, the story. A rehash of other things with dialogues from a high school play. Also, very self referential. The bitch! from Aliens truly omnipresent. I was surprised Sam Worthington didn't say ""I think I've seen an iceberg"" or maybe he did say it while I conceded myself a little nap - after the second hour - So here we are, facing a film future in 3D"" I will, still, long for characters in movies, people I can, not just relate, but be inspired by, thought provoking and all the rest that goes with it.

"Happy Symbolical Birthday; to Jake, to Pandora and to James Cameron - who has been born again","Science fiction is, at its core, more than just a hypothetical fantasy about our distant neighbours twinkling in the night. It is also a reflection on humanity. It holds the mirror up to our faces and forces us to question who we are; when our aspirations, morals, ideals and weaknesses are put to the test, are we really who we think? And what is our place in the great darkness that surrounds us, frightens and amazes us? To know your own culture; learn another man's customs. It is only by comparison that we can truly see ourselves. And it is also only us, as subjective individuals, that can know who we are beneath our human exteriors. Many of us focus too much on our weaknesses and turn to God/s and religion for love and acceptance despite our faults, with heaven as the ultimate point of approval. Acceptance by someone or something that truly sees us, not only the shortcomings, but also for what we hope to believe that we fundamentally are; good, decent, with the heart in the right place, trying to make the best of what we have been given. Some of us don't believe in God, or profoundly question his/her/its existence. Many fear death, the unknown, never to see, feel or experience anything again. To be forgotten. For ever.So the question becomes: does this introduction have a point and what does Avatar have to do with it? Mr James Cameron is a self-proclaimed sci-fi nerd and - not to mention - a human being (although I agree questionable, let us make that assumption for convenience sake) and just like many of us I am sure he shares many of the same existential thoughts and questions that find their way into our human brains and skeptic hearts. And like many of us he seems to share a craving for adventure, discovery, enlightenment and a curiosity of the world, the universe and the beings with whom we happen to share our short time here on Earth.With Avatar, Mr Cameron manages to address most of these existential questions: who are we? Not in the comfort of our living rooms, nestled in the sofa with a bag of crisps and a chocolate bar in front of the TV, but in the face of choice. The choice between convenience and what we believe in. When all the luxuries have been taken away, and all the shields and walls and layers have been peeled off, do we like what we see? Avatarians have an expression; ""I see you"", which comes with such a deep ring to it because it is what we all want the world and people around us to do; to recognize, appreciate and care about us and to see that no matter how we might act and react on occasions, deep down we are good. These glasses we desire others to wear when they look at us also have another umbrella term; love. Some say love is blind, but to me at least, real love is not blind, it is understanding. It looks beyond the flaws and recognizes us for all the good things that we are. It sees our actions from our point of view.The story of Pandora's box in Greek mythology depicts how numerous evils were let into our world in a moment of weakness on Pandora's behalf. In much the same way, humanity in James Cameron's Avatar goes to the planet of Pandora and is confronted with a choice; open the lid or let the box be. Naturally, the greed (for money, power, etc) wins, and so, the lid is opened. Naturally, it has consequences. However, just like in the original story of Pandora's box, something else was let into the world when the lid was pulled away, something to counterbalance the evils that had been unleashed; hope. The hope that the good will, eventually, win. In Cameron's Avatar, this hope is represented by a group of humans who are not set out to exploit the people and resources of Pandora, but to understand it. And with understanding comes the ability to see clearly, and with this comes, ultimately, love. Love is not blind, but ignorance is, and ignorance is the root of most evils taking place in the world today.We all choose how we want to see the world. Everything is neutral as far as the universe is concerned; there is no good or evil, no good or bad, no morals set in some sacred stone at the heart of the heart of the universe. Morals are what we, humans, have created because we have a conscience. We have the ability to empathise and sympathise, to see the world through other's eyes as if they were our own.On Pandora, everything is connected; the trees, the animals, the flora and fauna, the past and the present, the living and the dead. If we as humans could be as connected with each other and communicating as much, I believe understanding of each other's differences would ultimately result in the realisation that we are in fact more similar than different. I believe that one such medium of communication already exists today â the Internet. Another one is the media but the question is how well it is working.I think Cameron's intended message with this film is very simple and â I admit â very clichÃ©, but also very true and it doesn't hurt to be reminded of every once in a while; to see what we value and to stand up for it.Plus, it's easier to see the world through another's eyes when it's presented with such smashing CGI...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Masterpiece or Pocahontas in Space?,"It's movies like this that are a reminder that story should always be the number one priority when making a movie. The amount of clichÃ©s at multiple phases in the movie is unbelievable. It would be too easy to point out obvious and rather blatant rip offs that occur throughout (going into a misunderstood tribal group, sacred trees, being in tune with nature). After all I was almost shocked I didn't see the writers of the Disney version of Pocahontas credited as assistant writers.After saying this, I have to give credit where credit is due. James Cameron's vision for film making is unmatched by anyone. The visuals are outstanding; entertaining and saved me from regretting laying down the extra two dollars to see this film in 3-D (it's not worth it to see the regular version). It is obvious that Cameron has unparallel dedication and drive to make a film that people will want to see. This same dedication and drive made him want to handle writing this one himself. Few posses the power to demand the type of budget that Cameron can and it's obvious this film could not have been made without a substantial budget. If you would have combined this new ground breaking and visually stunning technology, with an equally moving and unique script then that's the movie I want to see.Am I disappointed I invested 162 minutes and $10.50 into this movie? No. The visual themselves are worth the price. But at points you will be nauseated, you will roll your eyes, and will ask the question: Why does Hollywood not think we can handle a good story anymore?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Welcome to Pandora,"It's been 12 years since we last saw James Cameron's visionary directing on the big screen. He previously graced Our Cinemas with the Likes of The Terminator, Aliens and the rather popular titanic. The latter went on to gross more than 1.8 billion dollars worldwide and bag 11 Oscar's. Now he's back with another epic, Avatar. It's been 12 years in the making, now it is being realised in glorious 3-D.The story is set hundreds of years from today on the distant moon of Pandora. The planets a lush, vivid place full of beautiful and deadly creatures. The population that inhabit this planet are the Na'vi, they are big, very fast and athletic with a knack for not taking the humans lightly. The film centres on Jake sully (Sam Worthington) a paraplegic marine who is offered a second chance at being a soldier. He is asked to fill in his recently deceased brother's boots and head to Pandora. The First thing you will notice about this film is that it looks incredible. Every single blade of grass has been fully detailed. The motion capture technology brings the Na'vi to life, with every emotion being realised. This is truly from a visionary point of view, a work of art.You are transported to the Moon of Pandora and it's a marvel if you are seeing it in 3-D, as intended. You are then introduced to the main characters of the film. First you meet the rather joyful and impressive colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) He gives a stand out performance as a stereotypical American Grunt, a rather over used clichÃ© by the Canadian director. You are then introduced to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) who has affection for the Na'vi, and looking for a way back into the indigenous population's community.You will notice through the film that there are many references to James Cameron's previous work Aliens. There are a few small similarities' and one big, Aliens is arguably Cameron's best work, so it's not a negative. The role of Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) will remind you of Carter Burke, the slimy all business Executive from Aliens. The score by James Horner, who also worked with Cameron on the 1986 hit leaves a familiar taste in your mouth. Cameron originally wanted Michael Biehn to play the role of Quaritch but thought the audience would get confused as Sigourney Weaver is also in the movie.The introduction of neytiri (Zoe Saldana) is powerful and exciting, You get the impression that she knows how to handle herself, This is a trait of all Jim Cameron's heroines. She introduces us to the Na'vi culture, and in the process, we start to care for and understand the advanced race.The film flows well; it can drag at times, especially in the middle act of the film. This could have been improved with an extra RDA encounter, to further mount the tension between the Na'vi and the inpatient humans. The Action in the film is amazing, real hard hitting stuff. But it is in no way mindless. Every scene of action has been carefully crafted, by the trusty hands and eyes of James Cameron, Who has a knack for getting the audiences, pulse racing. The final battle lasts around 40 minutes long and it is defiantly a sight to be seen.Final Thought's: On a technical level the film is a triumph with moments of wonder, the action is top notch to boot. The script and story can let it down at points, but that is no reason not to see the movie.Avatar is like a beautiful painting. What you see is what you get, and what you get is nothing short of epic.A moment of brilliance: The final battle scene is as good as they come. The last time you had Goosebumps like this, was when a well known farm boy, destroyed a death star.Reviewer: Joshua Roberts",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar: Once in a lifetime film making,"James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. He is what you may call an Auteur. If you aren't aware of this, then you probably are not a movie person. James Cameron wrote and directed Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic. That last one I'm not a fan of, but he won Best Director, Picture, and it became the highest grossing film of all time. $1.2 billion dollars.Avatar is his latest film, it is a movie that has been in the works since 1994. After a decade of being in the works, you would expect it to be a good movie. But the real question is it any good? It is the most expensive film ever made. The budget was $500,000,000 so you'll be wondering if all that money was put to good use, and if you should spend $11.00 to see the film in 3-D. Should you or should you not?The answer is that you should. Avatar is a monumental success. It is a film unlike anything you have ever seen. It uses special effects to a level that you have never seen, and that's not a bad thing.The story to Avatar revolves around Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-marine who is sent unwillingly to a hostile planet known as Pandora. While on this planet he finds himself caught in the middle of a war between the planet's indigenous people known as the Na'vi, and his own race. He must decide whether he should fight for what he knows is right or help his own people destroy Pandora as they destroyed earth. I don't want to spoil anything in the story, so I'll refrain from saying anything else. To put it simple, the whole movie was the prime example of a colonialism work.The cast in Avatar is strong. Sam Worthington (Terminator: Salvation) stars as Jake Sully. He does a fantastic job, but the real credit in the film has to go to Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) for playing the native Neytiri. She creates most of the emotion in the entire film. She preforms fantastically and I also have to mention that she is also really attractive as a blue woman. (True fact.) Some people have complained about Stephen Lang (Public Enemies) as the antagonist of the film. But he actually pulls off a very believable and cruel performance. All the actors in the film are great. But the real actors are the ones that are the digital Na'vi. These actors are the ones that create the film. I think that this movie is proof that special effects don't have to be of just robots killing and blowing stuff up. (Even though that's in this movie.) This movie shows that special effects can be used to take us to places that we never even dreamed of.Other films have used special effects like this. (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean, District 9) But none of them have gone as far as this movie has. This movie takes you to a whole new level of film making that you can't even imagine. You almost want to call this movie insane, because of how different and unique it is. You really have never seen anything like this, and that's a very good thing. What I really enjoyed about this film, was how it is a breath of fresh air. You don't see that very often. The only other films to do that this year for me were District 9 and Fantastic Mr. Fox. But Avatar is far more different and unique than these other movies.One thing that I always enjoy about a James Cameron film is his sense of innovation. Avatar is the most innovative movie I've seen in years. It is so different from anything else that you have seen. It is a movie a film that you literally cannot describe. This is a see to believe film. You'll have to see the movie to believe that it's as good as I'm telling you. Avatar is a once in a lifetime film. You will not get another chance to see a movie like this one.James Cameron creates not only a visually beautiful race of people, but also a culture that is so beautiful. The Na'vi in Avatar felt very Native American to me. Everything from how they dress to the musical score is very unique, and made me think of Native Americans. The film was almost like a reenactment of our history, with the Native Americans being driven out of their home land. It's all very believable. It's all very sad as well; and it moves you. I sympathize with the Na'vi as they fight for their lives and their home.I am not a fan of 3D. I think it is over used, and ultimately lessens the movie experience. Avatar however, is not like that. The 3D in Avatar is extraordinary. Little bugs on the screen fly right past you, leaves fall from trees towards you, and the battles are astronomical. You really feel like you're there, and forget that this is a movie. The cinematography is actually enhanced by the 3D which is a rare thing. The wide flying camera shots make you feel like you're flying with the film, it is fantastic.Avatar is a difficult movie to review because it is so innovative. It blows away almost all sci-fi epics out there, and is a must see. See Avatar. It is well worth full-price, and it is the best picture of the year. The only movie that comes to being as good as Avatar is District 9. Avatar however, I will say is better because Avatar has heart. A truly fantastic movie. Avatar is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, it is James Cameron's masterpiece, and it should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It feels so good to be a fanboy again.,"I did my best to keep the expectations low, but it didn't quite work out. I mean, it's a movie directed by James Cameron, featuring sassy badass Space Marines, evil corporations, power armor, and Sigourney Weaver. That's the closest I'll ever get to a direct Aliens sequel, definitely one of my top 5 movies of all time and inspiration of countless wet military sci-fi dreams.On the other hand, although trying to stay spoiler-free, I kinda did expect something that would turn me off on a certain levels, hearing things about ""dances with wolves"" in space and a straight green message, delivered in black and white, without the necessary shades of grey in between. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for saving the planet and respecting the natives, but I like my messages delivered in a subtle way that makes me care, instead of the sledgehammer-in-your-face method. See ""the day the earth stood still"" remake. Bah, humbug.Third point: My first movie in 3d. Wasn't sure how it would work out for me with my glasses, and if it would enhance or distract from the experience. Really, I had no clue.So. here's a spoiler-free, very personal summary of what I think: Go. See. That. Movie.In a nutshell: It's flawed, but for me, a flawless experience. It's extremely CGI-heavy (something I couldn't be more sceptic about), but it's CGI you buy into. The designs, the human characters, the animated characters, there's just... chemistry. The illusion is there and makes you overlook the obvious. The plot is predictable, but it didn't give me time to predict, because it gripped me and didn't let me go. See, a movie can have the most blatant story, the question is how it is delivered by the people involved, from the actors to the director. That's the theory, and I was always sceptic of such gibberish. But boy, it was delivered, straight to my inner child, on a silver plate full of awesome. It immersed me. It worked. I was in awe. I was in tears. I was cheering. The whole premise, the parallels to our history, the message, the love story, it's all naive. And I'm so glad that it just shut the **** up that cynic in me in the most elegant way for three hours and made me naive and open for the beauty and wit and wonder in it. I didn't think I was still capable of that, but I watched that movie with the wide, blue eyes of a fourteen year old, enjoying a thrilling, heartbreaking mix of ""ALIENS"" and ""E.T."".Also, sh** blows up really good.See, the Star Wars prequels were something that should have been just that. Instead, I was pulled out of it and shaking my head all over the place. I was pulled out by wooden, badly-directed actors acting confused in front of too much blue screen. I was pulled out by half-assed cartoony CGI characters. By video game sequences of unbelievable combat and plot holes as big as a small moon.And here's the movie where it's all so flawless, human and elegant- characters, effects, delivery- that I gladly overlook its faults and enjoy it for what makes it awesome. Here's the spiritual successor of the movies I grew up with and loved, that just left me dreaming. Suddenly I remember how it was to watch 1977's Star Wars for the very first time. Grinning, crying, cheering and clapping.This is it. But don't listen to me, I'm being a biased fanboy here.See? It managed to make me a biased fanboy. Nothing has done that in a decade. And it feels so good!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Mr so-called ""King of the World"" returns with a visually dazzling spectacle and so-so story","James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
King of the world?... No! .... Master of the universe!,"Simple as that :-) This movie is more than most of you think. It has the message.

"If you thought Jurrasic Park was your favorite childhood fantasy adventure film, then imagine how children today are going to feel about this!","AVATAR is the Jurassic Park of this generation, with no doubt is it a family film, but it is also a hybrid of everything good in Cameron.Firstly, The highly-talked about visuals have given me, and the audience a true experience, if that is counted by the number of gasps, claps and heartbeats of every audience member, I seriously didn't get that in Transformers or 2012, people literally gasped when Jake explored the Bio-Luminescence nightlife of Pandora, now that is something you don't usually get in films! But this film isn't just about visuals, it's about the magic of film-making. And that is something rarely achieved in such absolute beauty, beauty that leaves you walking away from the theater, wanting to return the next day, and the day after that. I have never felt so good after watching a movie, a movie that holds such beautiful magic, since the original star-wars trilogy came out back in the 70's and 80's.The film ends leaving you wanting more, it starts by slowly enticing you, then gradually building up into one heck of an adventure, rolling at such a speed that you'd never think it would end, but films end eventually, and I just hope that we are given more in the future, so seriously, enjoy the power of seeing it for the first-time, watch it with a fresh-mind, an empty bowl and zero distractions because the world of Pandora awaits, the trip of a lifetime to an alien world beyond your imagination!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
AVATAR has a soul,"AVATAR has a soulI saw AVATAR today. It was a boiling 40 degrees Celsius in Australia. I caught a bus and train to get there. I spent months on a forum before that. Incremental stops included a scriptment, stills, a teaser, a foot, AVATAR day and a full trailer. Now released I have had many reviews to read which have been mostly very positive.It is a marvel to watch. The opening scenes are very sci-fi with a glimpse of low gravity aboard a space-craft. Sam Worthington fills us in with a short narration. He is taking over his diseased brother's role in the AVATAR program. These opening scenes are actually among the most effective 3D in the film, pulling you into this story, tracking shots putting you into the steps of the characters.I jump ahead, like the film, to The world of Pandora which is lush with earthly life as seen through pulp fantasies. The rendering of this world is terrific. The life and activity is in the plants as much as it is the animals. Wonder is generated with this ambitious creation. Cameron has lifted the bar. The CG is the best I have ever seen. Everything you have heard is true. The 3D enhances this with leaves falling and swaying branches life-like in the foreground.The realisation of the Navii is also ambitious. They are CG but there are many moments that make you think they are real and in terms of the story they are more than good enough to propel the narrative with strong emotional content.I went into this film knowing mostly everything within it. Hours of reading, some from the treatment and pages of the recent reviews. It is very much a family film like ""Nealz"" said in his IMDb review. There is a moment where one of the ferocious animal species that earlier were attacking Jake are seen with a litter, the children in the audience loved the cute pups! The spiritual side of this film is much better than expected. It is in fact a beautiful story. The structure is classical film-making but with amazingly new scope in CGI to express grand images. An epicThe journey that Jake takes through Pandora is lovely. He is taken in by the Navii and explores their culture, language and habitat. Natirii, the female Navii he meets while lost, helps him through this journey. This is a love story of both soul mates and with a wider picture. Existential connections with the natural world. Personal destiny.I had tears in this film. I tried to hold them back but by the roll of credits they came. This is a movie that I have anticipated for so long. I think the ingredients of its story and my connection to this films production gave me a very emotional response. I cant imagine this disappointing any of the fans on the board. Keeping in mind that it is a family film but delivered everything I wanted.Expect a special edition. After AVATAR is a hit, a special edition will make its way to the cinema. I can understand why they would cut the earth scenes and it works. The actual film seems pretty brisk and it could also have more padding out. You want more of it and that is a triumph for this type of film running two and a half hours. It is a good balance because at two and a half hours AVATAR is aimed directly at the cinema going audience. Broadly appealing with elements for everyone. My earlier prediction of a billion or more world-wide seems safe.I don't want to go on about visuals too much but the lovely shots of the natural wonderland of glowing life in still 3D shots is magical. Something to take kids to see. Floating tiny neon life jellyfish their way through the air with grace. The monkey-like extra-limbed creatures with the peeping eyes flock through the forrest quickly. The creature design is done in a clever way with the motion of a living thing. The action is over the top, epic, frenetic and a new take on the battle sequence.James Cameron didn't stuff this up. He probably pressed the studio way beyond their comfort zone with the time, money and effort that has gone into this. Sam Worthington is excellent casting choice. Sigourney Weaver ads frank reason. Stephen Lang chews the scenery as the ultimate you know what. Zoe Saldana is beautiful as Jakes guide into this world and.I went to the cinema and it was a very hot day. By the time I left the cinema, the streets were wet with rain. A warm humidity was thick in the air. Lightning splashed my walk to the train station with white light. I honestly wondered if It was my time to be struck down with a bolt of electricity from the sky.Watch this film. It is destined to become a childhood classic to many little-ones too young to be on this forum. It will be talked about at high school by male and females as spectacular. It will be watched multiple times by fans. I loved it but beyond my appreciation for the film itself, is the the message of love permeating from this movie that I hope enters the zeitgeist like elements of Cameron's other stories have. At its heart is a soul. AVATAR is an achievement in many technical departments but I wouldn't say the story is deficient. It is a beautiful experience and the story is surprisingly what I loved most.Believe the hype.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mustsee masterpiece!,"Avatar: The Way of the Water is visually breathtaking and entertaining. The storyline is original and only leave a want for more. The length of the film was no concern and needed for proper character development. The characters in the film were a good selection and made the film more enjoyable and watchable. The movie may be classified as scifi, but it meets the expectation of almost every genre. Like the first Avatar, this movie wil be my go to movie until the next Avatars come out. Both Avatar movies are deserving of the best movie title. Thank you, James Cameron, you did not disappoint. I look forward to the next installments.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just the best Cinema experience on this planet,"The visuals and 3D are truly amazing. Some people spend Thousands for traveling to see beautiful landscapes and that's fine. But in the cinema we see the most beautiful world and the visuals are so good, one forgets being in a cinema. It feels like 3 hour trip to another planet. Some people say its boring, because the story is not unique. But that doesn't matter. A movie is a story and how the story is told is 100 times more important than the story itself. Every crime movie has same story: Someone dies -> detective identifies murderer. Yet we want to see HOW the detective does it.Actually I think, there are not so many different base stories and many movies are similar to each other. But Avatar has only one similar movie which is why people notice it.No one would complain about a crime movie: I know this story from this movie, and that movie, and that movie, and this one as well... Oh and this one and that one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Putting perfect Visuals and Virtualities aside, going deep into the Avatar's concept","Looking into Hindu mythology, when Gods descend to Earth they acquire avatars to make themselves known by human beings. Of the recent years' TV animation series let's look over ""Åban Star-Racers"" from Jetix and ""The Last Airbender"" from Nickelodeon for avatar concept. In Åban Star-Racers, the Earth had been threatening by antagonist galactic races and human beings were expecting a savior from space who is called the Avatar. On the other hand in the Last Airbender, avatar concept was completely confused with Prophecy. Aang the Avatar was born in the form of human being, which is wrong; because Avatar is a form of a God which has no destiny, no life, no death.Herein James Cameron's Avatar, the concept is truly appropriate to the origins of Hindu mythology: When humankind explores the planet Pandora, they aimed to search for underground resources; so they send an ex-serviceman to the natives in a DNA mapped hybrid body(which seems like one of them) to capture their secrets. Becoming the Avatar of natives by time, the ex-serviceman saves the planet from humankind, turning against his origin.Exploring a new planet, descending on the ground, trying to capture it by blending within natives, but failing to do so... This actually is the same storyline with a Sci-Fi legend: Franklin Schaffner's ""Planet of The Apes(1968)"". Still keeping its sense with having the most terrifying ending of all science fiction works ever created, Planet of The Apes has so many things in common with Avatar. The Apes and the Na'vis both seemed atrocious and uncivilized at first. Then we realized that they're in fact very cuddly creatures. Both Charlton Heston and Sam Worthington became beloved with a female native, and we're introduced to their untouched and God's gift virgin nature. Then as in Star Wars and Abyss, humankind declares war against the natives to capture their lands and resources.Another unique similarity between Planet of the Apes is that humankind is the evil-side again. So the same message we get with a deeper self-criticism is that humankind is the one who destroys the nature and is responsible of all wars. Wasn't this the Terminator's message as well, spoken out by Sarah Connor? ""It's in our nature to destroy ourselves"". All to the good, we didn't lose our World to apes or cyborgs this time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Stunning visuals and an ""OK"" story!","Snapshot: Avatar is a ""visually stunning"" movie that captures your imagination with a pretty ordinary story that SOME might find triteWhy I LOVED IT?When people were first informed about Avatar NO ONE spoke about ""A Great Story"" or ""Wonderful and complex Characters"". Avatar was supposed to be a treat for the eye, a very imaginative and immersive world. Avatar exactly does that. I LOVED it because it delivers what it promised to!Why is it ""Ground Breaking"" and ""Stunning""?Avatar totally blew me away in the visuals department. Now I know some people are saying that there are many movies that look more ""REAL"" and have better quality of animation than Avatar e.g. Final Fantasy, but I guess these people are missing the point. Avatar is actually about NOT looking real, it is about showing something that we have never seen or have never imagined (exotic creatures and floating mountains!!!). It is also about meticulous attention to details that we may actually never notice especially when we see the movie for the first time. So ultimately using fine details and imagination of some very creative artists a stunning and immersive world called ""Pandora"" has been created.What's NOT good?Avatar does not try to do anything new in the story line department. It's got a couple cheesy dialogues and just a touch predictable. It is the same old story told in a new way. But then how many movies that are made are really original today?From my perspective I even LIKED the story but some people with different taste, perspective and expectations might complaint!Who should watch it?I suggest EVERYONE, at least for ""Pandora""Who should avoid it?NO ONE! HOWEVER if you are VERY RELUCTANT about ""ORIGINAL STORY"", ""GREAT CHARACTERS"" blah blah blah and just cannot get the message right then don't watch it, but then you will be missing something very special ""Trust me"" on this one!SummaryGo for the movie with the right expectations i.e. ""An imaginative and visually spectacular movie"" and put other things like a ""GREAT STORY"" aside. Avatar is everything what it promised to be and that is why I give it 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible,"I remember watching Avatar when I was 9 years old and loving it back in 2009. 11 years later I thought I'd revisit it as some people w had been talking about it ironically how it is amazing, etc. And this movie kinda blew me away. We watched the extended cut that tags on 16 minutes of intro before the real film begins and that added a sense of new-ness to the movie. The animation and visuals at times blew me away and made me realize why this movie was such a cultural landmark for cinema. At other times id did look a little bit like a ps3 game where the graphics take a minute to load and everything is smooth without texture. I also forgot about how hard hitting the message of the movie is and how revolutionary AVATAR really is! James Cameron knows how to appeal to a large audience hook people in and show them a message that they cant argue with. Avatar shows us the exploitative nature of Capitalism and the husks of people behind it and how its good to go against the grain of societies order. The main character although some complain that he's not interesting or a good actor works even better for this message as he is clueless and he's 100% on the side of the military and the state and gets convinced ad won over to then lead the revolutionary battle for freedom. He is an unmemorable, plain character than makes a decision to do what's right and that relates to the masses. You don't have to be the most charismatic perfect person to make change. Where Starship Troopers (although satirical) is a movie to promote fascism (again satirical, I love this movie) and authoritarianism, Avatar is our movie to promote the right path we have to take, a path away from capitalism and it cannot be long lasting. (Also its creepy how James Cameron kinda precited Venezuela and still impressive how he Invented all that 3D Technology)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Whole New World,"Director James Cameron's return to the world of science fiction cinema is a glorious one indeed. Twelve years after delivering us the highest grossing film of all time, Cameron brings us the sci-fi epic Avatar, a film that is not only visually breathtaking, but also character driven, emotional, exciting, effective, and masterfully directed.The marketing and hype for this movie was mostly based around the groundbreaking visual effects, so I'll start there. I was lucky enough to get to see this film in a digital 3D theater. My only complaint is with myself, in that I wish I had seen a couple of 3D movies before this one. This was my first experience with a 3D film, so I really didn't have anything to compare it against, but all I knew from the very first shot of the movie was that this was going to be unlike anything I had ever seen before. At first it took me a while to adjust to the dimensions of the film, but after my eyes got used to what i was seeing, I realized that what I was looking at was not a 3D gimmick but a world with an incredible amount of depth. James Cameron rarely gets right in your face with the big things in this movie. He is more subtle than that. The things that appear to be directly in front of you (and they really do) are the little things that capture the ambiance of the scene and make you feel like you're there with the characters. The rest of the 3D effect serve to add dimensions and reality to the scenes.The visual achievement in this film is not in the action scenes (which are some of the most exciting I've ever seen) but in the lengths that were gone to to bring this world to life. James Cameron has created a planet, a species, and a culture that work in perfect harmony with each other, and likewise the visuals are in perfect harmony. I'll admit I was a little apprehensive that this movie was more computer animated than live action. To me that usually suggests that a film crew is getting lazy, and that it's going to look like a video game. That is not at all the case here. The truth is that without computer animation there is no other way this film would have looked this impeccable. The planet of Pandora is extremely beautiful and detailed, and the Na'vi species fit with it perfectly. In all honesty, you can in fact tell that the aliens are computer animated. They still haven't quite attained the ability to make CG characters that look absolutely 100% unquestionably real, and in a live action world they might still have suffered the out-of-place look that many CG characters in movie get. However, in the computer animated world of Pandora, they blend in seamlessly and beautifully. This is of course not to downplay the design of the na'vi. They look as real as you could possibly hope for. The nearness they have come to looking real, the motion capture used in this movie, the range of facial expressions and emotions that they show, are all unprecedented.All of that being said, the next big question about this movie is this: Are visual effects all it has to offer? My answer: Not at all. The depth of Avatar goes far beyond the visuals themselves.As with all of Cameron's movies, Avatar is character driven. The central characters of the film are all dynamic, well written, and very well acted. You go on an adventure with them and throughout the movie you fall in love them (or grow to despise them depending on which characters).The general plot-line of the movie is a bit generic but that's okay. No, the premise isn't anything completely brand new, but it's still an excellent plot, and one that is familiar to our society and very important for us to remember. Along with that there are still several aspects of the plot that are quite original. James Cameron took a familiar story, one that many storytellers before him have told version of, and made it his own. Furthermore, this is one of those movies where you predict things because you want to see them happen, and when your predictions turn out to come true it's gratifying. That's not to say that everything is predictable, because that would get old. Don't worry, Cameron has thrown in a fair amount of little surprises too.This film is also as much emotionally effective as it is visually effective. James Cameron is a master at getting a certain emotion or feeling out of his viewers, and every scene in the movie works toward one or more of these effects. It's very light-hearted at times, with a good bit of comedic relief, and then quite intense in other scenes. Some scenes make you fear for the main characters, or perhaps even for yourself. Much of the film is brimming with anticipation and suspense, and several scenes had me simply grinning with excitement.Overall this is one of the greatest cinematic experiences I've ever had. Avatar is groundbreaking, dynamic, powerful, and a ton of fun. I must say it was worth the wait, but I certainly hope Cameron is here to stay this time.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Avatar is This Decade's ""Star Wars""!!!","In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, heads the mining operation, which employs Marines for security, intending to exploit Pandora's reserves of a valuable mineral called unobtanium. Pandora's inhabitants are the Na'vi, a blue-skinned species of humanoids with feline characteristics. Physically stronger and taller than humans, the Na'vi live in harmony with nature, worshiping a mother goddess called Eywa.Pandora's atmosphere is toxic to humans, necessitating the use of breathing masks. Attempting to improve relations with the natives and learn about Pandora's biology, scientists grow Na'vi bodies modified with human DNA, called avatars, that are controlled by genetically matched, mentally linked human operators. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former marine, replaces his twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator, who was killed in a mugging. Doctor Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother and relegates him to a bodyguard role.In their avatar forms, Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) on a mission to reestablish peaceful relations with the Na'vi. A predator attacks the group and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by her clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at (C. C. H. Pounder), a shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior ""Dream-walker"", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways. Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), leader of the security forces, enlists Jake to bring him intelligence about the natives that could help RDA negotiate for access to the huge unobtanium deposit under Hometree. He promises Jake that he will help him obtain the expensive neuroregeneration treatment to restore his legs.At first, Jake delivers key strategic information to Quaritch. Augustine becomes suspicious and relocates herself, Jake, and Norm to a remote scientific outpost with an avatar link module. Over three months, Jake grows close to Neytiri and the Omaticaya, while questioning his loyalty to RDA's agenda. He is initiated into the Omaticaya, and he and Neytiri choose each other as mates. Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he disables a bulldozer as it destroys the tribe's ""Tree of Voices"". Quaritch presents Selfridge and Augustine with a video diary in which Jake admits that the Omaticaya will never abandon Hometree. Selfridge decides further attempts at negotiations are futile and orders Hometree destroyed.Augustine argues that the destruction of Hometree could affect the bio-botanical neural network that all Pandoran organisms are connected to, and Selfridge gives Jake and Augustine one hour to convince the Na'vi to leave Hometree. When Jake reveals his original mission to the Omaticaya, Neytiri accuses him of betraying them. Jake and Augustine's avatars are taken captive. Quaritch's forces arrive and destroy Hometree, killing Eytucan (Wes Studi), Neytiri's father and clan chief, and many others. Jake and Augustine are disconnected from their avatars and detained for treason along with Norm. Trudy ChacÃ³n (Michelle Rodriguez), a security force pilot disgusted with Quaritch's senseless violence, breaks them out and flies them to the remote link module. During their escape, Quaritch shoots Augustine.Hoping the Omaticaya can help Augustine, Jake tames a Toruk, a powerful flying beast that only five Na'vi have ever tamed, to regain their trust. Jake finds the Omaticaya at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Mo'at to heal Augustine. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her dying body into her Na'vi avatar with the aid of the Tree, but she succumbs to her injuries before the transfer completes. Mo'at declares that ""she is with Eywa now"".With the assistance of Neytiri and Tsu'Tey (Laz Alonso), the new leader of the Omaticaya, Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other clans to repel the humans. Jake prays to Eywa, via neural connection to the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi in the coming battle. Quaritch notes the mobilization of Na'vi clans and convinces Selfridge to authorize a preemptive strike on the Tree of Souls. Because it is a center of Na'vi religion and culture, its destruction would leave the Na'vi too demoralized to resist further encroachment.As the security forces attack, the Na'vi retaliate but suffer heavy casualties, among them Tsu'Tey and Trudy. Suddenly, the Pandoran wildlife joins the attack on the corporation's forces, overwhelming them. Neytiri interprets this as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Jake destroys the main bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls. Quaritch stumbles across the avatar link module where Jake's human body is located and attacks it, exposing Jake to Pandora's atmosphere. Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake. With the attack repelled, Neytiri and Jake reaffirm their love as she sees his human body for the first time.Selfridge and the remaining corporate personnel are expelled from Pandora, while Jake, Norm, and the scientists studying Pandora are allowed to remain. Jake is seen wearing the insignia of the Omaticaya leader. The clan performs the ritual that permanently transfers Jake from his human body into his Na'vi avatar.Brilliant CGI, sound, & vividly showcased in vibrant colors!!!

What movies should be like!,"James Cameron once more shows that he knows what he is doing. I finally get to watch it yesterday in 3D after waiting so long, and it was worth all the reviews and even better. I am still in shock from what I experienced. The visual effects and the 3D experience in the movie- you have to watch it with your own eyes to feel the magic James Cameron has captured with this masterpiece. Acting is excellent, you can't ask for anything more than the actors gave from science fiction. Whoever said no love or passion in the movie is mistaking big time, it has something for everyone starting from astonishing score (bravo! James Horner) and love story, big epic, awesome war episode and a unrepeatable beauty of Pandora- WOW. If you didn't like the movie at any point, you seriously need to see your doctor.

It is pure beauty!,"I want to start this review with the note that this is my first review ever,i did not write one until now because i am a critical person and i have not met a movie yet which moved me so deeply that i felt the need to write a review.I saw today Avatar in 3d with some friends,i went to the movie knowing it has nice effects and visuals but with no big expectations, i do not know if i have ever been more surprised in my entire life , this movie has absolutely incredible breathtaking visuals.And here is the good part,it does not only deliver images which you could watch for days without a break,but the story is also intense and well written.When Jake Sully takes control of hes avatar for the first time i almost cried, if you are a sickly person like i am,never been able to do sports or enjoy runs, then those moments will deeply move you,he develops so much joy and fun running around ,breathing deep, feeling the nature ,it takes you in ,and makes you want a new body. Throughout the movie i cried ( and i am 22 years old), i laughed ,i had shivers running down my spine,i had so much anger i nearly stood up and punched somebody,and at some scenes my heart even skipped a few beats,which never happened watching another movie before.This movie just overwhelms you with emotions.The outcome of the movie makes you seriously think about us people ,about our lives and how we treat the nature and animals,about our behavior as mankind,we enjoy killing and destruction instead of respecting ourselves and others and the world that surrounds us. I recommend this movie to anybody,especially those people who can understand the deeper meaning,it is very likely that this movie will stay with you for the rest of your life,and its sure that this is one of the best movies ever made.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great spectacle, mindlessly predictable plot","Like Peter Jackson and George Lucas, James Cameron raises the level of technical achievement in film making in every movie he makes, and Avatar is no exception. We have set before us a digital masterpiece of beauty and spectacle, where the technology has once again surprised us, but the beauty and imagination of the artists behind it inspires us even more. Now, as before, much of the movie was green screened, but unlike before, it doesn't matter. When live actors are on the screen, they actually look less real than their surroundings. The idealized Na'vi are sacred, vivid, and real. Live actors are dimly lit, phony profanities in James Cameron's digital reality.The central problem with the story is its appalling lack of originality. The plot, and moment after moment in this film, is ripped from previous movies with reckless abandon. No person who has seen such movies as Dances with Wolves, the Last Samurai, Pocahontas (Dis.) or any number of other movies should be surprised at any part of the story here. The plot is simply an excuse to string together a beautiful canvas of rich, detailed digital fantasy art. Soldiers are portrayed here either as self-hating pansies or narrow-minded bad asses. The Na'vi are portrayed as a race in perfect balance with the world around them, rather than as products of natural selection with their own defects. Count me as someone who wanted to see a story which had real characters with real people in them, or a twist in the story I didn't see coming. I have a few moral qualms with the story as well, which plays out not as a message about tolerance of differences or peaceful coexistence, but as a racist ballad where the sacred Na'vi have been perverted by contact with the infernal humans and it is the humans that need to be eradicated or exiled.This is a movie you will want to see if eye-popping visuals and vivid detail at all appeal to you. But if you're looking for a compelling story that you haven't seen before, look elsewhere. As sci-fi, District 9 is a much better movie, and I would say even Star Trek has the edge on a compelling story line.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An exceptional piece of film-making by an exceptional director, this is James Camerons Avatar.","The sheer amount of pressure for one single film from one single man was so immense, that it is a wonder that Cameron even dared to tip-toe back into the film industry for one brief glance, let alone make an actual movie. And yet, it is an extremely rare and beautiful thing that something is created which can not only meet it's former film in pretty much all aspects as well as the pressure from media all over the world, but dare even to out shine it. Yet i have to agree that Avatar, in my opinion, does just that.I cannot deny that Titanic was not a piece of marvel and excellence, and the scale of the special effects as well as the intensity of that infamous jack and rose love story were so remarkable that is was enough to leave most that watched it weep like a small child. However, Avatar gives us a look at a different story of love, and like Titanic, it is forbidden and frowned upon, yet is still heart warming and similarly tragic in some places. The only criticism I have is that the love between Jake and Neytiri lacks that throat choking moment which still holds Titanic in such high regard even today. On the other hand it also must be commented that despite these films being among the most expensive ever made, the story lines do not rely on they're huge explosions and crashing objects to make the movie, because both of the stories are deeper and more meaningful than that and they manage not to drown in the special effects like so many films nowadays do.Speaking of the spectacular effects, those in Avatar are really just that. The beauty of Pandora makes you get goose pimples as the sheer detail of exotic plants and dangerous animals feel so real that you have to remind yourself continually that they do not actually exist. And if you are not as soft as to fall in love with the beauty of the planet, than I'm sure the final battle will make you heart race and you will truly be blown away by the incredible effects that all of Cameron's team have managed to achieve, this really is film making at it's best. Don't be put off by the length or the fact that it's sci-fi because i do not doubt that coming out of that film, no matter what your favourite genre, will leave you so speechless and amazed that the only word you will be able to breathe is 'wow.'",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mediocre in every aspect but the technical ones,"This is not the worst movie ever made, but it's not something that will change the direction of cinema either, and it's definitely not something I would want to sit through a second time. Like Cameron's Titanic it will largely be forgotten in ten years to the point that people in the future will just not believe all of the hype that went on at the time it was in theaters.Cameron is brilliant with special effects and technology, but he's a good businessman with a sense of showmanship too, and thus he realizes that if he simply made a documentary entitled ""How I Did It"" and showed off and explained how he produced some of his pioneering technological tricks, that nobody but a few dozen geeks such as myself would buy a ticket to see it.Thus a narrative is added - usually an obvious and emotionally manipulative one - to draw in the largest audience. That was what was done in Titanic, and that is the case here. I can't say that Cameron plagiarized the story either, because he's also a master at taking known story lines and putting them through a blender where you can at no point say this is a retread of any one story. However, it is retread of several well known ones. I won't tell you which stories or else I might give the plot away to the few people left on this planet who haven't seen Avatar and still intend to do so.My recommendation - see it or don't see it. This one won't change your life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A grand cinematic experience,"AVATAR is one of the few films in recent years that I've really looked forward to. Given Cameron's solid track-record when it comes to sci-fi/action-films, there was no doubt in my mind that this film would be good, even though it's been 12 years since his last feature film. The only question in my mind was whether the film would be great or merely good. Fortunately, it turned out to be the former.I'll start by mentioning a few things that I really liked about the film, and areas in which I feel it succeeded very well:The characters: Cameron invests enough time in his characters so that the viewer actually care about them when the going gets tough later on in the film. Most action-directors put too much emphasis on the action and fail to involve the audience on an emotional level: You couldn't care less what happens to the main characters and the feeling of genuine suspense is severely undermined. AVATAR is an action/adventure film with a heart.The CG (primarily by WETA Digital) looks great, especially when it comes to organic objects, such as plants and the blue humanoid-looking natives. The great attention to detail makes a significant difference in terms of photorealism. The natives move and express themselves in a very convincing, natural manner. Mocap (*) has been used for many years, but this is one of the few films in which the movements (both body and face) look completely realistic. AVATAR sets a new milestone when it comes to photorealistic characters. I was also very impressed by the seamless integration of CG and live shots, and the CG explosions: The explosions were actually created using fluid simulations which made them look very realistic (the normal approach is to use live shots of real explosions, composited on top of CG elements).The directing: With AVATAR, Cameron demonstrates why I consider him one of the best action directors in modern cinema. The long finale, in particular, is one of the best action-sequences I've ever seen. It's dynamic, intense and exhilarating to watch. The rhythm and pacing is spot on. Cameron also slowly builds the film to its finale, and this makes the action-sequences even more rewarding (because the buildup serves as 'foreplay' and creates anticipation).Other things that I liked: The beautiful cinematography and the interesting, underlying themes related to imperialism and the environment. It makes you think a bit after you leave the theatre, and it adds a bit of extra depth and meaning to the film. This is more than you can expect from a typical film in this genre nowadays.It's hard to pick things that I didn't like about the film, because there was nothing that really bothered me. If I had to mention one thing that I was hoping would be better, then it would be James Horner's score. It didn't seem as prominent or memorable as it should've been. Its impact on the overall movie experience was much smaller compared to his score for films such as TITANIC, ALIENS or BRAVEHEART. I'm not saying the score is bad, far from it, it just lacked that little extra.Some people have complained about the simple plot and predictable ending. I personally didn't have any issues with the plot, and I must admit that I don't really understand those who get too obsessed with spotting plot holes and logical problems. First of all, it's not really the story itself that matters, its the way it's told, because film is primarily an audiovisual medium. Cameron's films are simply structured in general and they're easy to follow. But he makes things interesting and engaging to watch because of his storytelling skills. Although the film lasts for over 2,5 hours, I never felt there was a dull moment. Cameron sucked me into the film from the get go and he didn't loosen his grip until the end-credits started to roll.I've seen both the 3D and 2D version. Some people clearly prefer the 3D version, but I didn't feel that I lost anything substantial when I saw the 2D version. Cameron doesn't make the mistake of trying to use 3D as a cheap gimmick, and the use of 3D effects isn't exaggerated. The 3D effect is impressive, though, and the technology has obviously improved significantly in recent years. After a few minutes into the film I almost forgot that I was wearing the glasses: They were comfortable and they didn't cause dizziness.AVATAR is a visual tour de force that really needs be seen on the big screen in order to be appreciated fully. Don't wait until the DVD or Blu-Ray is released: The experience simply won't be the same, unless you have a big, high-end home-theatre.(*) Motion capture: Technology used to capture the actors's performances, so that they can be reproduced by their CG characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is not a movie or an art piece. It's a lot more!,"well, this is the best movie i ever seen. it is almost too good to be true, u get so sucked into it that at the end it's like the time and everything stops. the most impressive and the most balanced movie i ever saw. u know what they say, u get what u payed for, with the biggest budget you make the best movie. this is the kind of movie that will enter the history, next to the other great movie which impressed the world.about the goofs, one looks incorrect for me.Its more of a talk without thinking. arrows on first attack bounce of the windscreens, and in the second they blast them. its simple, in the first attack, they fire upwards, at an like 30 degrees angle or more, from a big distance, and they are stationary, not to mention that the arrows hit the windows at a 45 degrees plus, which makes them bounce, only few scratch the windows. at the second attack, they dive from above, with high speed, adding speed to the arrow (relative to the target), and they also fire from a few meters, and perpendicular (almost) on the windows. if i am correct, in the second attack, the arrows hit with more then twice the energy, and remember, in the first attack they could scratch the glass.they wouldn't make such mistake, this movie was too well done to make any mistake.I saw many well known and wonderful movies from top 250, at least 100, and they impressed me, i liked them. if I would view them now, after avatar, i don't think they could impress me anymore, just rized the standardsit has 10 stars from me, and i cant wait to see it at the cinema. people who rate this movie less then 8 either they really dun like this kind of movies or are total ignorants. You can't say it's crap when it's yellow and shines.***DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DID NOT WATCHED THE MOVIE YET!!! it might spoil the surprise.***i read like 100 reviews on this movie and i noticed 2 major categories of people the ones who give this move 8+ and have a great impression about it, and another, much smaller, which gave it less then 5, mostly 1 stars, who say 'its a pure eye-candy with a crappy story and no plot, it copies many other movies, and its a ridiculous movie to watch'. that kind of words make my inside burn of frustration. i feel like those people are blind or deaf.its like they don't have a soul any more, they have a heart of cold lead, no imagination, no dreaming. it's horrible. this kinda movie cant be rated on 'points' like sound picture and bla bla bla.Something like this needs an overall opinion. the combination is the true masterpiece. Its a wonder. You cant judge a great picture and say its crap because the paint used is cheap.yesterday i had a flick like idea that passed in my head. i think terminator 2 has a very deep secret message in it. that we wont be killed or taken over by the machines. We are slowly turning into machines (in the inside, literally i mean) because of the environment we live in and the daily routine that we get used to. we will be like living machines. no feelings, no ""soul"", no dreaming, no hopes, just following 'laws' lines, parameters. People like that are starting to appear between us. only a cold blood ""machine like inside"" being cannot be touched by at least 10% of this movie. I hope and pray this is just a ridiculous inexistent coincidence i made.How can someone not be touched by the perfect balance of that wonderful race with the nature, living in harmony. how can u not get emotional at the sight of those hopeless beings after they're home tree is blown to pieces. how not to be sad that humans are a bit same to those in the movie? and the most impressing, how not to get touched by the way that paralyzed man of steel, marine, realized he fought all his life on the wrong side, and now he finally finds something that worth fighting for, real freedom and nature and how not to get touched by the wonderful ultimate freedom of being able to fly on the back of a dragon like creature, and control it like an extension of your mind, up in the sky, ""on top of the world"", between those floating mountains ""i am not too much of a horse guy, but i feel i was born to do this"" he says. from a wheal chair in a metal house, to the top of the sky. and not to mention that in the end he finally gets rid of the horror of waking up from the device that he was depending on to get into the in the wonderland, entering his avatar. His 'soul' is transfered from his human body to the avatar, finally being totally free to live his dream all the rest of his life in that world of perfect balance, full of life, enveloped by nature.I liked how Jake realizes that he fights for the wrong things, when the right thing that is worth to fight for, he was fighting against.Its funny how the colonel says that place is worse then hell, but actually is better then haven. Don't kick the dog! Look in his eyes, scratch him between his ears.Someone says this movie has a soul. I feel the same thing!1 of the most sad things about this movie is that it's just an imagination, a dream about a perfect place, but unreal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Can we please just feel the Greatness of this movie?,"Experiencing this movie, in Imax 3-D, was simply the best movie experience I have ever had. It is great that there is a lot to say about movies but this should be the fist and most important thing. What did the experience of watching evoke in you? I start this way because I have been reading very much about this movie and I have heard so many perspectives on it that I almost lost the direct feeling of it. Moreover the fact that It is being spoken about so much is to me another indication that this is an important and intriguing film. Of course attention in itself it not an indication of value, but it becomes apparent soon that the discussion is very widespread and represents many views that already are inherent to our society itself. As soon as this criterium is not met we should be aware what this movie is trying to do with us or with a certain group of people. From my point of view such a discussion is not going on and what is going on is a fair and multiperspectival approach to a deeply intriguing and moving cinematic masterpiece (even though the last word of this sentence is a bit more personal).Having said all that what is left now is for me to present my contribution to the ongoing dialogue. As one might have guessed I am very positive about the movie and not only because it was a great experience in a 3-D movie theater. This movie clearly has a message that our world needs. The consciousness that wants to aggressively dominate and control the world around itself for the purpose of profit regardless of the consequences for the world of nature, life and living beings is being defeated in here. And it is defeated by the conscious choice of beings living by natural law, by other beings abiding the ways of the spirit of the planet and by the very command of this planetary spiritual will itself. As such this storyline is a simplified but direct representation of processes playing out on the face of earth nowadays where the aggressive military-industrial (american) way of control and manipulation is being defeated by conscious processes on various levels of existence.My wholehearted thank goes to James Cameron and his crew for this fantastic tale of life, love, victory and hope. Thank you for creating this and good luck with all future endeavours (which I am looking forward to).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderful movie for all ages......truly amazing!!,"Wow!!.....what a movie!! To be honest with you all, I'm 26 years old....and i have never, ever seen such an entertaining movie like this ever... its really confusing to put this movie in which genre........ coz, there is action, adventure, emotion, love, thrills, chills.....you name it. Even the LOTR trilogy are no match for Avatar.It has all the right ingredients for a great movie...and off-course my favorite....emotion....lots of LOVE and emotion.James Cameron ain't ""The king of the world""....... He is THE GOD OF FILM MAKING. i have only one word for him and his cast & crew.....Awesome!!!Wonderfully executed movie which wont make you bored at all. It will just take you away to Pandora for over 150 minutes without even realizing how fast those minutes went.The technology used was brilliant, CGI animation incorporated with performance capture is something many people haven't even dreamt about. Plus the virtual camera tech & augmented reality system!!!......totally cool....totally awesome!!I'm myself a big fan of such techie stuff and cant wait for the sequels to come in future.....next time, there will be more that meets the eye... Cameron is god..... picturing Pandora like a place seen never before, the flora and fauna, the military gears, choppers etc....animals, birds are all absolutely amazing. And most of all...the NAVI'S!!Making a whole new language from scratch too was a great achievement. Thanks to Paul Frommer.Their is a scene where Jake flies with Neytiri on 2 Banshees......its one of my favorite scenes.....so lovely!!I really wondered the toll it had taken on Cameron and his men to bring these things to life. Wonderful!! Also a superb job done by the actors, without whom, this wouldn't be possible....Especially Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver....To me, watching avatar in 3d was an experience....Not just pop-corn and friends. And Off-course......The center of the movie is all about LOVE. Love...So much love. And even i fell in love with Neytiri!!...i wished she was real!! Though the story lacked some punch, the 3d experience and CGI used will just carry you away for a ride, without even you noticing it.Avatar is truly, one of a kind movie...that is hard to find and will always remain as one of the best movies for all ages.I believe, that from this much info...you all would have got a brief idea about Avatar.....I can guarantee you all that Avatar will be a feast for your eyes...So people.....what are your waiting for???...don't watch it......EXPERIENCE IT!!And may Avatar cross the 2.5 billion $ landmark and win Oscars as well. And may god bless them all.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic voyage !,"Although ""Avatar"" may not be James Cameron's greatest story I consider it a great popcorn movie. It is a film, that should work fine even without IMAX cinema - however with 3D for me it was fantastic! Already once Cameron took a lot of risk with ""Titanic"". Back then his success was nothing you could have expected back then! His newest creation is no less risky but it seems it will work out perfectly fine.What has always impressed me considering this director and writer (especially when thinking of his movies ""The Abyss"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens""...): nothing in Camerons script seems to be coincidence. Everything seems to have a profound reason. Every picture is thoroughly thought. Same holds true for ""Avatar"". Its plot provides several typical Cameron elements: the clash of different worlds, technology versus nature, progress versus tradition, human species crossing a crucial line and so on. I heard it reminded several viewers of films like ""The Last Samurai"" but I'd say the meaning of this story goes deeper. It's not just about how we deal with other cultures and traditions, it's about how blind we deal with nature.During this picture, you can almost feel how its 3D technology is evolving. The director and his crew were painting an image of colossal size, merging tons of impressive ideas from all directions (movies, nature...). So far I have never seen anything as detailed. It's like seeing (feeling in some way) a different world - which from my point of view is ""Avatar""'s greatest strength. This time the very archetypal plot is no more than a fancy (though not less moving) accessory.Easy to see I'm very positive about this movie. On the other hand - without 3D and especially on a TV screen - I could imagine that ""Avatar"" might have some lengthy moments. I assume that probably 3D needs more ""lengthy"" moments to relax than 2D. In my point of view Cameron chose the right pace and you'll have enough time to become familiar with this new world. There are several moments, when ""Avatar"" is like a ""prototype"", where not everything is perfect. And yes, the quality of 3D varies and some images seem to have little space, whereas others look totally overwhelming. But from my point of view the story is strong enough overcome little flaws.Summing up: ""Avatar"" is offering a truly wonderful impression of what is possible, how cinema can/will be plus even more and also a very moving story which hopefully will create a more positive spirit towards nature. A film which already is one important brick in the wall of film history !",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Avatar 3D-IMAX Experience - A review....,"First off, I had never seen IMAX or 3D (only in 80's magazines) and was actually in two minds whether or not too go and see the 3D version... but boy am I glad I did... it should NOT be seen any other way, I went to my new IMAX cinema which opened on the day of Avatar release and was awestruck by the experience, I was so overwhelmed just from the 3D trailers before the movie that it made me physically laugh, I could not control it until I got used to it.The movie itself was amazing, the 'cutting edge' motion-capture CGI mixed in with Stereoscopic 3D (special 3D cameras built by James Cameron himself) all shot in IMAX 70mm film (10 times the resolution of normal movies) it was stunning to say the least, the storyline and dialogue was quite good and characters played very well, Sigourney Weaver played a great role as did the Stephen Lang (the army Colonel), it is a long film but as your engrossed in it - it really does seems to fly over and your left wanting more, the Wildlife and plants on Pandora just come to life, colours and detail were amazing and the 5.1 Dolby Digital was outstanding... robot machines walking from behind the camera and over your head and to the front...as it does its steps were thundering from the back of auditorium right through the middle and to the front whilst a big 30ft 3D robot comes towering over your head into view...AMAZING!! I strongly recommend you go and see this movie in IMAX-3D or just normal 3D if you don't have IMAX (the experience is roughly the same just on a smaller scale) its all cutting edge stuff, Steven Spielberg called it ""the future of cinema"" if you have kids even better - don't expect them (or you) to sleep that night haha",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cameron's latest is unbelievable,"Some directors go 'further'; some push the boundaries of controversial subject matter, some strive for a new means of expression, some are desperate to make ground-breaking content and others will do anything to be original and unique. Whatever these directors try for, they all dip their toes in the deep end of the unknown pool, and James Cameron is no stranger to these foreign waters.Cameron's filmography is far from a sad story; he is responsible for some of the most technologically advanced and brilliantly original cinema Hollywood has ever seen. From 'The Terminator' (1984) to 'Aliens' (1986), from 'The Abyss' (1989) to 'Titanic' (1997), he has always strived for more than the average Hollywood mega-director, and his latest picture, 'Avatar', looks set to follow in that same path. The film has already been said to be the most expensive film ever made, costing a whopping $237 million, it boasts the latest gadgets and technology, using High Definition cameras and ultra-sleek CGI, and it's been labelled by many as ""the future of cinema"". So, bearing all of these points in mind, Cameron has got a lot to deliver to a very hungry holiday audience, much like he did with 'Titanic'. He succeeded in '97, but will he strike gold again in '09?The film follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington); a paraplegic ex-marine who's been asked to take over the role of his late brother in an 'avatar' experiment. This means that his DNA is genetically developed with another being, to form a second life. He's sent undercover to Pandora; a beautiful moon soaked with luscious foliage and filled with mesmerising creatures. His boss, Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) has set him a mission; he must bond with the natives of the planet; the Na'vi. Once he has bonded with them and gained their trust, Sully must obtain a mineral that lives on their planet. This mineral sells for millions of dollars in the United States. But when Sully meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana); a native of the planet that blossoms with beauty, courage and ruthlessness, he becomes attached to her and the Na'vi people. Now Jake is torn between his mission and his orders, and the planet and people that he learns to love.So, $237 million and 162 minutes later, what are we left with? We are left with one of the most beautiful, captivating and emotional roller-coaster experiences that 2009 has offered us. It totally blew me away, more so than I ever thought it could. Not a one moment are you taken out of the film; the audience is locked in for the film's mega duration, which passes by so quickly. Packed with dazzling CGI and mouth-watering cinematography, 'Avatar' most certainly is the future of American cinema. But it gets better; rather than all the throw-away blockbusters Hollywood has offered us this year, the film's life is in the narrative and character development, rather than the green-screen technology and gizmos. It's not just an attraction on the eyes; you are actually involved with the characters and the overall picture.The planet of Pandora is quite possibly the most stunningly gorgeous thing to grace the silver screen in years. It's plastered with radiant colours, wild flowers, twisted trees, crushing waterfalls and jaw-dropping mountains. I would have happily watched the film even if it just toured around this new world.The film is completely action-packed too; sporting some of the most mesmerising and memorable battle sequences. The fights between the Na'vi and the RDA (Resources Development Administration) are champion.The film also features stellar performances; Saldana is fabulous as Neytiri, Sigourney Weaver is excellent as always in her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, and Lang steals the show as the relentlessly evil Colonel.'Avatar' is an ultra-brilliant package of proper film-making, and Hollywood glitz. Cameron has had this film is pre-production since the mid '90s, and it's so obvious how much he cares for this picture. Everything is perfectly placed and works accordingly.I'm hard pressed to find any problems with the film; the only thing I would have liked is if it was released in the summer, at least that way there would have been one summer Hollywood hit that was worth watching. But, nevertheless, this film should and will do tremendously at the box-office over the Christmas period and rightly so. Cameron deserves his praise for this picture, because 'Avatar' is so much more than a film, it's a cinematic experience.If you see any films this holiday, make sure this is one of them.'Avatar' is a modern masterpiece. See it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Average, in every respect but one","Entirely computer rendered movies are some of my favorites over the last 10 years. The Incredibles, Up, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, (the list is long!). But Avatar doesn't deserve to be on this list. In fact, given the money spent, it is a failure worth 2/10. However ignoring the budget for a second, it is a 6. A summer block buster popcorn movie that somehow is pretending to be a classic.it is bad? it is so well reviewed!well, first, the 3d. The glasses reduce the brightness, and for someone with good vision it just isn't pleasant to sit for 3 hours with a black fuzzy rim bracketing the screen and a plastic weight on your nose. The 3D effect, when executed, _demands_ you look at whatever is in focus lest you get a headache trying the impossible -- to focus the fuzz outside that spot. This is annoying. When 3d is mostly suppressed you'd really rather be watching a regular big screen movie.Second problem. Multiple ones. Forget for a moment the computer graphics. What you are left with is - a clichÃ© ridden script - the least cohesive imagining of future science I've seen for ages. Stuff that varies from barely better than stuff the Pentagon shows off now, to god-like technology. All set in 2154. - stereotypical characters - a very dull leading man. He sounds a bit like Russell crowe, but there ends that comparison. - an extremely predictable plot. Not just predictable. You've sat through this story before, and parts of it you've seen several times.The worst is the script. On the rare occasion the characters reveal some inner emotion or conflict through subtle action or facial expression, they immediately blurt out their motivation. I guess for the sake of us dim wits in the audience. Meanwhile the full orchestral score swells and swirls almost without a breather from the first second to the last, unnecessarily ramming down our ear canals whatever emotion we are being ordered to feel.A good movie you think about not just the next morning, but the next week. The next month. Avatar only left me annoyed. I couldn't care less about the characters, I was left with zero curiosity for where an Avatar 2 might take them.I'm squarely in the demographic for this movie, supposedly. Bit of a geek. Like sci-fi. Interested in technology and prepared to pay to see good CGI and Avatar totally failed me. Reading some of the rabid comments left for the few professional reviewers brave enough to be actually critical makes me wonder if the studio has launched a viral ""think positive"" campaign to support this movie. Either that, or the lowest common denominator uncritical cud chewing PR swallowing movie going public is a lot more interested & active on blogs and message boards than I had imagined! If the latter then I'll be spending a lot less money on Hollywood over the next decade than I did over the last!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It Depends on your experience,"If you are 10 years old this film will probably move you. If you are older and remember movies like ""Broken Arrow"", ""little Big Man"", ""Dances with Wolves"", ""A Man called Horse"", then the plot will seem very familiar to you in fact, slightly hackneyed. It's really cowboys and Indians in space. And let's not forget that most of it is a cartoon.It has massive special effects that are impressive. It has great surround sound. It has 3D. 3D is nice but I don't feel that it has reached it's potential yet. I may be in a minority but so far I find 3 D to be inferior to a well directed well photographed normal film.But if you can get past the plot that is so familiar (to adults) as to remove all suspense from the movie then it will be OK. If you take your children to it I am sure they will enjoy it. And it will be a nice diversion for them for a couple of hours.Is it great movie art? Is it a breakthrough? NO.

Excellent for me,"It's a pretty risky bet but for me is the best film at the visual of the story so far, has set a precedent setting a new level of credibility in the sense of reality and naturalness of 3D being capable of displaying a digital reality as credible as the reality of the real world but there are also limitations that are apparent when the amount of digital creations screen is very high producing some CGIs little expressive and replicated, a perfectly logical thing on the other hand in a technology that has just taken off and the he still has much to develop to get to graze their limitations, the spectacular contrasts found in the faces and amazingly realistic foregrounds.

"Watching Avatar felt like watching Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or Star Wars for the first time when I was a kid.","Watching Avatar felt like watching Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park or Star Wars for the first time when I was a kid. Back then I didn't even really realize I was watching a movie, I felt more like one of the characters and a part of the story. Watching Avatar was like that. The 3D technology Cameron has perfected over the years makes you dive into the story so deep, you feel everything more effectively, just like when you were a child. After the movie was over my body was shaking and my heart was bounding from excitement. There's that feeling, that high again, the reason why I love movies above all thing.Avatar is director James Cameron's first film in 12 years after Titanic, which was the most expensive movie of it's time. So true to his grand style Avatar is no exception. It is clear from the start that this movie was very expensive. That being said, Cameron is one of those people who knows how to spend money wisely and in the right places. In this movie the money has gone mostly to CGI. And God knows how much money is spend on enhancing the 3D technology alone. I say money well spent, because Avatar is not only one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, but it is also a major breakthrough in 3D technology. The movie is so beautiful in fact that at times I was moved to near tears just by it's beauty alone.Although Avatar is highly entertaining it is also very anti-war and green. I might even say that the movie has a conscience. I truly admire the highly imaginative world Cameron has created for Avatar. It feels like he has thought of every tiny little thing. It's not every day you get to see a bunch of blue people running around half naked in the jungle and not think it's completely ridiculous. And this is one of those days.I'm not saying that the movie is flawless or that there were no negatives, sure they were. A cynic might even say that Avatar is a movie filled with crazy patriotic soldiers, bad dialog and a bunch of tree huggers. But who cares when you feel like you've just been injected with a doze of the most exquisite movie heroin. The only really negative thing about Avatar is that the movie is not meant to be watched in 2D or from you shitty TV screen, no matter how big it is. I'm already a little sad that I will never be able to see Avatar again, at least not in the right way, unless I go to the theater again.Oh wait, what's that ringing sound? Oh, it's the Oscar bells.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I was blown away,"This is the most astonishing movie I have ever seen. First word I heard leaving the theater was 'amazing!' No doubt about it.I won't discuss the plot,but the plot is good, nothing can match the special effects of the 3-D.Here's the least you need to know:It is 'new age' all the way. It's all about 'we are all one with nature'.It's a long movie, about 3 hours to be precise. Be sure you have your snack in hand and your 'business' taken care of, just in case you don't have a 15 min break like I did.Sexuality was not much of an issue, the only thing remotely sexual was the 'hair-bonding' ritual.The ending was predictable from the start, but again an extremely enjoyable movie.Finally, the special effects were amazing. This you got to see in 3-D!!! You'll feel as if you are IN the movie after a few minutes. You'll be reaching for the floating jellyfish(tree seeds), dodging the flying dragon-birds...etc. I was so impressed that I felt as if it was all happening in front of my own eyes. I do not recommend watching this movie in 2-D. I believe that this movie was made to be viewed in 3-D.The movie is not only a movie but it will open your mind and make you reflect on your life. As I wrote earlier it's kinda ""new age vs modern world view"".I truly hope that you enjoy the movie. I know that I did. 3-D is a must !!! just a few extra bucks, believe me you won't regret it. the only thing that makes me sad :( is that I have to wait until late 2010 to buy the 3-D bluray.enjoy :)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually astonishing,"Avatar, in terms, visuals effects and overall aesthetics, it excels. The fictional world of Pandora is very well done. The many different animals, trees and how they connect with the Na'vis, and the Na'vis themselves are all truly spectacular. The CGI is outstanding. The score and cinematography are also amazing. But The plot is downright predictable and generic. Moreover, it is dragged out to an infuriating length. The characters are introduced well, but none of them are explored further, and the relationships between them lack any kind of complexity and depth.Overall, Avatar is a visually stunning sci-fi adventure, with good cast performances, amazing score and cinematography but suffers from formulaic story and one-dimensional characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Simply breathtaking. The King is back, baby!!!","Unfortunately, I had to watch it in 2D, but even with that, this movie was just brilliant. I think we all know the basic outline of the story by now, and I admit, some of the movie's flaws is that the plot is somewhat predictable, and that it had some clichÃ© moments and some cheesy dialogue, but nevertheless, I thought the movie was overall fantastic. We all know the SFX are the best ever (everyone pretty much has said that, so why bother?), but what you don't know is that the way the film is executed actually carries quite an emotional punch that most people won't be expecting, and all of the performances overall are great, even Worthington's (which is the first film I've seen him in, by the way. Never got the chance to watch Terminator: Salvation, so he was a relatively new actor to me), but I can easily say that Zoe SaldaÃ±a was the best one, which brings me to my next point, and what I think is the highlight of the film: the na'vi.If you thought Gollum in the LotR films or the prawns in District 9 were incredible in how much emotion and realism they conveyed, just you wait 'till you see this film's blue humanoids. They're, without a shadow of a doubt, the best-looking CG characters I've ever seen. Not only do they LOOK real, they FELT real, and after a few minutes in, one could easily forget they were all actors in motion-capture suits. The na'vi showed more emotion, more expression and simply just more life than what most live-action actors have today. I hope the Academy Awards consider motion-capture performances from hereon out in the Acting categories, because they were just outstanding in this movie, and WAY better than most live-action performances we get today. And the action, of course, was also fantastic. Cameron just proved to people like Michael Bay that the King is back. Not just the battle scenes, but even some parts that were just, say, some characters flying around on their banshees were just a beauty to look at, since all shots just show how amazing the incredibly deep and detailed world that Pandora is. To the senses, it's the most stunning film I've ever seen. As for story and dialogue writing, it could've been better, it's not perfect, but this movie's really about how the story is executed rather than the content.Another highlight for me is, of course, just how deep and detailed everything in this film was, and being an artist myself, you could easily imagine just what an assault on the senses it was for me to witness such a beautifully created world that is Pandora. Ranging from its flora to its fauna, all things in this world are indeed alien, but also have a familiar sense to them from our world. One who's been watching Cameron for the past few years would know that he's always been into deep underwater exploration, and you can easily tell that a lot of what he saw down there influenced his vision for many of the things we see in this lush beauty of an ever-stretching rainforest.As for the film's score, I really don't get why some people are getting upset about it. In my opinion, James Horner gave us a tremendous score that fit perfectly to whatever was happening during the film. And yes, I even like Leona Lewis' song in the end credits.Many filmmakers out there think about CG effects and put no depth into the narrative or story, but that's not the case with Cameron. In this film, the special effects MAKE the story. He puts special effects and story in a blender, and meshes these elements up so well that what we get is one of the most unique films in history.My score: 8.5/10, and I think I'd probably give it a 9.0/10 or higher if I had seen it in 3D, and definitely a perfect 10 if I had seen it in an Imax 3D screen with the best seat in the hall, but then, we wouldn't really be speaking in that case about a movie, and instead a full-on cinematic experience, which is what makes me think that Avatar will become a classic; it's more an experience than a film, it's a journey to a new world where our imaginations are tested, and has achieved perfectly what a movie is intended for in the first place, at least of this genre: pure, out-of- this-world escapism.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Typical Cameron: Dumb Story But Fantastic Visuals,"Well, after all the hype - and a chance to see this for free on a Blu-Ray disc - it was an offer I couldn't refuse. In the end, and even though it's a long film (2 hrs, 40 minutes) I watched it all and wasn't surprised at much of anything story-wise. Like a lot of modern-day action films, they start off great but slowly become unraveled and during the last third of movie, you have to totally ""check your brains at the door,"" but this movie, overall, was fun to watch.For much of it, there were enough visual wonders in here, fantastic colors and special-effects to make up for Director/writer James Cameron's usual Liberal political bias and stereotypical characters. In many respects, you've seen this story before a number of times. In fact, if you've seen ""Dances With Wolves,"" you've seen ""Avatar,"" the main difference being the setting: instead of the Old West you have a futuristic planet. The story is basically the same, the one filmmakers love to present: the evil white military-like corporation men invade the peaceful natives for greed and profit.... and troubles ensue. Throw in the ""mixed"" romance you saw in ""Dances With Wolves"" and you have a good chunk of this story. Very little has changed except for the futuristic eye candy. Instead of the American Indian, we have the ""Na'vi,"" which are portrayed in a very similar light except for the blue skin, of course.The only creativity in this film is in the special-effects department, but - wow - what creativity! The visuals are the attraction to this movie, pure and simple. The amazing jungle scenery, bizarre bird creatures and illuminating small objects everywhere will dazzle you, especially played through a Blu-Ray disc and big HD set. The transfer is as sharp as any you'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More than just a clichÃ©d story,"Avatar in 2D: Incredible movie. Amazing visuals. Beautiful story. Great action sequences.I absolutely would go to see it again. While the early movie does suffer from the same syndrome that is seen in so many movies, namely a rushed fake-feeling time-lapse of events in some areas, the final hour is absolutely worth it. I will add the caveat that my feelings are affected by my being a fantasy buff. The druidic religion of the natives, the landscapes, and the general story all hold to the fantasy mold. Including the heart-wrenching fate that awaits the good guys. But that isn't a bad thing. It's once in a generation, if that, that someone writes a story that breaks out of that mold.Avatar was a work of art as much as a movie. The immersion of sight and sound had me often on the edge of my seat. The performance capture used to film the movie lets the Na'Vi come to life in a way no animation can. The incredible eye for detail that went into this movie is astounding, both technically, and in terms of creating the world.It is a great joy to me to see a fantasy movie done so well. It is extremely difficult to capture the essence of a true epic fantasy in the traditional length movie. At approximately 2 1/2 hours, Avatar doesn't cut it inordinately short but neither does it deter all but the hardcore fantasy fans with its length.Overall I absolutely give Avatar 2D a 5 out of 5.Avatar in 3D was a bit difficult to get used to at first: glare on the frame of the glasses, things seeming to be out of focus at times, the fact that the screen does not fill the entire field of view. However, after a break-in period and the realization that some of the focusing is because it's not meant to be in focus, things improved. It pulls your view to a certain aspect of the scene, the same way you have to focus on a particular thing with your eyes. It's just disorienting at first since what you focus on isn't necessarily what they want you to focus on.Also, I noticed that a lot of the movement scenes early on seemed to blur the image, as if it was not updating fast enough to form a smooth image. Through the second half I did not notice this much at all, but whether that is because it wasn't there or because I was concentrating harder on the events, I do not know. I suspect I was trying too hard to see the 3D while I eagerly waited for the movie to progress, having seen it once already.Hopefully in the future they will improve the delivery mechanism (ie, the glasses) and make the experience even better. I look forward to taking the final step and watching it on IMAX 3D! I give the 3D aspect a 3.5 out of 5. It definitely added to the experience, but was disorienting, difficult to get into, and has a few annoyances yet to work out.Avatar in IMAX 3D blew me away, even after seeing the movie twice previously. I can't say if it was the fact that I had seen the 3D once previously, the IMAX screen, the different frame for the glasses, or all the above, but that was an incredible experience! I think the key is to not try to see the 3D, but to just let yourself sink into the movie. Filling the field of view and having that depth of field makes it easy to really get into the action and forget yourself.There's not really a whole lot more I can say about that. 8000-10000 (depending on the theater) watts of surround sound tops off something you're not likely to forget, at least until the sequel! The IMAX 3D experience gets an easy 5 out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Okay... torn between great cinema and a great movie,"This is no doubt a great piece of cinema. The visuals are gorgeous and the effects are incredible and on a whole, this is by far worth the admission price.That being said, the plot is thin and the characters are thinner. The foreshadowing is often shoved in your face and there is little exploration into what could have been wonderfully unique characters. Essentially, the plot is the Last Samurai on a distant planet. The characters are stuck somewhere between honoring Native American culture and insulting it.If this were just some run of the mill Hollywood flick, those things would be easy to overlook--or at least forgivable. In a movie that was over a decade in the making, costing more than almost any other film, and introducing such glorious cinema, it's just a real shame that everything to do with the script was so carelessly put together.Again, see it. If these things don't bother you, you are very lucky and will end up having one of the best cinematic experiences of your life. If they do bother you, you'll nonetheless love the ride. But don't believe the reviews that don't see past the imagery. There's more to film than that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Stunning, epic cinematic experience","Without a doubt, this was the single most amazing display of movie making that I or my family have ever watched. For all of you out there criticizing this movie because of the cartoonish characitures, or the simplistic plot, or the liberal pontification; you are completely missing the boat. You literally cannot see the forest for the trees.I will admit, entering the movie I was trepidatious over the reported 3 hour running time, but the movie flew by quicker than many 90 minute yawners. We will be going to see it again in a couple of weeks.The cool factor was off the charts. The visual stimulation from seeing it in 3D was something I'd never experienced at the movies before. The movie enveloped me and washed over me. I felt as though I was on Pandora. Incredible.Yes the imperialists were cartoonish, but they often are in real life too. The plot was simple, but that simplicity enable the viewer to focus on everything else that was going on.The word I kept repeating for hours afterwards was ""Amazing"". This is the first movie that I've given a ""10"" rating on my vote.My wife and my 11 year old son agree, you absolutely owe it to yourself to go see this movie. You won't be sorry you did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not bad, but largely over-hyped and unoriginal","Seriously: 1. The soundtrack - Pretty standard 'epic-jaw-dropping-orchestra' fare, nothing particularly new here.2. The effects - OK. Let's be clear: I'm a professional Software Engineer with a hand in computer graphics (specifically, high end visualization of geological volumes) so I've made a lot of pretty pictures myself, and know how a lot of Avatar was made. I've seen a lot of CG, some of it good, a lot of it bad.The effects in this movie are nice, and large parts of this movie are basically render porn, specifically some of the volumetric effects (the water, smoke, dust), some of it isn't that impressive (some of the surfaces just look downright plastic, particularly that huge gunship thing), and some of it REALLY isn't that impressive (external shots of the spaceships at the start made me cringe).If we look at it as a matter of scale, this movie is hardly ground breaking: For $237,000,000 you can buy a LOT of computing power. Throw enough money, time and manpower at any computing problem and you'll get something purdy.If you want to talk about pioneers, read about the founder of Pixar, Edwin Catmull; he is one of the guys who made hard things easy. This movie looked nice, but it DID cost $237,000,000 so if it did look crummy, someone would have probably been kneecapped.3. The 3D - 3D isn't new, I don't know why people are so excited. The process they used is a good many years old, and has been used for far less hyped movies. At the start of this movie I went 'wow, this is interesting' and about 10 minutes later I stopped caring, like everyone else I saw this movie with. Kudos though for not making half the audience vomit with nausea.4. The storyline - I just read that James Cameron wrote the script in two weeks. I wonder if he wrote if after watching Fern Gully? The storyline has a pretty heavy liberal bias, 'military bad, environment good, let's all hug a tree' type stuff, been there done that. It's neither particularly insightful of thought provoking; if you believe this stuff you'll swallow it whole, if you hate it you'll really hate it, and if you're after something thought provoking (duality of man), you'll be left severely disappointed.The other problem I had was that at times the need for visual spectacle overtook both storytelling and pacing in priority, a large portion of Avatar feels like a a tech demo. I've sat through enough tech demos to know when I'm watching a finely tuned fly though of a rendered scene to show off all the sub-surface light scattering and how well the volumetric effects handle the 200 light sources. subtract some of the rather protracted visual scenes and there could have been some decent dialog, and perhaps even an original storyline. I count this as a missed opportunity.5. Etc - I got a cool pair of glasses.In summary, this movie cost $237,000,000, and it's pure spectacle. The soundtrack is forgettable, the storyline would get you a C+ in junior high school (or accused of plagiarism, have you seen Pocahontas?), and a lot of the visuals feel contrived to the point of a tech demo. It's not completely bad, but it's not spectacularly good. I did get to keep those 3D glasses though.I think it's a C+ at most.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar is fantastic!,"Simply put, Avatar is an epic. For it's 2 & a half hour run time, I sat mesmerized, until my eyes watered and I realized I wasn't blinking. By the time it was over, I had a headache as a result of over stimulation. Now I feel like I need to wind down and watch something like Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero to feel normal again.Avatar is a spectacle film, with a lot of action and visuals. The story is simple and the anti-war message is very obvious. But in the long run, you get a compelling movie out of it that gains momentum all the way into its final act.James Cameron always manages to get his actors to seem natural. You believe the characters, because the dialogue is not overwritten. My favorite is Stephen Lang who plays a Colonel who's hellbent on pillaging the alien world. He ranks up with one of the greatest villains I've seen in recent times.This was the first major 3D movie I saw. It didn't use any gimmicks. Usually, you would expect objects to fly straight into your face, but instead it used the 3D as a depth of field to see into the screen and immerse yourself in the environment. I felt like I was there.History has repeated itself. In the 1950's, 3D and lavish color widescreen ""Cinemascope"" epics enticed people away from their Televisions, to get off their asses and come back to the theater. Today, the convenience of Netflix, downloading movies, DVR, and movies coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray within a few months of their theatrical release, for little over the same cost, loaded with extras, it makes you wonder why go to the theater at all. But the answer is here. Avatar made me glad to leave my house and saved the movie-going experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
boring and derivative movie for children,"The only thing this movie did for me was make me soooo bored I actually started remembering the plot of FernGully. Which I hadn't seen in like 18 years. I couldn't even remember its name. When I arrived home I furiously searched the internet for this mystery movie that I had forgotten and that Avatar somehow reminded me of.Then I found it and realized that it's exactly the same plot, except that it's a movie for children - which incidentally AVATAR also is, it's just that it cost 500$ billion, or whatever, to make so they had to pretend like it was for adults, but it really isn't. It's a kid's movie, and a 2 hours too long one at that.Frankly, what surprised me most about it was that it gets such good reviews... from almost everyone. I'm going to sit and wonder why for a while.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nobody in the Western world should miss this movie.,"I've seen a great many movies in five decades of life in this ""age of media"", and I've seen quite a pile of IMAX 3D features as well. Within the latter domain, this movie is really nothing special. I mean, yeah, it's VERY cool if you've never seen live-action IMAX 3D before. All around me during the screening I could hear the new initiates in the audience experiencing the giddy delight that strikes so many of us on our ""first time."" But what was very apparent to me as a seasoned IMAX aficionado was the difference between the live-action scenes and computer-generated ones. Though still spectacular by virtue of the sheer screen size, CGI 3D still has a long way to go to rival what IMAX cameras can do.That said, the tale itself is simply wonderful. Yes, as other reviewers have remarked, it's an old and well-worn storyline. But then, as many film reviewers have pointed out time and again, there are really only a couple of dozen different basic story lines in existence to begin with, so if you've been around the block a few times as I have, they all look pretty familiar in one way or another. However, what sets Avatar apart is that it an essential parable for our times . . . and if you are TRULY willing to look and listen, you will find it resonating within you at a level that goes far, far beyond the messaging of messaging of even the best of Hollywood's standard film-fare. Cameron has a way of reaching to an emotional depth in the sapient viewer's soul that nobody else in cinema comes close to. And upon this power he overlays a subtle yet vital message to which we simply must pay attention. For that reason alone, Avatar is an absolute must-see for all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Went with low expectations, but LOVED it!","I went today with my husband and two sons simply because I didn't want to be left out. After all, I thought it was just a bunch of blue aliens jumping and flying around. I also do not enjoy wearing the 3-D glasses as they give me a headache. Then I saw that it was 2 hours and 40 minutes of wearing those glasses and watching blue aliens. Needless to say, I had extremely low expectations. I'm not one of the people that has been following and anticipating this movie for years.As it so happened, I absolutely was mesmerized by this movie. I loved the plot. I'm sitting there thinking someone had to have been on crack to come up with the world of Pandora due to how creative it was. I really want to go there and fly on those dragon-like things. I thought the transformation of Jake was so cool. The 3-D effects were amazing, but I would have definitely enjoyed this movie without it.In fact, I have only seen one other movie more than once in the theatre and it was Titanic...another James Cameron movie. I can tell you that I will see this one again and I can hardly wait to buy the Blue-Ray disk and see all the extras on how they made the movie. That will be awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An epic masterpiece,"James Cameron has never directed a bad - or even mediocre - motion picture; this is the guy who has brought us such classics as the first two Terminators, Aliens - one of the best sequels of all time -, True Lies - exceptional action movie - and, of course, Titanic. That's why, despite some negative buzz, I was always pretty sure his latest endeavor, Avatar, was going to be something else. Maybe not a ""game changer"", as many - including Cameron himself - have been saying, but certainly something that we haven't seen before.Well, I still am not sure if this is a ""game changer"", but it certainly is ""something else.""Avatar is the most visually impressive and most immersive motion picture I've seen in some time. Not since Peter Jackson released the last of the Lord of the Rings movies has someone marveled me in such an amazing way, transporting me into a different land where - apparently - anything is possible. So maybe the story Cameron is telling is not 100% original, but the way in which he tells it certainly is. I haven't seen the movie in 3D - I will on Saturday and a review will follow - and I imagine it must be impressive, but even while watching it on 2D I can't imagine anyone not being marveled and feel inspired by what Cameron has created. This is one epic, epic film - an event and an experience unlike anything I've seen this year.Performances are quite solid. The real scene-stealer is Stephen Lang, whose Quaritch is one of the most effective villains I've seen in some time. We know he is the villain not only because the screenplay tells us so, but because Lang makes the character his own, a real sonofabitch who knows no compassion and no mercy. He never goes over-the-top and avoids turning his character into a caricature. (Although he is larger-than-life.) Sam Worthington is pretty good as Jake Sully - although his ""American"" accent is less-than-stellar - and Sigourney Weaver is memorable as Dr. Augustine. On the other hand, Zoe Saldana has a tougher job - Weaver and Worthington appear both in human and Na'avi form, but Saldana's character appears only as the former. No problem, though - her performance - with the aid of performance capture - is strong enough to make the audience believe in her. Like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings pictures, the audience believe in the Na'avi - we believe they are real characters who breath, cry, laugh and can even die, not just a bunch of pretty-looking cartoons.But what about the spectacle? Despite all the drama and the romance, Cameron has actually managed to deliver action-wise - if there is someone in Hollywood who truly knows how to portray the right balance between action, special effects, character development and story, it is Cameron. Simply put, the film is breath-taking. Despite being approximately 60% CGI, there was never a moment in which I was aware that I was watching big, powerful computers at work. There isn't one - not a single one - fake-looking shot. Pandora is simply beautiful, and all the creatures - including of course the Na'avi - are amazing and totally believable. The way Cameron has populated his world is, simply put, worthy of applause - every single plant, creature, monster, predator, everything is credible and awesome-looking, showing that Cameron is talented at both creating great stories and characters and using his vivid, visual and fantasy-based imagination.And there is the difference between a masterpiece like Avatar and a mindless product like Transformers 2: the viewer actually believes in all the computer-generated creatures, characters and locations, accepting them as real and believing they actually exist, even when they appear on-screen at the same time with flesh-and-blood characters. Unlike the soul-less Michael Bay movie, Avatar has spirit and charm, and never bores. Yes, there is action, but it is not mindless because there are incredibly high stakes at hand, and because we feel for the characters. There are a lot of ridiculously tense moments in Avatar because of this - on the other hand, I didn't even flinch while watching Transformers 2. (And if I did, it was because the action scenes were almost incomprehensible.)Since I haven't seen the film on 3D, I really don't know if Avatar truly is a ""game-changer"" or not. Why I do know, though, is that the movie is one of the most imaginative, visually-arresting and gripping motion pictures I've seen in years, and quite possibly the best film I've seen this 2009. Avatar is not simply a ""movie"" - it is a experience, something that quite literally has to be seen to be believed. It boasts a smart screenplay, it has believable and sympathetic characters, it's got the most believable and awe-inspiring special effects ever seen on the big screen, and it contains more thrills and emotions that any other film this year. I don't care that Cameron took 12 years to make this film - the final product was definitely worth the wait. I just hope that all the rumours that say Cameron plans to shoot a sequel are actually true. This is one rare case in which I just wish a second installment is actually released. (Hopefully, it won't take 12 more years.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A spectacular movie with so much heart,"For the first time in my life as a writer, I won't be writing a lengthy paragraph.When I saw the movie, I cried for two reasons. One, because I am also an artist, and the sheer beauty of its digital imagery stunned me to tears. Second, with a lesson in environmental concern, the simple story of a lost tribe and their survival moved me so much. I fell in love with such imaginary, admirable characters (both human and Navi). I fell for a sci-fi story with a heart.So allow me this reluctance to elaborate further. You just have to see it to believe it. Believe that you are in Pandora even for two fleeting hours, and it will be more than worth the trip.Thank you, James Cameron.

"I might be the only one, but...","I was not blown away by this movie like everyone else seems to be. First, the good stuff. There are some good actors in here, especially the actor who plays Jake (though I might be biased, because he was pretty hot), and they all commit to what they're doing and make it believable. As everyone says, the graphics and visuals are pretty freakin' awesome (as well they should be, with the budget of this movie). The world that Cameron creates is stunning, mesmerizing, and pure: the special effects are amazing. Like many, I saw it in 3D and it was good old fashioned movie-going fun. Yay!Okay, now for the not so good parts. As others have stated, the storyline/plot is a little lacking. I had trouble understanding the motivations of many of the characters. Ah, yes, character development - that would have been nice, too. Don't expect any. Yes, it's a recycled and re-used plot: clichÃ©d and often predictable. It seems reminiscent of many great classics, my favorite being ""Star Wars."" Now I'll be the first to admit that the mythical structure of ""Star Wars"" was not completely original, but at least it seemed Lucas ""made it his own"" (to quote American Idol?) with his original characters and unique setting. ""Avatar"" is practically plagiarism (one line in particular made me want to shout ""THE FORCE!"" in the middle of the movie). Also- we get practically no character background at all, so we have no idea what makes these people tick (perhaps there would have been more if the edited version wasn't already a staggering 2 hrs 40 min.). Instead, we get one-dimensional, stock characters that had me rolling my eyes underneath my uncomfortable and overpriced 3D glasses. Lastly, the film is doused with lessons in morality from Mr. Cameron; it is a blatant criticism of US foreign policy. Not everyone will pick up on this, which I understand, since most of us want mindless entertainment at the movies. But upon closer review, I don't see how some people cannot see it. One of the ""evil"" characters actually says: ""We'll fight terror with terror!"" (Though mind you, they are attacking a planet filled with peaceful inhabitants who have never attacked them, for the simple quest of obtaining a precious metal called...unobtainium...::rolls eyes again::) Now I don't mind a little political satire here and there, but it seems misplaced in what is seemingly intended as a mindlessly entertaining popcorn flick.To give an example of the poor story-telling and lack of motivation: the ""evil"" humans are attacking the peaceful planet of Pandora in hopes of getting more ""unobtainium"" (gah it's so cheesy) but Cameron never bothers to tell us WHY. It is barely even mentioned. Is it just pretty and shiny like gold? Or, as another reviewer brilliantly pointed out, this stuff could save lives on Earth for all we know. It is never explained and the movie makers just assume you will accept it and not care what the reason is.I was actually really glad to come to IMDb and find there were others who felt the same way. I don't think it was an awful movie, I just don't think it's worthy of the enormous praise that seems to surround it. Should you see it? Yeah, sure, it's pretty entertaining I guess. And if you are into graphics/special effects, and/or don't mind gaping plot holes, then you'll probably love it.Bottom line: Remember when Lucas revamped the ""Star Wars"" saga with the three new prequels, and instead of telling a great story with interesting characters like he did with the original trilogy, he got so obsessed with graphics and special effects that it pretty much ruined the whole movie? Yeah, it's kind of like that. I guess they stole that from ""Star Wars,"" too.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Groundbreaking cinema,"I've always enjoyed this film, following the release of the trailer for the second avatar film I decided to give this a rewatch to see if it has 'aged' like many CG heavy films do after 5-10 years and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up.There are certain shadows, textures & lighting which look a bit old now but the rest is still stunning to look at.From a story point of view this is one of my favourite type of films with the big action set piece & the underdog coming out on top. I really enjoy the world building.My main critique of this film is the rushed ending, it feels as though the last 30 minutes some BIG things happen that would impact our characters but this is heavily glossed over which I believe can be put down to the runtime.Overall I give this film a 9 because of the quality of the film craft, the beautiful soundtrack and the story isn't 'bad' just rushed at the end. There is also great rewatch ability to this film which helps its rating. I'm hyped for the new film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar is Original,"I just saw it and I had unbelievable expectations for it(the kind that expected the next Star Wars out of it). And I was not disappointed in the least. I had read many comments about it being Dance's with Wolves in Space. I knew all the so called critical badmouth of the story. I have to tell you that I not only loved the characters, I loved the story as well. Something that many people forget is that there is a difference between plot and story. Plot is the generalized events that happen within a story.""A person learns the ways of a race he originally looked down upon or did not understand. He ends up joining them in a battle against the people who he originally identified himself with.""That is a plot very cut and dry. There are many films with similar plots, in fact more than you would think. Does this plot line sound familiar to you? Guess why? Because you saw it in a little film I like to call 'District 9'. The man in District 9 looks down upon a race he does not understand, but as he becomes one of them(parallels Jake Sully in Avatar) he begins to identify with them and in the end fights with his own people. This film hailed by every living man and woman as original is almost identical with Avatar in plot.What you misunderstand is that what makes a film original is not it's plot but the story that carries the plot. District 9 is original because you have never seen Science fiction come to life as if it could happen. The story(the plots delivery if you will) makes all the difference.So now that we know the difference between plot and story lets look at why Avatar is original. While the story may draw parallels to Dances and Pocahontas it is by no means a copy. Never have you seen a paraplegic marine get his legs back by living through a organically grown alien. Never have you visited Pandora and explored such a vast and 'original' world. Or felt the thrill of flying on a dragon beside an ever increasingly attractive alien princess. The originality in this story is incredible for one reason alone, that the story takes the audience member on a journey with the character Jake Sully. We truly get to discover this amazing new world with him and share his excitement.Many people have said that this film has no character development, I beg to differ, I believe it adds a new depth to character development in cinema. How do we get to know people in real life? By sharing our time with them and laughing along with each other. Instead of this film telling you what to think of each character through their words, it allows us to share the events with the characters. As Jake learns to fly, we get the feeling of learning to fly along with him. The love story comes naturally because as we experience these things with Sully we too grow attached to Neytiri.As it has been said, this film is an experience. It is a journey we have never taken before and will wish to take again. That is why audiences adore this film, because it is original and we just aren't used to originality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
VISUAL TREAT what else!,"Yes Avatar is a movie which standouts by technical brilliance. It might don't have the best story, but all it provides is a visual treat. Wonder that they have created an authentic language for a movie. It's been 11 years still, it still stands tall on visual effects and moments.

It's 3 days after I left the cinema... already got the tickets for a 2nd visit,"I've never done this before... Even if I am absolutely aware of my poor level of English, I simply had to register. Just to be able express my feelings and to leave my vote here.This movie is something I didn't expect. After all those ""blockbusters"" I have seen in the last time, no one could convince me about the fact, that this flick will be something different. Entering the cinema, I was really skeptic and awaited just another boring shooter with some expensive computer animations.Well.. But then it happened. After just few minutes, I was completely sucked into the world of Pandora, I was there, breathed the air, enjoyed the extraordinary nature. I fell in love with the Na'vi and with their lifestyle, their world.For those 166 minutes, I completely forgot everything else, my work, troubles, everything. This was the best experience, the best feeling I had from a movie ever! Actually the movie was too short for me, even after those almost 3 hours I still wanted more of it, can't describe my feelings.Leaving the cinema, I had tears in my eyes... couldn't stop them. I was just sad that I have to return back to Earth... Pandora was well... go and see it people and maybe you will feel the same I felt!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Enthralling and unforgettable. A theater experience I'll remember forever,"Avatar is to my generation of movies what 9/11 was to my generation of tragic events that shook the world (I'm 16), in that is an experience I will never forget. When I am much much older, I will still be able to look back on this very night and remember everything about it; where I was, who I was with, how old I was, and, most of all, how amazed I was at what was happening before me. This all may sound like a bit much to say about one movie, but believe me. This is an event, folks.Many people have compared Avatar to Star Wars, saying that it had the same effect on audiences today as the latter had on its audience back in '77. They're right (to a certain extent, obviously). What James Cameron has done with his latest project is taken a simple enough story, and poured his heart, vision and imagination, and a couple hundred million dollars into it. The result blew me away in a way I didn't think was possible with movies today. I really thought we had seen it all. Leave it to the one and only Cameron to prove me wrong on that.The level of detail in every plant, creature, and environment is a new landmark in the world of cinema. It really goes to show that anything is possible in the movie world, and it takes a movie like Avatar to remind us of that in this day in age when audiences are so used to getting huge overdoses of special effects in their movies, and show us why we love going to the theater so much. Because, like I said before, anything is possible in a film. If Avatar doesn't make you realize that, then I can guarantee you that nothing else will.Avatar is every bit the movie I was hoping it would be. It lived up to and surpassed all the hype and I can't wait to see it again. What makes this movie so special is that you can watch it again and again and still be amazed by it, unlike some films where the impact is never the same after the first viewing. Obviously the effect of Avatar on its audiences will be much different after their first viewing, but it will always be an incredible experience.10/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Really Don't Understand the Reviews,"Avatar is a poorly written, and poorly acted animated movie. James Cameron directs Avatar like he would a TV movie. There's no real depth and no real emotion. The special effects aren't even all that great, and the 3-D is absolutely, 100% terrible.There's no ""experience"" while watching Avatar. It's like watching an animated film. I could hardly sit through it, but I spent a lot of money for the 3D so I forced myself to stay. The entire movie, aside from a few action sequences, is incredibly boring. Mostly because I don't have any reason to care about any of the characters on screen because they are also boring. I recommend that if you're going to see this, get it on DVD, don't waste your money on 3D. It's a cheap gimmick and I really hope it goes away. Avatar utilizes the 3D in the worst way, I felt like I was looking at a pop out book that I wasn't interested enough to finish.I don't really feel like there's much else to say. Avatar is just an extremely lame movie.*/****",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A cinematic triumph.,"Avatar is the kind of film that makes a cinema visit worthwhile, I saw it 13 years ago, and it lived with me ever since. It is of course known for its sensational visuals, but it is so much more than that.It's a great storyline, I love the concept of the planet, The Avatars, Jake's story, it's just captivating.It's moving, exciting, dramatic, it crosses over so many genres, it's the kind of film that takes you away from whatever you have going on.You still cannot help but be blown away by the visuals, you could say it's arthouse in the mainstream, but it's more than that, this film was a game changer, the visuals even now are spellbinding. The animals, forests, effects are all tremendous, they've aged pretty well also.Three tremendous performances, which have all always stood out for me, Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and of course Sigourney Weaver.I knew we'd get a follow up, I just didn't think that we'd be waiting 13 years for it, I can't wait to see it.Glorious, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A movie to go down history!,"To me no man can be gifted more and gifted better than the ability to imagine, create, structure, and produce thoughts against convention or any degree of sanity; the best that a man can ever do is think, and make an audience experience his thoughts and his world in a way he deems best. The only work of James Cameron that I loved till this evening was the Judgement Day. It was slick, it was futuristic and it was everything we wanted in the early nineties; Titanic was stupid, Titanic was glossy and borrowed in ideas, and Titanic was everything commercial cinema wanted in the late nineties. Today, I watched the best movie I've ever enjoyed in my twenty years of life, the only movie that got me to the edge of the seat, clapping and smiling widely for 2.5 long hours, the only movie I thought I felt goosebumps until 20 minutes outside the hall, and the only movie that was special enough to make me hold my pee in and consider taking a leak in my pants, fearing I might miss a second of this cinematic brilliance.They say the only reason Avatar's working is because it's got the most brilliant effects but can't afford an enthralling plot line, I say thats bullshit. The only movie I think came extremely close to Avatar was The return of the king, and the plot line there wasn't as much of an original script as a screen adaptation of one of the most popular literary works in history. Avatar is original, avatar doesn't feel futuristic, it's like a totally new world that is so believable not because of of the effects but for the totally incredible concepts that Cameron produced and delivered patiently and with the prowess he's acquired over the years. There have been movies, documentaries, commercials, infomercials on the way the humans are filthiest race ever, but never has a movie pulled it off as this. The best part about it is that the creatures (strangely they never make a very strong mention of what they're called), are so emotive, so real and so much more human than the human characters in the movie, that your heart goes out to them and you feel the stab in your chest when things go wrong. Avatar is unachievable and irreplaceable in cinematic history. It's epic, but not a revolution since it's so brilliant that it's almost improbable for a movie to follow-up to what Cameron's achieved. It does have plot lines dissolving in the most predictable climaxes, and I'm glad it's done that way and originality for the sake of originality is not attempted. The movie reestablishes our belief in love, life, hope, power, energy, and magic, and in the strongest way makes us question- What really went wrong with us?I have no idea how the guy produced and held such insane creativity inside his head for 3 long years while creating this epic, and still managed to keep it sane,",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I must be fixed, I didn't liked Avatar","Well, I have to say I'm not exactly an enthusiast of this movie. James Cameron does it again and is able to create a huge blockbuster that everyone seems to like, that seems to be carved to do big in the Oscars but again I'm left with a bittersweet taste that this will not have, like Titanic, a very long life in the top of the best movies. For me the movie seems to try to disguise the simple plot with a wide variety of computer graphics (not as amazing as I thought) and making it long, really long, so that it can leave us numb. Then they put all those 3d stuff flashing that is just pure evil to leave you amazed. But if you look behind the cosmetics you'll see a simple and uninteresting movie. The movie reminds a bit Miyazaki but without the passion, without the creativity, and embedded in action and corny scenes. Well maybe I'm broken. Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
James Cameron has done it again.,"Avatar, set in the far future, is the story of wounded ex-marine Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington). Sully is handicapped and cannot walk anymore, but is offered a deal that would change his life forever. Space travel is common and a mining mission is employed on an alien planet known as Pandora. The planet is populated by a race of indigenous and environmentalist extraterrestrials known as the Na'vi. Their main village rests upon the richest deposit of the substance that the humans are trying to mine, but the population simply refuses to re-locate. Colonel Quaritch (played by Stephen Lang) introduces Sully to an operation in which he will control an external body called an Avatar, which is his DNA mixed with the DNA of a Na'vi. Sully's Avatar is transported to Pandora in an effort for him to befriend the Na'vi, gain their trust, and eventually find a desire that could get the aliens to relocate. While learning the Na'vi culture and language, he bonds and falls in love with Neytiri, the daughter of the Na'vi king and queen. Sully switches sides and eventually joins the aliens in a fight to save the stunning beauty of Pandora.One word may have popped into your mind after you read my plot summary: Pocahontas. Yes, Avatar does draw many parallels to the Pocahontas legend, and simultaneously embeds strong environmentalist messages into the story as well. The story was not the most original ever created, and it is not meant to be. The simplistic story adds to the epic tone of the film that slowly creeps its way in as the climax builds up to its finale. It is true that the plot is something we have all heard about, but never has it been presented in this manner. By the end of the film, the satisfaction one garners after the grand finale exceeds that of every Lord of the Rings film. This is classic storytelling, in James Cameron's simple yet powerful directing style. Although Avatar may seem like the average action flick of today, many of Cameron's old-time trademarks are clearly evident. There are plenty of rolling feet shots, notorious one-liners from villainous characters (like those found in Aliens, True Lies, and Terminator 2) and the action flows very nicely in true Cameron style. The writing was also very nostalgic. Cameron does not rely on complex, mind-wrenching dialogue to tell his story. The romance was well written, and character development is clearly evident as Jake Sully undergoes his transitional phase on Pandora. Some people criticize this Avatar's dialogue for coming out as a bit clichÃ©d and ""corny."" I honestly would not have enjoyed the film if the dialogue tried to hard to be revolutionary. An epic adventure like this just needs powerful acting behind the lines to work, and in that area, Avatar delivers. Sam Worthington is great and this film is yet another great example of how the Australian actor is quickly becoming one of the best and prolific actors of this generation. Zoe Saldana brought the bold, strong, and fearless character of Neytiri to life. She served as a great love interest character and her Na'vi background helped enhance how valuable of a character she is. Sigourney Weaver's performance as Grace Augustine, a botanist who specializes on Pandoran plant life, is also great as one can expect from her. The villainous Colonel Quaritch was also a fantastic character thanks to Stephen Lang's absolutely powerful performances. Cameron implemented a wonderful and fearless villain into the film and every character (including the wildlife of Pandora) stood out on it's own.I cannot find words to describe the visual impact of this film. Breathtaking, phenomenal, and amazing are all understatements. The amount of painstaking effort put into realizing the world of Pandora really paid off. The entire alien planet, including the Na'vi characters, is computer-generated, yet many shots would make the viewer wonder where they shot the film on location. New and extensive performance capture techniques were created for this film. Cameron improved upon previous motion capture methods that were used for characters such as Gollum (The Lord of the Rings) and Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean) in order to make his computer-generated characters more life-like. The Na'vis convey real emotions down to the very small muscles on their faces. The attention to detail was so carefully handled that you do not worry about things being over-the-top. You simply believe that the setting is there and the characters are undergoing a huge conflict within it. The design involved in the film was astounding and a lot of caring dedication was put into the character designs. A full phonetic language was designed from the ground up for the Na'vi civilization, in addition to a full background lore and mythology for the population. The animals look like ordinary animals at first glance, but when you see them up close with repeated viewings, you realize how alien they are. The predatory creatures that dwell in the forests of Pandora look absolutely menacing, and the dragon-like Ikrans serve a great purpose in the entire movie. James Cameron, along with other top-notch artists like Neville Page (of Cloverfield and Star Trek fame) and others from WETA Digital created a new world full of wildlife, plants, geographical locations, and a humanoid population. Pandora is simply a living and breathing world that is truly a sight to see in which the 3D effect greatly enhances.Avatar is a film experience that will be remembered for years to come. James Cameron has succeeded once again in creating a wonderfully entertaining film with the perfect balance between love, action, and mild comedy. In addition to this, the director has taken another step in upgrading the way we watch films in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Breathtaking, simply breathtaking.","I just came home 5 minutes ago from seeing an early morning showing in 3D. My expectations were pretty high in seeing this movie as lets face it, it's James Cameron. James has consistently made great films through his career and he's tried to better himself every time, but still maintaining to entertain the audience. This time round he have excelled in every aspect of film-making.Right, down to the film. All the backlash from the first teasers were forgot within the first 30 minutes of viewing, and I'll never listen to critics in the future ever again. How wrong they were. Sure there were elements of other films like Dances with Wolves, but I saw greater connections with the Final Fantasy VII game. I'm not even prepared to say that the comparisons are a bad thing, as this film (in my opinion) is greater than anything it will be compared to. A bold statement I know.Now Pandora is a world needed to be seen in 3D, I'm sure the 2D version will be a great movie, but you won't feel like you are actually there. The realism in the visuals is far greater than anything I have ever seen, the CG characters make Gollum look like Roger Rabbit. The world appears real like our own and you connect and feel for the place and its inhabitants towards the end. I really wanted it to be as real as it seemed.If you are familiar with the plot, you will be please to know that any political statement made, its not one forced upon us throughout, its subtle, but the message is clear. As the audience, you are allowed to forget about our own world troubles and be part of an amazing adventure that will stay in your mind for a long time.

Cameron is a Genius,"I don't understand how some people could criticize this outstanding work of art, i never in my life felt so good watching a movie at the theaters and i didn't even watch it in 3d.I liked all of Cameron's work, especially aliens and terminator 2,titanic was OK but nothing to rage about,but this goes on to a whole different level, the scenes in this movie are incredible,the imagination a person has to have to create a movie like this have to be beyond description,not even district 9 comes close to some of the visuals in this movie, the storyline amazing, what else can you ask for. I've read some comments stating that avatar does not belong in the top 250 movies on IMDb, as its numbered 26th i think,well not only should it belong there i personally think it deserves to take first or second place on IMDb's list for the pure genuine pleasure, and Cameron is ahead of time, he proved it in 1991 with T2 JUDJMENT DAY and he proved it again with AVATAR.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another movie spectacular by James Cameron,"When I first heard about this film I was looking forward to it a lot but I must admit when I saw the trailer it didn't really do it for me. It wasn't what I thought it would look like. But as I like every other James Cameron film I thought I would check it out and I must say it is spectacular. I didn't think I would like but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.The visual effects are just amazing. There is no other word to describe it. Pandora actually felt like it was real. It was that good. The attention to detail was brilliant. It just looked so realistic, visually stunning. The scene where Jake learns how to fly looked amazing. The dragon like creatures looked very real and were very well designed. I loved it when Jake and Neytiri were racing down the side of the mountain. The camera angle they got on that was brilliant.The last 30 minutes of the film was just breathtaking. I mean it was all systems go. It was non stop action the whole way. James done a great job of putting that together. It was just so well done. They had some great moments when it went slow motion. That was brilliant. It was just so mad with all helicopters and the navi in the air taking each other out.Colonel Miles who was played by Stephen Lang was the best character for me. He played him so well that he really made you hate him because he was just so brutal. He just didn't really care about anyone. He just pretty much wanted everyone dead. The look of his character was spot on, making him big and mean and having those scars across his face.Also the navi looked really good. I mean loads of people were saying they looked rubbish in the trailer but on the big screen they looked amazing. It was just amazing how they got the facial expression looking so good. I mean when Jake jumped in the lake when he was being chased it looked so real when the water was dripping from his face.James Cameron can definitely be happy with this film. He just never disappoints. Some of his camera angles were brilliant. They were just so clever. I mean the end battle must have taken him ages to film, let alone edit.This film is definitely one was best films I have ever seen and gets me really excited to see what the film industry could be like in a few years to come with technology like this. It is so entertaining and will have you glued to the screen throughout the whole film and wanting to see what Cameron can come up with next. I can't wait to see what the sequel will be like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply Outstanding,"James Cameron's Avatar is a breath of fresh air. Although the story itself is one that we have seen before in the likes of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai of a man who falls in love with a way of life and has to choose between what he knows and what he loves, Cameron's masterstroke is in setting the story on another world and so it is not restrained by certain parameters which leaves him free to tell an emotional story.The performances by the actors are fine and all invoke the emotions of there characters eg Giovanni Ribisi plays the Corporate bad guy perfectly. However it is James Cameron's ability to make you fall in love with a world that does not exist which makes this film work. People remark that it is a work of art which you will have to decide for yourself. In all this is a must see movie and I believe will collect a lot of Oscars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Movie will inspire many movie makers for some years to Come.,"I was expecting a lot and I did get a lot in the movie. So much so that Vatican felt threatened and made a statement on nature worship and NeoPaganism as they have monopoly on any GOD about some themes in the movie. Graphics is best in class and actually I had motion sickness, personally I may not see more 3D movies because I cannot take it. Let your self roll with the movie and wander where the movie want to take you. Race is shown little bit but usually very abstract themes don't drive home a major point without some simple analogy and analogies are logically related in the sense not in totality, hence futility of people finding race question here. There are some scenes of hanging rocks and holographic screens which I think are for entertainment purpose vs enlightenment of young minds and are truly quite original though journey to the center of earth did introduce the concept. Na'vi's speaking English makes me wonder what point we are making there but let us not hang on that theme because you will loose the effort spent in getting Na' vian language up to speed. Na'vi people are not so realistic but just think that movie is a super hit without that because Madagascar has a better eye coordination with mode and dialogues. One more point, Avatar is an Indian word meaning reincarnated self of usually God or superhuman being and quite well chosen like Yoda (another Indian word meaning warrior from Star Wars). All in all buckle up and get ready for pretty fantastic future like Wall.E, it may be a matter of choice in future to have or not have and struggle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular Visuals BUT Story Needed More Development: Rather Weak Ending,"I will certainly not argue that this is a highly entertaining film. But again with a lot of films of this type recently, the script gradually takes a back seat to the visuals. The premise of the story is a good one, and I admire Cameron for giving us a relatively original plot from which to tell his story via CGI. However, there were still a few problems with the script. Like many of movies of this type, the script seemed a couple of re-writes away from being an absolutely phenomenal story. There were a few too many aspects that started ringing of Aliens and Titanic, both of which Cameron wrote and directed. And there were glaring holes in some of the story but instead the action sequences were overlong almost to cover-up the lack of development, particularly in regards to the mineral substance sought-after by the corporate baddies.The basic plot is pretty complex. American white capitalists are exploiting Pandora, a world that is a cross between the jungles of modern-day Africa, the world of the dinosaurs 100 million years ago, and the unpredictability of Wall Street. Some of the creatures that habituate the planet are crosses between dinosaurs, reptiles, mammals, and Enron Corporation. At one point a character says you could get a little rest and relaxation in Hell after being on Pandora. Nestled inside this wilderness are a race of green humanoids resembling something that could pass for an ancient African or Native American tribe with a little bit of Vulcan added for good measure, called the Na'vi. They reside inside a giant tree that would give the Empire State Building a run for its money.Trouble is the Tree (aka Hometree) contains a mineral that's supposed to be worth $20 million per 2"" x 2"" x 2"" cube, which would mean that one the size of a bowling ball would be enough to buy the entire state of Rhode Island or the estate of Bill Gates. But this is one of the holes in the script: What the hell is this stuff and why is it potentially worth more than all the that pops up on ""Antiques Roadshow"" and ""Pawn Stars"" combined? This is never explained. I think we are given only one line about the mineral and left to speculate ourselves, and the subject never comes up again. Of course this is a gaping hole as the whole premise is based on the immense desirability of this stuff! The man in charge of the corporate interests of the operation, Parker Selfridge, seemed a clone of Carter Burke from Aliens. (I notice their first names seem like a last names!) Like Burke he is only interested in the capital gain of mining the mineral. The native people, of course, are going to get screwed.A crippled soldier, Jake Sully, who lost the use of his legs in the Marines, is hired to place his consciousness inside an ""avatar"", a life-like replica of one of the Na'vi and infiltrate their society and culture to see if an agreement can be reached between the money-hungry corporation and the Na'vi. The agreement is the native tribe is being evicted from their Tree, without even a written 30-day notice. The better part of the film is Sully learning about the Na'vi. That aspect worked relatively well, although there were characteristics of the Na'vi that seemed so much like either idealized Native American or Ancient African culture that it was getting a bit deja-vu all over again. My favorite moment is the relationship between the Na'vi and the winged beasts, the Toruk, and how the Na'vi tame them. Later, the scientists discover that much of the planet is interconnected like a giant organism but again the idea is neither developed nor resolved.The baddies are led by a colonel who is so replete with over-the-top military clichÃ© I half-expected to see him worshipping at a shrine to General Patton. He would probably feel right at home in the company of Atilla the Hun. (Again he was very similar to Cameron's character from Titanic, Spicer Lovejoy, who is just pure evil even when the ship is sinking! Without giving it away, there is a similar scene in Avatar.) Which points to what I think is the biggest problem I had with the final confrontation of the horrible white corporation with the wonderful Na'vi. The Na'vi seemed to have very little dark aspects to them and the baddies had almost no redeeming qualities barring the scientists and Sully. For those who like their bad guys and good guys very well-defined, this is your kind of movie.Unfortunately, I predicted the last 20 minutes of the film during the first 20 minutes. The ending needed something unexpected that also tied up the loose ends concerning the valuable mineral and the idea of interconnected consciousness of life on Pandora. I speculated that the corporation might earn greater profit from fostering this idea of interconnected consciousness, but nope. They don't listen to reason and simply go for the jugular. Probably the first one-half to three-quarters of this film were exceptional. The last quarter became a slash-and-bang shoot-em-up action video game. Sort of a Spaghetti Western in space. The ending needed to transcend itself to meet the very interesting rhetoric of the middle of the story. But of course that probably would have meant cutting down the action sequences, God forbid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The new era of film begins with Avatar,"I am still in awe. This film has surpassed the visual barriers. It is the marking the beginning of a new era in film. Why do I say that? Because it's done by James Cameron and after-all, he has surpassed technological barriers before with the release of Terminator 2 and Titanic in the 90's.This movie has been in the making for over 15 years and it looks like it has paid off. James wanted to wait till technology got better, then he got his inspiration from Lord of the Rings. He took that inspiration and he perfected so that NO ONE will ever make a movie this good for a very long time, visually. He created the camera, the graphics, basically he created new technology and this opens SO MANY windows of opportunities for other film-makers in Hollywood. The next decade of sci-fi, or special effects driven films will look like Avatar thanks to James Camerons' technology.Now to the story. This is such a beautiful tale of a man with a disability who befriends a different species outside of our solar system and respects their way of life. Now a lot of people compare this movie with ""Dances With Wolves"" but I have never seen that movie so I can't say anything and it seems that people love comparing films nowadays to feel like they deserve to have an opinion. Anyway, on with the story. After our main hero befriends the Na'vi populace, he has a change of heart and sides with them, the militia that has populated Pandora doesn't like this, they just want their materials and will kill anything in their path to have it.The Na'vi are not a violent species unless they are pushed over the edge. The humans who inhabit the planet only want raw materials that sell for 20 million a kilo. A lot of other parasites have said that it makes fun of Americans and their way of life, of how they seek nothing else but to dominate everything in its path. I mean, isn't that true? They love doing that, and they have been doing that for the last 200 years. But this movie is not about that egotistical, and arrogant country, it's about the human species when it comes into contact with another species; we hunt them down if they don't co-operate or if they we think they're a nuisance, and on top of that, claim their land as ours. It's true though, we would do that if we wanted to colonize on another planet with another species. We would kill them. No wonder aliens don't visit us, we're f***ed up.Anyways, I can't stress it more that you MUST see this movie. It's one of those movies you should see before you die. Even if it's your last day before you die because you have a critical disease or condition; you have to see this film. It will make your life and your death so worthwhile. You will die in awe. Definitely a blu-ray purchase in my books. 10/10 for a visual evolution, a breathtaking story and an outstanding experience in IMAX 3D..the way it was meant to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Outstanding,Mesmerizing,Hypnotising","I believe in James Cameron, way back from the Aliens to Titanic he delivered a sensation or a magic. And his new magnum Opus, AVATAR is most entertaining,thrilling cinematic experience of my lifetime. Its mesmerizing, and Cameron crafted it wonderfully.The film focuses on an epic conflict on Pandora, Pandora is inhabited by an indigenous species called the Na'vi. Standing nine feet tall, with tails and sparkling blue skin, the Na'vi live in harmony with the natural world around them.The word Avatar is an ancient Indian word, with literal meaning of ""the Lord Vishnu taking another form, to counter the evil forces"". Here it refers to human scientists led by Dr. Grace(Sigourney Weaver) taking form of Na'vis with the help of Genetic engineering.Jake Sully(Sam Worthington), a marine, who replaces his brother on a mission to infiltrate the Na' vis on the planet of Pandora. During Jake's first assignment through the Pandora jungle, few wild creatures attacks him and becomes alone in that jungle, attempts to survive and steals the attention of Nytiri (Zoe Saldana) a Na'vi female.The Na'vi people decide to take Jake and teach him about their culture. As Jake learns the way of the Na'vi, he finds himself caught between the military-industrial forces of Earth and a newfound love for his adopted home and people. Believing that the Na'vi will never abandon their home, the humans attack and destroy the Hometree, forcing the Na'vi to flee. The Na'vi feel betrayed by Jake, ostracizing him from the tribe. Back at base, Jake and his compatriots are forcibly disconnected from their avatar interfaces and are detained for arguing against the destruction.Finally, with Neytiri's assistance, Jake assembles thousands of Na'vi from other tribes and lead them into battle with the increasingly violent human forces, in order to save their race and world, after the battle, the humans are forced to evacuate Pandora. To talk about the performance, all arrows from the Cameron's bow done an excellent job.Especially Nytiri, an electrifying performance, even Sam did an excellent job.I mean all are acted brilliantly. Visual effects is superb and hypnotizingAvatar offers not only Space war but also a drizzling love story between Jake's Avatar and Nytiri. Every scene offers you a thrilling Taquila. I added Avatar in my favorites list. I give 10 rating for James Cameron's Avatar because i cannot give less than that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Avatar - Way of Heart (definitely a masterpiece),"Wow! Bravo James Cameron! Nothing I have seen so far was so breathtaking! Special effects are another breakthrough! Well worth to see it for yourself in a theater.Mainly this movie gives us (the humanity) a chance to look in the mirror (which is not especially pleasant) and to survive as species.However, people who let their minds consider themselves ""the crown of evolution"" will not grasp the Idea and will not like the movie. For them, the main character remains a mere traitor. (oh, what should i say! what a pity!)We, people, have our mechanical toys OK, but watching this movie made me for the first time feel (indeed) that ""advanced"" people from a mechanical civilization have _nothing_ valuable to offer for such ""usual barbarians"" as Navi, who are living in perfect balance at Pandora planet and in perfect harmony with every creature.Definitely I want to see this movie again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hyped for a mediocre film,I think the build up to t's release was more exciting than the actual film. I'm not sure if I'm missing something or need to give it another watch. I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
eye candy with no substance,"It's very possible that this is an important movie in the field of CGI and 3D technology. In that category it is certainly a groundbreaking pioneer and it will have its followers. In fact it already has (life of Pi). The artificial world that was created was amazingly beautiful and imaginative.For this I give the movie all ten points.But in the movie industry there are different categories. More than half of the playing time - namely the scenes of the Avatar world - belonged more or less to the category of animated movies with CGI effects. It was made rather on the computer than it was behind the camera.The question is: shouldn't Avatar be treated and rated like an animated movie rather than a motion picture with real actors? Even animated movies and are judged as whole, not only for their outstanding visual execution.If you extract the whole high tech visual aspect of Avatar what is left of it?-average acting (except Sigurney Weaver) (- 1 point)-predictable story (- 1 point)-full of clichÃ©s: bad military people versus native peoples preserving nature (-1 point)-full of stereotypes: there are either good or bad characters (-1 point)If the Avatar world would have been replaced (and played) by some real Aborigines, this movie would have been neither noticed nor watched.I read somewhere that this movie is the equivalent for pop music hits: Today for the best tomorrow for the garbage.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Hard criticism for the USA. But will anybody notice??,"One of the best movies ever. There was the famous Mr. Gorbachev, who wrote in his book ""Perestroika"" the remarkable sentence: ""Capitalism is incapable of solving mankind's global problems"". We just witnessed Copenhagen, where the two most aggressive nations on this planet finally paved the way to global doom.Avatar shows us the extinction of the Native Americans by the first Europeans coming to America, it shows us the way the Aborigines ended after the English came to Australia, it shows us numerous ""smaller"" events, where the evil combination of a mighty military machine and insidious commercial interests. This combination (some call it fascism) will do everything to get its profit.I find it fascinating, that especially a nation like the USA, who can't kick militarism, is making such movies, watching such movies, enjoys such movies and ... continues exactly like they did before. Don't marines visit movies theaters? Don't managers visit such movies? We destroy everything. This process continues, it actually happens each and every day. Each day, ""Avatar"" happens on Earth. A little Pandora in every hour of our life. But since we don't watch it in 3-D in a movie theater, it doesn't bother us too much and our ""Na'vi's"" ain't always that perfect and pretty.So now we watch it in beautiful, magical pictures in a movie theater and the good ones win for once. At least until another profit-hungry corporation comes back and throws some ERW /neutron bombs on the Na'vi, because after that, they can continue making 20 Million bugs a kilo of something mineral - so we can buy more non-alcoholic beer and more blue jeans and more bankers can claim more bonuses.The movie is wonderful, but the victory of the Na'vi can only be considered a ""Little Bighorn"". Nothing more.For the few among us who know about Enlightenment, the movie pictures the Na'vi as beings living in a state of knowing who they are. This alone makes it worth watching the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing graphics...but crap overall,"Well people, I would like to start off by saying that if you have seen this movie more than twice, you should really check your IQ (it might be lower than you've expected). The reason I say that, is that like most of the other modern super high graphics movies, this movie lacks a good story. I mean its just a complete mess, the plot is like 5 minutes, some idiot comes in the village speaking English, and they are like oh yeah dude we are just going to teach you ""our way"" out of the blue, not even caring where he came from or what he wants. Followed by boring 45 minutes of dragon flights, etc...I was yawning when I was watching it. The of course the savage fight scene, a cheesy love story, all that crap. Here's the breakdown of all the mess they've made:1) Terminator - Their sarge, a ruthless idiot. 2) Lord of the Rings - the Stupid tree the people live in, just blow up the tree..could have nuked it, but it's OK) 3) Alines - well that one actor whatever her name is, was from aliens and so did the space ships looked a lot like in that movie. 4) Matrix - guy in the tub, loading him to the avatar...oh jeez, come on people, it's not original anymore to be a copy cat(I am sure I forgot another movie they copied the stuff from, but that's OK. So I gave it a 6/10 because that's all it deserves for crap story and amazing graphics. But seriously don't see it more than twice, just because you are wasting your money. I'll get my BluRay copy of it, but that's about it.Adios!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most overrated film in history,"The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.1 star out of 4",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar - a comprehensive review (no spoilers),"Avatar is quite simply the most outstanding movie experience that I have witnessed to date. It excels on all levels without exception. Anyone who is fan of science fiction / fantasy and enjoys having their imagination tickled will thrive on the vast wealth of original creativity contained within this multi-layered epic masterpiece. Avatar is a movie you don't watch... you live it.VISUAL PRESENTATION: James Cameron has thrown down the gauntlet with Avatar's stunning visual imagery, phenomenal CGI and 3D presentation. The next generation motion capture technology that James Cameron developed and utilised in the production of this movie has achieved a wholly realistic quality. The days of dead-eyes, emotionless facial expressions and general unnatural creepiness (such as seen in Robert Zemekis' Polar Express) are at an end. CG characters are for the first time truly emotionally expressive to the extent that they appear real. The overall quality of the CGI is so high that for the first time it is practically impossible to distinguish between what's real and CGI. Cameron's perfectionism has paid off particularly in this regard.3D OR NOT 3D? Avatar is a great movie irrespective of whether you watch it in 2D or 3D. However, if you want the best viewing experience I strongly recommend you watch the 3D version. Opting to view the 2D version would be akin to choosing to watch Titanic on a black and white television... why would you do that? I watched the 3D version (in RealD not Dolby3D) and can comment that it was a mind-boggling spectacular experience. I have never, ever found myself so immersed within a movie... The 3D is not in any way the occasional gimmicky hey-look-I'm-jumping-out-the-screen-at-you effect of the past. Everything has a truly three dimensional depth... the effect is that of astonishing realism... It is literally as if you are actually there in Pandora watching events as they occur. With Avatar any apprehension I had about the new 3D technology has been quashed, it is without a doubt the way forward for visual entertainment and I very much hope other movies take note of Avatar's demonstration of how it should be done.AUDIO: The music composed by James Horner is consistent with his previous work and superbly lends itself to immersing you in the world of Pandora rather than beating you over the head with a relentlessly pounding soundtrack. Horner provides the perfect balance of atmospheric ambiance where relevant blended with thrill-inspiring pulse-pounding accompaniment to the various action sequences. The quality of the sound effects and mixing is also exceptional. Whilst the music was pleasingly emotive there were also times I was literally shaking in my seat.STORY: The one area that Avatar has received criticism from some is regarding its story. I'm not going to include any spoilers here, but suffice to say that the theme of the story is strongly science fiction / fantasy so if you don't like that sort of thing then this movie may not particularly enthral you. On the other hand if you enjoy sci-fi and possess even a modicum of intelligence you will almost certainly enjoy the story as much as I did. Please don't pay attention to any of the tabloid film critics who in my opinion always try to be too clever for their own boots. Any talk of Avatar's story lacking originality is quite frankly utter nonsense. Of course, there are certain aspects that could be considered similar to this movie or that movie, but commenting that Avatar is low in originality is akin to stating that The Terminator is not original because it comprises what is essentially the standard formula for an action film, namely lead/hero meets villain, lead/hero battles villain through various action sequences, lead/hero kills villain, the end. Of course The Terminator was most original, and so is Avatar. In fact, the extent of imaginative creativity contained within Avatar's story, in particular relating to Pandora and its inhabitants, is mind-numbing. Furthermore, Cameron pulls off a high level of character depth to not only the lead characters but even those of a supporting role. The wealth of imaginative ideas contained within Avatar is more than enough to produce at least one if not two sequels. Let's just hope that we don't have to wait so long for the next instalment. I for one am longing to return to Pandora!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A classic in the true sense,"I was a bit hesitant to write a review after my first viewing of Avatar. But now after my third viewing, I am not shy in declaring that this movie will become a classic and remembered for its groundbreaking vista for as long time. We have become used to ""production"" movies coming out of assembly lines from Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movie houses that we almost forgot how wonderful a cinematic experience can be. Sure, there may have been other movies this year with ""more quirky"", ""more original"" stories but as a whole, Avatar is by far the best movie this year and in the top ten of best movie this decade. A classic is by definition something that you can enjoy as much if not more in the second, third, fourth viewing, and Avatar is definitely it. I don't understand the critic that this film lack story and emotion because it has all of it, even if a bit on the clichÃ© side.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Absolutely Incredible,"There's a lot of gushing going on for this film, and rightly so. After a Summer of lackluster crap, along comes this magnificent film. For once the hype was actually deserved. I won't talk about the plot, this film is best seen with as little information as possible. I will say that I wasn't prepared for the experience, even as a jaded film-goer I was transported and yes, moved. I didn't expect the emotional impact, but Cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons, and he does so here masterfully.Some of the criticism lies in the ""surface"" quality of the plot, but again, Cameron has never made deep, cerebral films. Cameron is an entertainer, and thank God for it. This film is pure, futuristic, ahead of it's time escapism. I was absolutely floored.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually Stunning and Cutting Edge CGI but no characters or plot worth a darn,"I will give Cameron credit for a visually stunning movie. I will say this movie did hold my attention for about an hour. But special effects and great CGI only carries you so far.OK first of all, I give James Cameron credit. He has surpassed all his prior films in creating a visual masterpiece. They were glorious and beautiful and he should be commended for that. You could even call the Special effects here groundbreaking. But it's sort of like looking at the Alps or Niagara Falls. While visually stunning, that's it. The rest of the film to me was a huge empty vapid wasteland, not well written and very predictable.First of all the story. What story. I could have rented Pocahontas if I wanted to see this story. There's nothing original here. And at least Pocahontas and John Smith were real people with layers and motives that were empathetic and relatable. Who are Jake and Neytiri. I found myself not really caring about them. The story is clichÃ©d and has been done many many many times before. I found nothing groundbreaking about it. I guess if you are a teenager you probably will love it. Me not so much.And the acting? Who needs acting when you have CGI and CGI created characters. I fear for the future of actors.Now I admit I am no James Cameron fan but I do admit he created something special with Titanic although watching the special effects in that movie now more than 10 years later, they are laughable. At least Titanic had a semblance of a story. So in 10 years plus how will Avatar's special effect's hold up. This should not be on any ""BEst of a decade list or any top 200 film list. It won't stand the test of time. Compare this to a film like Aliens(which by the way Cameron made) which is still visually appealing, had a compelling story, well rounded characters, and fine acting and there is no comparison.I think another reviewer hit the nail on the head. Hollywood is continually trying to come up with ways to draw movie goers to the theatres. Since many people can sit in the comfort of their home and watch films on their surround sound big screen TV's how do we get them coming to the theaters. Create films with huge special effects that are 3D where you can only experience maximum impact on the big screen.Maybe these geniuses in Hollywood need to figure out why films like Julie and Julie, The Blind Side, Up in the Air are drawing in film goers, and these are not big special effects films. Just good films with good acting and decent stories. These are films that stand the test of time. I can watch films like Gone with the Wind, The Godfather, Aliens, time and time again and never tire of them. Avatar, Titanic, zzzzzzzzzzzz.One last disturbing tone to this film. How soon will it be before CGI created characters take the place of real like actors. Thanks James Cameron I happen to adore actors bringing their personalities and takes on characters to a film.And I will reiterate I am not anti James Cameron. I adored Aliens.By the way who wrote the score and song for this film. Truly terrible.I give this film 5 stars for the special effects. That't it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Gives Epic a new meaning,"This film is simply extradionary. nothing compares to it, Cameron has created an entire new world, with new creatures and even a new language.The story keeps you intrigued, you don't notice the 2 and a half hours and the battle scenes are simply sublime.i read a guardian review before seeing the film that gave it 2/5 and likened it to aliens but he should be fired from his job, really cant understand how anyone can not like this movie, even my gf who said it looked crap and they were smurfs ended up loving it and has agreed to see it again next week with me. The 3D doesn't go for the gimmicky pop out of the screen at you but instead just adds to the experience in a subtle way.A lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon saying how amazing Cameron is cause they have seen titanic, i loved Cameron's movies before i knew they were his. By the time i was 12, T2 and Aliens were my 2 favourite movies of all time before i even knew anything about directors etc, now avatar adds to that list.Quite simply see this movie, it is most definitely one that you will need to see on the big screen preferable in 3D for the full experience and if you don't have a blu ray player by the time this is released on DVD?

"Incredible, inventive effects can't save this","James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by ""aliens"" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An outstanding piece of entertainment.,"First I would like to state that this is my actual opinion. I am not putting in an extreme to try to balance off everybody else as seems so prevalent in these reviews. I put my money where my pen is so to speak. So first I will provide evidence that this is my actual opinion: My wife and I VERY seldom watch TV, but we do watch 3-4 movies/week. So although we do have a life outside of watching movies, we have literally watched thousands of movies. I have a sizable investment in home theater gear, so we do not feel compelled to go to the theater very often (a couple times a year). When we do, we are normally content to wait until the DVD is released to see the movie again (if ever). Prior to this, there was only one movie I had EVER seen more than once in the theater. That movie was Star Wars and although many of my contemporaries saw it 11 or more times, I was content to see it twice in the theater. Tomorrow, we are going to see this movie the third time in 3-D (I won't see it in 2-D because I can do that over and over again in my home when the DVD comes out.) and I am not ruling out seeing it yet again before it is pulled from the theaters. This shows a landmark change in my viewing patterns and I believe that I can be believed that I am rating it a 10 because I feel it is a landmark movie rather than trying to have an inordinate sway on the overall ratings.The movie was visually stunning, quick paced and quite a bit of fun to watch. It was a superb MOVIE.There are quite a bit of other reviews summarizing the plot and key points, so I will address some of the negative points.Many have said that the plot was very simple. While this is true, science fiction and fantasy have a hard time adapting to the screen if they have an overcomplicated plot. The reason is that much of the movie time is used to explain the framework. This could be technology or magic or whatever variables make up this fantastic world. The alternative is to have a movie that cannot stand on its own. ""Dune"" and ""Battlefield Earth"" were both excellent books with too much plot to make a good movie. Simple plots with well developed frameworks tend to make the best sci-fi/fantasy movies such as ""The Thirteenth Floor"", ""Soylent Green"" and ""Clockwork Orange"". Even ""Star Wars"" is very simple if evaluated only by its premiere movie. It is only after several movies that a more complicated fabric emerges. That is why stable ""Universes"" such as ""Star Trek"" are common. Once the framework has been developed, then relatively short stories can be more complicated since the framework doesn't have to be explained over again.There have been several objections to the use of ""unobtainium"" as a ludicrous name for a material. ""Unobtainium"" is not new to this movie. It is a common engineering/fictional concept that has been around at least since the 1950s (see the Wikipedia article). It even has its own symbol (Uo). It is funny. Get over it.There have also been several objections to the faculty that the aliens have with the English language. Excessive use of subtitles would detract from the movie far more than frequent usage of a non-existent language would.There have been objections that the movie is predictable. OK, it isn't a who-done-it, and being unpredictable is not required for a show to be good. I absolutely love the BBC ""The Blue Planet"" series, and all of the fish behave exactly the way I would expect them to.My advice is if you want cerebral sci-fi/fantasy with exotic locations and complex plot lines, read a book. If you want a wonderful trip into an exotic land watch this movie. I think it is beyond compare and the box office seems to indicate that I am not alone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
No movie ever looks the same after seeing AVATAR,"I have seen Avatar three times, tonight being my 3rd viewing. I saw it in 2D the first two times because I felt like the 3D would be horrible and unwatchable/blurry/etc.I was wrong, the 3D version literally places you in the amazing world of Pandora...I left the theater after seeing this movie and just looked in amazement at Earth, how simple and almost disgusting it looked compared to the beautiful Pandora. (yes the plants in Pandora glow at night)I can't even describe how good this movie is...yes I was one of the millions of people who thought it looked stupid because it was blue aliens running around screaming...I couldn't have been more wrong about my expectations for this movie, within the first 5 min my opinion on it changed.I believe it will be many years before I see a movie as incredible as this, just when you think Hollywood has run out of gas, James Cameron spends half a billion on the most epic movie ever created in Hollywood history. What else could he possibly have in store for us? Titanic, Terminator, Aliens...guy just doesn't stop cranking out the masterpiece films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A spectacular show of ""cinematic fireworks""","""Avatar"" is billed as an action, adventure and fantasy film. While it is all of these, it's basic plot and makeup is all science fiction. There's no doubt about the fantastic technical and production qualities of this film. It's a joy just to watch the colorful scenes, sets and creatures of Pandora. CGI clearly has gone to the next level in creating backdrops, sets and scenes for use with live action filming. This is very good fantasy stuff.With so many reviews already, I won't rehash what others have said. But, I didn't see reference in the comments I scanned to a couple of things worth noting. So, this is to add them to the discussion of this film. A number of others are critical of the film for its lack of originality. It's true that the same themes of the genre of sci-fi and space exploration have been used a great deal before.The earth has depleted its resources and must find new ones somewhere else. The indigenous creatures of Pandora have their own deity. So, this film has considerable mythology. The new type of bionic man comes into this one with a scientific melding of human and something else. The humans are aliens to this planet or moon, and there is the usual division of some who care about the natives and others who couldn't care less about them.Much less often, fantasy and sci-fi films will use a writing trait found in classical literature. That is symbolic names and other words. Two leap out in this film. The first is the moon's name, Pandora. From Greek mythology, Pandora's box (or jar) today refers to a plethora of things that can cause havoc or problems. That fits this movie all too well. The second obvious symbolic word is the name for the rare mineral that earth needs, ""unobtanium."" So, it can't be obtained on earth or elsewhere.What is a somewhat unique about ""Avatar"" is that it combines all of the above aspects of sci-fi and more. But with so much action and all of the visual spectacles, it makes a plot that is very difficult to follow. When I came out of the theater after seeing this film the first time, I thought about the splendid visual show it was, but also wondered if there was any real point in the plot. It seemed to be just a complex story made to pull together many scenes of action, visual treats, and wild fantasy and sci-fi things.Watching it again, the visual spectacle is still there, and the plot fades. So, this isn't a film that would be recognized for the original and main crafts of theater - acting and directing. A good analogy might be with what Americans enjoy every year in celebrating the Fourth of July. Whoever tires of watching spectacular fireworks displays? We don't think about the theme, or the reason or the history at that moment. And, year after year we turn out to watch the fireworks again.""Avatar"" isn't so much a movie or film with a great story and actors performing in it. It's just a spectacular fireworks display on the silver screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Inventive detailing with (maybe a bit too much of) an Anti-War-Message,"I sat through these nearly three hours of Avatar and I have to admit I really liked it. I didn't want to see that movie, because I'm a bit disappointed by American cinema lately, but my brother was psyched, so I joined him.At first: We saw that movie in 3d, but I doubt this feature adding something special to the experience of the movie. However there were some scenes worth watching in 3d, but I could really have spared the expense without missing anything.And that's due to the fact that there was so much to see in that movie, that you forget about 3d really soon and concentrate on the beautiful work of the landscape design artists. There are so many ideas being realized in that Pandora nature. So many details that create the feel of a complete world rather than what you see elsewhere, when they have some pretty ideas, but use magic plot holes to bypass the logical flaws.Avatar takes its time to tell its story. That means you have to watch it really long. I mean if someone tells you a really good story, you can listen to it for three hours, but of course: This is a long time. Sure this time is never wasted, but tends to address different 'moods': Sometimes it's extensive action, sometimes it's just visual entertainment ('watching the beauty of Pandora'), sometimes revealing emotions etc.The story itself I consider to be an Anti-War-Statement. And it's the best I have seen in American cinema until now. Saving Privat Ryan was good to show that war is on your own expense too. But Avatar concentrates on the question: ""Does, just because you have a gun, mean you're right?"" or alternatively ""Is your way of living the only one worth trying?"". Of course this is a bit of a clichÃ© and the bad guy in the movie is a really bad ass bastard, so if you side with the natives you'll really love to see his payoff. And that's somehow exploited I think.Overall Pandora is my favorite movie in the categories: Anti-War-Movie and Oh-My-God-3-Hours-Movie.Watch it if you have enough steadiness, if you can stand more than the one 'mood' that is action and if you're not offended by an offensive Anti-War-Statement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
OHHHHHHHHHH Jamesssssssss!!!!,Well i just happened to see the screening of avatar as i work with movies. We happened to get avatar and I must say the movie delivers...Not just on an aspect of story telling and intense moments but on pure entertainment and visual bliss. I am not much into Hollywood movies but for James Cameron I will make the exception of writing this review. It is just what the doctor ordered for this year of pathetic Hollywood movies. I just cant wait to watch it in 3D the following weekend but James Cameron still hasn't lost his masterful touch.Its great to see how the movie turns out to be so great and the way in which the plot turns.I wont give away anything and the plot is pretty much explained in the previews that you would have definitely seen. Just remember the cgi is brilliant and Cameron yet again has given us a glimpse of tomorrow today.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's actually a love story,"Most people have heard about this movie, and how it's got groundbreaking cinematics and will ""change the way movies are made and watched."" I'm not sure about all that, but I sure liked it.Please don't be fooled into thinking this is an action movie. There are a couple ""chase"" scenes, and one major ""fight"" scene. The rest of it is breath-taking CGI and plot development.Yes, there are several heavy-handed messages about imperialism, capitalism, pollution/destruction of the natural environment, and even a religious message or two. But these are secondary to the main story, which is a love story. If you are willing to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in the story, it is a magical experience. I NEVER see movies multiple times in the theater; I've seen Avatar twice, and WILL be purchasing the DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Visual Marvel but Lacking in Substance,"Avatar (2009) is a visually stunning film that showcases some of the most impressive CGI work to date. The lush and vibrant world of Pandora is a joy to behold, and the design of the Na'vi and the other creatures that inhabit the planet is truly breathtaking.However, despite its impressive visual style, Avatar suffers from a lack of substance in its story and characters. The plot is fairly predictable and unoriginal, and none of the characters are particularly interesting or complex.Additionally, the film falls into the trap of the savior complex, with the Na'vi needing the help of the human protagonist to fight back against their oppressors. While the film's themes of environmentalism and cultural respect are admirable, they are not explored in a particularly nuanced or deep way.Overall, while Avatar is a feast for the eyes, it falls short in terms of narrative and character development. If you're looking for a film that prioritizes style over substance, then Avatar may be worth checking out. However, if you're looking for a more engaging and well-developed story, you may want to look elsewhere.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Greatest movie of all time, period","In my 27 years of life I've had the pleasure of watching truly great movies like Blade Runner, Braveheart, and The Lord of the Rings to name a few, but all of them pale in comparison to Avatar. I have no doubts Avatar is the greatest movie of all time.Avatar is set in a future in which the humans have destroyed Earth. Through their travels in space they found a planet full of life and a very valuable metal. Unfortunately the rich deposits of that metal are buried underneath an encampment of an alien race indigenous to that planet. The humans have been trying to convince the natives to move out, but the natives don't want to.To better communicate with the natives and to attempt to win their trust, the humans have engineered a hybrid body composed of human and alien DNA, a body that looks very similar to that of the aliens. The humans are able to link up a human mind to that hybrid body, and control it like if it were your own body, sort of like how you'd control a character in a video game, hence the name of the movie, Avatar. But this is even better than that, even better than virtual reality because the body you control is alive.After years of communicating with the aliens and being unable to convince them to move out, the humans send in Jake Sully, an ex marine. Will he be able to convince them to move out? You'll have to watch and see.The picture quality is amazing, the rain forests, the futuristic human technology, the indigenous animals and people of the alien planet, everything looks wonderful and real. The sound effects are equally great, you'll feel like you're in an exotic rain forest. Mel Gibson's Apocalyto did a great job at making you feel like you're in the middle of a wonderful rain forest, but Avatar goes well beyond that.This is the first time I've watched a movie in Real D 3D so I can't make a comparison with other 3D movies, but the experience was breathtaking. You'll be dodging things thinking they're coming straight at you. You'll feel like you're in the middle of an incredible ceremony with hundreds of people. I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the movie, but believe me when I say you really don't want to miss out on a chance to see this movie in 3D. What an incredible experience, I can't wait to see it again, I'm definitely seeing it again tomorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More than just a movie,"Beyond the storyline there is something very valuable. This Film really demonstrates to me the importance of recognizing beauty in the world. Lets all wake up and see the beauty in our own world, in our relationships, in our daily tasks. Lets make life sacred again. Lets live through our fears and not reside in comfort. Embrace life and fill ourselves with love until it overflows into the world. Lets create heaven on earth!I know there are people who would not agree with my views; however, its all in the eye of the beholder. Obviously this film has flaws, maybe the story is not very original, or the script for that matter. To me this film didn't need to be perfect. I feel it is a timely work of art that represents where we are as a species. We are at a place where the way we are living isn't working anymore. Disconnected from the earth, disconnected from each other, we are starving for a more raw genuine way of life. A world where giving is as important as receiving, and we understand the connection we have with our environment. If we all think of the earth as a being, or an organism, then we the people are like the bacteria. Some bacteria are helpful and some are harmful. Just like in our own bodies, when there is a harmful bacteria the body attacks it! Think about natural disasters or disease! The earth needs our love. If we treat it well..it will treat us well. No movie has ever addressed this issue so masterfully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually Stunning...Plot Challenged,"Avatar is an important cinematic achievement. To dismiss its groundbreaking visual effects is just as bad as forgiving its lack of plot development and weak dialog. The movie will usher in a new era, for good or bad, of technical achievement in film. The 3-D is amazing and the special effects are on a scale that Lucas could have only dreamed about. But, like Lucas in his prequels, so much time is spent depicting the story that (it seems) no one really bothered to ask if the story was worth telling to begin with. Imagine if Avatar had been as powerful as 2001. Imagine if the story were just as awe inspiring as the images racing before your eyes. That would have been a true movie masterpiece. Because, in the end, no matter how good the movie looks, the visuals only exist to bring the story to life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Film I have ever seen!!!!,"Let me start by clearing a few things up. Avatar is the kind of film you have to see in the cinema to enjoy it fully ( and in 3D if possible). I was lucky enough to stumble upon the film a few months ago and foolishly dismissed it. Then two days ago me and a few of my friends were on our way to see 2012 and got stuck buying food and so were very late. We decided to skip 2012 and go see Avatar instead.A full 165 minutes later I walked out of there fully convinced of that James Cameron is a certified genius. The amount of detail in the world that he has created for the Na vi (the blue people) is astounding. The level of colour and detail draws you in like nothing I have ever experienced and the 3D really is incredible.Now the main point the critics of the film focus on the storytelling and its slow pace towards the beginning . Now not only is this an unjust and misleading comment but it is a total lie. The film sets up a beautifully crafted story that demonstrates the power of human emotion and what happens when we loose site of it. There was not a single moment in the film where I was wondering what was happening or why and I doubt that any director could fit such a breathtaking story into anything less that 2 hours 30 minutes. It once again proves Cameron creative genius and gives us a terrifying insight into the path that humanity is taking and what we will become. He has always tried to highlight this in his past films with Carter Burke in Aliens and Caledon Hockley in Titanic, both portraying the bastard capitalists.There are very few things that can be leveled against this film but I do not believe that I can think of any. In my view Avatar is not just the best film I have ever seen but the best cinematic experience I have had in my 15 years in this world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A powerful and sweeping epic,"""Avatar"" might be one of, if not the best movies ever made. Like James Cameron's last film ""Titanic"", it's a powerful and sweeping epic that goes to unbelievable lengths to wow us and amaze us. Some people are going to say that the story is rubbish, the dialogue is trash, and it's only a technical achievement, nothing more, nothing less. But they are wrong. The movie exceeds on every level possible, and while the impact could be considerably less in 2 dimensions, it still holds up as one of the best movies ever made.Cameron has perfected his three dimensional technology, and if you never see this in 3 dimensions, you are not seeing the director's extraordinary vision. I've never seen anything like this before in my life, and neither will you. I honestly have never seen a 3D motion picture in my life until Avatar, and when my theater finally had 3D technology, I considered seeing ""Up"" in 3D, but decided I would wait until ""Avatar"" to pop my 3D hymen. Boy, I do not regret this decision one bit.Yes, what you have heard is true, ""Avatar"" is the future of cinema. It's a complete game changer for Hollywood, and it has redefined the industry. There is no doubt in my mind there will be as many and maybe even more flocking to see this like Titanic 12 years ago. What's even better, is that while it revolutionizes Hollywood as an awesome technological achievement, it also packs a really damn good story, too.It does have a political message, but it's a very universal one everyone can accept: While human beings do some pretty damn amazing things, we also do some really horrible things. We burn down our own forests, we fight wars with each other, and we destroy each other's lives. James Cameron relays a message that is both powerful and a wake up call, and he's embedded it brilliantly into a film that is going to be seen by everyone. I hope this movie changes people, because I certainly think it has the ability to do so.While Cameron uses the technology to wow us, he also uses his story to pull at our emotions. I won't lie, there are scenes that do have the ability to make grown men cry, and it's important to realize that most of these scenes don't even involve the humans. The alien race known as the Na'vi are probably even more human than we are, which even adds more realism to the completely computer generated characters. This does not feel fake, this feels absolutely real. Thank god for that.This movie also runs at 2 hours and 40 minutes long. However, this is not one bit like the other movies this year that nearly push the 3 hour mark (i.e. ""Transformers 2"", ""2012""), and what's funny is that once it's over, you will have wished for more. Not many movies can do this, especially if they are long, but I can tell you that this movie does not drag once, nor does it feel like it is nearly 3 hours. If anything, it feels as though that it is too short. Try getting a hallmark card for that.From its opening scene to its closing shot, this is a truly beautiful, remarkable, and amazing film. There's no other film I would want the first decade of the 21st century to close on. The most important thing is, you have to see this movie to witness the most important part of what will soon be the history of 21st century Hollywood, and we have James Cameron to thank for this.

"Usually people hate clichÃ©s, but in this one they love them???","I did not like Avatar. There, I said it. Criticize me, but this movie was bad. Just bad.One of the most predictable stories I've ever seen. Curiosity: I saw this movie with my best friend and usually before the movie starts we discuss how the movie is going to go and how the story will develop. We do that before every movie and many times we get the ending right (maybe not 100% right, but the most important things), but avatar was the first movie where we got everything right. EVERYTHING. We talked for like 20 minutes and got everything right. It was like We went inside Cameron's mind or something, just kidding because even a 10 year old could've guessed 90% of the movie.OK. So the graphics were awesome. So what?! Is a movie all about graphics to you? A movie only needs to be visually awesome to have an 8.4 rating?? How low has the movie industry gone? If people stopped thinking about the graphics for 5 minutes and just thought about the supernatural amount of clichÃ©s and predictability present in this movie, maybe this movie would have a 6 or 7 rating, but no, most people are like a little kid looking at something shiny and new - the content doesn't matter as long as it's pretty.Just one thing, if you didn't see the movie and don't want to hear or be aware of spoilers follow these measures: 1-Don't watch the trailer(it'll give too much away) 2-Don't read the synopsis (it'll give too much away) 3-Don't even think, or you'll figure the whole thing.

Treat yourself... a must watch in IMAX,"Terminator, Titanic, these are the names everyone have heard of. What do they have in common with Avatar? An avangard director by the name of James Cameron. This was my first IMAX 3D experience and this turned out to be a visual extravaganza. In recent past, Hollywood has produced some stunning movies in the genre, and we knew something great is coming, and this movie shows how far we have come; this is what we had been waiting for. This is the benchmark of the 21st century action-adventure-sci-fi experience. The movie is about Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic marine, who travels 4.4 light years to come to Pandora, under the banner of Avatar program. Pandora a lush green, low gravity moon of Polyphemus, inhabited by hominoid race called Na'vi. A Na'vi is nine feet tall, have bones reinforced by naturally occurring carbon fibre, have bioluminescent blue skin, big eyes, small ears and a tail. They live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess called Eywa. Members of Avatar program have successfully genetically engineered human-na'vi hybrid knows ""Avatar"", that can be remotely controlled. Jake's mission is to infiltrate the Na'vi camp, gather Intel and reconcile a treaty with them to move their camp, which happen to be resting on large deposit of ""unobtanium"", the reason for humans to come to Pandora. Failing to convince the Na'vi's and simultaneously falling in love with them, their culture and a Na'vi name Neytiri (ZoÃ« SaldaÃ±a). When Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), decides to go all weapons free on Na'vi population, Jake sides with Na'vi's to give them an edge in the ""battle of bows and arrows against gunships"". The visual effects in the movie are truly groundbreaking. The movie is interesting, entertaining, emotional, and action packed; an overall awesome performance. Animation, characterization of Na'vi and other Pandora creatures are by far the best I have seen. A must watch. Treat yourself by watching it in IMAX 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Like nothing I've seen before,I watch movies for a living and feel as though most movies are just rehashes of movies that have already been made. Avatar is different. Cameron has created a new world that I felt I became a part of while watching. The detail is absolutely amazing. All I could think about when watching this movie is how the Native Americans must have felt when the white man came to town. The idea that everything is connected touched home with me. The natives felt such a connection with every thing on their planet. It was so original to have the natives literally connect with the other species on the planet. I must admit that parts of it were predictable but it was so worth the ride.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually-stimulating! The best Cinema-going experience I have ever had,"Avatar is the new feat of film-making. I would never have though James Cameron would have been able to pull this off, especially after all the hype. It's safe to say he did. While the plot is similar to other films, and despite many reviews saying that it's screenplay does not hold up to the weight of everything else in the film, I disagree. It's true that the screenplay is simple, but I found that is was a lot better than Titanic's screenplay, which really turned me off. But like most said, the screenplay is the least important aspect in this film, in a good way. It sets off this whole new vision that Cameron wants to bring to us. He does magnificently. The creature designs, visuals, sound, colors, and depth that everything has in Pandora is amazing, and I have never been transported into another world like I have with Avatar. Seeing it in 3-D was spectacular, simply spellbinding, and unforgettable. Everyone in the theater was in complete amazement at everything in this film, and for that, James Cameron has succeeded very well. He is a great director, and I hope he gets nominated for the Oscar at the very least. Avatar is the new feat of visual entertainment. It is one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best action films ever made.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Deeper Abyss,"This blockbuster directed by James Cameron twelve years after ""Titanic"" is a perfect mixture of previous Cameron movies. Although it includes many classical factors of James Cameron movies which will seem familiar for you it still worth to be named the best motion picture of the 21 century so far.It discusses many issues we face today in our planet, contains several original thoughts in science fiction and tells an old story in a very fresh way.THE WARIt talked about human invasion in a new planet called Pandora in the future for some vital resources and the residents called Na'Vis have to fight with human for their own civilization. The conflict begins with this simple reason and deepens as some crazy people in army who holds strong violence in mind always find a solution of ""fighting terror with terror"". And this triggers another inside conflict in the human side when a group of researchers who studies behaviors of Na'Vis using Avatars found that this invasion will destroy this upper civilization. Is this a mirror of some of the issues we face globally?ENVIRONMENT AND TECHNOLOGYWe people are animals that are good at and are keen about transforming our nature. We are trying to learn the world by creating technologies and then use those technologies to convert the nature to what we want it to be but NOT what it should be. This is our civilization. Unlike ours, the civilization of the Na'Vis is more complied with their environment and eventually they have an upper level of evolution. Do we need to be more complied with the environment in our planet earth today?THE LOVEThis movie tells us a good and powerful love story. The brain and intellect connection of male and female will cross some boundaries which anyone will not neglect. Love is the source of the power.GET BACK TO THE CINEMAThe IMXA 3D, WOW, you should really try this. You will find it is pretty flat when you go to the 2D cinema after the 3D experience.If you watched most of James Cameron's movies before including ""The Abyss"", you will notice that this is a story after ""The Abyss"".It is a deeper abyss on Pandora.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Looks nice but that's it.,"I have just returned from seeing Avatar in 3D and although it is visually pleasing, it gives you an empty feeling. I am a big fan of James Cameron's work and as he has been working on this movie for many years, I was expecting something fantastic. If you consider the length of the movie, I would have thought that, by the end, we would care whether the main characters live or die. I did not.The visuals are state of the art and for the first hour, its an enjoyable watch. Once you get used to what you are seeing, you need some kind of story to keep you interested. There is no real story here that we have not seen before and those previous stories were told much better. For the quality and depth of the story, think Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.You have to feel slightly sorry for the actors as I think it would be a difficult task to imagine the end product of this film.It should probably be the Oscar for Visual Effects and possibly Best Editing but definitely nothing else. Its a sad fact that, these days, films sell just on Visual Effects but we do need some quality story lines Mr Cameron.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid Hit,"Well, I'm going to have to give this movie a full rating because it really lived up to my expectations.We have here a science-fiction epic set on an alien world. It's a classic story of a ""good-guy"" hero who must overcome a battle within himself to do what is right.Although the movie doesn't exactly have the biggest twists, turns, or surprises, it simply sets out to do what movies like ""Star Wars"" (the ones in the 70s, and 80s, that is) did... to stun us a little with the latest in special FX, give us a classic ""Romanesque"" story, and enchant us with a very creative world. This movie did what it set out to do, perfectly... and maybe even a little better than perfect.The world is so detailed, and rich. Every animal looks as if it is real... and everything just matches and seems convincing. The ""humanoid"" race that inhabits this world is very interesting, and the way the world works ""together"" is amazing. This may be one of the few sci-fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in favor of the storyline. Animals and beings do not look like animations. This realism, this pushing of the limits, is what science fiction is all about.But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no storyline or character to back it up. There is a lot of character in this movie. All of our human characters, the alien race, and the avatars all equally have great character. And the storyline, although nothing extraordinarily original, is chiseled from ""classic"" storytelling. Good versus evil... doing what is right... all spun neatly together.What a wonderful escape this was! It was dazzling, and even got me thinking a little about what life is really out there on the various billions of stars that make up our galaxy, and the other billions of galaxies out there.And that's what movies like this should do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A 2D viewing reveals a weak story,"Not blessed with two good eyes I can't see in 3D. I suspect that many of the glowing reviews this movie is generating would be more subdued if the 3D candy was missing. Sure, it still looked great in 2D but the weaknesses of the story were more revealing. The basic plot has been done before and done better(Dances with Wolves). The bad guy was completely one-dimensional. For me, a James Cameron fan, this was his least satisfying effort since The Abyss. It felt like I was watching something he scripted shortly after making Piranha 2. Dialogue has never been one of Cameron's strong points and he isn't going to generate an Oscar nomination for screenplay with lines like ""It's not over as long as I'm still breathing!""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Colourful Visuals . Black And White Storytelling,"I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised "" A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc "" . I'm one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering . On top of that I'm not someone who's going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses . It's bad enough being a speccy in real life . Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades ? In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at allIn April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I'd seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR . Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you're able to concentrate on the story . The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there's nothing happening at allFault number one - there's very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie . Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white . Good guys ( Read humans ) are blacker than the darkest night while good guys ( Read blue skinned aliens ) are so white they're brighter than the sun itself. It's almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies . I say "" almost "" because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will . There is no complexity involved what so ever . The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there's no motives involved . Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn't a 3D gimmick and had saving graces . Take away the 3D and you'll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool .

The Greatest Movie Ever Made....,"First of all I would like to place upon my sincere thanks towards Mr James Cameroon for taking his valuable five years of his life for making a movie no one except him could have ever imagined.. Being under pressure of humongous amount of money stake he carried the expectations with ease and expertise.. This is not just a movie.. Its a rich experience which may eventually blow of your mind.. All in a future high-tech metaphora, of enormous weaponry and spaceships and a primitive jungle world that's both weird but also so familiar...Hats off to James for his thinking and imagination..(He even created a language for the creatures living on the James-made-Planet).. For performance I would love to take two names: Sam Worthington and Michelle Rodriguez.. Both were superb in their roles.. Sam's simplicity initially will take you as a surprise and watch out for his performance during the fight sequence as a Na'vi.. He will surely walk away with loads of accolades.. Cinematography is pragmatic and enigmatic.. VFX and Graphics used are marvelous.. James' Direction is humongous superb and breath taking.. After allowing the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich to try and direct large action films he returns to show them how a master does it..My advice: ""Take out 3 hrs of time out of your lives(even if you are not a movie buff) to enjoy an experience nobody ever imagined.. Just buy a tub of popcorn and a soft drink and enjoy""My Rating: 9.5/10Thanks & Regards",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's out of this world!,"James Cameron's sci-fi epic finally arrives having gestated in the filmmakers mind for longer than a decade. Is his vision of the future just as fresh in 2009 or is should this avatar be terminated? There's one thing you have to give Cameron, he is like the postman...he delivers; granted sometimes he may be a little late but if there 's one filmmaker you can always rely on its Cameron. I haven't disliked a Cameron movie to date, in fact I've loved, almost, everything he's done; with the exception of course being Piranha II but let's not get into that. Avatar is a razor-sharp reminder of how epic film-making is done. Not since Return of The King has epic been done on a scale this big.A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3-D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron.The story ticks all the right boxes, at least for a Cameron film. It's got good guys with guns, bad guys with even bigger guns and appalling guys with even bigger guns. It's far from original and won't come up at this week's book club. This said it's very engaging and the people, and aliens, involved are interesting. The film goes to great length in order to develop its characters so we feel the hardship and pain when they fall in battle. The film does an excellent job of keeping a good pace. Its near impossible to get bored whilst watching the film and this may have been the quietest i have ever seen an audience. It's an engaging trek through uncharted lands that, while feeling very familiar, is a brand new assault on the senses.James Cameron has spent a long time in incubation, flitting around on submarines, but if ""Avatar is a reminder of anything it's a reminder that he's the best the industries got. His harsh, no-nonsense approach to film-making has landed him with one of the most polished pieces of art of the century and for that I take my hat off to you. This may be the most polished movie of the decade, sweeping, epic and ... dare I say flawless? Not quite. As far as the direction goes however, it's close enough and ranks, for me, as Cameron's second best film to date, behind ""Aliens"". IN the hands of any other director this could have gone terribly wrong; anybody other than Cameron may have played it safe delivering a spectacle, but an underwhelming one. Cameron pushes so many boundaries with one single film that it's hard not to stand up and cheer once the final credits roll. This film has pushed the limitation of the cinema medium and emerged as one of the finest film of the decade. And dare I say a classic? The acting is exceptional. Nothing warms my heart more than seeing Weaver and Cameron united for the first time since she stood toe to toe with the alien queen. She is astounding and gives an electrifying performance as Dr. Grace Augustine a woman split between two worlds. What's funny is the fact that she is not the strongest actor in the film. If anybody deserves a standing ovation is has to be Zoe Saldana who completely transforms into this other worldly thing. If you had gone into the movie not knowing that that was her you would never had guessed she was even human. She is unrecognisable and exhilarating as Neytiri who is, without a doubt, the standout role of the film. Other congratulations must be given to Sam Worthington who shows us that Terminator Salvation was not just beginners luck. Michelle Rodriguez gives a stellar turn as Trudy Chacon and ends up the way Rodriguez usually ends up. That however would be too much information.Now for the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance the reason you've already booked your ticket, the reason you're so sceptical, the reason the hype for this film is so large. The presentation. To call it out of this world would be an understatement. It's stunning. Sun all those pre conceived judgement and see for yourself. The sheer scope of the film is impeccable. This film will have you clambering through the jungle on horseback, soaring on the back of a banshee and just when you've taken in the sights and sounds Pandora has to offer you've bee blinded be the beautiful destruction on the final act. Any filmmaker that can make such destruction rather beautiful is a mastermind in my opinion.Verdict: Avatar is far more than a movie, it's a cinematic experience. This is a visually assault on the senses and something that is destined to change cinema forever. It's utterly gorgeous; all backed up with scene stealing acting, fantastic direction and, wait for it, the mother of all battle scenes. Believe the hype; Cameron has delivered one of the best films of the decade and something that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. I'll be waiting in anticipation for the sequel; just don't be too long will you?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolutely breathtaking and an amazing surprise overall,"Of course I had heard the hype over Avatar for a long time, but just refused to believe it for many reasons. It seemed very overrated at first glance, as it probably did to most, and I really didn't care to see if for awhile. Now, I am so glad that I gave it a chance, because Avatar turned out to be a visually beautiful, incredibly written and wonderfully executed work of art that indeed is my favorite movie of 2009 and one of the best movies I've ever seen, and that's without me viewing it in 3D!First of all, yes, it does seem overrated at first glance. Even when the film started my thoughts were that it had pretty bad dialogue and that it was going to be incredibly crappy and a complete waste of my time. I changed that thought within the first twenty or twenty-five minutes of the movie. It begins to get so interesting and the characters start making an unbelievable impact on you and you really start to care for them and the story, within the first twenty or twenty-five minutes, I don't lie. It starts becoming more and more entertaining until you are completely mesmerized and astonished by how wonderful it truly is and how entranced you are in the film and how alluring it is to all your senses.The movie is amazingly brilliant and even though it was long, I was taking in every second with the utmost delight because James Cameron makes it so enjoyable to watch and has a direction that creates the most pleasurable and sensational atmosphere, as he's done with every movie I've seen by him. The actors and actresses capture their characters superbly as well and make them really believable and likable down to the very core. Sure, the movie didn't bring that much new material, but the way they handled it so delicately is what really pays off and makes the viewer tantalize every aspect.I thought the suspense, romance, action and all other genre mixes were balanced perfectly, and though the plot was paper thin, it was strong because of how amazingly beautiful the visuals were and how powerfully the actors and actresses make their characters, and how well the CGI makes it seem like you are actually on the planet Pandora and living every second of the film. Simply fantastic, I must say!Well, people who think it is still overrated after seeing it have probably disagreed with this by now, but if you are a fan of Avatar and appreciated it for the astonishingly magnificent piece of work that it is, I am right there with you. It was exciting and riveting to the bone with CGI and lush, picturesque scenes that are to die for. The plot was well done because of how wonderful every one that worked on the film makes it be and the movie was entertaining as hell. I am proud to say I enjoyed it highly and that James Cameron deserves all the money he received for this marvelous movie. After it was off, I wish it would've never ended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just OK,"I went into this movie not knowing what to think. A lot of people I knew told me how good it was but I also heard many say that it did not live up to the hype. After watching this movie I have to say I'm not disappointed but I don't think it deserves all the praise it is getting. Some of my complaints are how weak the story is, to me it seems the James Cameron just copied the ideas of all the big sci-fi movies of the past 10 years and combined them together. Also the story was very predictable, I knew what was going to happen almost from the very beginning and nothing surprised me. While their were some good things about it like the visuals and special effects that does not make a movie and the visual did not make the movie any better. But like I said it was not a complete disappointment. It did have some good action sequences and some decent dialogue even though most of the rest of the dialogue was crap. So overall it was just an average action movie and I don't see how this could be nominated for awards over so much better sci-fi movies out this year like District 9, Moon, and Star Trek. Which I think are all better movies then this and would pick any one of their directors to be nominated for a directors guild award over James Cameron",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Splendid!!! A remarkable achievement in the world of cinema!!!,"Avatar makes the best out of CGI in this live-action, emotional, putting you on the edge of your seat film of extraordinary proportions.Just like James Cameron has done in the past he has brought something new to cinema. He has directed some of the most influential and amazing films of the last twenty years some examples being The Terminator and Titanic. Avatar has now come to take it's place in such high rankings.Watching Avatar is like being on a roller-coaster ride that you just do not want to get off of. When you see it you'll know what I'm talking about. With all of the action, sorrow, romance, and the fight to just be there is absolutely no way that you can't enjoy this movie.Avatar tells the story about a man named Jake that lost his legs while on duty in the military. Now he travels to the world Pandora on a mission that could help him get his legs back. He is on a mining world where what they are digging up is worth a lot of money. However, the natives of Pandora are called the Na'vi and their home is on the site of where they're trying to mine and that is where Jake comes in. His mission was to get them to relocate but in time that starts to change. He uses an avatar (a body that looks like him and Na'vi as well) he uses this body to communicate with the Navi. While he is under their care he falls for the princess of the Na'vi. As he feels more at home with them the sooner he realizes that he must make a choice to side with the humans or the Na'vi and find his true place in life.Avatar is probably the most amazing film of not just the year but the decade. This is a film that you would love to see over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Smurf-ahontas meets Fern Gully,"Visually amazing. Spectacular. Awesome. Fantastic. By far one of the best looking films I have seen in ages.Plot/Story/Acting/Theme - absolutely atrocious. Bloody awful.The plot is an awful mix of The Smurfs, Pocahontas and Fern Gully. It really should be called 'Smurfahontas Gully' instead of 'Avatar'. I have also heard it described as a film about 'Magical Negroes'(for brief summary or the 'Magical Negroes' argument, see BBC article 'Is blue the new black?').It was just the same with Titanic. Visually amazing and outstanding at the time but the plot and character lacked substantially and were often cringe-worthy.I would recommend seeing it for the visual effects but little else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I didn't have any expectations... And I was BLOWN AWAY!!!,"I'll make this short and sweet... (Though if I could, I would write a BOOK about how much I loved this movie! I am too sick to do so, so it will have to do with a short review!) I was so incredibly TOUCHED by this movie! It was SO beautiful on so many levels, so realistic, so incredibly huge, over the top, and utterly mind-blowing in all aspects!! I saw the 3D version and just sat there in awe, even all through the ending credits... I could NOT close my mouth! My jaw was all the way down there, right there, on the floor of the movie theater.Dear James Cameron: I want to LIVE on Pandora. To me, it was, and still is, very much real! The characters were so real and GOOD that I like them better than most people I've met! Sigh... Two lives.. What an idea.. I wish I could wake up as a Na'vi one day! Avatar made me cry several times though the movie. I am a 31 year old male, FYI. The first that I cried when watching Avatar was when I realized how beautiful Pandora was. Then again when I understood how good, innocent and pure the Na'vi were. Neytiri is probably the most beautiful personality I've ever seen anywhere, in movies and in real life, and I absolutely fell in love with her soul. I cried when I saw Neytiri and Jake Sully kiss. It was such a beautiful moment. Then I cried when I just understood how amazing this movie really is - The whole meaning of it. It was just... Too much!!! There was just so much LOVE in this movie! Mr. Cameron, you're a Genius! Best movie of the year, and probably the best movie I ever saw. . .Thomas in Norway",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar: The Matrix meets Braveheart set in Fern Gully; with traces of the Phantom Menace.,"A couple of years ago I found myself wondering what had ever happened to that once great director James Cameron? You know the one; he produced a string of hits, Titanic, T2, True Lies, Aliens. He had managed to circumvent the artistic divide somewhere between critical acclaim and box office success. Whatever happened to him?Basically, Avatar happened.It was an acorn of an idea that; like anything worth investing time in, has taken many many years to bring from infancy to adulthood. A real labour of love that has made a lot of recent waves in the media for setting new records for budget requirement and length of post production. All of this coupled with the kudos that goes with a James Cameron project, mean that the goalposts for success both critically and financially, were going to be set pretty high....As a film Avatar works fairly well, it sets it's building blocks on very firmly established sci-fi ideals and ensures at all times that no matter how imaginative the storytelling; the realm of reality that has been crafted is consistent and believable.There are a lot of nuances that would have you believe Avatar has scrounged strong plot moves and ideals from several other films and on the whole this has to be accepted. Avatar cannot be considered a wholly original or innovative sci-fi movie. In my mind I can set aside some of this 'borrowing' by clinging on to the fact that the first draft was apparently written a long time before some of its predecessors were ever conceived. This however does not excuse any of the stylistic elements which make Avatar look very much like an homage to The Matrix, The Phantom Menace and the Halo franchise.There is an amalgamated feel to Avatar which is all its own and if you can forget that you are seeing a fairly straight forward, unidirectional story unfold before your eyes; then I think there really is something in there for everyone.From pretty much the first scene it was fairly obvious what was going to happen to Jake Sully and how the character would develop within the realms of the story. However the was still enough drama, action, romance and political overture to keep me enthralled for the majority of the movie.there is a 30 minute segment in the middle of the picture which judged against the rest, could be considered a little dull. However even this section could never be considered lifeless or without heart, nor would make anyone turn the movie off or leave their seats. In truth this part of the narrative is almost unavoidable and within the realms of the characters provided is absolutely inevitable. There is a certain school of thought, that would lead me to believe this part of the story is deliberately slow burning to allow the magnanimous crescendo at the finale to be accentuated, however I have to temper that opinion by saying that it still won't be to everyone's liking.There is a message in Avatar that is obvious and makes no excuses for its self and to a large extent; no excuse is needed. The overtures it makes have been made for as long as mankind has been in existence and there are very few people in the world who would be blind the problems it attempts to highlight.The acting throughout the film is universally excellent. It is now obvious why Sam Worthington is such high demand after only a very short carrier thus far. Sigourney Weaver reignites her relationship with James Cameron demonstrating the vigour that came before. She acts as a good foil for Worthington throughout. The undoubted star of the show however, isn't actually an actor or actress but the CGI created 'Nytiri' voiced excellently by the increasingly impressive (and busy) Zoe Saldana. The effects department have obviously taken extreme care to ensure the complex delicacy of the character is obviously but subtly presented on screen (it's a real triumph).Whilst the story isn't pulling up any trees (sorry that's a pun) or filled to the brim with new ideas, the CGI team have mastered the images presented absolutely faultlessly. It really could be considered an evolutionary step forward in digital media and green screening. Through 120+ minutes of entertainment their expertise can never be questioned.So whilst there are overly corny moments that will have some audiences rolling their eyes and there are periods of sentiment and political overture that are laid on a little thick; these slight errors in judgement can be forgiven because the overall attainment level of the film far outweighs the slight glitches.A masterpiece of storytelling? No. But a memorable, enjoyable, inoffensive and likable motion picture? Yes, most certainly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Afterwards by the buss stop, we looked at each other, and in unison we knew and agreed, we had experienced something extraordinary at many different levels, an once in a lifetime moment. This is truly by far the movies of all movies. The only bad thing that I can say about this movie is I never wanted it to end, all from the jaw dropping scenery to the emotional computer graphics.

I feel like I became part of this world and now, at home, I kind of miss the scenery, the animals, the people and the nature of the planet.This movie is more groundbreaking than Jurassic Park, Star Wars and all the other historical movies that you've read about. Though the story and the plot is not very original, like a mixture of Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas and, well, The Matrix, it doesn't really matter. The movie is not about changing your perspective on anything, imprinting some morals or shaking your beliefs, it's just about entertainment.Thank you James Cameron.

Entertaining but nothing else,"I had higher expectations from this film, being a great fan of James Cameron's previous work, such as The Terminator and Aliens (his two best films, in my honest opinion), but this film simply disappointing. It is pretty much a vessel for testing special effects and is perhaps Cameron's worst film after Piranha 2, that's it, it is Cameron's worst proper film.The main problem of this film is simply that it is to dumb: it has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon and the characters lack any depth. So Cameron simply recycled the plot that was already used a hundred times before to test drive these new special effects. In essence, this film's only strength is its visual spectacle, which is amazing and that's why I gave it 6 points, otherwise it is just a boring dumb film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Must see - a landmark film that will hopefully set a trend...,"The first 10 rating I've given to a movie. Plot?

If you add action 10/10, CGI 13/10, imagination 13/10 I think it adds up to a perfect score.All I can say is that the CGI is so amazing in this movie that there were a LOT of FIRSTS for me:1. found myself just staring at random parts of the screen to notice the amazing attention to detail.2. found myself trying to figure out if some of the CGI were real camera shots blended in - it was so good it looked like a picture.3. found myself thinking - this is the first CGI dominated film in which the CGI scenes trump the live actor scenes. I was slightly disappointed when Jake would leave his avatar and return to real life.4. found myself not noticing an emotional difference between the real actors and the CGI characters. the movements, emotions, textures, and everything are superb! groundbreaking!5. found myself attracted to a completely CGI character - Neytiri (mm...mmmmm!)To me this film is a first - it shows that we can now take the full extent of ones imagination and put it on film.

Utter bilge!,"Yes this is 'Science Fiction', but the intended relationships with the elements of reality were so poor that they grated on my nerves throughout.Very clever CGI. Lovely colours. Sexy aliens. Characters absolutely unsympathetic. I couldn't develop any empathy at all with who they were or what they were doing. Any of them.The military staff were portrayed as the worst kind of gung-ho 'shoot-em- ups', full of prejudice against the natives of the land they have invaded so that they can steal the resources. The director couldn't have been less subtle in taking a swipe at Americans and America's foreign policies.

Spectacular !!!,"Quite simply the most astounding movie I've seen as a visual experience.I am in awe.I hope Cameron makes a billion dollars for this truly amazing piece of art!Forget the people who talk about the storyline, the plot, as if it somehow fails to live up to the rest of the movie. This is a great story!--- this is sci-fi on a very high level. Is the story less than novel?----what stories aren't rehashes and blendings of other story lines...? This is a morality tale with good and bad very clearly drawn. It is a disavowal of technology and the greed that drives profit and power, and an extraordinary affirmation of the organic world, the vegetative and animal forces that constitute life.Others will comment at greater length of Cameron's rejection of man's attempt to conquer the universe by technologically violent means-----this is not that different a view than the one that drove John Borman's tale of the Brazilian native people's lives being destroyed by the advancing bulldozers in ""The Emerald Forest""----but more than that it focuses on the incapacity of those blinded by greed who cannot empathize with the sufferings of those they are harming. Cameron again is not inventing anything new, but taking a very old human story to very powerful heights. George Carlin would have loved this movie. It attacks some people as shallow and mechanistic, cruel and barbaric, narcissistically destructive... after seeing war movies for years of humans killing one another I must agree with Cameron.At one point the Na'vi are called ""blue monkeys"" by the humans..... human hubris denigrating non-human lifeforms. At another point the idea that there would be sacred areas to the Na'vi is laughed at by the corporate mercenaries------as if spirituality is either non-existent or only a human trait. Yet in Cameron's world the profit-hungry humans have no concept of God or spirituality at all----they are as soulfully dead as the machines they climb into----while those who live sans technology are very strongly spiritual. They are the essence of spiritual beings fully in touch with the life streaming through and around them.Good v bad. Mechanical worldview v pantheism. Pro-life v anti-life. Cameron's movie isn't about inventing these themes, only the way he portrays them with amazing beauty and boldness.I cannot say enough about the grandiosity of this cinematic effort. It is not only groundbreaking, but the first major step into the next wave of visual entertainment. The glasses-aided 3-D is superb, entrancing. The blend of CGI and actors is as seamless as the sky . . . will this lead to 3-D in home cinema, in TV broadcasting? Cameron is marking a trail that others will undoubtedly carve more completely. Tomorrow is bright with promise.Thank you, James Cameron.

beautiful but a tad infantile and predictable story,"Unfortunately Cameron looks down to the public and offers us a story so full of clichÃ©s and of a simplified view of the world, people and the Universe in general, that it is truly condescending. Neither he nor the studio behind him respect their audience. And after they sunk a reported 400 or so million in the project who can blame them? They need to recoup at least most of this money, and they do it by trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. I think Jim Schembri from The Age sums it up very well: ""There's no argument that, as a showcase for the immersive potential of 3D visual effects technology, James Cameron's sci-fi epic Avatar is an unqualified triumph. But as a story designed to engage, enthral and entertain adult audiences for almost three hours, it is a disappointment strewn with weak characters, environmental platitudes and anti-progress clichÃ©s. A compulsive envelope-pusher, Cameron invented a pioneering camera system and ground-breaking visual processing techniques for the film, but perhaps he should have spent a little less time obsessing over the technology and a tad more developing the story beyond the compendium of clichÃ©s it regrettably is.""

"Mesmerizing, Don't forget to breathe","I've been waiting for Avatar for a really long time, During the long wait my expectations changes a lot, at first, I thought it would be a masterpiece on all levels, but then after the first trailer was released and all the negative attitude towards it, I became skeptical and thought maybe the long wait was for nothing, I am glad I was wrong, Avatar was truly groundbreaking and here is why:An enthralling environment is set up, with amazing attention to details, Some scenes are truly hypnotizing, Although the plot is not the most original and sort of predictable, it's still very interesting. Emotionally engaging, you care about the characters, I have never felt so much empathy towards aliens living on a distant planet, that is the genius of the movie to put you in the aliens' shoes even when they don't wear any shoes :) I don't really know what to say about the cinematography and CGI, It's bound for an Oscar, no words can describe it, you'd have to see it for yourself.

A true masterpiece!,"After Titanic in 1997, many wondered how James Cameron would ever try to top that spectacle. Well, its taken 12 years, but he most certainly has, and then some.The basic plot is certainly nothing that hasn't been done before, but so what, almost any movie has a plot that's a retread of another plot before it. But what really sets this movie apart from anything I've ever seen is the amazing visuals.Seen in 3-D, the astounding special effects seem even more visceral. The hanging mountains, the mysterious and abundant creatures (some truly nasty animals that were conjured up from imagination) and even the indigenous Na'Vi tribe... all marvels of CGI.The movie is almost 3 hours long, but it's so exciting and action-packed and a delight on the senses that it's never noticeable. The acting was more than adequate, with Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldanha and Stephen Lang probably the standouts.The final battle scene is exciting and a sight to behold.

Remarkable experience,"James Cameron is capable of making films that are both visually stunning and emotionally convincing; ""Avatar"" is no exception. However, this film is different from many of his other films simply due to its large scale and influence. The film demonstrates one of the best world-building in films to this day. Every aspect of Pandora feels imaginative, exciting, and realistic. Amusing sights like floating mountains and small details such as the Na'vi language are all what make the world so elaborate and realistic. By working with experts of different fields, Cameron has created a breathing planet. And of course, the use of 3D adds to the immersive experience.The characters are also an interesting aspect. Even thought the third act is more action centered, the emotions are still there. The audience can feel the devastation the Na'vi feel during throughout the film. And its comments on colonialism is also remarkable. The characters are developed well and the ending is very emotional yet hopeful. This is truly one of the most influential modern movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not the game changer that is hyped up to be,"Avatar is the first movie I've watched in 3D. The hype is that it is made to be watched in 3D, and the 3D is not some afterthought tacked onto the movie like some other 3D movies. But being this is my first 3D experience, I'm unable compare Avatar's 3D to other movie's 3D, but from what I've seen, it gives a different experience, but not really essential. I have to admit that 3D does add something to the experience of watching the movie, but what it adds just isn't enough for it to be something that will change how people go watch a movie altogether.Apart from adding something, 3D also takes something away. If you're not used to wearing glasses, then wearing those 3D glasses while watching the movie isn't really ""comfortable"". You never really forget that you're wearing glasses. The feel of it on your face, and the glass itself gives you a feeling like you're watching a movie through a window. And wearing glasses also makes the movie darker than normal. Some dark scenes become just too dark to see what's happening.But the CG in Avatar really does push the boundaries of what has been done before. What they've really nailed is the facial expressions on virtual characters. That, they got it almost perfect. But as for the human/humanoid body movement, they've got most of it right, but some if it just isn't that good. But one GC element that they made ""their's"" bio-luminescence. Nobody has done it, and if they have it was never as good as what is seen here. The CG of mechanical things like vehicles isn't the best of what we've seen. Transformers 2 did a way better job of it than Avatar. And the vehicle and mech designs in the movie seems as if James Cameron is stuck in the 90s. They seem dated.In the end, what makes a movie isn't the CG, it's the story. And the story in Avatar isn't a very original story. It is about humans trying to exploit the riches of a foreign planet at the expense of the aliens living there. Sure James Cameron did a great job of fleshing out the environment of Pandora, the alien planet, but as to what takes place on the planet, he could've done better. The dialog is very simplistic, but it's not as Star Wars prequel bad. There's nothing ""edgy"" to the story. It's very straight forward ,feels like it's a story made for a kids movie. There isn't any plot twists that turn things upside down.So it has beautiful CG, but has a mediocre story. It still can be enjoyable if it has great action. But I'm sad to say that the action does not redeem the movie to enter the ""enjoyably fun"" category. The final battle is a big one, but I never really got into it. Maybe it's the 3D glasses, maybe it's just the direction, but it didn't work for me. What makes an action scene work is choreography and damage. As for the choreography, there isn't really much opportunity to implement cool choreography in the action scenes as most of the action is organism vs. machine. It's organism vs. orgasm is where choreography can shine. And as for damage, in their effort to keep the movie PG, there is very minimal blood splatter, and the vehicular damage wasn't very dramatic.So there it is. Avatar. A movie that wanted to change things, and change may very well come if enough studios jump on the bandwagon, but if seen as what it is, a movie, it's just mediocre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It will take your breath away . . .,"After seeing this movie Friday night, I don't see how anyone could walk out of the theater having watched this movie and not be impressed -- especially if it was seen in 3D. I saw this movie in Digital 3D and it was truly the most incredible cinematic experience I've ever had. I plan to re-watch it in IMAX 3D later on. What Cameron and his team created was more than a movie -- they created an experience, one that shouldn't be missed. If you miss out on this movie, you miss out on cinematic history. The world that Cameron and his team created is one you may never want to leave. I didn't feel the nearly 3 hour length of this experience -- to me, it breezed by. It's unforgettable.Granted, its familiar story has been told numerous times, but Avatar succeeds in making it feel fresh with new ideas and absolutely gorgeous beauty. The familiar story doesn't diminish the experience in any way. It's chalk-full of memorable moments and the final battle alone is worth the price of admission.See it. Really.

Amazing! Must-see movie!,"Today I saw the beginning of a new era â I had the opportunity to be one of the first to see Avatar. I tell you! It is amazing!!! It is a must-see movie. Every one should experience it at least once. I can honestly call it my movie of the year. It might be even more than that â the movie of a decade. I had been waiting to see it, and for once my expectations were rewarded.It is a breath-taking almost three hour ride in the world you could not imagine existed. After the movie my colleagues were saying that they didn't want it to end. I felt the same. I didn't want to leave this dangerous yet amazingly beautiful place where everything is so bright and colorful, and exciting. It is amazing that there are people with imagination powerful and creative enough to bring such an experience for the rest of us.There were several people at the screening who originally were not interested in sci-fi or this movie in particular. They all liked it very much though. I believe it is due to the storyline. The story may not be the most original one, but it is that which moves all people at all times. It is a tale of love and fighting for a cause. It is a tale of a charismatic hero finding his true identity and place in the world. It is a tale where good triumphs over bad. This is what attracts people at all times. No more, no less. Just as important is the fact that the story is well told. You won't miss any details. Everything is explained well and to the point. There are no long overwhelming scenes. The story just moves fluidly forward and takes you on a magical ride.I must make a remark regarding the much-discussed technological achievements. CGI is incredible! You can't tell where the real thing ends and the CGI begins. Well, you can, but just because you know that it doesn't exist on our planet. It is so believable and therefore so fascinating. I despise those that claim that all of it looks just like a very expensive computer game. NO! It does not! Go see it! See it in 3D if possible. I feel that this new technology offers some great possibilities. It has been said that a new era in cinematography begins with Avatar. It so does and I cannot wait to see what it has to offer. So, I invite everyone to go and see this new world of Avatar. You won't be sorry!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mediocre movie with great special effects,"Saw it a couple weeks ago. I had high hopes for the movie, but it was't quite what I expected. All the great reviews and user comments and what did I get.... A mediocre movie with great special effects. The movie itself was predictable and I wasn't surprised even once during the movie. This was my first 3D-experience, so the first hours or so went to adjusting to 3D- image. It tells a lot about the movie, if you are more interested about the CGI than the movie itself. .I think this movie is highly overrated. The acting was OK, but nothing superb.This is not a bad movie, but I don't consider this to be one of the best movies of all time. Not even close.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, through and through","First, I'd like to say that you should be reading all these comments and reviews later, not before. Right now you should be seeing the movie, and you will not regret it, I promise. This isn't meant to be a review as such, instead it is a response to the very few people that mistakenly mark Avatar as having a clichÃ© and dense storyline.I think one of the main reasons why we feel Cameron should have done a better job with the storyline is that he wrote this like 10 years ago, am I not right? I guess he just figured he'd use the storyline from back then, but in the meantime, there's been dozens, maybe hundreds of movies all using a storyline much like this one, because after all, it's what sells movies. I still don't consider this storyline ""bad"" though, because while it may have been done and said many times, this is the best iteration of it I've ever seen, and I expect that had this movie come out in 2001, I wouldn't even notice; I'd just call it epic all around.Besides, you can't try to compare this movie to some super realistic one, everything in it is drawing you into something very different from the reality that we live in. The GI Joe-like badass Marine dudes, their toy-like hovercraft and mechs, the blue furries, the overthetop lines, the overdone emotions that nobody in real life would have, the glow in the dark plants, the 6 legged creatures, the 3D..... All of these elements have been done over and over, but where this differs is that Cameron combines them all into something that just works. The people that are nitpicking on them aren't really nitpicking on the Avatar movie, because everything here is done splendidly. They're unknowingly picking on all the movies that did these things, but badly, and ruined us of these things forever.There's nothing wrong with naming something ""unobtanium,"" or having a GI Joe for your nemesis character, or having a 10 foot tall super hot humanoid-with-a-tail character, or a Pocahontas storyline; it's just that when we see those, we jump on all the failures related to them, and then somehow we think it was Avatar's fault.Anyways, enough justification, just go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Plot, Visually Stunning!","I was not sure I would like this film. I really did not like Titanic, mainly because it's not my kind of film, so I wasn't sure if I'd like Avatar. I went to see it because people were saying that it had the better CGI than any other film, and it had five-star reviews all over the papers.I loved it! The film was action packed from start to finish! I do admit that only the very smart will get the plot at first, but everyone will have it by at least the middle. I hardly even noticed that the film was almost three hours!The planet Pandora is visually stunning. The plants are incredible, they light up, they move, some near the beginning even shrink! The Nawis, the natives to Pandora, are very life-like, I never even knew that they were computer generated!The action scenes (not giving any spoilers) are just fantastic! Everything is so realistic, the planes are realistic, the floating mountains are realistic, and the sound literally blows you away.The actors are very good, especially Sigourney Weaver. But if you have a young child, do not allow them to watch this. There is a minor bit of swearing, tons of blood violence and very loud sound. Overall, the film is just fantastic! You have to see this movie, as it is by far the most stunning film of the decade!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Amazing entertainment, not much more","Avatar is the best really big blockbuster since LOTR: The Return of the King, also smashing that movie at the box office. It's an amazing film as long as you don't take it too seriously and consider the quality and originality of the story.Cameron has tried to make an epic that also delivers a message to the audience. One problem is that the story is so weak and unoriginal. Also the message is so easily discernible, it could just as well be written in plain text at the start of the film... Thus it loses much power.Avatar works much better for you if you turn your brain off. Then you can let yourself be amazed by the incredible visuals, both people and landscapes look stunningly good and lifelike. I can promise with all my heart that you've never seen anything like it! And please watch it in 3D! This movie is made for 3D, and it really shows how 3D can make a movie into an experience you'll remember for a long time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I loved this film when it first came out and I am looking forward to the sequels of which the first one will arrive in the UK at the end of 2022. What a remarkable imagination James Cameron has. Be in no doubt, this is a top class movie which deserves to be in the highest class of science fiction films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated,"I happen to be a huge fan of Cameron but I saw this with a few friends recently and found myself feeling guilty for having convinced them to go with me. Visually, it was a fantastic film but that's all it had to earn any fanatic response. The story itself I found boring, repetitive, and completely unoriginal. I even found the acting to be quit weak. I don't think Sam Worthington did a fantastic job with the character but I doubt he was casted with any great expectation of great delivery as was the same for Arnold in Terminator.I think the worst part of it all is that the studios are transferring every movie into 3D just because of the outstanding worldwide grosses for Avatar. But they're being lazy with it as well because so far they're just rushing into the process and not even shooting these movies in 3D. Instead, they're reformatting movies in 3D as was done with Clash Of The Titans which was horrible (another poor performance by Worthington) and The Last Airbender. This whole thing is turning out to be one huge glut fest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolutely incredible,"I was lucky enough to get tickets to see this in 3D yesterday - and boy, am I glad I did. AVATAR was...simply amazing. I can't think of a word good enough to give it the credit it deserves.What I thought was extraordinarily brilliant about this film was the way it made me genuinely dislike the race of human beings. The humans assume they know better, assume they are superior, and ultimately play the part of well, human beings, exactly right.There are scenes within AVATAR that depict a destruction of a beautiful world, and I literally had to hold my hand to my mouth for some of them in horror. In fact, a number of times I surfaced from my stupor and found my mouth gaping, along with my sister and all the rows of people next to me. The CGI effects of some of these scenes were incredibly well done, which meant that the scenes of destruction were especially shocking to the eyes.Indeed, I even found myself approaching tears a number of times throughout, which felt strange because I'm usually very hardy. However, the experience was so vivid and so intense that I just couldn't help but get completely sucked into the fictional world of Pandora. Even the Na'vi themselves - these huge, blue, glowing humanoids - the more I watched them, the less alien they seemed and the more...'human' they became. The transition the film takes to turn your opinion is just amazing. Rooting for the Na'Vi? You bet.""There's no green there. They killed their Mother..."" For those who are a fan of nature, of films like Fern Gully, this is for you. Just because AVATAR is of the fantasy genre, it doesn't mean it doesn't involve a very real, very relatable message for us all to pay attention to.This isn't just a film, this is an experience. You just have to see it. Beautiful, breathtaking, and nothing like you've seen before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Mona Lisa of film,"I just saw Avatar earlier this night and though I am still drunk off of its glory, my opinion of this movie will not change when I sober up. Also, it should be noted the theater I went to attempted to butcher my experience with the screen glitching half way through the movie and then about a minute of a blank screen and silence following- and yet still it could not kill the buzz that is Avatar.I went into the movie with great expectations and not surprisingly, it surpassed them. This movie is more than just watching a film, it is an experience. Avatar has it all: action, suspense, love, comedy, beauty, and digital 3d. I thought the plot was great, the acting great, and obviously the cgi is borderline unholy. The film also has some great messages weaved throughout the story, reflecting many different issues past and present.As much as I love watching and talking about movies, I have yet been this compelled to comment/review a movie on IMDb- I literally just registered to type this drivel.This movie took a fat budget to be created but by definition you can't put a price on a piece of priceless art.Bottom line...this is a must see and a must see in the movie theater in 3d.3/28/10 edit: Not so great. Still great, just not an emphatic great. I drop my rating by one star for a 9 out of 10.

James Cameron: thanks for the chance to witness a turning point in cinematic history.,"How often do you get to see a turning point in cinematic history? Not in hindsight, but as it is actually happening? Not often. Those watching The Jazz Singer in 1927 (debut of audible dialogue) or Becky Sharp in 1935 (introduction of Technicolor) experienced it. I wasn't born for another eight years, but I have read and heard that when Star Wars first came out in 1977 people were feeling a similar way; that they were witnessing something never before seen that would change movies from that point on. Has it really been 32 years between motion pictures that have had this impact? Well, revolutionary movies wouldn't be revolutionary if they came along all the time.James Cameron's long-awaited, much-touted 3D motion-capture technique is a step towards the future. What we see on screen during Avatar is nearly impossible to explain with words. But I'll try. Do you think 3D is just a gimmick? Think again. The depth and clarity afforded by the third dimension is invaluable; it immerses you into the action so well that you aren't sitting in a cinema for three hours, you enter a whole new world. Forget the blurry patches to the sides of the screen or the impossibility of seeing things that are moving too fast, as experienced in previous 3D flicks, with Avatar you see everything as if it were real.The digital surroundings that Cameron has created (so he could shoot his actors with mo-cap in an environment that already existed) are awe-inspiring. Pandora is a beautiful forest and jungle-like land, whilst its non-Na'vi inhabitants are exotic and exhilarating in equal parts. The realism of this fantasy world is extraordinary; from the opening shot to the closing credits, Pandora and all its creatures do exist. In addition, and most importantly, the motion-capture technique used for the Na'vi is astounding. Cameron's groundbreaking technology enables the Na'vi to look, move and interact realistically; the smallest of nuances from the actors, including pupil movement, have been mimicked flawlessly onto their digital counterparts.The aforementioned visual revelations are unsurprisingly marvellous during the action sequences â the climactic battle is undoubtedly the standout â however they lend themselves to the subtler scenes just as well. Cameron refuses to use his pioneering invention just for spectacle; he wants it to assist in capturing the minds and hearts of his audience. Take for example a couple of the scenes where the Na'vi fly on their local birdlife. To experience something so graceful and elegant, yet so thrilling and jaw-dropping, is where the real pleasure lies.Most gratifying is not all the optical splendour on offer mind you, it is the powerful tale that it is in aid of. Cameron's account of love, war and nature is more affecting than you might expect. Avatar boasts a screenplay which at times will make you laugh, at times make you cheer and at times make your heart heavy. It never neglects the story and even infuses the action with a surprisingly high level of emotion. A pivotal scene midway through where the humans launch their first attack is genuinely gut-wrenching and shattering; evoking similar feelings you get when watching the atrocities committed in wars gone by. Cameron is greatly assisted by James Horner's booming score too; it's African-esquire sounds giving it an exotic and poignant feel that match the proceedings perfectly.Hollywood's new kid on the block, Aussie actor Sam Worthington, delivers a star-making performance as the conflicted Jake that, along with his turns in Terminator Salvation and the upcoming Clash of the Titans, will surely see him catapult to the top of the A-list. The unrecognisable Zoe Saldana is breathtaking as Neytiri; Sigourney Weaver adds her usual class and elegance as the 'mother' of the Avatar program, Dr Augustine; Michelle Rodriguez gives a career-best performance as the cocky yet likable pilot Trudy Chacon; whilst Stephen Lang makes one heck of a badass.James Cameron: thanks for giving this 24 y.o. his first chance to witness a turning point in cinematic history.

"Ridiculous... Plus, A Full Out Slap At America's Military","Surrogates meets Apocalypto; Ewoks meets the Keebler ElvesÂ this is a visually stunning movie that's far more ridiculous than it is interesting. I saw it in 2D and I think the format will have a lot to do with one's enjoyment of the film. The entire first two acts are geared only to show off the visuals. The story itself boarders on the offensive but is poorly written in any case. Plot points involving a stereotypical military as the evil arm of corrupt corporations that want to harm innocents as well as ""great mother"" hippie babble surrounding tree energy reduce this film to epically absurd levels. The last film that gave tree energy this much focus was The Happening. Need I say more? It also wouldn't be much of a stretch to call this a 200 million dollar potential Al Qaeda propaganda film. The evil military use terms associated with the current Iraq/Afghan conflicts. Drawing parallels to American military action is a cheap shot by Cameron. Untrue, but his intent is clear even if he thinks it's veiled and clever. Ignorant politics aside, the third act does save this movie. The action as the CG natives take on the oppressive military is outstanding. I still think the CG movements are off in terms of realism but the action was impressive. Overall, I'm sure seeing the first two-thirds of the movie in 3D would've been better but as a film, it was almost painfully bad to sit through the presentation of glowing bugs, scenery and creatures in repetitive 2D.A VERY overrated film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Stunning and History making achievement!!,"I sat for 3 hours this afternoon slack jawed, mesmerized and awed to have the privilege to experience this Masterwork. At times I completely forgot about the special effects and felt that I was actually visiting another, incredibly breathtaking world. But no more beautiful than the Earth: the Garden of Eden she used to be. James Cameron has brought the art of visual storytelling and it's audience to a whole new dimension.To those who feel the story has been ""done before,"" and/or the plot is too simple: You must understand that this is a morality play. Right is right and wrong is wrong. Many movies have used similar archetypal themes. They're universal. Just read ""The Power of Myth,"" by Joseph Campbell. Each story tells the Hero myth in a different way, but with the same theme. And of course the analogy to Native Americans is inescapable, but the technique in which it is conveyed is unique unto itself.The actors: from the Zoe Saldana's blue skinned, nine foot Goddess Neytiri, to Sam Worthington's heartbreakingly paraplegic Marine. The ever radiant Sigourney Weaver and every character in between are absolutely excellent and have totally immersed themselves in their roles. But the star of the show is the moon of Pandora itself. It's most incredibly beautiful place that it almost defies description. The sweeping score along with the amazing imagery just underscores the epic grandeur of this film. But in the end this is a message movie. The message, the warning and symbolism are clear: The Na'vi are our ancestors before we became ""civilized."" At the core of this film is a childlike heart of innocence and wide-eyed optimism that maybe it isn't too late for us if we can manage to wrest the stewardship of our own planet from the Corporate/Military Industrial Complex. Nothing is more precious than our home. I feel humbled, uplifted, and yet ashamed of my apathy.This movie is more than a movie on so many levels: It is an experience, a true event. I can't wait to see it in an IMAX theatre, that is when it isn't sold out. I have never been so touched by any film as I have been touched by this one. I'm so grateful to have been introduced to this new 3D film technology with this exquisite, incredibly crafted and beautiful Masterpiece from the film God: James Cameron. I've already seen it again in 3D and it was even better the next time. I'm sure I'm going to be going again and again. To say that I am pleasantly astounded is an understatement! The last time I got this excited for the future of film making was ""Star Wars"" and the LOTR's trilogy. But be warned: It's hard to watch another movie after this one. Nothing else compares. It is in a league by itself. I wish there were more than 10 stars for this vote. It's off the charts, like a rare diamond, it is priceless. Tonight I looked at the Earth around me with a newfound wonder and reverence. This is truly a landmark film and an astounding achievement!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar: meh...,"Really, with all the hype going on about Avatar and its immensely rising status as 'greatest piece of cinema' and 'best selling piece of... anything', I just had to see what the fuss was about. And for the life of me, I don't see it.First off: to praise a movie JUST for its 'graphics' is bullcrap to me. Flash makes a movie easier to watch and makes it easier to believe what's being displayed on screen, but that doesn't make any of the plot, the writing or the acting better. With that said I will admit that most of Avatar does look good, except for some animals and other details. But what does that matter? It could've been 2D for all I cared. I've seen a lot of anime and I'm always more impressed with amazing 2D animation than CGI (maybe that also has to do with me being an avid gamer, meaning 'stunning 3D visuals' are daily matter for me). So yeah, it looks neat most of the time.But when you get down to the bare essentials, there's just not a whole lot to look at. I simply sat in my chair watching, waiting for something to take me by surprise or... something. All the characters are stereotypical, the dialogue never is interesting or creative and the plot is pretty much Pocahontas/Dances with Wolves or what have you. Never was I clueless to what was going to happen, and never did I care. Why would I? The characters were like eighties cartoon characters; good guys are naive and get themselves in stupid situations, bad guys are EVILLLLLÂ² because being evil is where it's at! When I was watching GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra, I was expecting this, but not with Avatar, currently #51 of the top 250 of IMDb. My god, how embarrassed I was at the shallowness of James Cameron's writing.When a movie tries to convey a message and tries to connect with its viewers on an intellectual level, it should not at the same time underestimate that very same audience. And the message is laid on so thick that it doesn't hit home, it just bumped me in the forehead while it was trying to force its way down my throat. So here you have a story with unbelievably stereotypical characters who have to play their part in an epic about imperialism and self-discovery, but you just don't care. Also, the message is mostly one-sided and there is no sign of any relativity whatsoever. So any opportunity to add some depth was left untouched, sadly, which makes Avatar a lot like a kid's novel with a moral at the end of the story. It leaves nothing to think about and it presents its points in a, dare I say, pubescent fashion.All that aside: Avatar is a blast to watch if you can turn your brain off and just look at the purty pictures. With all the predictable build- up, mindless action and other 'never really intense' moments, you can simply sit back and enjoy the ride. But when you look at its intent, I say 'meh, I've seen better'. I just couldn't connect with anything portrayed on screen, and why so many others could, I will never understand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic movie!,"I went into the theater not knowing what to expect on this one. I didn't have high expectations in the slightest. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG! This movie took number 1 on my movie list by leaps and bounds. From the plot, character development, CGI effects, everything! This movie is legit and I would gladly go see it again if opportunity arose! The best part i think was the character development and the high amount of emotion in this film. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but i definitely suggest to go see this movie--now. The language isn't perfect, but it's cleaner than most movies nowadays and it flows into the movie very nicely and is kind-of a must have in the areas it is placed. Definitely 10 stars and more if I could give them. Props on this one! Fantastic movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Movie of the Decade,"Every so often a movie captures your heart and mind; Avatar does just that. The twelve year wait for Cameron's fantasy feature was well worth it in every sense of the word. I saw the movie at midnight and as soon as the credits popped up at the end of the movie I immediately wanted to watch it again. Words cannot describe the beauty of this movie, both in scenery and story. Whether or not you enjoy watching fantasy movies, you must go see it. Hopefully Cameron is already preparing to make a sequel.

Is this the Star Wars of our decade?,"I want to say for one, that this movie was EXTRAORDINARY!

Some will beg to differ, but the real star is the 3-D. Yes, the 3-D! Wow, It has as of today changed the way will see our entertainment and how we view it.

Imagination is limitless.........,"Make no mistake that this is something you have never seen before. I find it hard to call a film because it was so much more. The immersing nature of the visual aspects of the film are breathtaking. Your mouth will remain open for large sections of this movie.I was there for all the big step ups in film making technique. Terminator 2, Titanic, Lord of The Rings and the new Strawars. All of them did that job, astounding work for their times and amazing achievements. But, I never left the cinema after them the way I did from Avatar. You truly feel you have just witnessed something special, something defining, something of our time. A culmination of years of film making to get to this movie. As far as this movie looks, it is simply perfect.The story is captivating and the characters engaging. It's a tale told many times before, but almost everything is just a variation of older work. But there is so much more depth to this story and a single viewing is unlikely to reveal them all.I don't know if the movie will be the same when I finally own the DVD and play it on my HD. Can that cinema experience transcend to TV screens? Time will tell.If you are waiting for DVD, you'll be missing out on something spectacular. If you can get to an I-Max, or see it in 3D you should try, but at the very least go see it on the big screen. You'll be so glad you did",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better watch District 9 ten times,I found the movie was very boring to watch for the second time and pretty much slept in the cinema hall and the other reason why I am just giving a 7 for a movie so well received by the audiences would be seeing the movie District 9 for the 5th time after watching this movie and not getting the bored at all.James Cameron really needs to take inspiration from Neill Blomkamp(Director of District 9) to how to make movies economically after all it is the the time of recession. District 9 is pretty much the same story except that it takes place on earth and made at a budget of just 30 million and James Cameron spends 10 times more developing new technology and cameras to make this movie.Well I can go on all day like this but the final verdict is that Avatar can be watched once that to for it visual effects and the movie could have been better if it was a bit more short.PS I did'nt watch the movie in 3D this is a 2D review,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Divine,"First of all, I'm writing this mainly to thank all the people behind this motion picture. Especially the art department. You guys have made something that has touched people's minds and will be remembered as a milestone in cinema history for ever. I don't know if any of you will ever read this entry but, I hope you do. So I thank each of you for your effort and divine like skills. A special thank you goes to James Cameron. Thank you for this wonderful movie. You have immortalized your self with this picture and will be remembered like a pyramid in the history of motion picture by many.I don't want to spoil anything in this movie. I can only say that I fell in love with a CG character (Neytiri) for the first time. It's odd, but true. I have never seen a CG characters out preform real ones :D. They were so well done that sometimes during the viewing, I refused to think that they were CG characters. I know that the voices of the actors played a big role, but without the magic of the 3D artists and animators, none of it would have been possible.This movie will melt the heart of the most ""stiff"" and ""hard-to-please"" movie critics. If you love sci-fi, then it will totally blow your mind away.I don't care if there will be a sequel to this movie or not. But I care, and hope that James Cameron won't sell this franchise like he did with Aliens. That would lead to disaster. How you would feel if someone like ""Paul W.S. Anderson"" came along and took a big dump on it? Just the thought of it makes me shiver.Oh well, I could go on for ever, or even write a book of the feelings I got for this movie. Plain and short this is how me and my friend felt/thought when we walked out of the theater with a tingling sensation....""we're not worthy"", ""wow"", ""James Cameron is GOD"", ""Why am I feeling this way"", ""how is this possible"", ""how can I possibly feel love for a CG character"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Breathtaking effects and action sequences; so-so story,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Watched it at IMAX and was blown away by the amazing audio and visual effects. The action sequences and camera work were among the best I've ever seen. I have little doubt this'll run away with just about all awards. The other contenders might as well stay home.That said, I found the storyline to be somewhat unoriginal (namely at least a couple of Japanese animated movies) and predictable. I also found that despite the length of the film, a lot of important details seem to be missing, such as the exact motivation for invading the planet (what exactly makes Unobtainium so valuable, anyway?).I also did not care for Sam Worthington as the lead character, particularly since his American accent leaves much to be desired, and I found his live-action acting to be a bit numb compared with the expressiveness of his Avatar.Worst of all, I found the ending to be somewhat abrupt compared with the amount of time spent on less important elements (oh, and did I say predictable?); practically begs for a sequel (which I wouldn't necessarily mind as long as it's written better and fills in more details).I gave it a 7 because it truly is ground-breaking cinema despite its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Money + Technology = Garbage,"With a budget like this you would think that, at the very least, basic elements of a decent film should not be lacking. Well written story, passable dialog, above par actors, etc...Well, welcome to Hollywood!!! Those things have been relegated to the past! No more worrying about where that clever plot twist will lead, or that enigmatic character, or those subtle hints and tics in the dialog that aren't in-your-face obvious. Avatar blazes a new trail to where Money and Technology apparently rut for days, then pop out a bouncing baby masterpiece!!! Rad! Where to begin?

If you want to travel to an exotic place... Welcome to Pandora...,"When I saw ""Avatar"" i simply waited long enough to get back to the every day reality to say anything about it. I just like to cool down instead of being carried away by the moment._____________________________________Now, after thinking about what I saw, I can simply say it's a whole new experience. Instead of saying the story is rather simple and not so deep as some would want it to be, i will actually say it's really deep though presented in a very accessible way. The audience has to deal with enough information while stepping in a new world to also deal with a story developed in a very complex literary way. Plus, the fiber of the plot depends not so much on an intellectual level as the sensitive area of perception. Which is probably a higher step into comprehension.Mr. Cameron takes the viewer into a world so perfectly shaped and crafted, that it's impossible not to feel you are actually wondering through that land. Specially if you can see the 3D version of the movie.Besides taking you in a tour through the flora of a wild and exotic place, he also takes you into an emotional ride, full of different reactions. You can deny it as much as you want to, but you will smile, laugh, get angry and full of anguish or sorrow and joy as much as the director intended you to feel and exactly when he wanted you to feel that. It's conducted by a true expert. It's simply as it had to beTalking about the visuals it's merely nonsense, cause there are no words to describe it as well as you can experience it with your own eyes. It's simply groundbreaking and breathtaking.""Avatar"" is setting the bar high on many levels and it's just the doorstep to what's coming next. In later years it's influence will be found in many works.In few words, my advice would be: don't let this one go. It's really the one you must see in a theater to feel surrounded by this incredibly real non-existing world.I only feel gratitude for having seen it.Anyone would.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Long, very long, but worth every penny","From the director of ""The Terminator"" and ""True Lies"" comes ""Avatar"". Not to be confused with the hit Nickolodeon program. Avatar takes us to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a newcomer from Earth embarks on an epic adventure, ultimately fighting to save the alien world he has learned to call home.We enter the alien world through the eyes of Jake Sully, a former Marine confined to a wheelchair. But despite his broken body, Jake is still a warrior at heart. He is recruited to travel light years to the human outpost on Pandora, where a corporate consortium is mining a rare mineral that is the key to solving Earth's energy crisis. Because Pandora's atmosphere is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human ""drivers"" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi.Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them. Soon he will face the ultimate test as he leads them in an epic battle that will decide the fate of an entire world. Avatar 10/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a dimension is still missing,"My impressions after having seen 'Avatar' are mixed.On one hand I am the kind of film viewer who does not run away from entering the film theater and expecting a greater-than-life experience. I also love computer effects and any special effects that extend the cinema experience. From this point of view James Cameron's film is one of the best that I have seen, maybe second only to Peter Jackson's last film in the Lord of the Rings series in creating a whole new world of fascinating beauty, in imagining shapes, colors and visual emotions that did not exist before.I also am a big science fiction fan, I love third degree encounters, and I let easily the small or tall, green or blue aliens move and frighten me. Yet, when judging a science fiction story or film I use the same criteria as when judging any other story or film - the capacity of entertaining, of creating emotion, and of making me think. Here I think 'Avatar' is no more than an average movie. Considered beyond the visuals it is no more than a quite banal action film, with stereotype characters (human or alien), with an anti-colonial message that is routine having seen it in scores of films from the Tarzan and John Wayne movies to the latest Iraq films, and with New Age incantations that never convinced me in any film ever.The 3D genre is not so new. I have actually seen a 3D film festival in a cinematheque a decade ago, and it was made up mainly by action and science fiction films of the 50s. The technology was amazingly similar based on the two colors plastic spectacles. I find it remarkable that film makers took this technique out of the dusty drawers and made it enhance the other new film effects invented since. Films will however be judged by most people by the emotions they generate. My feelings after seeing 'Avatar' are that I viewed a fine visual show, but that it was deprived of originality and depth. Despite the 3D visuals a dimension was still missing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just WOW!,"Just having watched the movie and its hard to come by the words to describe it. James Cameron has just set a new standard for a blockbuster. A standard which is highly unlikely to be competed with in the near future.From the moment it began to the very end was just mind blowing. Although it might take a while to get used to the 3D, the effects and the graphics were outstanding!It will be quite hard to step back down to movies we are used to seeing nowadays. It'll also be interesting to see if Cameron makes a sequel to this masterpiece. Was apparently initially intended to be a three part series...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
All eye candy and little else,"I had high expectations going into Avatar. Now I admit, it's probably stupid to go into any movie with expectations that are too high, lest they be crushed. However, even without high expectations, Avatar impresses only on a technical level, and on that level only. The story is very predictable, and as I watched this movie I was overcome with a feeling as if I had seen this all before in something in a made for TV movie on SyFy. This is pretty bad considering this is the same guy who made The Abyss and Terminator. I can only say that if you go see this movie, expect beautiful visuals... and a standard humdrum story that you've seen before if you follow any number of science fiction TV shows or just sci-fi in general. Oh, and if this is the 22nd century, why are they still using manually propelled wheelchairs?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dances with Na'vis, plus $211million, minus the depth.","If anyone tells you before seeing Avatar that they were expecting a well written epic, would you think he's retarded? Probably. Our little planet waits for this sci-fi spectacle for one reason--spectacular visual effects in 3D.I just saw it in 3D in a Bangkok cinema, and I got what I had expected before. So, it's worth the price for anyone paid to see it(As you can see I gave it an 8/10). The phenomenon created by the actual viewing is almost beyond the words. Walking onto Pandora, both the audiences and Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) were awed by a very believable alien world. This is no ""Final Fantasy"", and this is definitely not a Pixar movie, it's James Cameron's visual ambition realized with 230 million dollars. As we see the complete alien ecosystem on Pandora, the lively details of every character and creature on the screen, one can't help being dragged into the world created by Cameron's team. Many scenes felt so heartfelt and thoughtful that you almost want to be a naturalist yourself. But, one can also start to build up another dimension of expectation as the incredible first act is enough to promote a well-developed mythology.You might be asking why did I wrote such a negative title. Yes, you got the idea. After my expectation was inflated, the 2nd and last act only led to one dimension of story, which was already well told in $19million-budgeted Dances with Wolves. This isn't really bad, but a minor disappointment because this outrageous similarity can take the audiences back to their reasons and minds. While watching the 2nd act which involves some tragic situations, I couldn't help but noticing the Na'vis were actually native Americans in blue skins. The 3rd act only made me notice the lack of depth in the ""civilization clash"" theme.Still, this is not saying Avatar is not a good movie. On the contrast, this review means to help you stocking less on the story side and totally immerse into the movie's visuals and logics. Concerning logics, I am already decided not to call Avatar a Sci-fi because it's more alike Star Wars. But be warned this is not Star Wars because the scale of the movie ate everything else, including performances. Though, Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles was a strong candidate for this generation's Darth Vader. Enjoy being a Na'vi!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Top 10 all-time,This is my generations star wars! I walked out the movie theater and watched the lights come on and was completely in a daze! I cant believe that James Cameron pieced together such a great blockbuster that had heart and ground breaking VFX ...i cant wait for the sequels this winter but i had to revisit this classic and just remind myself of why i love movies. There is something about the way this movie grabs you and transfixes you into a new world! I haven't felt something that believable in ages and i now realize what it was like for the people in the 70's to see the large spaceship fly over the screen in outerspace ...i just wanted to come and review this in prep for the future sequels just well done...all around top 10.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great experience,"I have seen the movie in 3D last night and I am really really exited. This movie was fun to watch and I enjoyed nearly every minute (161 min). The storyline is not as bad as some people say. The visual effects are ground breaking and you will flow with the 3D effects, the colors, the atmosphere. When I left the theater, I was unable to put my opinion in words, it was just awesome. The last time I was blown away by a movie like this was 1999 with ""The matrix"". Just convince yourself and ignore the complaining critics. Watch it in 3D, otherwise you will miss a lot. In the times of huge flat screen TV's, cinema is back with an experience you can not copy at home. THIS is the right answer to illegal copies. The storyline is simple, but it works great. Just do not expect a deep philosophical statement and enjoy the experience. Definitely 10 out of 10. The best movie 2009 and a lot of entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Movie With Too Much Hate That Deserves More Appreciation,"Over the years James Cameron's, Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it groundbreaking and a masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn't kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav'i look incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes.I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though similar to others) is like nothing I've ever seen before.89%-A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Avatar - the disappointing Cameron film,"Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the most well-done CGI hand in hand with the most disappointed movie of the year - yes, put your hands together for Avatar.No, no - don't get me wrong. The movie's not bad. But the script is horribly weak! I don't know if this has anything to do with the fact that I was watching a dubbed version, but the dialogues were disappointing enough. Cameron has come up with the most convincing CGI production, but, I wonder why, he only relies on the CGI? Why didn't he work more on the story and, specially the script? The direction is very slow at times, and tends to get irritating. The predictability of the movie is the worst part. We're tired of the some-stroke-of-luck last- minute-life-saving moments of the lead roles.

A powerful slice of wow,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** I went into the theatre unsure of what to expect, having read a mix of rave reviews and critical maulings. I walked out nothing short of blown away. As a big budget and big effects blockbuster, Avatar delivers and then some. Great action, spectacular effects and stunning visuals of scenery, communities and machines. I also loved the many subtle touches afforded by the 3D rendering that lent an added sense of realism to the imaginary jungle on Pandora.As a story, Avatar excels. Yes, it has the formulaic qualities expected of an action-fuelled Blockbuster ... extraordinary hero, super amazing daring stunts, love story, conflict, a point of self-awareness in which defining decisions must be made, and that feel-good sense of ""YES!!"" as the story lines resolve themselves and the baddies get their just deserts. Yes, these Hollywoody elements are improbable. But it's a fantasy sci fi, and fantasy is improbable by definition. However, as expected of James Cameron, there is so much more for those who wish to engage below the surface as he revisits his theme of man's preoccupation with technology.In the Terminator movies, Cameron ably provided us with a retelling of the old Hebrew Golem tale. Avatar poignantly examines the west's longstanding habit of treating technologically-driven military superiority as superior cultural worth. Here, Cameron references the west's realistic historical tendency to use this ideological devaluing of cultures it labels ""primitive"" as an excuse to behave like savages towards them. However, this movie is not a commentary on the past, but of America's recent continuation of such spiritually devoid behaviour. In doing so, he draws an unavoidable parallel ... if the invasion and destruction of cultures for profit was arrogant and evil in the past, as most of us agree these were, then how can exactly the same kind of ideologically-driven, pre-emptive invasion of countries to gain control of their valuable natural resources be any less so today? Whether one agrees with Cameron's condemnation of neo-conservative policies or not, one function of art is to force us to ask questions about our state of humanity. And in this sense, Avatar functions very well as a work of narrative art.I feel compelled to comment on some of the criticisms I have read. They seem to wholly overlook this underlying message of the story, as though these critics somehow never looked past the 3D effects. As a PhD student, I've observed often enough that those who assume themselves to be the smartest person in the room tend not to be, and the smartest people in the room tend to assume that everyone is just as intelligent as they are. As a movie buff, I'm all to aware of those that dismiss any blockbuster as brainless based on their own self-ascribed intellectual superiority. The criticisms I've read adhere to these ideas. The critics, few though they thankfully seem to be, seem to be so busy patting themselves on the back over how clever they are that they've failed to be at all intelligent.Quite simply, this is a superb movie, visually and contextually. If you love blockbusters, go see this movie. If you love intelligent movies, give this one a chance and judge it by your own standards and movie-going tastes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I was blown away,"To be honest, I didn't really know what to expect of Avatar, thinking I'd get along to it sometime and not knowing much about it, but got pulled to the cinema by my kids. Well, I was absolutely blown away. My first words after it finished were: ""Great, fantastic and quite possibly the best sci-fi movie of all time."" It really is that good and that technically advanced that it raises the bar - not by increments but a whole lot.I might get to a more detailed review and Cameron's use of themes he's used in his past sci-fi like Aliens and The Abyss, his cipher characterisation, but that's just nit-picking detail. This is a complete tour-de-force and there's been nothing like it for its richness and complexity of detail. Go see it in the cinema for the 3D because I don't think the flat screen can do it justice. It's utterly, utterly amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar - a sentimental Sci-Fi flick,"The movie is simply mind blowing. Director James Cameron has sculpted this epic with his heart and mind together.The main reason why the movie is worth a watch is because the movie is complete and has all the ingredients. The movie is full of CGI. But not once do you notice that and its never irritating to the eye. The movie has a good feel for the movie-goer. With all the previews/ promos talking gadgets, I expected a Sci-Fi flick. But the movie has all emotions in it - love, vengeance, sacrifice, humor, sober, valor, pride... you name it and you have it.The plot is simple. Hence it has a greater reach. The way it is told is excellent. The movie binds the sentiments with science. The way the characters see the movie is excellently portrayed. When the scientists see, they see samples. When the power hungry humans see, they see money. When the Navis see, they see life and its simplicity. When the avatars see, they see the difference in lifestyles. And its an excellent work from the director that we see all these in the movie.Its not an edge-of-the-seat thriller but its not a sit-back-relax-watch movie either. The story is simple, the screenplay riveting and the background score simply spell-binding. What else you need for 150 minutes of entertainment?This is a visual treat one ought not miss and will be talked about for long.

Avatar = MASTERPIECE,"Twelve years after coming out with ""Titanic"", the highest grossing film of all-time, James Cameron has created ""Avatar"", an absolute masterpiece. Climbing the charts by the day, Avatar has now reached second place all-time grossing nearly $US 1.15 billion worldwide and it's understandable! The movie focuses rather narrowly on a conflict between an indigenous people inhabiting a planet off in space called Pandora and corporate investors from planet Earth. In a rather personal, dramatic, and spectacularly visual way, it exposes a greed far too common here on Earth. Despite the 2.5 hour run time, there is never a dull moment. There is not even a slow moment. This production has fine tuned its focused tale to unwind perfectly. Cameron doesn't waste time with setting as we are trusted to figure out this new world on the go. Avatar is like no other movie. The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the movie explores new territories. It is visually spectacular and more than lives up to its hype. Cameron's long awaited and unbelievably expensive 3-D epic drags you in from the beginning and keeps you in until the end. Unexpectedly, the movie is inspiring and with its groundbreaking special effects, it is one you don't want to miss. You have to see it to believe itÂand even then, it is still hard to take it all in. Including such themes as environmental destruction, war and corporate corruption and even a love affair between two blue-skinned aliens which is surprisingly romantic and affecting, all in the context of a sci-fi adventure story. The movie is set in 2154 and revolves around a paralyzed man, Jake Sully. Following his brother's death, he is selected to the Avatar program to take his brother's place. He is taken to Pandora, a beautiful destination where the nabi population resides. The humans have genetically bred human-nabi hybrids known as Avatars. The more time he spends with the nabi population, the more attached Sully gets to them and will have to choose what side he is on --- the humans or the nabis?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Painting with All the Colors of the Wind,"Avatar has received an absurd amount of hype as the movie that will change the film experience forever. And from a purely visual standpoint, the film lives up to it. As Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his blue buddies roam about the spectacularly crafted planet of Pandora, you feel as if you're running alongside them, and the ""intense epic battle sequences"" (as the PG-13 rating description calls them) are all of that and more. This is a movie that can only be seen in 3D, and it pushes the technology to heights it has never reached before.It is unfortunate, then, that a movie with such visually-stunning potential falls so flat. The film is filled with melodramatic lines like ""It started just as orders... but then I fell in love with the forest,"" and though the acting doesn't damage the movie, it certainly doesn't elevate it either. But the movie suffers most heavily from its plot, which is the most predictable one in a serious film in my memory. The few plot points that were not immediately clear from watching the television commercials became clear while watching the movie at least an hour before they actually occurred, and the entire film was oddly reminiscent of Disney's Pocohontas. Pocohontas, however, provides more depth; Avatar includes no moral questions or quandaries. The good guys and the bad guys emerge within the first twenty minutes of the film, and for the rest of the movie the good guys do nothing bad and the bad guys do nothing good. And that, ultimately, is Avatar's biggest failure, that though it is a film that presents cinematic beauty in every color imaginable, it has no shades of gray.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cinematographic achievement with a simple but beautiful story,"Avatar. This is a title that will remain recognized and remembered for a long time to come. Tens of millions of people have already seen the movie and it is on track to become the highest grossing of all time. Congratulations to James Cameron for following his dream. After years of work (Cameron didn't write or direct anything meaningful since Titanic in 1997) and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, audiences- thankfully- are spellbound.The movie, set in 2154, begins with a narration by Sam Worthington and shows his character, Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, taking his deceased twin brother's place in the Avatar program, a secret mission designed to infiltrate the world of the Na'vi, a colony of blue creatures who live on the distant moon Pandora. The exploration and exploitation of Pandora is crucial to the humans as the Na'vi tribe is living on top of an enormous amount of extremely precious, and expensive, ore.Jake is not trained for this mission but since he is a genetic match to his brother, is sent anyway. His wayward actions get him into trouble relatively fast, especially since on Pandora, with his new Avatar body, he is able to run and use his legs which on Earth are paralyzed. As he is experimenting with his newfound freedom he meets the beautiful Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana, a Na'vi huntress who shows him around and introduces him to the rest of the tribe as well as their culture, language and habits. As I'm sure you can imagine, a love story ensues and Jake's loyalty shifts rather quickly from his own race to that of the blue Na'vi's.Pandora is magical. The jungle is lush and rich, teeming with life. Sights, sounds, and smells abound. There is an understanding between the people and the land, a harmony, a balance which is not exploited for profit as it is on Earth. Trees, plants, animals and the Na'vi coexist in peace and utmost respect. Trees are considered to have souls and nothing can be harmed, touched or disturbed. Each and every life, be it human, animal or plant is valued equally. This is no doubt alluring to us all, as we watch our own planet suffer from the ravages of our growth and absorb the great damages of our years of neglect.Sigourney Weaver plays a tough talking scientist, unlikeable at first (she is even shown smoking cigarettes which has caused great controversy) but her true character unfolds and is revealed throughout the movie. She has a purpose and a mission, fighting against the capitalist exploiters from Earth who are trying to ruin Pandora and expel or kill the Na'vi peoples. Stunningly beautiful moments (some of my favorites were the spectacular scenes with the flying dragons) are mixed in with scenes of utmost destruction and devastation that leave you extremely saddened and horrified at what we are capable of. I have read that some theatergoers are leaving the movie with serious depression issues, wanting to leave our world to live on a planet like Pandora.The story is simple, perhaps too simple, and themes like these have already been seen, but the movie is enchanting and the technical achievements and cinematography outstanding. The special effects are hard to put in words, they must be seen and experienced in 3D. This movie deserves a lot of the praise it is getting and is therefore a must-see. Personally I'm happy I saw it and although I wouldn't see it twice, can recognize its triumph. If it is seen as such it will be an enjoyable experience and it will be understandable why Cameron waited so long to come up with his next billion dollar blockbuster.My rating: 7 Fabio's: 6.5 Total Score: 13.5 For more reviews please visit and become a follower at: http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Frankly disappointing.,"I remember when I first saw Avatar in theatres and I was totally blown away. I remember leaving the theatre just stunned at what I had just been a part of. So I decided to go back for a second viewing and thats when it all came crashing down. Apparently the first time I was just mesmerized by the special effects to truly notice to bad acting,writing and characters.This movie is about a young crippled man who is sent on an army project to leave his human body and be put into an avatar body. His avatar body is a 8 foot tall alien and soon he makes friends with other 8 foot tall aliens.When I first saw the previews for the movie I thought it was going to be so great.

"A very good movie, not great","Before I saw this movie I did not expect much after seeing the trailer. I knew going in to the theater that the special-effects were going to be awesome, and, oh believe me, they were. James Cameron had painted a wonderful place for the audience to watch and enjoy.

But buy watching the trailer you knew how everything was going to end up, it was to basic. And the army guy, to much of a stereotype, it bothered me.I love a movie that makes me think, wanting more. Coming home from the theater and just longing for the DVD to come out. This movie did not do that for me, mostly because of the story.Don't get me wrong. Go and see the movie, you will love it. Just don't praise it to much cause yes its beautiful story and a wonderful world. But its not great",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Breathtaking!!!,"Just awesome. I was fortunate enough to see it in 3D, ""most of the 3D theaters were sold out"". Let me just say that Avatar is by far, hands down the best movie to come out this year and ranks in my top 15 of all time.The story is simple but effective. Cinematography is outstanding. But the special effects is just jaw dropping. The night sequences are breathtaking as the dark is illuminated by the glow of the leaves. Watching this in 3D, you cant help but look around and admire the landscape. The alien like insects, the purple sky, or how the ground lights up green when it vibrates (like m.j's Billie jean video).Avatar by far is the best movie out this year and one of the best this decade, and IS THE FUTURE of cinema. You have to see it to believe it. Its almost 3 hours long and it when it ends you would've felt it was short. I recommend seeing this in 3D to get the full experience. Either way, 2D or 3D, Avatar is Freaking Awesome.9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Welcome Back the King of the World (and Other Worlds),"James Cameron had not directed any movie since being the ""King of the World"" after ""Titanic"" in 1998. This big movie ""Avatar"" is certainly more than an worthy comeback project to again re-launch Mr. Cameron back into filmdom's firmament.When I first saw the trailer some months ago, I admit that I was not entirely enticed to catch this film. Lately though, the film had been garnering nominations and wins for Best Picture in some year-end award giving bodies, including the Golden Globes. And finally, I was lucky enough to win two free tickets to a special invitational 3D screening tonight, so there was no question that I would watch this. And wow, I am sure glad that I did.Truth to tell, the basic story is not entirely new as we have seen it in various incarnations in so many previous movies. However, the grand imaginative vision of Mr. James Cameron is what elevated this piece into the masterpiece that it is. We are effectively transported to a whole new time (in the 22nd century) and planet (called Pandora), with plant and animal life the likes of which we have never seen before.The magical effect of 3D was put to good effect in the whole movie. From the amazingly big battle scenes to quiet scenes, the 3D drew us into this alien place as more than a mere spectator. I found it hard to imagine watching this film in regular 2D. The extra money you would pay to enjoy the 3D is very much worth it.The acting of the humans and the aliens were all very good. Clearly standing out are the good guys led by Sam Worthington (very convincing as both the crippled Marine Jake Sully and his alien Avatar) and Sigourney Weaver (as his mentor and leader of the Avatar project, Dr. Grace Augustine). On the alien side, female characters like Zoe Saldana's Neytiri and CCH Pounder's Moat stand out. The bad guys were a bit on the cardboard side, one dimensional in their wanton greed and evil machinations.This film is definitely a front-runner in the award season in the next few months. It is clearly the leader in the field of Visual Effects. Cameron reportedly conceived this project back in 1994, but only pushed through now when the technology to realize his vision had been developed, and how! We the audience are also effectively drawn into the heart that beats within the story, and get caught up in the adrenaline rush of the action along the way. This is told as only James Cameron can. Indeed, he is back!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Spectacular Treat....You can't afford to miss it..,"Its a dazzling spectacular treat in terms of technical aspects and it takes to a world of imagination and I watched it in IMAX 3-D and its visually stunning..The action sequences are superbly created by a digital army of compositors and FX engineers - including a brigade of motion capture specialists - and the seamless visual effects render the tall, blue Na'vi entirely credible. Some of the natural wonders are blended with imaginary beauty in Pandora's astonishing forests, floating mountains, spectacular plants and tremendous trees - the latter playing a key role as spiritual guardians.The scale is extraordinary as is the bewitching world of 'Avatar' that James Cameron has created with jaw-dropping technology, stunning production design and exotic golden eyed, blue-skinned aliens whose passions are as tangible as the giant flying dragons on which they fly. This huge ambitious project which took many years in the planning earns 'Avatar'.Cameron's 'Avatar' comes in large scale, this contemporary action adventure mingled with sci fi genes & spiritual and ecological themes is more mighty & bigger as a visual epic then his previous 'Titanic'.The movie deserves a 10/10.You can't afford to miss it..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Been watching movies for over 30 years....,"and been a reader of IMDb for quite some time as I am in the film industry but this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to giving my 2 cents worth as what I have witnessed in Avatar is not only a cinematic landmark but a technological benchmark as well. Previous sci-fi films made us dream of what it is like to see other worlds but this is the 1st film that succeeds literally in taking us there and is unlike no other. Star Wars was groundbreaking yes and I will always be grateful for the world it created and the unforgettable characters but surprisingly, it is more fantasy/ soap- opera than sci-fi...Avatar is actually well-grounded scientifically (go to aintitcool.com if you don't believe me as they actually got an astrophysicist to critique its scientific merits) and is as close as one can get (without buying a 1 million USD ticket to outerspace) to leaving our world and visiting another. All the haters out there simply have not seen this yet and those who were bothered by story and dialogue, I think that the brilliance IS in its simplicity- it's easily accessible by all ages and the characters speak like, guess what, you and me, the average person. I think this is the most important and relevant film of our lifetime as we are faced with serious issues that could well spell doom for our planet unless we reverse the greed over precious resources and start respecting our planet and all people of color. If there is one film I could recommend of all the films I have ever seen in the past 30 + years, this is the one. You will have not experienced anything else like it. Pandora is a character in itself. My hats off to JC for reaching for the stars and not letting naysayers keep him from realizing his dream of making this film. The CG and 3D was not used in a gimmicky way unlike all other 3D films in the past.I just saw the latest Star Trek again on DVD and it pails in comparison..I never at any point in viewing Star Trek felt I was on the deck of the Enterprise or on Vulcan with Spock. Transformers and District 9 were great popcorn entertainment but no where in scale and quality or had a potent message as Avatar.JC has figuratively invented fire or the wheel for the film industry and movie goers should rejoice that movie theaters can be relevant again if other studios follow suit and I for one am excited for this new 3D medium. Seen so much crap recently that most of it can just as easily be enjoyed at home on HD TV with a nice sound system but the Avatar experience is one that can only be fully enjoyed at the theater. Thanks JC for bringing back movie magic. Can you imagine what can now be possible with other sci-fi films, heck, all films if produced with this new technology? I can't wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Yeah, but who won the Academy for Best Picture??!!!","People can spout how wonderful James Cameron's genius is when it comes to making huge, expensive and successful films, that isn't too hard to debate. But to say this film is original in any way is a bit of a stretch. Anyone who has watched Star Trek, Farscape, StarGate, and other sci fi films and series know that the storyline is NOT new. Granted, the special effects have come a long way from years ago and it shows in how much money and time he has put into the film. What I have to love is the fact that for all the hype and speculation for Academy nominations, everyone EXPECTED AVATAR to win. . .and it didn't. His first ex-wife won with her film about a real life subject and way under a fraction of the amount Cameron spent. The Gods have a good sense of humor to be sure. :-)",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's not a movie, it's something else!","After seeing first trailers in cinema few months ago I was skeptical. I love James Cameron very much, his every movie is cult, and I was afraid to expect too much, although seeing the trailers I wasn't sure what to expect. Didn't want to know anything about it but in the end couldn't resist reading some opinions, both from critics and regular folks. When I first read Ebert's review I was encouraged, than after reading more and more reviews my expectations began to build up which I didn't like because of those complaints about the story.Finally last night I went to see it. Well, all fears just vanished as soon as the movie started. What can one say?! I'm still blown away I'm going to see it again tonight, but in 2D version to see the difference.Movie is so beautiful, story is so warm and sad, well, it is translation of what is happening here on Earth, fortunately we won't be able to reach other worlds before we destroy ourselves here. OK, story is not complex but why should it be? It is perfect for this movie! Some people always want some crazy twists but they aren't always necessary for movie to be great. It is very well told and you really care for the characters, it moved me to tears several times. But of course, for such cynics and nay sayers no such story is good, they just enjoy bashing, it is in their blood, so don't care too much about that.From visual stand point movie us just beyond this world, it is Pandora's world! I bow to James for such vision! To conceive this in your head and materialize it on screen is just pure art and he is Picasso of our time! Again and again he manages to create something not yet seen, he is simply the best! This movie really deserves an Oscar, at least dozen of them! I respect all the other amazing movies of the year but Avatar is just something else!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Memorable like no other,"The story and characters, the world and flora and fauna is still so present in my head.

How to not do things if humanity is in a similar position one day. And also what to prioritize right now, since the destruction of our necessary surroundings and the environment in general continues every day.After watching this movie i had the hope something deep in the humans will change for good. But when the picture of the orang utan, defending his jungle against a excavator, went around the world i knew there is still room for improvement, to say politely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing new but the CGI Smurf-elves...,"Well, I just hit the halfway point of Avatar. (It came out today for rental from Netflix.) While I shan't deny the effects are outstanding, I have to say it's most derivative and manipulative move I've ever seen. Derivative because I see direct steals from Michael Mann's ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" the obvious Disney ""Pocahontas"" rip-off, ""Pathfinder,"" ""Titanic,"" and at least a dozen others. There really isn't anything original so far. Cameron even steals from himself, with Michelle Rodriguez reprising Jenette Goldstein's ""Vasquez"" part from ""Aliens"" (and why is it that the the kick-ass military chick in Cameron films is always Hispanic and has a tough but submissive male partner?); the military exoskeletons taking on the powerloader part from ""Aliens"", and of course, Sigourney Weaver playing Ripley with a PhD.It's manipulative in that everything about Pandora is beautiful and organic; while everything about the the humans is ugly and technological. One can't help but sympathize with the Smurf-elves: they're beautiful, they are one with the fauna (literally, with those built-in USB jacks in their hair), they give back to the spirit of the land, etc. The humans, however, are for the most part ugly, scarred, self-absorbed, ignorant, and pitiless, and you just know that Cameron is gonna have the big bad Earthers try to trash the pretty Smurf-elves before this movie is over. One can only surmise that the purity of the Smurf-elves will overcome, albeit abetted by the creatures of the land they are so close to spiritually.I hope something interesting happens soon, else I fear I will lose interest. In fact, I guess I already have, as I've stopped to write this...Update: I've finished the movie, and I am not too terribly surprised that I nailed it. Cameron hasn't really made an original movie since Aliens- everything has pretty much been rehashing his same tired themes over and over again. More unfortunately, the blissninnies (thank you for that great word, Col. Jeff Cooper!) all want to accept the civilization=bad, nature=good, as evinced by the misguided Global Warming alarmists.As teenage movie fodder, this sits right up there with Pearl Harbor, Titanic, Indiana Jones 4, and Transformers 2 as a movie that will make more money than anyone can believe, and still be little more than smoke and mirrors. What is sad about that is the people who love it will never realize how sad and shallow they really are...Joe",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dated/wrongheaded social commentary, and without any real technological imagination....","I was honestly very disappointed by Avatar, and this reaction is despite my enjoyment of the homage to Philip Jose Farmer and some other very well-executed scifi flourishes. My problem is that, as a social commentary, Avatar One was entirely misguided. I am a huge James Cameron fan, but he is at his best when telling stories, which he does quite well. So blowing up ""evil"" corporations is the way to save the world? How about looking at how it really is? These days, miners spend decades working out agreements with indigenous peoples, providing job training, repairing environmental damage, etc. Avatar is about 100 years out of date in its social commentary. In my own view of the long-term future, we will have unlimited fusion power, and raw materials will be derived primarily, perhaps entirely, through robotic recycling. So maybe we will leave the era of mining the earth entirely behind us (maybe we'll mine asteroids instead - space travel looks different when energy is virtually free). But Mr. Cameron is not telling us ANYTHING about what could make it better in future. He has no real technological imagination, and Avatar spells that out in spades. There are many brilliant failures in science fiction, and unfortunately, Avatar is yet another of them.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Landmark Film,"I have to admit that this was the One Film that I went in expecting alot. I usually don't do that, but firstly, it's a James Cameron movie, and two, it was the new tech at that time.

James Cameron is an absolute master of film creation, and this movie proves that 100%. All of the actors were absolutely incredible and did an excellent job in portraying their characters, and the amount of hard work that went into this film is crystal clear.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually breathtaking and immensely creative.,"We all know that the story of Avatar is replaceable and has been dealt with in Hollywood for decades before (-> Dances With Wolves). But honestly, if you watch Avatar and only care about the story, you're kind of missing the whole point of the movie.Pandora, along with Middle Earth, is one of the most immersive worlds that have been brought to cinema screens in the 21st century. I would argue that Middle Earth is holding the number one spot here, but keep in mind that LOTR's world existed before in books whereas Pandora was built from scratch for the movie. To develop the appearance of the Na'vi species, the other creatures and animals, that is a big achievement. The terrain and environment is just beautiful to look at. 
At the end of the day, Avatar's visual experience can hardly even be compared to anything that came before or afterwards in movies. Even in 2018, the immensely detailed particle effects when the wind of turning rotor blades rushes through the vegetation just blows my mind.
And even though 3D wasn't really a lasting success, that is what made Avatar unforgettable. People watched it because of the 3D effects (I still think that this is why it has become the highest-grossing movie) and in no other movie was it so fitting.
Ultimately, Avatar is one of the best blockbuster movies of all time, period.
The story, well, is not too bright but not too important either. The visuals kind of made me forget about the story because I was too busy being fascninated by Pandora itself.I felt thoroughly entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I couldn't wait for this to end,"It takes all sorts to make a world. Some say that Cameron is a consummate writer and director. Others tell the truth.

A film so immature, condescending and so filled with plagiarism's that even though a friend lent me the DVD, so I watched it for free, I still felt robbed. Of my time. I was simply hoping that it would get better. But it did not. And what was with the music? There were so many bars of Titanic in there, I wondered if it was the same composer. Oh waitÂit was. And what's with the sympathy for the Na'vi? Or any indigenous people? I've no sympathy for people who use other animals to get about on or fly. Almost every so-called civilisation in the past, had slaves, practised unbelievable cruelty and preyed on the weak and those with less intelligence.

"The visuals, morals, and pace of computer gaming--in pulsing 3-D CGI","Avatar (2009)Technically dizzying, morally unambiguous, with dialog and a story line aimed at teens and young adults, but clearly with wider appeal. Set a hundred and some years in the future, the helicopters landing still conjure up Vietnam, and some of the big mean soldier stuff drinking coffee in the middle of battle, with the airships rolling in over the population below, is pure Apocalypse Now. It's a ""big"" movie, and visually demanding.The 3-D is terrific, smoother and more restrained than other 3-D releases (Journey to the Center of the Earth), which gives it sophistication beyond just the gimmick. I watched part of if without the glasses, and it's actually still pretty jazzy, so I think it would work in 2-D very well, if that's what you have in your area (or in your budget--they charge extra for the extra dimension). The music is heart pumping stuff, formulaic for sure, but part of the adrenalin machine.Is this a ""good"" movie? Not really. It's an impressive movie, obviously, but it has a hyped up computer gaming feel to it, not only visually but ethically, and in terms of depth of plot. It does have a science fiction fascination to it, with the mind and soul switching bodies in different ways, though I'm not totally sure it makes logical sense, which even sci-fi has to do. And the clichÃ©s are fun in their own ways, even if I got tired of it all the constant running and fear, the endless platitudes, the constantly pretty prettiness (it's one heck of a beautiful planet, Pandora is). Even more of a problem is the stereotyping going on, culturally, from the natives to the military, but I'll save getting angry for another day. If you notice it, it's demeaning, if you don't, watch it again.These aren't all things to hate, but the movie doesn't have a lot to love, nothing to dig into, nothing to think about, nothing to make you feel deeply. It might make you feel in a more sympathetic way--there is room for a lot of sympathy, and if your heart strings are dangling beware--but it will do so in the way the Lion King or Pocahontas did. Someone said to me, hearing my doubts, ""You expect too much."" And that makes me think, ""Really?"" I'd hate to ever say that about a movie this ambitious, even from a James Cameron who already proved his crowd pleasing intentions, and savvy, with Titanic. Expectations aside, I want more, and you might, too.I added this response to the New York Times blog, after a comment by their reviewer Manohla Dargis:Well, yes, it's sort of given that we all carry our baggage with us, and apply our viewpoints with bias, one way or the other. But Dargis is too willing to just say, ""Whatever,"" as if the movie didn't have some specific narrative and symbolic qualities that can be scrutinized. That is, even if viewers come away from the movie with a diversity of views (hopefully they do), it is still true that the main character is a white male (with a disability). Or that there are almost no African representations among the humans, and few women (two, mainly, and they both die). Or that there is a kind of broad stereotyping of the natives in attitude and appearance (widely open to interpretation, but not a blank slate). Or that the invading traitor ends up being, voila, the leader of this hapless tribal people with very high ideals. Etc. Etc. If it sounds like I'm suggesting a way to read the movie, it's not on purpose. That's the baggage thing, and I have mine. But it doesn't mean that we should all just turn a blind eye to the possibilities, without polarizing the argument, and without making the movie more than it is, a dizzying entertainment a step away from some Disney classics. With all their stereotyping.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Honest Review by a Matter of Opinion,"Visually, Avatar is one of the most stunning films to see. If films were based only on visual effects rather than writing, directing and acting performances, I would give a 10/10. However that would be shallow, considering as a screenwriter I know it takes more than simple beauty to be memorable.The 3D experience is quite fascinating, but ask yourself; Would you wish to see this film again? In the comfort of your own home without those 3D glasses to fool your mind's eye? James Cameron is a master of animation. Nevertheless, the dialogue is slightly too formal and simplistic, performed mainly by actors who have obviously not had experience in theatre and Shakespearean plays. Any true actor will agree, ""if you can act Shakespeare, you can act anything"".The storyline is not the example of originality, as the plot line is identical to that of 'Pocahontas'. If you do not believe this, simply compare the two plot lines. What differs 'Avatar' from 'Pocahontas' are the character names, and the era in which both stories occur. Otherwise, they are almost identical.There will most likely be angry comments on this review, since we live in a generation which is mainly judged on looks and different opinions. We simply can't accept those with views which are unlike our own.Remember, there are many films considered classics, not only for visual effects, but also for the important aspects of film which make a piece memorable. 'The Godfather', 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'Atonement' are only few examples. Years from now, 'Avatar' will be remembered as being the first 3D film to have won at the Oscars for predictably-cinematography, art direction, and visual effects. It will not be remembered as a film one could see many times over.Being mainstream doesn't make something great. Greatness is quality over dollar signs.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Avatar by James Cameron is a visually stunning film with some really great CGI, and the world of Pandora is engrossing but the story is so pedestrian that it makes it difficult to watch the movie 2 plus hours.The basic story is one of a disabled veteran Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) who takes over his brothers role of a Nivi (the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora). Colonel Miles Quaritch(Stephen Lang) uses Jake as a spy to gather information about the Nivi. Well Jake is found by Neytiri(Zoe Saldana) and she will become his teacher in the way of the Nivi and they also fall in love, Jake goes native and it becomes the colonel's task to destroy the Nivi to help some greedy earth corporation.The problem is that besides Jake and Neytiri all the other characters are sock one dimensional cartoon types particularly the evil corporate manager and the colonel.

You start to become part of the film.The film is a fun-filled ride. Truly exciting and magical. The movie is an instant classic, worthy of many Oscars. This one goes on my top movie list as #1.I wish I could give it more than 10 it deserves all the praise the movie is getting. For once I can agree with the critics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I see you.,"James Cameron's latest attempt, Avatar, is no longer an attempt. Avatar is the most visually beautiful film I have seen in the past ten years. It is a stroke of utter and complete genius. James Cameron brings to life an entirely new way to create a world. With only 40% of live-action material, Cameron created a world so renown and so stunning that for over 2 and 1/2 hours our eyes are glued to the screen. Cameron has a way of allowing you to be awed by the beautiful world that is Pandora while still paying close attention to what's right in front of you. The visuals do not take away from the movie in any way. Everything is superb from start to finish. Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Joel Moore, and everyone else are excellent in their respective roles. I've read some of these comments on here and can't fathom why people do not like this movie. Yes, the movie drags on a bit, but if the movie were only 2 hours long, people would complain that there was no character development or some parts were left unfinished. James Cameron takes you through Jake Sully's transformation in such a way that you actually believe in your own mind that you were watching a human being turn into something completely different, all while not missing a beat.You don't have to like or dislike any of Cameron's other films in order to decide whether or not you want to see this movie. This is a masterpiece from start to finish, in every aspect of the movie. The fact that this has an 8.8 is superb but only #25 on the Top 250 is beyond me. The Dark Knight was a great movie but it does not deserve to be #9 with Bale's shotty performance (as usual).Avatar may simply be one of the most artistic movies ever made, and I mean this with no exaggeration. Undoubtedly the most beautiful film I've seen since The Green Mile. Granted I've only seen The Green Mile for the first time last week, but going back to 1999, I can't think of any better movies.Avatar ranks up their with the best, and it deserves to win every award that it is nominated for. Simply put, a stunning 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
new mythology,"high technology. imaginative director. tasteful cocktail of myths, ecology and defense of basic values of human kind. against every critic, it is an amazing show. seductive, touching, maybe not profound but convincing. it is easy to blame it and it is easy to proclaim it as masterpiece. if you ignore its purpose. because the film has the admirable virtue to propose new measure unit in cinematography. than - to give the best image to a lot of problems of every day news. not the least, to give a challenge. to public, critics and cultural media . and that fact is the only important. because, fan or enemy of Cameron vision, it remains not easy to ignore. because it represents a new mythology, inspired mixture of elements from Sci Fi and old fairy tales.the only problem - maybe Sam Wortihington. but, in few decades, each error becomes a virtue.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
If only the script could have been better?,"The ""King of the World"" James Cameron is back with his most ambitious project yet, a project that took over ten years to make and cost $300 million. This time he has set about creating the most realistic environment generated on computer that has ever been seen on film and has done a fine job of it as well.The movie begins with paralysed marine Jake Sully replacing his dead brother in a project to win the trust of the Na'vi, the native inhabitants of the moon Pandora who are at war with the human colony searching for ""unobtainium"" the mineral to bring life to a dying Earth. To do this they set about creating vessels called Avatars for the minds of the scientists and marines to inhabit allowing them to communicate with the Na'vi more easily.The characters are perfectly acted with Stephen Lang as the war mongering Colonel Quaritch and Sigourney Weaver as chief scientist Grace Augustine the stars in Pandora's sky but leads Sam Worthington (Sully) and Zoe Saldana as the princess of the Na'vi, Neytiri give good performances as well.With the team that brought Lord of the Rings to life behind him, Cameron has blown all other special effects out of orbit with this stunning masterpiece of visual stimulation. Through the beautiful scenery, the native creatures and the Na'vi themselves, you are encased in a world where every bit of detail has been accounted for and the results are stunning as a result.Yet for all the imagery and detail the effects team has come up with, it can't hind the problems with the script which is as clichÃ© ridden as a Leona Lewis ballad â which is presumably why she's on the soundtrack.The stone cold marine falling in love with nature, the budding romance that forms between Jake and Neytiri, the sneaky corporate executive and nature vs mankind plot lines all could have been lifted from a Hollywood handbook called ""basic plots"" and this results in the inevitable glances at the watch as the legs and behinds begin to beg for the slightly long winded film to finish.Avatar has raised the bar for all other action films in terms of imagery and special effects but it has not mastered the ability to tug at the heartstrings of the audience which other epics have done better in the past.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Poor story, to much effects, fun for war-game lovers","First of all, I did not regret to have seen this movie. I loved the colors and visual effects. But it is all too much. It lacks any subtlety. In every corner of the movie there are effects. It gives me the same feeling as the Starwar movies. It is all too much a computer game, no rest no time to breath. I think it is beautiful in the light of the zap-culture. The only thing that grabbed me were the visual effects. But one and a half hour should have been enough for me. I can imagine that for instance that the movies Solaris , I am legend, 2001 a space odyssey, planet of the apes in 3D have more effect to me. They contain a story-line and some mystery",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
many many eye-gasms.,"Avatar is the best movie ever written, directed. just best film ever shot, the screenplay is just so imaginative, the cinematography is some of the most visually stunning images the eye can see. bottom line is this movie blows all others out of the water, it has the adventure action all the quirky Sci-Fi fantasies that any nerd or non nerd can fall in love with. there is also a little romance that warms the heart, and for a movie that has been in production for nearly or more than seven years, the end product more than exceeds any expectations given. i reiterate my previous statement avatar is absolutely the best movie ever made. now I'm sure there is someone out there who would say that this is a little presumptuous and that I'm following the wind that blows to popular opinion, but no anyone can agree that for a box office budget film this is the best movie ever made. refute this if want for this is an opinion, therefor you cannot. so *#*% You if you try.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated rip-off of a Movie,"The only reason this movie was worth watching was the graphics.

The movie is entertaining, but it's long and has really stupid parts that should have been cut out. It's also quite scary watching giant blue things have sex. Thank you very much, James Cameron.

We have all done that, and after watching for a while you just despair and walk away ..But a review should be constructive. So I have had a think and have worked out what could have saved Avatar from all the bad reviews.

There are no surprises here. Everything you think will happen, pretty much does. Everything you've seen in about, twelve other films, you'll see here.

Avatar,"Initially conceived in 1999 as Cameron's follow up to Titanic, Avatar was put on hold when Cameron realized the technology did not exist yet to support his vision. Over the course of the next decade, Cameron created much of the technology he needed to make this movie possible. In 2002, Cameron watched The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and through the character of Gollum realized that his vision was finally possible. Twelve years have passed since the release of James Cameron's Titanic, will his new film prove that Cameron is still ""King of the World""? Much has been made of Cameron's Avatar long before it's release. Hailed as a revolution in 3D and CGI technology, Avatar holds a lot of expectations, not the least of which is the fact that the budget and marketing for this film add up to approximately half a billion dollars, making it the most expensive movie ever made. Of course, Cameron has been here before. Titanic cost $200 million to make, the largest budget for a feature film at the time, and just when it looked like it was going to goose that laid the rotten egg it proceeded to make $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of all time. Cameron's also not new to the idea of revolutionizing the world of film with almost every movie he makes: with The Abyss he had the first all digital water effect, with Terminator 2 he had the first CGI character with realistic movement, and so on. Can lightning strike yet again? I'm generally someone who's adverse to using all caps for anything, but: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE!!!!! Also don't wait for it to come to DVD or to a TV station near you. Why, you ask? Because this movie is a movie that has to be seen the way it was intended to truly get the fully immersive experience. I watched the trailers on TV and online, and none of that compared to seeing the film in theaters in 3D. With Avatar, Cameron has truly outdone himself. When District 9 came out, I raved about the CGI effects in that movie, but Avatar is a whole other monster. With Avatar you truly cannot tell where the CGI begins and reality ends and vice versa, and on top of that it is the most beautiful film I've ever seen, CGI or otherwise. On top of that, Cameron's new 3D cameras create an experience that is in no way uncomfortable. No headaches and no motion sickness for those of you who suffer from that sort of thing. Instead, you get a highly immersive experience that leaves you begging for more (which is saying something, considering the film's run time is 162 minutes) and wanting to return when you leave.I've seen a lot of reviews lately that talk about the film having a weak script with too many clichÃ©s and one dimensional characters. What you really get, in my opinion though, is old school story telling with a message, even though the message is drowned out in special effects and action. The script moves quickly, there is no downtime, but you also never feel like the pacing is off, or that it's moving too fast. Cameron has built a complete world, we don't just see characters and action, but we see complete eco systems, and are introduced to many characters. While the entire cast is amazing, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully and Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch are the real standouts here. Sam Worthington creates a character that you feel for, and through his progress from pawn to leader is truly believable and heartfelt. Stephen Lang, on the other hand, gives us a character that starts off just trying to do his duty, but eventually becomes a character on par with Sergeant Barnes from Platoon or Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now.I purposefully chose not to mention anything about the plot for this movie. I think this movie is going to be the revolution of movies that Cameron believes it's going to be. I've seen reviewers compare it to The Wizard of Oz (the movie to truly lead the color revolution) and King Kong (the 1933 version, which revolutionized special effects), and I wholeheartedly agree. I still can't completely fathom what I just saw, and will probably see it at least one more time on the big screen if not more. Anyone who's into film, the tech of film, or just wants to keep up with where film is going in the future should see this film. On top of that, this movie touches on so many different genres (SciFi, fantasy, romance, war films, drama, etc.) that it will appeal to almost everyone. Once again, James Cameron is ""King of the World""! 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

He tries to show us that we need to be more tolerant, patient, curious and kind. And that we need to look after one and other and the environment which surrounds us. There is no plan B. This is a movie experience that will follow me for a long time I think, and the message that Cameron gives us is more important now than ever before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar sets a new standard for visceral entertainment,"Let me start this off with a few words on originality in film. I like to judge movies on a purely subjective level, so the originality of a plot or idea is is only relevant to me insofar as it begets predictability. So, while I criticize Avatar for being an extremely predictable film, I don't consider its supposed lack of originality, probably its most universally criticized aspect, to be relevant. Cross-medium adaptations don't catch any flak because they acknowledge their intent to re-film the same plot. Instead they are judged on how well they are able to capitalize on the storytelling strengths of the new medium while retelling said plot. No Country For Old Men is a perfect example of this. And I'm telling you that Avatar is an example of this as well. The 3D film is used so well in this film, it transcends ""gimmick"" status and becomes an amazing tool of immersion. It sounds like a studio-issued tag-line, but really, you have not experienced a film the way that you experience this one in 3D, on a large screen. You have seen this story before, but with Avatar you really feel like you are experiencing it through a whole new medium.Okay, that was more than a few words. Sorry. Here is my actual review:There are two things that this film does so well that its flaws are completely overshadowed (flaws such as frequently weak dialogue, a handful of cheese, predictable plot, lack of secondary character development).First, it shows Jake Sully's gradual immersion into Pandora and Na'vi culture, and brings us along for the ride. His character arc is sublimely executed, and the world in which it occurs is mind-blowingly cool and fully realized (It is also worth noting that the love story is almost embarrassingly sincere, which I consider to be a plus, but can be kind of awkward to watch with friends). By the end of the film you will feel like you yourself have spent time living among the Na'vi on Pandora, and it is a truly intoxicating experience (I want to fly around on a dragon too, damn it). Leaving the theater, I had the feeling that you get after waking up from a very pleasant dream: genuinely disappointed that it isn't real, but still high from the experience.Seriously, I would kill for either: A: a zombie apocalypse; B: a trip to PandoraSecond, it sets up and executes the mother of all action sequences. The film gradually builds tension over its 160 min. running time, contrasting Jake's love for his newfound life with escalating displays of imperialist douchebaggery culminating in a couple of tragedies that really hit you where it hurts. I already knew exactly how the final battle would turn out, but god damn did I want to see it happen. Now, some people view any kind of action scene as a flaw for reasons I cannot fathom, but as an action movie aficionado, my eyes honestly welled up at the absolute magnitude of spectacle that I was witnessing. Maybe it was the IMAX, and maybe it was the 3D, but this movie had absolutely the greatest climactic action scene I have ever seen. I mean, better than the hospital sequence in Hard Boiled or the church scene in The Killer, better than anything in the Matrix trilogy, better than the last 20 minutes of Raiders of Wu-tang or the last 10 minutes of The Mystery of Chessboxing, better than any of Cameron's previous action scenes, and certainly better than any of Michael Bay's incoherently edited crap.Avatar is a remarkably focused, entertaining, and well-paced epic. Never have I seen a film of this length that felt so short. There Will Be Blood, probably my favorite film of the decade, is about the same length but feels twice as long. Not once during the running time of this film was I bored. Yes, the film has a few flaws that would be enough to cripple a lesser film, but in the face of what this film achieves, they seem negligible. This is not a film that tries to impress you through its plot; it focuses entirely on visceral entertainment. Aside from the initial exposition, any time that is not spent on some sort of immersing spectacle is spent setting up some sort of immersing spectacle, and yet it never feels like empty entertainment; we are always emotionally attached to the characters and events. Avatar is a remarkable achievement and sets a new benchmark for blockbusters that I fear not many will be able to meet.I give it a 9.5 out of 10, but I think it deserves a 10 more than it deserves a 9.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
AMAZING...visually that is!,"I saw this movie in 3D and I must say, it was amazing! Visually, that is. Other then that I'm far from impressed. If you take the visual away all you are left with is a predictable shallow story with one clichÃ© after the other. As it is a James Cameron movie, I guess one could have figured that out right from the beginning. How ever, if you want to be visually amazed and can turn of your brain for around 2 hours you should go see this movie at the cinemas, in 3D.

"WOW, WOW, and WOW","James Cameron's new movie ""Avatar"" is an outstanding film.Each and every actor gave a solid performance that helped to enhance the film. Stephan Lang was absolutely brilliant in his role. The characterization was wonderful and the writing allowed you to identify with the characters and empathize with them. It is rare that a Sci-Fi movie has this range and depth of characterization included.The story is the usual Sci-Fi/Fantasy story. Nothing in the main plot is much different from other movies that have tackled the same dilemmas.The world is an absolute utopia for the senses. There has never been a movie with this much detail and fantastic effects with the landscape. Every plant, every stream, every inch of this planet is stunning and wonderfully filmed. The floating islands are stunning, the foliage, the life that the illumination brings to the plants, the colors, this world is beautiful in every aspect.The indigenous life looks real and the creatures also have great character and essence.Digital 3-D is a must to get the full experience. The 3-D makes you feel like you are looking out your window (or doorway) into this world. You see the insects flying around the characters and you feel like you could catch one of the fireflies, you feel the embers of the fire nearing you, you experience the depth perception of entering a room and looking at the characters within.Avatar is a masterpiece in film-making. While the story is typical of Sci-Fi alien encounter movies and the acting is very good---the world is stunning, visually moving, a complete enjoyment for the senses, a visual fantasy and delight, an experience well worth any admission price. Avatar is the greatest visual/special effects movie ever made. I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. Sit back, take in the beauty of the environment, the thrill of the 3-D and the excitement of experiencing flight, riding, and fighting in 3-D.WOW is the word you will use over and over and over throughout this entire movie.Reading some of the other reviews, I am saddened by the nasty commentary that people have put in these forums. It is obviously not accurate about the film and made to discredit a visual utopia. Please do not listen to negative people. Whether you like the story or not---the visual are so amazing that you are engulfed in the beauty of the planet and it's life force. What Cameron has done is to elevate the level of film-making for the coming years and I applaud him for his efforts.

Sci-fi + SFX + Neytiri = A technical masterpiece,"This is only my second review on IMDb after my all-time favourite 'The Matrix'. So, it is quite obvious that I am a sucker for sci-fi.Yet, I deducted one star for the lack of originality in the character and story departments. Full marks for the creation of a fictitious parallel world. I bow down to the technical team of this marvellous piece of art. Money well spent by the producers.In the acting department, everyone did a fine job considering the transfer of the true human expressions on a graphic platform.

The direction was fabulous, aided by some excellent editing, cinematography, sound and not to mention SFX.This could easily be a wonderful tribute to the works of the many unknown entities who make an eye-opener of our movie-going experience.Finally, I'd like to mention that I fell in love(genuinely) with Neytiri. For me, the tall, wild, blue, computer-generated damsel outshines all other cinematic goddesses. (Again, thanks to the technical brilliance behind 'Avatar'.)

Overrated,"This film will give you an experience remembered, as it is surely one of the most cinematically enveloping, visually, to come about in a long time.

You can balk at that, but do not let the robust visuals and ""experience"" factor take you away from my point. You boil away the visuals and you have a markedly less interesting story.Having said all that, this film was obviously well worth it, on the basis that it will bring minions of children and young adults joy, the world over. It is an impacting film that lingers, visually, in the memory.

"""Avatar"" is Better Than Good, and Even Better Than ""Titanic""","Many critics who have reviewed ""Avatar"" said that they initially didn't know what to expect going in. I bring this point up because I felt the exact same way. I'd seen posters for the movie, and previews for it in the previous months before it was released, but did not know what it was about, let alone if I would like it or not. In fact, I was so unsure how I would feel about it that I saw ""Sherlock Holmes"" before I saw ""Avatar"". All I knew about the movie was that it was about blue, cat-like creatures, and it was directed by James Cameron, a guy who is very easy to dislike as a person. After all, ""Titanic"" broke many records, but eventually came to be seen as bombastic and meretricious. Cameron's declaring himself ""king of the world"" at the Oscars didn't help much, nor did his immediate public divorce from Linda Hamilton, or his long stretch of not directing a followup feature film (save the forgotten ""Ghosts of a Abyss"" (2003) that should have been called ""The Making of Titanic"", and ""Aliens of the Deep"" (2005)).However, after seeing ""Avatar"", I can honestly say that there was not one inch of celluloid that was wasted in this film. Cameron may not be a nice guy, but when he wants to tell a story, he can tell it and not waste a dollar of his $250 million budget. As I serve myself a piece of humble pie, I'll even add that he probably does not care what an amateur, unestablished 27- year-old film critic thinks about him, and that's a good thing.I went to see ""Avatar"" in 3D (which is well worth the extra 3 bucks, depending on the movie), and I was afraid to blink in case I missed something. This is an epic movie well-deserving of the term ""epic"". Any time there is a scene where a helicopter is flying out into the Pandora wilderness, or even inside in the scientific lab or Marine base, I was taken aback by the design and the detail of everything I saw on screen. Nowadays, saying that a movie has great special effects is synonymous with explosions and societal destruction compromising the majority of the film. ""Avatar"" indeed has great special effects, and those latter elements represent a small percentage of the film.Naturally, like ""Titanic"", many people I spoke to had problems with the acting and the story line. One person I know called the movie ""'Dances With Wolves' In Space"", which I suppose it was. I also saw similarities to ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest"" (1992) and ""Pocahontas"" (1995), but by no means was the story a blatant ripoff of any of these films. I did think the villainous characters like Colonal Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfrige (Giovanni Ribisi) made the Native American allegory too obvious by frequently calling the Na'vi creatures ""savages"". It made their characters also seem one-dimensional, and they obviously hadn't been taught about the Battle of Little Bighorn in school.Other than that, I thought the acting was fine. Except for a few times his British accent slipped through, Sam Worthington had both a commanding presence throughout the film while also being a convincing moral compass. There haven't been many actors who can pull that off while playing a paraplegic. Sigourney Weaver, being no alien when it comes to science fiction roles, also did a great job here. And Joel David Moore was perhaps the breakout star of this film, doing a great acting job that truly redeems his role in ""The Hottie and the Nottie"" (2008). Lang's role as the hard-ass colonel may have been seen in other movies before, but there is no doubt that Lang knows how to play a great bad guy.Zoe Saldana, Wes Studi, and CCH Pounder essentially did voice-over work in their roles here as the native Na'vi of the planet Pandora. Still, there was not one second where their voices were not convincing. Saldana especially cemented her position as a convincing leading actress while not appearing as a human on the screen at all. I don't have to say that she deserves to be an A-lister. She will be very soon if she isn't considered one already.""Avatar"" deserves no less than 9 stars in my book. I usually give 10 stars to movies that are not only great, but really move me in some way. ""Avatar"" had a few weaknesses, but not enough to deduct a star from my rating. It was an enjoyable film that moved me on more than one level. I felt compassion for the characters, marveled at the scenery and special effects, and most importantly, didn't get up to go to the bathroom once during the film. When I went to see ""Titanic"" 12 years ago, on the other hand, I got up three times to go.James Cameron wisely made the reported $237 million it took to make ""Avatar"" worth every penny. Fortunately, I wisely made the $14.50 I paid to see it in 3D worth every penny as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar is epic!,"James Cameron returns and shows these wannabe rookie directors of recent times how it's done. Finally a good ""old school"" film that is worth remembering. This has been one of the weakest years in film-making that I can think of. When extremely low quality films like Transformers 2, New Moon, and Wolverine are some of the biggest hits of the year, you know something is wrong. Leave it up to Cameron to save the day with this fresh and unique cinematic experience.Avatar is everything that it has been hyped to be and is nearly flawless in it's execution. Cameron, unlike Michael Bay and every other crappy director of today, actually shows just as much care in crafting a compelling and involving story as he does in delivering mind blowing visual effects and action. Cameron knows that with out a good story and characters that action is just a bunch of noise. He really knows how to invest his audience so that when the action kicks in you are on the edge of your seat in suspense. The film runs long but everything pays off in full. There is only one plot point I can think of that doesn't have a pay off but it's barely even worth mentioning. The allegory of indigenous tribal people being forced off their land by a more sophisticated race isn't a new concept but it's executed very fresh in this story. It really makes you feel guilty to be a human being as we are the true villains in this film. You cheer for the Na'vi to kick our asses in the end. Cameron definitely does a great job of sending a message.The visual effects are ground breaking and are undoubtedly going to clean out the Oscars. I heard one audience member say that Avatar was ""the most beautiful film I've seen in years"". I definitely have to agree with that statement. The creatures and the environment they live in looks so good that it could fool someone into thinking it is a place they could visit. The action always serves the story and is never there just for the sake of having explosions. Michael Bay needs to take some notes. The action is used carefully but when it's on screen it's jaw dropping. You'll find yourself cheering, laughing, and crying all with in a single action sequence. There is also a surprisingly very genuine romance at the heart of this film which makes it a great date flick. The movie breaks boundaries of genera and is made for all audiences.The cast is also worth a respectable mention. This Sam Worthington guy came fast out of no where but he is definitely here to stay. It's very rare that a guy can make a sudden jump on to the scene and bring with him this much on screen charisma. He stole the show in Terminator Salvation and now totally carries the film on his shoulders here. He is a total natural and really delivers above and beyond. Zoe Saldana, his romantic interest, also made a sudden leap onto the scene and nearly steals the show. Her performance is the heart and soul of this film. It's also great to see Sigourney Weaver back in a big film. Now if only Cameron could give Michael Biehn a big break like that too. There isn't a single weakness in this cast.Avatar really is the big event that Cameron has promised it to be. If I had to pick any flaw with it I'd say some of the dialogue could use revising and I'd really like the physics of how mountains in this world float explained. All in all though, it's very hard to think of anything to complain about this movie. Cameron has proved that he has still got what it takes and that time has only added more wisdom to his film-making style. This film is deserving of great financial success, critical praise, and Academy Award nominations. If you're only going to see one film this year then this would be a good choice. It is a movie that must be seen on the big screen. I don't care how big and impressive your HD TV is because it can't possible do this film justice. Hopefully this will remind audience and filmmakers what movies have been missing these days. Story is the most important aspect of any film. Filmmakers must remember this or films are doomed to mediocrity. Avatar is a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
1 hour and a half with growing tears. I ain't thigh it was possible since AVATAR,"When a smart and creative idea meets a great director of photography, a great editor and a great director, then AVATAR comes out.I don't mean to leave out the actors job which still is over the top of what I usually expect from actors, especially after I have seen 2012 which comparing with avatar is 2/10 rating.Excellent work on graphic, and smart especially because this sci-fi was not something we can't even imagine, but a reality where things we usually like are powered: The led on natures, the blue-green gradient, the tall blue habitants of Pandora, the great half dinosaurs creatures...AND the MOTION. The motion of things, animals and people was everything. From my point of view, Dynamism was the best part of it, besides the beautiful special effects of colours and shapes, the quickness of movements of the blue guys was amazing and astonishing. beautiful to see and to feel.Here another topic: James Cameron know s how to make people FEEL the movie. I don't understand how, but He knows how make us audience sniff flowers, touching the ground, and tasting the air of Pandora. I didn't watch it on 3D so this means it's not about the third dimension.About actors: I loved most of performance, I got something to say about the cigarettes that could have been avoided besides they have no sense in the movie, but great, great great.And the best part: When I saw ""The dark knight"" which I do like a lot, after Harvey got fired in face I told myself ""that's the end"" and I mean it cause I felt even tired of the next 45 minutes. Comparing to Avatar, I stand with holding tears for 1 hour and a half. For instance, Clint Eastwood movies got you in that mood usually during the last 10/5 minutes and you say ""this is a great movie"". But Cameron, damn gets you in after a hour and KEEP you there for the next 1 hour and a half, incredible, and when avatar finished, I didn't want it to finish.I really have a lot to say about it but I'll stop here, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING???? GO AND WATCH IT!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not my cup of tea.,"So, I'm a big sci-fi and action type of guy with epic exposition in mind. So why did I not take a shining to this film that had all those elements and more? Why did I not warm up to it? What was it that was missing from this piece?It's kind of the same reason I didn't go see ""ID4"", and why I thought that concept of a film was pretty bad in the first place. It had no soul.So it is with Bruce Cameron's ""Avatar"", a play on the realm of computer games and online interaction, which tells the tale of a man who is likewise relegated to forever living vicariously through his blue skinned alternate persona. A comment on today's youth if I ever saw and heard one before in my life.""Avatar"" hits all the right dramatic cues. It hits all the right emotional chords for drama, plot, character, story, and even has dazzling visuals to accompany the tale of a world fraught with noble savages warring with a corporate army.I found myself laughing, loving, and even shedding tear or two as I watched this film in a packed movie theatre. And with all of the explosive action, with all of the romance and traditional underdog fighting hightech warrior themes going on, what was it that this film lacked?For all of the pro-native and pro-life messages going on here, I just found the thing to be fairly plain and unintelligent. The message of the film is sent via a telegram. It's written in big letters and nearly shoved down the throat of the audience with a huge silver spoon. Couple that with the ""muster your inner soul"" thing, and I had a hard time connecting with this film on a basic level.Oh sure, I got all the emotional stuff, and agreed with the moments of drama, but it simply was a film made for a five year old teenager. In short, it was unintelligent.When I think of classic sci-fi that I watched ages ago, I think of films that were made for adults even though they were veiled in high gloss that attracted younger viewers. That, and they had a set of precepts of what was right, and what was wrong. It wasn't a clinical analysis and twisting of basic and fundamental American values, and breakage thereof.But ""Avatar"" is made for the young ""international"" youth audience. It's designed to be a universal message attempting to appeal to everyone and everything. It's like a politician who promises a chicken in every pot, who kisses babies, shakes hands and the like, but winds up being powerless because he's promised too much to everyone, and has lost his own sense of worth.That sounds very existential, but it's essentially the problem with ""Avatar"". And it's essentially part of the reason it is not thriving like the other established sci-fi franchises out on the market. ""Avatar's"" message is that your primal instinct to mate should outweigh your other responsibilities, and that those other values that are wrapped in a colored cloth are mere jingoism and are merely clouding your judgment. The nail in the message's coffin is the corporate army is just that, a business venture run for mass murder, and for the sake of controlling and educating the natives.It's a trite message for a film that demonstrates equal regard for its target audience. And as for the 3D adding to the film? I saw the same technology demonstrated at Disneyland 25 years before with Captain EO. I can't say much has improved.Watch at your own risk.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Mother of All Popcorn Movies,"This review contains NO spoilers and I did not see any trailer footage beforehand.Ever went to a fun park where you wanted to take the biggest ride?Well, in this case it is Avatar. It is the mother of popcorn that ends all popcorn movies. Literally really. But as with any popcorn movie, you should keep your expectations low story wise and then you will have a great time. Especially with teenage kids. Else get ready for some serious eye-rolling and groans.And here's why...SCRIPT: Man, what can I say? They say, Cameron has been working on this thing for years, wanting to recreate an detailed fictional world full of life, vistas, sounds, colours and spirit. So you might think he would have had time to develop the story as well. I don't know why it turned out to be so juvenile in the end; it really does not exceed the storyline of a Saturday morning cartoon show.The characters are very one dimensional while the opportunities of exploring the characters more are so interesting and wide open. You cannot say anything, unfortunately, then that the characters serve nothing else but the cgi.I think this can only be one of two reasons; OR James Cameron has the mental age of a 14 year old, which I doubt because it is takes enormous effort and organization to set something like this up. OR is aiming for such a wide audience that it also covers the Asian market. I am going for the latter, which uncomfortably fits Cameron's commercial aptitude towards movies.EFFECTS But while you are waiting for the predictable plot to unfold you will be shown a beautiful world with interesting creatures. And this is were certainly the element of Asian influences shows. Although the world looks luscious and full of life, it still cannot escape the CGI look it has. It still moves too elegant or fluid to be lifelike. The irony is, that this becomes quite apparent in the cinema 3D version.The 3D does not actually add much to my opinion, although once I was fooled into believing something small was in front of my face, the clichÃ© of actual pointing or throwing things at the camera confirms the 3d but here it is done so subtle you forgot about it. And when it is apparent it is still not that relaxing looking at it. Afterwards I was curious about seeing it in 2D how it feels and look...but no.All in all, the effects were of course cream of the crop. Everything was done to squeeze the last of 3D out of those gfx workstations and it shows. But the question is, what comes after this? It is not like anyone is going to outdo Avatar for a while. I can even hear George Lucas scratching his head from here. But Peter Jackson knows, and I think Hollywood does too; make it about the characters and the story. Instantly rendering Cameron without a job really. Har di har.DIRECTION Well, needless to say it is quite an undertaking to set something like this up. But strip away the million dollar effects and then what do you have? Still some very nice, dynamic but familiar camera work, lighting always seems oddly even (because of the green screening) but the sound is just amazing. My hat off for the people who did that.ACTING Somehow, even in the darker bits, the actors seem quite upbeat in this movie. Maybe it is just me, maybe it is because the non-cgi actors did not have to squeeze out the majority of terrible one-liners. The double irony is, that for a 3d movie the characters are very one dimensional, but the actors do a reasonable job of making the best of it. I was surprised to see main characters being filled by actors I admire but also surprised by actors I did not know at all.So all in all 7 out 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overcoming my disdain for CGI,"When you stop caring, or even noticing, the CGI, you know you're watching a good movie.I generally hate CGI, especially in large doses. It's disheartening for me to watch a big screen knowing that every little detail is there because someone thought to draw it. Nothing accidental, nothing by chance, or dropped in by human quirk. But Avatar made me not care. And that's really saying something.I fell in love with the scenery! This movie was simply beautiful to look at.The story was 100% predictable. You know what the protagonist is going to do, every step of the way, and sometimes you have to wait a while for it. But who cares? It was great. When it ended, I don't know where 2-1/2+ hours went! I honestly didn't want it to end. I didn't want to leave that world.This is what the big screen is made for!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Film which overhyped in 2009,"I remember all this hype around this film, it was exteremely popular and many told it was the most extraordinary film they had ever seen. But is it now? Certainly not. It is the product of its time and it doesn't look so stunning in 2021. Of course all this unique world and CGI drew our attention in 2009, but most of us didn't notice that there's hardly anything more than graphics that is new and unique about this film. Its story is a bunch of predictable cliches about an encounter with a different civilization. To the most famous films which showed us exactly the same sequence of storytelling belong Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas and The Last Samurai. In such stories we have a protagonist who is on the side of his people and wishes to fulfill his duty, then he acidentally happens to be among his enemies which turn out to be the good guys, understands how bad his own people are, trains his new allies to be more effective against his former friends and bosses. In some cases he may also have relationship with their woman. And in the end they win suffering great losses. We had seen absolutely everything from Avatars story except for new planet and slightly different reason for protagonist to begin his journey. Some scenes were even taken directly from The Last Samurai. Oh, and that 3D, which was in every more or less expensive movie till 2015, having only a f few effects, but making films dark and harder to watch.After 2009 we've seen dozens of films looking more realistic visually and suggesting us more interesting stories without constant repetitiveness, so I see no reason to watch Avatar in 2021. Only if you want to see what film is the highest-grossing and to be aware of its story if you wish to see it's sequel next year, you can watch it. If you want neither of these things, you can skip this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar AKA Dances with Smurfs,"Avatar's story has been done so many times already. It relates greatly to films like Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves or even The Last Samurai. The writing is pretty poor, as many of the lines in the movie come out to be corny. Even though the story has been done over and over again and the writing isn't great, the movie is visually stunning. James Cameron has created something we have never seen before in a film. Sadly, that's all Avatar is; eye candy.I don't recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good moving story. So instead, go watch Dances With Wolves, trust me, it is similar and far more worth while than this. But if you enjoy action packed CGI filled movies, then this is the one for you.And seriously? Unobtanium?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'd rather rate Avatar -100 to shoot it down,"Of cause I already voted 1 to it, but I still wish IMDb allows me to vote -100. Avatar is the lamest movie I'v ever watched. If you watched Dancing With Wolves, which is my favorite movie by the way, you know what I am saying. Avatar is just a sci-fi version of Dancing With Wolves, and of cause a much worse version of that. The story is weak, the characters are weak, the idea is weak. After 5 minutes you already know what is going on in this stupid movie, and you don't need to be a hardcore movie fan to predict the ending of this movie. Other negative reviews already mentioned the every detail about why this movie is overrated, so it is not necessary to say that again in this review. I just want to share my disappointment. Actually what makes me really disappoint is not the movie itself, since there are lousy movie all the time, but the high rating on this movie. IMDb indicates people's favor. And I think Cameron fooled people once again. He leads movie this great art to a lower level not higher. It is so sad. Actually I have to say, as a thief (he stolen whole story from other movie), Mr. Cameron used people, wasted people's time, and even worse he made young director frustrated by the Hollywood movie law--high costs equals great movie. Unarguably, movie is visual art, it has to be beautiful. So it is obviously correct that more technics should be used in movie to make it more visually beautiful. But if the visual beauty is the only thing left in a movie, I have to say, it is not a movie, it becomes a screen saver. So what is the point of a hollow beauty? It is just so sad that most people are cheated by this hollow beauty.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I want to come back!,"I have been there finally! I have visited Pandora. It was improbable! Mr. James Cameron, how did you manage to show it? How did you do it possible?I have no words to describe what I've seen. Full illusion of stay inside. It is the new world â the world of 3D. The cinema has turned over. About the same sensations, I think, those people who saw more than 100 years ago ""Arrival of a train"" they thought the same. (I'm sorry, if I inexactly remember the name of the first tape in history of cinema but there people were frightened and ran out from halls). Too most now â the truth without a fright.I don't know now how I shall go to the cinema more on other films. The whole time of my sitting in the cinema I was trying to understand. How? How is it possible to realize the whole world? It's gorgeous and fabulous picture. What imagination does Mr. Cameron have that he was able to recreate the whole planet in details and thoroughly? He did it with the attention, love and imagination to create all this portrayal of landscapes, trees, plants, insects, other living being and creaturesNa'vi look as alive â they really exist. It's like unknown cameraman managed to spy upon another life. I never felt the same before. Shaking ears of Na'vi, sensible eyes and smooth grace of tribesmen. They are alive.Perhaps someone will tell: there is the weak and banal script. But never before it was possible to visit ""film"", to be inside there, before we simply visited movie-hall, we went to the cinema. And all story and all events now you are feeling together with heroes, you live in this film. You, as well as Jack, go and fly among Na'vi, and every time it's more heavier for you to come back in your old ""skin"", in the usual body, you wish to return to their wood.

This movie is horrible,"This movie sucks. Never have I ever wasted 3 hours of my life on something this bad and this underwhelming. I can understand that the visual effects were good at the time it was made. But now this movie is just plain bad. The acting is so shallow and the plot is incredibly stupid. There's no good reason this movie should have won any Oscars, let alone even have been nominated for any. If someone asked me to see this movie with them, I would call 911. You can't be sure if someone is not insane if they even pretend to like this movie",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but not that great,"I agree, the effects are amazing and will certainly set new benchmark, same as ""Terminator 2"" and ""The Matrix"" did. The gray human ships/settlement vs colorful Pandora world is another nice touch, contrasting old, sick, technology obsessed world with new, pure one where all creatures live in harmony.However once you look past that the story becomes somewhat illogical. the first thing I noticed is that this is ""Dances with the Wolves"" with a happy ending. Outsider sent to native lands, becoming one with them and taking their side in the end.Next thing is that the ending isn't logical. sure, Na'vi won the battle, but looking objectively this is just a rerun of Zulu wars. Warriors are able to achieve one victory by combining their man(and women)power against small, isolated outpost and winning with weight of numbers, good tactics against superior weaponry. But as history shows, outsiders may suffer a setback and occasional defeat they can simply bring in reinforcements from their homeland, adapt to the environment and win with superior weaponry. Win couple of such battles, create a serious dent in natives man(and women)power and they simply cease to be big threat and become a nuisance, easily dealt with.as Pandora is seen as critical place for Earth's economy such place will not be abandoned just because one battle was lost. so after Na'vi win humans simply return some time later, armed to the teeth and nuke Pandora then strip mine it. Hell, with genetic engineering as advanced humans could simply develop virus that would kill Na'vi but be harmless to humans, release it, wait for them to die then continue mining uninterrupted.Overall I enjoyed the movie (despite irritating experience of wearing 3D glasses over my regular glasses) and am not sorry to see it. but I wouldn't consider it a great movie. Unfortunately people focus on the effects not the story. While the story undertones are clear (need to protect the environment, anti-militaristic message and so on) the plot soon falls into clichÃ©. How many movies exist where a person from outside group is sent to native lands then adopts their ways and takes their side against his former group, either winning or loosing? ""The Last Samurai"" comes to mind as well.Worth watching but if you want to see something more than just stunning special effects then nothing to be that excited about",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Utter Foolishness.,"AHHHHHH, where do I start?! I am shocked by the amount of positive feedback this movie has got. I mean, it was filled with nonsense crap. I am trying to write this in the most civil way I can but that's seriously the only word that comes to my head when trying to describe this film: crap. I cant believe how many people actually loved this, I even feel bad for genuinely hating this movie.I am not a sci-fi type of person and I have pretty much never seen a movie of this genre until now. I was hesitant about watching it but because I heard so many people talking about it and with such high ratings I thought it cant be that bad. It was. I mean, the time I decided to let go of my anti-sci-fi attitude, I found myself strongly compelled back to it.I am sure those of you who loved it will deem me as an 'uncreative unimaginative unappreciative-of-art' person. But whats so creative, imaginative, and artistic about it anyway?! Okay, the graphics and all of that was pretty neat, I'll give you that, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I am so bugged by people saying this film was so different and creative because it really really wasn't. What was different was the detail of the graphics maybe, but a film is not to be judged solely on the use of new technology, graphics, etc., but many other factors should be looked into like the actual plot, the story, the true originality of it among other things that quite frankly weren't properly considered, in my opinion, by the 10 star givers. Which brings me to the content and idea of the story ...Flying off to some planet trying to steal crap, and having the star of the movie fall in love of with blue weirdos who inhabit the planet and going against his own race for them, isn't very creative. It's stupid. There is no deep imagination in that, anyone can think of such a story, creatures on different planets, blue people, special trees? Foolishness. The whole idea, the connection the avatars had to the nature, the flying seeds, it was just weird (not good weird). I don't want to be superficial but thats truly my opinion and thats the whole point of reviews, one's opinion. Look at it this way, the avatars, the creatures that coming up with, was supposedly very clever, had worms in their hair. The worms or whatever would connect to the horse/dragon/ireallydontcare and tame them. Wow? Not so much.I found it to be belittling the human brain, not challenging it to look into deeper purposes or expanding its imagination and creativity by displaying impossible stories that would enlighten us in some way and make us think and appreciate and bla. To love this movie and find a deeper meaning or something in it would be an insult to (my) mind. However, if you were inspired by it and loved it or anything in no means am I intending this to be an insult to you. ;pBesides the whole content with all of its absurdity, it was too long. Two hours and a half of blue people running around is sheer torture.I might not have had such a negative attitude if there wasn't this much hype on about it, but I have.I am sorry if this was offending to anybody in any way, it is truly my opinion and I have really tried to like it but to no avail. xD.=)",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Of course we just couldn't expect James Cameron to screw up this kind of movie. Quite the opposite maybe it isn't a new titanic or a new terminator, but is definitely a masterpiece.One of the things that sets this film apart from the others from it's gender is that even though the actors are not very famous most of them are young and very promising. They are able really convince you that the feelings of their characters are genuine and not everything nowadays is about computer animation and special effects.The world of Pandora is amazing from the very beginning you will just be caught in the beautiful and fascinating way in which everything is created it is just beyond belief, that anyone could have such imagination. One other ting is that the native inhabitants are no at all made disgusting if you have to compare them to the humans you will probably see our race as ugly.All in all this movie has everything strong story, big budget, good actors and most importantly flawless execution of the whole film. No matter how old are you or where are you from you will most certainly like Avatar",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The mirror of our world,"This is a masterpiece. This movie has the best effects ever seen and has a story which shows our world: The people who are able to see the force behind things you can't see and touch; and the people who lost this gift. If you compare it with other 3D-movies, no with all other movies, you can't find a movie with similar effects.Watch this movie! If you are not able to see the message behind this movie and if your heart isn't deeply touched - go to a psychiatrist and learn how to get back this feeling into your life.If you are able to feel this connection deep in your heart, say thanks for this gift.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Freaking epic! A movie so nice I saw it twice.,"Plot: In 2154, the RDA begins mining on Pandora, a lush tropical planet in some distant galaxy. This planet is populated by the Na'vi, a race of blue, cat-like beings. In order to learn from the Na'vi, the Avatar program was created. In this, a human's mind is transported to that of a genetically created Na'vi. Disabled marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) is the latest to have an Avatar. His mission: learn from the Na'vi clan known as the Omaticaya and try to find a way to remove them from their homes, where a large deposit of a priceless mineral lies. But as Sully becomes attached to the Na'vi, including falling in love with princess Neytiri(Zoe Saldana), he realizes humans are the bad guys and must stop Col. Quaritch(Stephen Lang) and his soldiers from eliminating the Na'vi.James Cameron has done it again! After Oscar-winning epics like Aliens, Terminator 2, and Titanic, he has once again captivated us with a surefire winner. This is a visual feast for the eyes that makes Transformers and 2012 look like indie flicks. The effects are by far the best ever done in film making, and I'm not going overboard. The work on the Na'vi is the most lifelike I've ever seen. These creatures look pretty well like their actors, so that's ten points for motion capture. And Cameron knows how to cast 'em. Among the cast is Wes Studi, Michelle Rodriguez, Joel David Moore, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, CCH Pounder, and Cameron regular Sigourney Weaver who steals most of her scenes. And another grand thing is the score by legendary Oscar winner James Horner, who's also worked on various projects with Cameron. His beats give the film a true native feel. And I fully suggest this be viewed in 3-D, as Cameron's style of filming deserves to only be shown in that way.Last year, there was an incredible film called The Dark Knight, that became an Oscar winning billionaire that was easily the best of '08. Well, lightning might strike twice in the same spot with Avatar. This is the most flawless and satisfying film of the year. And maybe one of the best of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Technically Great- movie So so,"I have to say that Avatar was technically phenomenal. The CGI was great, the details were incredible and the 3D was not slap in the face blunt as are some others. No flashy tricks to try to get the audience- just added an extra dimension to the film.Now for the Movie. Sorry but kind of disappointed. The story was old just a new location. But I can go for that. However the script was not well written. How many times can Zoe Saldana's character say Baby. And though I normally like her work a lot. Thought she was excellent in Star Trek. She was just not that good in this. Her grief scenes were overacted and just not believable.Also- for James Cameron, the guy who brought us stingray aliens in the Abyss, the planet lacked imagination. I mean every animal and plant there could easily be traced back to plants and animals on earth. Didn't he even consider talking to a xenobiologist for ideas on what life could be like on another world.I recommend seeing this for the technical aspects and a glimpse of films to come. However without all the technical tricks the movie just would not stand up. Sorry just one guys opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wow, just... Wow!","I am in love. Not with a character. Not even with an actor. I am in love with the world called Pandora.Rendered in exquisite detail, James Cammeron's world is near perfect in every facet. Of course there are little niggles. The obvious horse and deer analogues seem too close to home, as is the Na'vi's Native-American-like society, the majority of humans are very difficult to identify with and the score is not one of Horner's best, being highly fragmented and even more unoriginal than usual. But all this pales into insignificance next to the huge and undeniably beautiful world in which it is set. The story is functional and gives plenty of room for the flora and fauna to steal your heart, to the point that it will break when the inevitable crisis point is reached. It would surprise me if there were many dry eyes in the house at that point.So I give this film 10 out of 10, not for being perfect, but for what it is: a quantum leap in audience immersion. At no point did I find myself disbelieving the world which was presented me, not for one moment did I think ""this is only CG"". This seamless presentation of an entirely new world will set Avatar's place in the history books and left me wanting more. Much more.So go out and see this film. And then see it again. We are told that Cammeron's decision over the next film he will make will depend on the audience reaction to this film, and with a plan for at least two sequels I can barely wait to see what's next. As possibly the best sequel creator in existence (see Terminator 2 and Aliens) he can't disappoint us now, surely.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm Speechless,"I first heard about James Cameron's ""Avatar"" about three years ago on IMDb, and have been waiting eagerly for it ever since. And now that it's here, I can say that it is definitely worth the wait. ""Avatar"" is nothing short of a masterpiece.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is contacted by the US government to help on a mission: On a new planet called Pandora, some very valuable mineral ore has been discovered, but unfortunately, the largest supply is under a tree where an indigenous people, the Na'vi, live. The government, led by Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi, in full-on big biz asshole mode), wants them to relocate, and to that end, they have enlisted the military to help, led by Col. Quaritch (a chillingly evil Stephen Lang). A scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), is researching the planet and teaching the natives in order to find a more diplomatic solution. To do this, she has created avatars, which are Na'vi which humans, like Sully, can control through a machine. But when Sully becomes accepted by the Na'vi, he finds his loyalties tested.This isn't an actors movie, but the performances work. Sam Worthington is effective in a low-key performance, but he's capable of more volatile acting when the situation calls for it. Zoe Saldana is very good in the role of his teacher/love interest. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific as the money-loving jerk, calling to mind his villainous performance in ""Flight of the Phoenix"" remake, but he's not creepy here, just a jerk. After seeing him in a few previous performances and in the trailer, I had my doubts about Stephen Lang. I was proved wrong though, Quaritch is a nasty piece of work, and a terrific villain. Sigourney Weaver is good as the somewhat bitchy scientist, but she's still sympathetic.This is James Cameron's show, however. The story may be familiar, but a story is only as good as how well it's told. And ""Avatar"" is told brilliantly. Cameron has patience; he knows that the audience is going to be so enamored with visuals that it will be hard for them to concentrate on the story. Cameron allows time for the audience to get used to the visuals before the story really begins, thus two parts of our brain are not battling for control (although the visuals never cease to amaze).The best thing about ""Avatar"" is the sense of excitement. Even the most involving action movies don't get the sense of excitement going, at least not to this level. This is an immensely fun and exciting movie, and a must-see.This is an incredible film; I can't stress that enough. And I can't wait to see it again.Note: I didn't really notice the 3D, but maybe it was because I was sitting kind of far back. Oh well, it's worth it either way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Event picture - Average,"Avatar is an average film with average acting and predictable story lines. (In fact the film is almost the same as Dune and several other sci-fi staples) The special effects are amazing! The graphics beautiful and the 3D stunning, but in the greater scheme of things this has not re-invented cinema, much like Titanic before it, it is an event picture to see, it has pushed the boundaries of cinema technology forward whilst not daring to challenge conventional story or plot development. But it has certainly raised the bar in the wow factor in films.Films like this tend to be super ceded by other technological marvels in a matter of years and then are almost forgotten about with only a few films (those with the story behind them) truly lasting the test of time. Avatar will always have its dedicated fan base but I feel this will wane over time as people see through the graphics to the rather shallow core.Avatar will remain in the consciousness for some time but I don;t think it will ever hold the affection of films such as Star Wars or the first two Terminator films, which whilst they also pushed the boundaries of film technology and story telling they also had a heart to their story making that made them stand out from the rest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
goose bumps EVERYWHERE,"I just got home from my second journey to the planet Pandora and I am still pretty speechless. James Cameron created a wonderful world here that I just can't get enough of.I love movies and have seen a lot good ones in my life but none of them ever got me as much as this one. I can still feel the goose bumps because I pretty much had them over the length of the whole movie, which is also something I have never experienced before.Cameron has done a flawless job in creating the perfect entertainment package with stunning 3D pictures, mind-blowing sound, and heart-touching music. I have to say that I usually talk a lot, even that much that my friends and family are trying to find something I could not find a smart answer to. They have not succeeded until today. While walking out of the theater my girlfriend just asked me how I liked the movie, but all I could answer was ""uhm...well.....wow.""In creating Avatar, James Cameron used state of the art 3D technology to bring these terrific pictures on the screen. If you are thinking of watching the movie in 2D or even only 35mm, you should reconsider. This world just is designed to be seen in 3D.Now the question is whether to watch it in IMAX or RealD 3D. Well I have seen both and think that while the IMAX experience has the superior sound and a bigger screen, the RealD 3D technology creates the better 3D effect. The screen is no longer just a flat surface, with the comfortable RealD 3D glasses on your nose it is a window and it seems like you could just reach through and touch what you see.When you are still arguing with yourself whether to go watch it or not, just do it. I have seen it twice now and I will definitely go and watch it at least one more time, but most likely more than that. It's that good.I think James Cameron has created a glorious and epic adventure here and I can't wait to see more of Jake, Neytiri and the rest of the Na'vi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
In one word - EXCELLENT,"To be honest I had no real ambition to see this film - to me the promos made it look like a teenage, computer game type film. A friend asked me to go along and see it in 3D and because it was an excuse to get out of the 35 degree heat and intense humidity I went. I am so glad I did. It truly blew me away, not just the visuals which were AMAZING - sometimes hard to tell what was CG and what was real but the story and underlying themes which was so intense and reflected in a futuristic way what has happened over the centuries and to this day here on earth. James Cameron you are a genius, firstly by casting mainly unknowns in the lead roles meant you weren't focused on the likes of a Hugh Grant or Julia Roberts, you actually felt these people were real and not actors. But act they certainly can and Sam Worthington the future must look great for you (hey I am Aussie & I am biased!). Secondly by having an underlying message in the film which will leave you cheering one minute and crying the next he achieves truly breathtaking visuals with a believable story and a strong message bordering on criticism of the human race and it's unbelievable greed and stupidity. To sum up - very hard to fault, great acting, amazing visuals and a MUST SEE movie that will surprise you on so many levels and maybe leave you speechless - ENJOY!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Now this is amazing,"The King of the World has returned! Mr. James Cameron's youngest ""Avatar"" is a mind-blowing adventure and the most impressive and intricate work of art, I've ever seen.When his twin brother is killed, disabled ex-Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is recruited to aid a mining expedition on the distant jungle moon of Pandora as only his DNA will bond with the alien hybrid body, known as an Avatar, that allows humans to breathe the toxic air. With orders to infiltrate the Na'vi, Jake finds himself falling in love with native girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).""Avatar'"" was created twelve years ago by Cameron, but was ahead of its time. Cameron had to shelve the project and wait for technology to catch up to the script he had written. In 2005 Cameron thought he was close enough to push the technology to tell the story he always wanted to tell and went back to work. It cost Jim blood, sweat and tears and of course a lot of money, but the result is just fascinating, mesmerizing. Money well spent.I am really happy that the movie turned out great. Not just for Jim's sake or because it had been a while since I'd seen a really good movie, but because of all the ""Avatar"" haters out there. All of those people who were trashing the movie before even watching it. They didn't give the movie a chance and let everyone believe that the movie was going to be really bad.Well, they were all wrong and I hope they are honest enough to admit that. OK, maybe the love story wasn't really original, but it worked. However, if the story doesn't work for you, everything else will make up for it. When you watch the movie in 3D it becomes a transcendent and amazing experience that's the closest you will ever come to setting foot on a strange new world. The length of the movie is 2 hours and 41 minutes, but it looked a lot shorter. I wanted more. I just didn't want it to stop. It was that good.I advise them and everyone to give the movie a chance and watch it the way it was mend to be watched, in 3D. You won't regret it! Oh yeah, I almost forgot. When you're watching the movie, it's completely normal to be attracted to Neytiri Â Right? Heck even Jim says he's attracted to the Na'vi creatures!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure cheese,"**** CONTAINS SPOILERS******* I'd like my 3D with less cheese please Mr Cameron! I walked out of the theater with the same bitter feeling as when I saw the Star Wars prequel whatever it was called the Phantom something. The feeling of having witnessed a complete failure I wanted so badly to enjoy. It all starts with that cheesy voice over. Usually a bad sign, but I was crossing my fingers the guy is a maestro, a genius, a pure talent, after all I heard in the media. 20 minutes of miserable acting and unbelievably lame lines that belong to a B TV series later, I start doubting the reviews. Characters who are supposed to have been living together for months start explaining to each other why they are here, who they are etc... in a very contrived and unsophisticated way that make it all very laughable. The hero is played by a bloke who belongs to an afternoon TV series, and is described as a stupid marine. Impossible to even start liking him. I started asking myself whether the genius had made a comedy. But no, the rest of the picture was undoubtedly first degree cheese. We were not supposed to laugh. Then this big animal a giant black alien panther with 6 legs comes out of the jungle for a chase, I cheer up: the masterpiece starts here! A cool chase in the woods, our hero is separated from his patrol without means of communication and runs for his life in the jungle. His patrol leaves him behind. There is nothing they can do. The hero miraculously escapes by jumping in a waterfall. You'd think that his fellow soldiers would deem him dead after leaving him alone to deal with a giant panther in the middle of a an unknown jungle. No. The officer as if he had seen the movie fears: ""he won't make it through the night"". That's when I started thinking that there was something deeply rotten in Avatar: the script. It feels it has been written in a rush or by a talentless beginner, or someone whose power in the project was such that nobody would dare tell him the blinding truth: if you are over 12 years old, you cannot believe one minute of Avatar because it's too cheesy. The script is not at par with the budget, nor the CGI . The fact that it makes so much money at the box will certainly make the author(s) brush any criticism away. Regardless of the box, avatar is a scandal of a script. Then the rest of the movie is just a confirmation that what makes a bad movie is a bad story. It becomes an endless retelling of Dances with wolves, itself a cheesy retelling of Little big man etc. As usual it needs a white man to tell the Indians how to fight back, they're too under-developed, naive and primitive you see. With a few differences: the Indians are now the color the soldiers of the cavalry used to be, ie blue, they have rastafari dreadlocks, cats eyes and mouse ears and they are saved not only by Kevin Costner but also by the buffalos this time. The Buffalos join forces as they have learned their lesson: they understand what Buffalo Bill will do to them later on if they don't do anything. Many similarities still with your usual John Wayne western: the horses, the broncos they tame, the arrows the costumes and the squaws. But no Wayne. No actors at all. Our tasteless hero is accepted by the Indians, God only knows why, no explanation is given, except their sheer stupidity and he is taught how to become an Indian himself through a 30 minutes montage of boring sequences with no dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is the usual celebration of testosterone and violence, the usual Hollywood dubious self-defense violence you find in any action movies except this one is lecturing us on its anti violence anti war stance. It still exploits an hour of pure violence to make money. End of story: the usual showdown between our dummy boy hero and the baddie, a ridiculous body builder GI Joe. A movie is as good as its baddie, Disney used to say . Well look at the baddie here: you'll know how bad Avatar is. The hero saves the Indians who without him would be toast, they're so crass and stupid, those ""savages"", a stupid marine makes all the difference. I watched all this mess with a pair of heavy 3D glasses which darken the picture and leave a mark on your nose so everybody you meet within the next two hours ask you whether you've just seen avatar, it's so red in the middle of your face. They say it's 21st century cinema. It may well be, but when the novelty of the technique wears off, they'd better start hiring scriptwriters. I am not going back any time soon. I don't care about the 3D, I want to see a good movie please! The quality of the dialogs and the fun of the Ice Age or Nemo make those cartoons enjoyable for all. Avatar is only for kids who enjoy violent video games and do not care for any story or characters. I heard people say Avatar is beautiful. Avatar's conception of beauty is ""when it glows in the dark"". Like stars you stick on kids bedrooms ceilings. I'm way too old for fluorescent deco. There is good news in Avatar's box office: it is probably scaring the hell out of LA talent agencies who got used to making millions off star power. People seem happy with 3D without cast. It may be the only 21st century news in the picture.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A masterpiece of entertainment, heroism, romanticism, and environmentalism","To be honest, I didn't expect too much from Avatar at the first glance when I saw the poster with dark-green aliens. I simply couldn't trust the media after all of their PR cheap technique. Still I decided to come to see Avatar for all the positive reviews it received regarding the 3D technology. And I was speechless.Not only was the movie good in terms of 3D visualization, but it also has certain layers of meaning that I found intriguing and worth watching.The theme is not new. It is a story about the relationship between human and environment. But what is new is how the story is portrayed in the movie.The Na'vi's world is our dream world. A world filled with beauty and interconnection all around, the thing that mankind have long lost in exchange for our technological development. ""Avatar"" is a metaphor for what we have all dreamed of somehow: a better world, in tune with environment and nature. And James Cameron didn't preach us; he just brought us to that world to witness its beauty and to reflect back on our world, on how we are treating mother nature.Cameron posed a question to the audience: are we really who we are? It's hard to answer; sometimes we just want to dwell in a world where we can live as our original self, wild but free. Technological developments does not guarantee happiness; and in fact, that is the lesson probably we all learned, in a hard way. Probably, we all hope that somehow our world can preserve some of it beauties like the Na'vi in Pandora.Despite an unoriginal motif, I still could not resist but give this movie a rating of 10. What else could you say of it? It brings you to a new world, that's enough after all!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Absolute Masterpiece,"James Cameron has never failed me. Ever. So what if he takes 10 years to make a film? So what if the limited screen shots of Avatar showed weird blue aliens? I believed. I believed it would amaze. I stood in line at midnight and was rewarded with an unbelievable 3D experience that may never be rivaled. I am so thrilled when a movie arrives that actually warrants the hype behind it.Avatar and the world of Pandora is a wonder. Every blade of grass, every animal fits seamlessly alongside the real-world actors. Never before has CGI looked SO REAL! The 3D aspect makes the film come alive. When the characters walk across a tree limb hundreds of feet in the air, you can look down and feel it! You soar through the air and ride the wind. You are most certainly along for the ride.Science fiction is about story-telling. It allows you the freedom to tell a story without limitations. I do not believe in spoilers so I will be careful of what I say, but many people complained that the story was nothing special. To these people I say, James Cameron told a story about the interference of cultures. How imposing oneself and one's beliefs into a world can have consequences. He told a story that would have been at home in any science fiction story from Ray Bradbury to Philip K. Dick. Cameron told this ""basic"" story (and love story) with such stunning clarity, power, and sheer film-making thrill that I cannot believe any would fault him for being un-original. Especially in a film this ground-breaking.This film was the opening salvo in a movie making revolution. 3D powered blockbusters may be the wave of the future. In the here and now, James Cameron is once again king of the world and leading the way.From Aliens, The Abyss, and the Terminator series (HIS TWO FILMS!!!) this man is THE MAN you want directing a science fiction epic. He has topped them all with Avatar. Stunning, masterful, every other superlative. I only hope the next wait is slightly less than 12 years...Either way, it will be worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Congratulations Mr. Cameron - Quite Possibly The Most Over-Rated Movie Ever!!,"There have been so many reviews and comments made about this film that I simply had to see it. The fans insist that everybody should see it. So in order to honestly judge this blockbuster I have watched it.That was my first mistake, the second was not getting up and asking for my money back, the third was to allow the film to be force fed to me till the bitter end.Oh good god, where do I start....... breathing is more complicated than this tripe.The horrifically basic story is force fed to the audience at a rate of knots. Leaving most of us, with half an ounce of sense, a dribbling mess by the end.The sheer arrogance that Cameron has shows in this film is quite frankly second to none. It treats the audience as complete imbeciles.The movie is so clearly aimed at the simple masses I have to congratulate him and his team on their success. I am utterly astonished that the public has graced this film in the way they have. How they have watched this and raved about it is beyond me.The CGI displayed in Avatar is OK, but that's about it. Too much like looking at a cartoon. When you do get to see some live action - it looks too obviously different. There has been many a gorgeous film that has used CGI as a tool to further the vision, why Avatar simply hides behind it only becomes apparent when you uncover the script and story in the first five minutes.It is no different than buying a car with a nice paint-job, but no engine. Yeah, it looks great but you try and drive it.This will sound crazy but, after numerous years of planning the final result seems rushed. Like they got to the end, stood back nodding sagely at the pretty CG and thought.......""Damn, we forgot the script, story, actors.......!!"" Some may think my review a little harsh, but seriously it comes down to how films are marketed and reviewed. If this was marketed as a cheap sci-fi action flick - I may have changed my tune. To push this as the best film ever than will change cinema as we know it..... Come on, let's be sensible..... That was stretching the imagination a little too far. The viewer is already pre-loaded with this expectation of a film that in theory cannot go wrong, yet when you see it....... it fails on virtually every level.If you like movies with substance, avoid this like the plague. If you like movies that are the cinematic equivalent of a lobotomy, with a shiny paint-job, then go right ahead - but don't say I didn't warn you!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Greatest Cinema Experience and Best Movie Ever Made.,"James Cameron's Avatar is basically the best movie I have ever seen, and now every other movie doesn't even come close as being as good. The setting of the movie takes place on Pandora, a lush, green planet filled with mystical creatures including the humanoids called the Na'vi. This place is so beautiful and magical to watch, especially at night where all plants and even the ground light up majestically. A little while into the movie I could tell what was going to happen but there are enough little twists to keep it exciting and not make it feel clichÃ©. I found myself falling in love with the characters and the Na'vi people. I have been twice to this movie in 3D and I could go 5 more times. All in all, I don't really need to say much in this review and I don't feel I need to convince anyone to go see this movie, just go see it, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Does anyone remember Ferngully?,"First off, this was more than just a movie. ""Avatar"" will be known as the event that changed how we experience films from now on. Yeah, the 3D was amazing but the action, vivid colors, mind-blowing scenery, and sheer sense of reality was overwhelming. I easily rate this movie a 10, one I hope to watch soon in Imax 3D. Now comes the interesting part. While I watched the movie I had an odd sense of deja vue, like I'd seen this plot before. On the way out of the theater I asked my girlfriend how she liked it. She said it reminded her of ""Ferngully"". For those of you not familiar with that film, it was a cute, animated good vs. evil kinda movie from the early 80's where this human guy shrinks to the size of a fairy and meets up in this forest where all these other little folk live and whose environment is threatened by an evil, possessed logging machine. And there's many other parallels. I'm wondering how much of ""Avatar"" was really imagined by Mr. Cameron and how much may have been influenced by this kid flick from almost 30 years ago. So if you have a lazy afternoon, get ahold a copy of ""Ferngully"" and THEN go see ""Avatar"". The similarities will make you laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Singular Imaginative Instant Classic,"Quick..When was the last time you saw a movie that resonated with you and captured your imagination so viscerally that you could barely wait to see it again? Not sure about you guys, but in this day of cookie cutter, by the numbers, based on a graphic novel/comic book crap, I can honestly say I can't remember a movie that left such an indelible imprint . To say that the film, on a wholly visual level, is breathtaking would be woefully inadequate. I will just add my sentiments to the plethora of other reviewers and say that Avatar is like nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, I have ever seen. From the fully realized, lush and incredibly detailed environment of Pandorum to the incredibly lifelike cgi for the Na'vi humonoid race, all of Cameron's considerable talents as an effects wizrad of the first order are on full display here.Not since Smeagle in the Lord of the a Rings trilogy have we seen such startlingly lifelike and expressive cgi characters as the Na'vi. And Make no mistake, the Na'vi ARE the undisputed stars of this movie! Lithe,graceful,agile and capable of conveying intricate facial expressions and subtle emotions like nothing else ever animated, you'll find yourself almost forgetting about the actual human characters in the movie ( i agree with the critics who complain that they could've been fleshed out more) and savoring every single interaction between the aliens and Jake Sullys avatar. At nearly 3 hours long, Avatar is one of those rare movie going experiences that envelops you in such a way that you lose track of the time. Definitely not a movie that I'd take impatient childen under 8 to go see, but older kids will absolutely marvel at the cinematic acheivemant on display. And thus concludes my MANGUSHING for the year. Glad I saved it for such a film. Now go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is so difficult to achieve in a movie specially when it's 3 hours long! Everything was just so well made,the characters, the different places.. Just so beautiful! I am just so happy that I got to see such a gorgeous movie.congratulations for this production... I could see this movie over and over again! I recommend it to everyone..",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too long, too trite and too loud","Yes, the special effects were impressive - but they just went on too long. The first segment, where she was teaching him about Pandora, had some magnificent effects, but I really did not need 20 minutes to get the point. Then, the first ""war"" although horrible enough in its unreasonable ferocity of modern war power against the natives with only arrows and spears was followed up with another one, even more horrible, purely for the sake of the special effects. I was holding my ears and closing my eyes, the mass destruction of these wonderful people was all too close to the American destruction of the native American Indians, with all its destructiveness. There was no character development, the acting was so simplistic, the plot formulaic, the dialog trite and simple.I wanted to like this film, but was ready to leave about half way though - and if Cameron had held to a disciplined directing mode it would only have been half as long and a much better picture.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wow, really very good","I was beyond impressed, this movie was good in so many ways that it is hard to know where to start... So I guess it will be with the CG - These were by far the best effects I have seen in an movie, the integration of both live action and animation was seamless, I recommend it to be seen in 3D, because I caught myself swatting at what was 3D bugs flying around. The storyline was long but kept me involved so as not to become bored, and though I was warned it was kind of a ""Tree Hugger movie"" I did not get that, there was much more to the story than that, and should wake people up to how we should treat each other. My nest step is to see it again in IMAX-3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"2D Or Not 2D, That is the question...","The answer is a resounding, unequivocal, no! Do NOT ""wait until it comes out on DVD"" to see this film. This film must be seen in HD 3D. This is not to say that the film is carried by the CGI or other special effects, it just wouldn't be the same experience. And that's what this film is above all, an experience.Ever since I was a boy and watched in awe as Neil Armstrong took the first steps on the moon, I realized, with sadness, that humans would never visit another planet in my lifetime. I was wrong. My dream has been fulfilled. I didn't just see a movie about another planet, I was ON another planet. Avatar breathed life into the planet Pandora in a way no other movie has even come close to achieving.The detractors say, ""well, Cameron cheated, it was all just CGI and special effects."" That's like saying Van Gogh cheated when he painted 'Starry Night' because he used paint and brushes'. Yes, there were special effects, but those effects are just an empty canvas and a box of paints until a master like James Cameron applies the strokes so vividly, so beautifully, from his imagination to the screen. The same folks are calling it Dances with Pochahantas meets Ferngully meets Matrix meets blah, blah, blah. Why, because the story has classical themes that people have been drawn to since the time of the first cave drawings to Homer to Shakespeare? That's what makes them classics. Their truths are universal and enduring over the ages and cross-culturally.Should it win Best Picture? Absolutely, but comparing it to other movies in the Best Picture category is like comparing apples to Oldsmobiles. It's just not a fair fight. It's an experience, not just a movie.I could go on, but I won't. The acting was solid, but probably not in award contention. The writing, directing, art direction, aliens, life forms were compelling and fantastic. I will endeavor to see Avatar again before it leaves theaters. This movie may stay in theaters for another year, and if it doesn't it will be re-released in 2011 because it MUST be seen in the way it was shot and intended to be seen. Even the Flomax crowd will stay in their seats for the nearly 3 hour journey. Time flies when you are in another world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The bar has been raised,"There's literally no point to watching this movie in the standard 2-D format. The movie is special in 3-D because only then will the audience see all the nuance details and effects that were intended to be experienced by Cameron. The story is nothing special, albeit more realistic since the bad guys aren't really ""bad"" in the traditional Disney movie, cookie cutter sense. There are some environmental issues that one must wrestle with during and after the movie, but perhaps this is not a bad thing. That is not to say the movie's story is bad, it's quite good that I believed in the emotional depth of the characters who were essentially figments of someone else's imagination projected into digital reality. However, it could be better, and improving the content is a task that future filmmakers must face if they are to truly push the frontier. With that said, the main innovation of this movie is the 3-D storytelling which significantly enhances the movie-going experience. In Cameron's other work Titanic, there was a great ""sunset."" With Avatar, I hope this is the ""dawn"" of a new era in cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The new standard for 10 in the 1-10 scale.,"James Cameron is now finally back after 12 years in solitude, with a new stunning cinema experience not only perfect in every aspect a movie can be, but it is also shown to us in 3D (3D for this movie is Mandatory, it elevates your experience tenfold). To begin with, a story which is flawless, visualized in the best possible way, actors who play their roles with a personal best, the character development is great, you really are taken in by them and after 2 hours it feels like you're a part of this epic adventure. The soundtrack provided by James Horner is the best I've heard for many many years, if not even the best. The digital effects too are flawless, when they told us this will take CGI to a whole new level, they weren't kidding.Focusing on the story and such, I loved the way they showed us the humans. They didn't have any super-Ã¼ber-spacey laser cannons or something like it, and they had to take years to travel there. The gunships too were pretty realistic. propelled, not equipped with a fancy super-jet-engine-like-in-star wars. The aspect of the humans and their technology wasn't exaggerated, and I find that good, since I'm tired of Star wars and lasers and plasma guns and light speed and force fields and God knows what.The first part was a bit boring though, like the first 30-40 minutes when the introduction to everyone is made, but after that it starts climbing upwards, and believe me, the ascension doesn't stop. I don't know words to describe this movie. Perfect, flawless. An even greater masterpiece made by James Cameron. He knows how to make the crowd love all the characters, good or bad, and how to make a movie exciting, detailed and fortunately, how to make good sequels.I know a few whiners that told me this movie suck, and such people is the kind who always have to find something to complain about, like if their opinion would look more professional if they didn't like it. 8.8 is a fact. top #24 is also a fact. Don't listen to these people, at least the rest of the world loved it ;)I'm heartbroken for the scale is just 1-10, I would have given this 15 if I could.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Will people PLEASE get a grip?  Greatest film of all time??!!!!,"It's been years since I've made a comment of a film on IMDb.com, but having read comments on here about Avatar being 'the greatest film ever made - period', 'Must be #1 on IMDb or so much more' or words to that effect I felt compelled to say a few words.I saw Avatar yesterday in 3D and went with no expectations. First thing I have to say is that it is by far the most technically jaw dropping film I have ever seen. It is truly astonishing effects-wise and a visual feast. However, there are a very very long list I could write of better films - in fact the more I think of it, The Terminator, Terminator 2 and Aliens (films I have seen many times) are better films from the same director. As wonderful as visual spectacle that Avatar was, the story was so rehashed, weak and, I genuinely hate to say it, I found myself bored at point in this unevenly paced effort.I would still urge anyone to see it and draw their own conclusions - it's a visual masterpiece but comes at the expense of a really good plot, story, character development etc. It's not a bad story by any stretch of the imagination but it's nowhere near good enough to merit the praise this film is getting. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A new cinematic experience,"So, finally, I have watched AVATAR and with it, all the anticipation, expectations end.And believe me, all that deafening publicity campaign had not been for nothing. The movie gives you everything you expect and more.After the release, I read some reviews stating that the story is not new and not high on emotional content. I would say that, though, the story is not something out of the blue and is somewhat predictable but its not bad, in fact its very good. The mega publicity revealed everything, people knew the key points of story in advance and that is why such negative things were felt and said by a few.AVATAR is a very good science-fiction which combines in its story, science and spirituality to present before us, a truly spectacular picture. The CGI effects are mind-blowing and would not let you blink your eyes. I felt slight pain in my eyes after 45 minutes or so as I was trying to behold the beauty of Pandora and in order straining my eyes. I am sure this happened with most of the viewers.The Na'vis created with the help of motion-capture technology looked more real than the human beings. Neytiri(female Na'vi, played by Zoe Saldana) in particular, looked incredibly sexy. The fantastic 3D, sometimes makes you feel as if the fauna shown is in real moving before you.The first half is dedicated to the exploration of Pandora and the romance between Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) and Neytiri. Jake Sully is assigned to learn the native ways and persuade them to move to different place as it contains rich deposits of a mineral Unobtanium which is the reason humans are there. The natives are not ready to buzz off as in that place, their most sacred tree is there. This leads to a war between the corporation and the natives. Jake Sully joins natives' side and leads them against humans. The action sequences are great with some hand-to-hand combat scenes being fantastic.In performance, Stephen Lang tops in his role of a military commander followed by Sigourney Weaver. Sam Worthington once against gets a big film with not much to do in human form, most of the things he does in AVATAR form. Others also provide good support.Music by James Horner is superb and aids the film very well.But, the most astounding work is done by the CGI effects team which has given never-seen-before visuals.And above all, the man responsible for all this sensational work is the one who gave us films like Terminator2 and Titanic, the greatest films of their times. James Cameroon has proved that such a long waiting was worth waiting for.With regard to the ongoing climate discussions, the movie doesn't preaches anything but conveys its message subtly that we have been responsible for all the nonsense happening to Earth which needs to be understood by our so called superpowers and world leaders.AVATAR is for fantasy lovers and fantasy lovers should not try to review it.Another thing, the sensuality of Neytiri indicates that after some time computer generated characters might replace human actors.Finally, AVATAR is a must watch and must in 3D only.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Painfully predictable,"The most clichÃ© ridden movie I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. This is the result of James Cameron taking the most transparent parts of proceeding Oscar winnings films, sticking them into a blender and pouring the resulting clichÃ© milkshake onto film. It is tedious beyond belief. Within 10 minutes one can easily predict what will happen. I've seen less predictable episodes of The Brady Bunch. I wont rant about the one dimensional characters, done to death plot or the name of the mineral (unobtanium ??!?!?! hahahaha sorry), they've been covered adequately in other reviews.Let me just say pretty does not mean brilliant. Because pretty it is. However if I want pretty, I'll take a short trip to the country side. I wanted 3 hours of entertainment. Not 3 hours of staring at a rainbow.Avoid if you have a semblance of intelligence and expect artists to be creative.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
There are movies and there is an AVATAR,"I saw rather experienced AVATAR yesterday at a preview show in my city. I want to start of by saying that every once in a while there are experiences which shake us so much from within that we tend to live in them even when the moment has passed.I am not shy to admit that I am smitten by Avatar's blue Bug.Movies like Jurassic Park, Titanic, T2, Alien are the grade of movies which stay with audience or in their conception even when they are out of the multiplexes.Avatar is one such movie which adds on to the list.The excitation of having a preview show ticket and anticipation of watching something really out of the world was gripping and I was speechless along with the rest of the Audi when Mr James Cameron unleashed his splendor of Mythical characters which were totally out of bounds of anyone's imagination.I have never seen so many colors so lively on screen at once. It was so mystical and beyond conception from our minds, yet the cinematography convinced me that a world alike exists with all the blooms and primes of nature in its full flow.(Kudos to the tech team behind it) CGI and the Detailing are wondrous(The best seen till date, compared to anything seen on screen). Every Character was given its own attention and distinct presence, which really added up to the splendor which was so grand that only IMAX could have captured it in its full flow and form. Watch Avatar for what it is(though its not the best Plot supporting the best Visuals seen till date). However, 3- D's and effects do take you to almost real world which is rather Alien to us. You just cant miss SUCH a revolution on Cinema platter.I give it 9 on 10 because I don't want to end it saying that its the perfect movie ever made. Because Avatar takes the experience of movie watching to a new epitome.And Since its now widely accepted that this is a Revolution, it only makes me hungry for more of this; may be something which strikes bolt in our spines once again.I am hungry for more. Hope you listening Mr Cameron!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The future of CGI! But it ain't the future of pacing.,"I am a huge fan of James Cameron. I love all of his movies that he's directed....even this one. This movie was truly amazing. Truly! But it did have some slow scenes and sometimes I felt it was 40-50 mins too long.The story was well told...it was very different. Trying to keep it where it very real and not trying to make it so over the top where the audience just goes ""That is not the future at all."" This could happen in hundreds of years from now. Very believable stuff.The acting was fantastic. Even Michelle Rodriguize was fantastic! Every character served a purpose. No one ever felt pointless or left out. What I also liked about the movie is that even the action scenes (including fight scenes) were never overdone and it didn't try too hard to make it so action packed. Everything was just perfect...again...except the pacing.Excluding the slow pacing....this movie was fantastic. Fantastic last fight scene too! This movie is pure imagination! I hope it at least wins one Oscar. It should be nominated for 12 Oscars lol.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible: 10,"This movie was hyped. A lot. More than probably any other movie in history. This hype eventually piled up so high that the film itself could never catch up. But, shockingly enough, it came damned close to doing just that. Like Star Wars and The Matrix before it, this film marked the beginning of a new generation of visual effects, and like those films, delivers enough in other areas to leave an impression that was more than just skin deep. Despite this movie's singular flaw (the script), this cinematic titan delivered more than enough thrills to compensate for James Cameron's occasionally iffy writing.It also does something that no other film has managed to do before: it truly makes you feel like you are there, in its world, and you find yourself filled with a genuine sense of wonder as you try to take in Pandora's rich flora and fauna. The quality of the special effects has been discussed to death already, but this is the factor that anchors the film, the aspect of it that was the main source of the astronomical anticipation (other than the name ""James Cameron""). However, if visual splendor serves as this movie's anchor, then the ship is built mainly from two materials: story and acting. The story (or, more accurately, stories), though they have been told countless times before, seem to never fail to leave a mark on audiences, and the resonance of one in particular is felt almost too strongly today. The clash of science, commerce, and militarism make for some great scenes of dialogue and tension, and add a philosophical aspect to the film, especially taking the constant contrast between the human Pandora and Na'vi Pandora into account.Of course, the world of Pandora wouldn't be at all believable without characters populating it, and the actors fit their respective roles like gloves. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana work incredibly well together onscreen, and truly bring their roles to life with some of the most underappreciated performances of 2009. One final part of the movie that I feel was the most unappreciated is the soundtrack. James Horner's best yet, it combines most of the best aspects of modern orchestral scores with those of traditional tribal melodies to match the setting of Pandora, and as a result is some of the most purely beautiful music anyone who cares to download the soundtrack will ever hear. Though you only leave Pandora just under 3 hours after you arrive, Pandora will not leave you for a considerably longer period of time. While it may not have been the best film of 2009 in terms of raw quality, its emotional impact, outstanding direction, and truly spectacular eye candy easily make it one of the most entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A for effects, D for hackneyed story and dialog","Just got back from watching Avatar and I have to say I was impressed with the 3d and the digital characters. The story, on the other hand, was comically bad.The 3d didn't work for everything, but it work the best when it was used for dust and particles. It really drew you into the image. The digital characters were better visually than Gollum in the LOTR films, though the ""character"" Gollum had nothing in Avatar that was even close.Visually, probably the best I've seen. Story, characters, and dialog, among the cheesiest films I've seen. (and not good cheese, like Army of Darkness) I don't know if it was worth the $ to see in the theater, but sure as heck wouldn't bother to rent or buy the DVD.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Thirteen Years Later, Avatar Remains a Visual-First Affair","Landing at the convergence point between the advent of uncanny CGI capabilities and the peak of the 3D movie revival, Avatar was the right film at the right time to reap a swath of popular rewards. For one season in 2009, it seemed like everyone in the world was going to see this movie. Often more than once. It's the type of cultural lightning most mainstream filmmakers dream of bottling, then spend the rest of their careers chasing. Writer / director James Cameron showed tremendous foresight (and maybe an awful lot of luck) in waiting for the right moment to unleash his vision, having conceived the basic idea a decade earlier, and now may be showing a tremendous lack of the same in scheduling four very-belated sequels. But that's beside the point. For now, the future of this franchise remains unwritten and I'm just here to assess the ground level.As plots go, the first Avatar entry is simplistic and naÃ¯ve. We see the glaring character archetypes for what they are, right away, and the blanks essentially fill themselves. The mean, self-centered industrial types can never understand the unspoken bond their mindful, tribal counterparts share with the land. Greed imposes upon empathy, inciting armed conflict. It's essentially a Captain Planet episode. Shades of gray pepper both sides of the argument, so there is a bit more depth here than in a Saturday morning cartoon, but not much. It's entry-level writing, establishing a rudimentary threat and then working loose suspense until the third act. Avatar's storyline will neither surprise nor enlighten, but that's not what sold the show, anyway.The film's real strength is in its knack for attentive world-building and its celebration of bright, colorful artistic representation. If this didn't look like it does, teem with life as it does, exploit the 3D craze as effectively as it does (Or as it did? Does anyone still watch 3D movies?), it wouldn't have landed with a fraction of the magnitude it once did. Its affinity for bright color and unusual hues, almost completely foreign in the cinematic language of the time, might be its most influential feature. Certainly, the creative minds behind Guardians of the Galaxy took notes and continued the trend. And the alien landscape of Pandora is exhaustively developed and realized. It buzzes, both literally and metaphorically, with biology. When the protagonist is staggered by his first exposure to the local fauna, we're staggered right alongside him. In this sense, it often feels like the cart has lapped the horse; like the storyline took a third-row seat behind the tantric urge to flesh everything out. So, while the spectacle of watching that six-legged, gill-breathing equine critter live and move is absolutely magical, its actual role in the story is limited to... er... living and moving for a few slow-paced scenes. After that, it's background fodder. The same is true of almost everything else on the map. There's an abundance of dazzling creativity, but no great underlying substance beyond the ""hey, we're all like, connected, maaan"" mumbo-jumbo. We're mesmerized by the beasts' intrinsic majesty, but any meaning we might take beyond the superficial is purely viewer-appointed. It's a billion-dollar tech demo, a wonderful place to dwell and take inspiration, nothing more and nothing less.And hey, that's not the end of the world. Sometimes it's okay to cast aside a deeper meaning and a richer cast in favor of a different set of features. I love non-narrative art films like Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka. However, the trouble with relying so completely upon this brand of visual fidelity and computer imagery is, eventually, those bills come due. And, while Avatar's trees and airborne jellyfish and spinning, glowing lizard thingies have weathered the past thirteen years marvelously, its blue humanoid representatives are already showing their age. And those guys chew a vast majority of the screen time. As they continue to degrade, so does the associated movie magic, leaving audiences with a meager, barebones plot for sustenance. That just isn't a recipe for success. This felt thin but spectacular in the theater, but now? It's fading. How will it look in another thirteen years? How will the sequels?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A movie experience like no other,"My family and I were completely blown away by this film - more, rather, a film EXPERIENCE like no other that has been in the cinema before. It was absolutely spell-binding, and especially in 3-D and shown on the largest IMAX screen in London, England. Moreovoer, my wife and I found it not only a totally gripping film experience but also to be a very emotional film and story indeed.My strongest advice to anyone wishing to see this film is this: DO NOT read anything about the film or its story before you go to the cinema. Simply, DO NOT. Instead, go the cinema with a 'blank canvas' of a mind and allow the film and its magical story to wash over you and unfold.Interestingly and throughout, I spotted how this film, in a review, could also be called ""Avatar"" meets ""A Man Called Horse"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" meets ""The Lost World"" meets ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"". That is, put simply, there is clear evidence in the film how certain cultural influences have obviously had an effect on the director James Cameron over the years. As such, he deserves all the credit and congratulations he receives for such a truly masterful work.

Special effects and soul,"2009 has been a year of soulless special effects films- Transformers 2, and GI Joe come to mind in particular. Military-centric and lacking in anything resembling a real character, it depressed me to find such emotionally cold film-making was making so much money.James Cameron is the remedy.As a director, he has often very successfully managed to balance intriguing and exciting film premises with human elements that made you care for characters- he has an amazing way of making you invest in the people he created.But Avatar, for me, represents a more mature James Cameron. In Aliens and True Lies Cameron, much like the Michael Bays of today, had a boyish fascination with weaponry and the technology of war. Now James Cameron, the man, expresses his disgust at these objects. This is NOT a worship of firepower- it is a damning indictment of it.Avatar has a story that acts as analogy for many things- colonialism, America's supposed war on terror, labelling Palestine's resistance fighters as terrorists, the human desire for profit vs the human need for environmental preservation. It is very much a product of our time, and it is hugely passionate in its execution. In my mind Avatar represents Cameron's rage.More that this, when we hear the horrified and angry screams of an invaded population, we hear our own frustration. The film had me in tears at some points, because of the clarity and resonance of its message.The film is not all doom and gloom- it is inspiring also. It demonstrates there exist universal principles that transcend race or allegiance of country, it celebrates spirituality, and abhors the arrogance of men and their guns. There were moments when the film gave me goosebumps.Please see this film if it feels like the world around you doesn't always show the humanity you feel it should, if you don't understand why people's lives are so expendable in the pursuit of oil, land or empty victory. It is a strangely validating experience to find so many of your feelings so poetically reflected. Thank you Mr Cameron.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The dawn of a new era in entertainment,"Avatar is James Cameron's science fiction epic that has broken the mold for movie making. For years we have been hearing great things about the progress and set backs for this film. Since 1997, Cameron has yet to release a feature length film, excluding some of his work with IMAX and his documentary/3D films like Ghosts of the Abyss. 12 years after he broke all of the box office records with Titanic, the most successful film of all time, Cameron has come back with a bang. A big bang. Possibly the biggest bang in cinema history.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic Marine, is sent to a distant planet to follow up in his brothers footsteps. The planet is Pandora. A world filled with strange, magnificent fauna and flora. It's a world filled with vibrant colors, breathtaking landscapes, and a tribe of intelligent life called the Na'vi. Underneath their village lies a rich deposit of a very rare and profitable metal. In order to avoid a hostile takeover, the military has permitted Dr. Grave Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her Avatar program to try and persuade the locals through education, compromise, and good will that they are not to be feared. The program takes the DNA from the Navi and humans and combines them to create Avatars. These Avatars allow those whose DNA is in the Avatar to plug in andDr. Augustine's science department is at wits end with Colonel Miles Quatrich (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), the forces driving the drilling and military presence. They share one thing in common; an interest in Jake Sully. Sully and has his hands in both pots. He is the only person who can operate his brother's Avatar and he has an obligation to serve his military superiors. Sully is put in the difficult situation of making contact with the Na'vi and giving information to both Dr. Augustine and to Colonel Quatrich.I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot and the characters. That was the one part of the movie I wasn't too excited about at the onset of the film, but as the story played out, I became more and more involved and grew to accept and understand the story. It sounds and looks almost too ridiculous, but trust me, it works.I have seen a lot of science fiction movies. I have seen a lot of 3D movies. Never before have I seen a movie like this before. The clarity in the depth of vision Cameron creates is astounding. A friend of mine compared it to looking through a window, rather than the movie popping out of the screen towards you. I couldn't agree more. Needless to say, Cameron waited just the right amount of time to make this one.What make the visuals so outstanding is the attention to detail on each individual effect. Everything from the mountains and tree tops in the background all the way through the foreground is so clear and detailed. It's astounding! From the very first moments of the film when Sully is lying down and water droplets surround him, every scene has something to wow the audience.The cast has a wide variety of actors, the biggest of which is Weaver. I expected a solid performance from her but I was surprised by Worthington, whose only screen credit I had seen prior to this was Terminator: Salvation. Lang and Ribisi too give excellent performances. Even Michelle Rodriguez does a fine job. The actors that we can't see, like Zoe Saldana and Wes Studi, do a fine job as some of the the Na'vi leads.I felt a certain enjoyment that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was like watching Batman or Jurassic Park again for the first time. A kind of thrill that you experience on a roller coaster. There is so much to fall in love with here. I would have no problem saying that this is the best movie of the year. It's almost in a class of it's own. Avatar is the dawn of a new age in cinema. Where we are not bound by the constraints of technology. It's proof that if you can dream it, you can do it. James Cameron sought out to create a mesmerizing, groundbreaking film and he accomplished just that and more. The doubters who thought he would fall on his face are now the ones picking themselves off of the ground.The future looks bright for big budget movies. With this new technology and new way of story telling, audiences can expect more high quality entertainment. James Cameron goes all in with each movie he makes. His next movie is called Battle Angel, another futuristic tale about a female cyborg rescued by a scientist. Sounds crazy. I can't wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible,"OK I went to see Avatar but I didn't expect what was coming. Story was perfectly executed, visuals simply amazing and I just can't find anything bad about Cameron's latest work. I've found out about it about 6 months back, no I'm not a fanboy. I wasn't particularly hyped neither. Saying that...This is most likely the best movie I've seen in my whole life. It has everything and more. There has to be a continuation, or ideally Cameron should make a trilogy. It's just so good 2 hours 40 minutes spent on watching it felt like an hour. It doesn't matter what movies you like, whether you enjoy watching sci-fi or not - you just need to see it for yourself be it 2 or 3D and you won't believe how good it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I wish I could say I enjoyed this...,"Like I said in the title, I wish I could say I enjoyed this, but I honestly didn't, I was so excited to watch this film for the first time, at the end I was so disappointed, it started off too quickly and I had no idea what was going on, the only reason I gave this 6* is because the middle was good and interesting, which is surprising, the ending dragged more than the middle, that should not be the case, I think the film itself was too long, nearly 3 hours long, I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep! I know this is just my opinion, I know loads of people love this film, but I didn't, maybe if I rewatched I might enjoy it more, but I won't be rushing to rewatch anytime soon",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Tears in the rain,"There is a fundamental error in Avatar, which director James Cameron refused to see when making the movie. The world of Pandora is brilliant and original indeed, but in no way does it justify alone an almost three hour movie. True art in cinema is rare and it combines a multitude of components such as storyline, character development, mise en scene, music score etc. Cameron focuses 100% in the technical part of the film-which is undoubtedly excellent and innovative-and deliberately neglects everything else. If one accepts that Avatar is a sci-fi adventure with no brains whatsoever, then he will have a great time watching it, but if one enters the world of Pandora with expectations of anything more than that, then he will be very disappointed. No problem here, except we are talking about Cameron, director of The Abyss and Titanic. Those movies had the technical brilliance of their age, but in the same time had everything else. Who can forget Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio calling for Ed Harris on the walkie as he descents in the dark depths of the ocean or Kate Winslet whispering in the cold and endless waters as she gazes Leonardo Di Caprio vanishing in the dark beneath her, while, just feet away, the titanic makes its final voyage to oblivion. Even when Arnold Schwarzeneger gives his mechanical life to save Eduard Furlog and Linda Hamilton. All these are moments that defined a filmic genre and an age of cinema. Unfortunately, in ten years time, we will still remember these moments, while all of Avatar will be lost...like tears in the rain...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Isn't this what movie-making is all about?,"There are many opinions on Avatar. There are clearly believers, and fierce critics. The mere fact that so many people are talking about it, including myself, must mean that it struck a note with the masses. Any publicity is good publicity after all, no?Hmmm - Avatar. As many of you I had very high expectations, and to be perfectly honest, I was not disappointed. The execution is flawless and the visuals are stunning and mesmerising. The subtlety of the 3D makes it stand apart from the traditional Disney World 'jump in your face' sequences.There is however a small leap of faith to be made, and as pointed out correctly by many critics of the movie, the story is not really original. It has been told before, it is predictable, but then aren't all stories derived from an older version? There are only so many stories to tell and I can compare most 'original' movies to an obscure predecessor.If you let yourself be swept away by it, and ignore the 'intellectually superior' attitude that blocks you from seeing past the simplicity, you are in for a beautifully crafted love story, good vs. evil in its most basic form. Only this time it has a twist: the new technology allows you to be sucked into the story, but you have to be able to let go and enjoy the ride.If you would read the script of Star Wars before it was visually realised by George Lucas, you might have concluded the story was somewhat childish. And now this is heralded as one of the best movies of all times. It was visually spellbinding for its time, withstood the test of time, and all that with a simple and naive storyline we all came to love and cherish. What makes Avatar so different from this? Not much. The story is simple and stripped of all unnecessary character development to give the viewer an 'experience', 'an emotional feeling', and on that level, it is unsurpassed in beauty and sensitivity. It will have many teenagers look back with happy thoughts in their thirties of the time they saw Avatar on the big screen.Well done James Cameron for bringing us something old (that works) but presented in a way that is simply revolutionary. Kudos to you for writing the story yourself although it is not your forte. Lord of the Rings was the last time I was wowed, and a lot of that was the combination of story and groundbreaking visuals. But let's not forget that it was based on a great book, Star Wars nor Avatar are, which makes them - in my opinion - slightly more original. Did you ever wonder what LOTR would have looked like with Cameron at the helm?Finally, this movie is revolutionary and I starkly disagree with people who say it is not. Blaming the studios for substituting a good story with use of expensive technology and expensive special effects is a dated excuse. The technology is here to stay, and James Cameron has opened the road for many directors/screenwriters to take advantage of this technology as the studios are probably queing up now the business case has proved the investment to be a luctrative.Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg are already lined up for making movies using this very same technology - so to all people unhappy with the story - scripts with more depth are bound to come.Maybe not the greatest story, but one of the best cinematic experiences since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.I tell everyone: go see it without prejudice, and you might just LOVE it. I did ...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visual effects make up for weak story,"I suppose the big selling point behind this movie was the special effects, and this film doesn't shy away from getting in your face with some of the most beautiful and amazing images I have ever seen.The amount of detail and love that went into the visuals is just outstanding. The scenery, the creatures, the Navi, wow!! If you see this movie, see it for the visuals.Now if only Cameron had put the same amount of care into the scriptThe plot for this movie seemed to borrow from a number of sources, the two standouts being Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas. I must defend Cameron, as it extremely hard to be 100% original these days, as most ideas have been used time and time before.Nevertheless, the plot weakened the overall viewing experience. I had a feeling I knew how the movie was going to end. And the movie went for a bit too long; unnecessary points in the plot could have saved the studios a LOT of money.But in the end, the goods outdo the bads. Avatar's visuals are a good enough reason to see this film, even if the film is more of a ""look what we can do"" piece rather than a piece of storytelling.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Even if it is sporadically decent or fun, it's mostly a bore","A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look ""photo-realistic"", as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I would honestly say watch the movie in 3D, it helps you get a better feel of what you are seeing and feeling.The emotion in the movie is amazing, it's almost like what they feel is exactly what you will feel. This movie didn't just change my perspective on movies, because it really is the greatest movie of all time, it changed my perspective on life itself. The feeling that our world takes everything for granted, and in their world they respect everything. Look at everything on there planet as if it is sacred. Because in reality, everything is sacred.They cherish the lives of there people and everything else around them.They give thanks for everything, and even the things they've killed they pass them on with respect and love. Giving them the space to move on into the next life so peacefully. It's amazing how much our world before all the greed and money use to be so similar to that.

The way ahead for the next decade...,"My first ever review on IMDb...The Odeon booklet describes this movie as a ""tent-pole"" pioneer in the 3D format used.

Why would anybody want to see this movie in 2D??Being a die-hard trekkie, I knew I'd enjoy this movie and it didn't disappoint in any area. My last experience of 3D was those multi-coloured cardboard thingies from the 80's that never really set the scene alight. This was altogether something different with solid framed specs framing an absolutely perfect 3D experience.

"Watch ""Dances with Wolves"" instead.","James Cameron's highly anticipated epic, Avatar, raises the question: Are special effects enough to launch a new era in filmmaking? In terms of storyline, the plot offers nothing new: once again, greedy Americans are exploiting new lands for valuable resources, and disturbing the natives. The protagonist, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), works for a big corporation but soon finds himself befriending the natives, falling in love, and growing distant from his people because he identifies with the natives' way of life more than his own.Sound familiar? That's because this story has been recycled time and time again. We see it in our history in the settlers' treatment of Native Americans, and it is the plot of the 1990 film Dances with Wolves. Cameron has acknowledged Avatar's similarities to Dances with Wolves, which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Taking into account that Cameron's own Titanic won 11 Academy Awards, you can see where this is heading.In Cameron's rendition, the natives are a species of alien called the Na'vi. Essentially, the aliens are a gimmick; aside from their sparkly blue skin, extreme height, and tails they are completely uninspired reincarnations of Native Americans. The Na'vi even dress like Â­Native Americans, use bows and arrows, live in close-knit family tribes, are spiritually connected to nature, and are threatened by the imperialistic, capitalistic white men because they stand in the way of precious resources. With this story set in the future in outer space, Cameron had the opportunity to formulate truly new and creative creatures but instead opted for imitation and unoriginality.Avatar deviates from its predecessors, though, in its simplicity, character development (or lack thereof), and tone. The distinction between good and bad is riddled with clichÃ©s and one-dimensional characters that make for a predictable outcome. While the film could have emphasized Jake's moral dilemma, he actually has no trouble deciding his loyalties, showing how Avatar sacrifices reality and the truth about human nature for the formulaic ingredients of a feel-good audience pleaser. At the same time, Cameron spoonfeeds the audience environmental awareness and lessons on the dangers of war, making Avatar preachy and, at times, tedious.Of course, the film is not without its merits. Cameron himself modestly told The New Yorker that his special effects work is ""the most complicated stuff anyone's ever done."" And he has succeeded in creating a new world of sparkling colors, fantastic creatures, and breathtaking landscapes.Does a film this unoriginal deserve the accolades it is receiving from audiences and critics alike? Is it really a breakthrough in filmmaking? Filmmaking is an art with many aspects, special effects being just one. We will see come Oscar time what the Academy thinks, and only time will tell whether Avatar becomes a true classic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Stunning sci-fi escapism,"Avatar is escapism at its finest. Even if the story isn't as original as the groundbreaking visuals it's still a well told one that's designed to be crowd pleasing whilst having deeper themes that can be as accessible and wide reaching as possible. It takes its time to get going so everything can be introduced at a nice speed and saves the best action for the grand finale so it ends on the biggest high.Sam Worthington makes Jake Sully a likeable protagonist who's fish out of water antics make him a solid audience surrogate and his constantly slipping accent only adds to the charm. Zoe SaldaÃ±a wholeheartedly commits to being Navi so the culture that's introduced is believable and the emotional core of their connection to the planet feels so earnest, exemplified by any emotional distress or euphoria she displays.Stephen Lang excels as the kind of tough as nails villain who makes sure he's suited up into a giant robot mech suit before putting out the fire on his shoulder. There's no greater depth here, just a bad guy who enjoys what he's doing. Science fiction icon Sigourney Weaver reunites with her Aliens director for a great role as someone who never backs down whilst also having a deep affection for the planet and its people.James Cameron's direction is so immersive, crafting a fully realised world that is very easy to get lost in, especially when employing some of the best 3-D ever put to screen. When it comes to the spectacle, he remains a master of large-scale action with a climactic battle that wages war on land and in the sky simultaneously. Once it gets everything it can out of that, proceedings get personal with a one on one fight that's just as thrilling.The CGI and motion capture on display here is astonishing. The level of detail in the characters means they never look uncanny and the CGI still holds up with every aspect of Pandora being breathtaking in some way. Funnily enough the only thing showing its age are the live action elements. The reason for James Horner's score being the way it is is ironic however, this is still a tremendously epic score that's rife with sweeping emotion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Goes Beyond a mere Visual spectacle to become a true modern masterpiece,"The hype was definitely big; over 10 years in the making. The ultra secret film project that would push the boundaries of film making to its limits. With that promise, a whopping budget and James Cameron's reputation on the line, ""Avatar"" was born. At the start of his career, James Cameron brought to life his nightmare about an unstoppable cyborg killer, now he has realized his vision of a beautiful dream. ""Epic"" cannot even begin to describe this marvel of a movie. It surpasses every other blockbuster that has come before. Plus it has brains and heart to boot, two things other big special effects laden movies like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen tend to forget.Much has been said about Avatar's less-than-original story. In the year 2154 on a faraway moon called Pandora, the RDA corporation has been attempting to mine precious ""unobtanium"" minerals while fending off attacks by the local ""Na'Vi"": a race of tall, blue skinned natives clearly inspired by Native Americans. Enter Jake Sully, an crippled marine who is sent to replace his brother in the ""Avatar Project"" which involves transplanting the minds of humans into artificially created Na'vi bodies in order to facilitate better inter-species understanding between Na'vi and Humans. But Jake is given new orders from the corporation; infiltrate the Na'vi tribe, learn their secrets and convince them to relocate before the military is sent in to remove them by force.Similar to his previous work on Terminator in which James Cameron took a typical horror/slasher movie structure(unstoppable killer going after helpless teenage girl)and tailored it into an all time classic, Avatar's story is, at its core, just a mix of well known cinema clichÃ©s. The story of a soldier who is taken in by some natives and ultimately fights with the natives against his former comrades is nothing new, having been done most recently in ""The Last Samurai"". But Cameron manages to bring all those familiar elements together and craft a sweeping tale that is as compelling as the world it takes place in; it is not the individual elements, but the end result mix that works so well. On the surface, it is a grand science fiction fantasy adventure that anyone can understand and enjoy. Dig beneath that surface and you have an entire cast of interesting characters as well as clever allusions about the recent war in Iraq, metaphors about corporate globalization, and even deeper philosophy about an individual's life purpose.A word of warning though: Do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch this movie unless you watch it in its full 3D glory. While most 3D films ""pop up"" in your face, Avatar does a different approach. Instead of popping out, it immerses the viewer into the visual experience with a realistic field of depth thanks to a technique of filming that mimics the way our eyes perceive distance. This revolutionary filming method makes the magnificent CGI world, creatures and characters all the more majestic to behold. Forget Star Wars, forget Lord of the Rings, AVATAR is the new benchmark of visual effects excellence. Even the more hardcore fan-boys of science fiction would be drooling at the attention to detail the production team put into fleshing out not just a never-before-seen world, but original creature designs and even an entirely new language for the Na'Vi(and let us not forget the most realistic portrayal of robotic mecha in the history of digital films). After a short while one would would forget that the Na'Vi are just digital effects and come to emotionally connect with those lovable yet tragic creatures. That is the extent of realism that the revolutionary CGI and amazing acting gives to the digitally rendered Na'Vi. The human characters are also perfectly cast and even the ""bad guys"" have a certain appeal about them. (special mention goes to Stephan Lang's character of Colonel Quaritch, easily embodying the definition of ""bad ass"" and giving ""Apocalypse Now""'s Colonel Killgore a run for his money.)While almost Flawless in its execution, only one personal nitpick would be that perhaps Avatar would have worked better with a longer running time or split into two movies. The final act where Jake goes from outcast to Na'vi savior in 10 minutes felt a little bit truncated and more time could have been spent on Jake Sully's back-story, but those are just minor nitpicks if one wanted to be really fussy.Emotionally engaging, thrilling, entertaining and breathtaking. Avatar is James Cameron at his best; showcasing his abilities as an blockbuster movie director who can balance action with emotion, bang with brain. Battles are edge-of-your-seat thrill rides, beautifully choreographed and filmed, bringing ""awesome"" to a whole new level. From start to finish, Avatar succeeds at everything it set out to do and easily lives up to the hype. Avatar is not just a film, but an entire world born from the mind of James Cameron, created from scratch and ripe with possibilities. It is an indescribable experience that one should not miss out on. Future blockbuster directors would be hard pressed to live up to the standards set by this grand modern masterpiece that would easily become an immortal classic in no time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beautiful images but lame story,"Man I don't know where to start the story of Avatar is a long and predictable one. With all its hype of: 3D, imax, and ground breaking C.G.I. there really wasn't anything left for a decent story to be told. I'll be frank. The movie is beautiful to look at (By beautiful I mean the most: realistic, gorgeous, and imaginative visuals I have ever seen!)but is hampered by a very lame and predictable story. By the time your half way through you'll know what the movie will lead toward and probably guess the ending. So what is so bad about this story? Well I should say it isn't bad but one that we all heard somewhere before not to spoil anything but in a nutshell its somewhat like Disneys Pocahontas and Dances with wolves. Just in the future with blue aliens and not as good. Now I know the budget for this movie was a ridiculous amount what with all that groundbreaking CG; I guess one could debate they wanted to be safe and kept the story and script to formula but they could have done a better job I mean Titanic had that a story we all heard but pulled us in with its characters.This is where Avatar really fails for me as great movie the characters in the story really aren't that interesting or engaging. I didn't find myself caring about what happens to a lot of them. Some dialogue and sequences from the characters come off as more than a little clichÃ© and at times awkward to sit through. My mind started wandering at certain parts because I wasn't immersed with the characters, or because I knew what might happen and was waiting for it to draw out. I don't know what went wrong when James Cameron the guy who wrote and directed Titanic and the first two Terminators but some re-writing in the script would of helped.Now I probably bashed this movie so much you think I hate it. Not so. As an experience it really is worth checking out for the sheer spectacle of it all. The visuals really are breathtaking to see and being the first movie in 3D (from what I know) that's good I recommend you go to the nearest imax theater to watch if it still is playing, or rent it. As a movie on its own though it really isn't worth collecting unless you want it for being so groundbreaking. The predictable story and bad character writing at times really do bring down what could of been a classic for me anyway.

Avatar is way before it's time. You may never have the chance to experience anything like this again!,"First of all, no review can explain what you will experience with Avatar. If you haven't seen it, go and buy your ticket... now! I cannot imagine this movie being experienced on anything other than the big screen and of course in 3-D!! Don't miss this chance because DVD/BR won't do this justice.I've heard people complain that this story has been done before, that it wouldn't be any big deal without the graphics, and plenty of other absurd statements. Obviously these come from people who want to spark arguments or from those who didn't want to like the movie in the first place. And please realize that I've read these statements on the Message Boards, not from actual Reviews. Of course the graphics and special effects make the movie what it is, but the creativity, imagination, and brilliance that went into this masterpiece are not all in the form of shooting arrows, or intense chase scenes.James Cameron's masterpiece is like nothing I've ever witnessed in my life. He's created a whole new planet and a whole new species. The Na'vi have a world complete with their own language, culture, beliefs, and other life forms inhabiting their home. For almost any aspects of human life, Cameron has given the natives an equivalent. By doing this, he allows you to really care for the characters, and share their emotions/concerns. (This also helps him to deliver a not so subtle message).OK, so there are quite a few Hollywood ""cliches""- the love story of two opposing cultures is obviously apparent. But is it possible to create a movie that is entirely original? ... I personally don't think so. At least not a movie that will appeal to various audiences.I believe that this movie sets a new standard for what should happen with the movie industry. A film of this quality doesn't come around often. In fact this film is the FIRST of it's kind, and I don't see anything coming close to it for a very, very, very long time!Even if you watch and don't find Avatar to be your kind of film, you can't deny the thought, talent, and creativity put together to make this movie. And of course, the mind-blowing visuals!!

the best film made in recent times,"avatar is a revolution in 3d cinema as well as 2d,almost the entire movie has been made using computer graphics,and to say the least,they are stunning if not mind blowing.the environment created by the design team is very well thought of and a lot of attention has been given into intricate details.as far as the story goes,it is a little predictable but does not effect the thrill watching the movie by any means.the action sequences are electrifying and the viewer gets a feeling of actually being inside the movie.Acting has been top notch,from the human actors that is.the animated characters have been made in such a way that they look more real then their human counterparts.other than the impressive graphics and story,the moral of the movie is also a very good and makes the viewers think.the one thing i can guarantee about avatar is that you wont leave the cinema halls disappointed.in fact you will want to pay it another visit.watching this film in 3d is a must for anyone who enjoys watching movies.for those who don't,it is still worth the ticket money.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great Effects, Thin Plot","I thought Avatar was a great visual experience and James Cameron really should be commended for all the excellent advancements he has made in CGI special effects film making here. But I thought the story was very thin on plot and really huge parts of it, all the broad strokes of the story, are very much recycled from other movies. From Pocahontas to Ferngully, a lot of children's movies have already explored the we're-the-invading-army-displacing- good-hearted-natives plot line. Why revisit this same story again? The effects make the movie worth seeing in the theatre as long as all you are looking for is fantastically advanced 3D spectacle, it's all visuals and not much on story. The acting is okay, could have used more Sigourney Weaver and it's hard to tell how good the acting is through CGI characters anyway. I can't stand Giovanni Ribisi in most of his roles and this is no exception, he annoyed me every time he was on screen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Nothing New, but Somehow Magicalð","Avatar is known as the movie for making the newest three-dimensional screen experience, directed by James Cameron. Avatar is also known for the incredibly high box office, which tops all movies below. Avatar is from my point of view a bit overrated. I understand why people liked it, I liked it too, but I don't think it deserved so high popularity. It was good, but it could be much better. The tale of the high blue Smurfs begins, and the dangers they have to go through and defeat. The plot is basically about people who land on a planet, where they discover new species and unique animals. They have to fight them, and one of the sky-people (Humans) become friends with the blue high Smurfs and together they will fight back their territory. I mean, sort of a story like that we have got a million times. The story is nothing new, but the movie did the great job with the visuals. The visuals and effects were amazing. The locations and the magical world of Pandora were fantastically made, very colorful and looking very real, what I think is very cool. It's amazing how many plants, animals and languages they could make in this movie. Everything was explained in detail, everything was worked in detail, so the visuals made their job, and I have to give a big applause to the crew that made it. The nostalgic, dynamic music soundtrack did the job in here, too. The Avatar Theme is something that I can remember very good. The acting, let's be honest, is not on the highest shelf, but they did the job as good as they were supposed to do. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver were my personal favourites, played their roles best and with emotion, they played most real, if you know what I mean. I can see that the moral they try to put in here is that you have to protect nature and take care of the people that you love mostly. Something that you can learn from this movie is very clear in here. But if I have to be completely honest, this movie was ok, a bit overrated, but I think it is still a fun experience and something worth watching anyway. If you want to see a science fiction movie once, this can be a good one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Sc-fi film of all time,"This is the M.O.A.B. - The mother of all Blockbusters.Finally, a movie that lives up to all the hype and expense, and then surpasses all my wildest expectations. Hats off to James Cameron for creating this marvelous spectacle that is the Epic of Avatar.This movie is so incredibly well executed from beginning to end. I consider it the perfect film. The story is an old tried and true plot, but with a fantastic sci-fi plot. The effects are phenomenal, and at times visually stunning...beyond words.Folks, this is a film an a massive scope...Epic to the extreme...not to be missed. Do not wait for it to come to hove video. This one needs to be experience on the big screen and in stunning 3D. James Cameron has now joined the ranks of the big Director-Gods, such as Lucas and Jackson. This one is one for the history books as the greatest sci-fi epic of them all!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular!  The BEST movie of all time,This is a MUST SEE movie in 3D and preferably in IMAX. James Cameron was very wise to wait for computer animation to catch up to his vision because OMG it's spectacular!There are more than a dozen animation studios world-wide who all contributed to a realism of graphics that has never before been so natural. Amazing considering that most of the movie is based on a new planet with all animals and most plants having totally new characteristics.The visuals and sounds/music is immersive & realistic. The story will leave you satisfied. All mature audiences will love it.This is NOT a typical multi-part comic book movie that always leaves you hanging.Go see it on the big screen and enjoy the BEST movie of all time!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It really is that good.,"Just a quickie, i'm not going to drone on, this was brilliant, BRILLIANT. This is entertainment friends, exciting, action packed, engaging, romantic, funny, its report card is all As, it passed every class.The story alone is timely and relevant, it demands consideration of its issues from even the most passive viewer. Add to that the jaw dislocating effects and top it off with great actors doing their best work and Jimbo's done it again.Is this worth my Pounds, Dollars, whatever ? wholeheartedly YES, even if your not normally a sci-fi kind of soul, its much more than that, see it 3D, see it Imax, just see it, it really is that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow,"Let's begin with the story. Many people I have heard are complaining about how the story lacks depth, how it is unoriginal, and even copies the ideas of other movies that were made after the story of Avatar was created 12 years ago. To say that a movie does not have an original plot is an easy argument in the film business today, if you take how many movies we have now I'm sure you could find one that fits with every other one. This is beyond the point. The story of Avatar was to show a crisp example of the greed driven brutality of the human race, which is becoming a more popular topic in video today. Often in films today you see a lot of gore, sexual humor, sex, or drug use to depict a writer's point. None of this can be found in Avatar. This movie took a plot concept that so many other movies have been attempting to use, stripped it of all popular techniques of the culture today, and made it into a beautiful film.So, what made the movie as good as it was? The VISUALS. Certain scenes in this movie that show the nature of Pandora will literally bring you to tears. I am finding it hard to understand why this factor is being overlooked in reviews when in reality it is the driving force as to why this movie is so amazing. The point of a film is to put the viewer in a situation that is otherwise hard to imagine, correct? Every single person upon leaving the theater, including the people I went with were dreaming of living as an Avatar in the world of Pandora, as the main character was in the movie as well. This movie took every detail of the terrain, and lit it up with fireworks, creating the most spectacular case of eye candy you will ever experience.After watching this movie, you will not have goosebumps and your blood will not be racing because of copious amounts of action as it would be in Transformers or such. Your jaw will be dropped and your imagination will be on a roller coaster ride through your own vision of Pandora.My final advice to you, pay the extra 5$ and see this movie in Imax 3D, trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Incredible...,"One of the best films ever made. Avatar is full of emotion, interesting story lines, great scripts, and beautiful, incredible landscapes, creatures, and everything else. Cameron worked extremely well at bringing Pandora and the Na'vi to life. The expressions on their faces are the most real I have ever seen in animation. It's like watching actors! It's also nice to see a film with smaller actors...it gets repetitive seeing people like Brad Pitt fill 5 different roles...Sam Worthington is a great role for Jake Sully. Jake is hilarious and ignorant at first, but soon becomes a very big role model for the Na'vi.The films effects are incredible and the storyline, even though it has been done before, has a new ""fresh"" feel of it.This is the way movies should be made!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A bloated clichÃ© with grade school quality dialogue,"My fiancÃ© and I bought this while on vacation for something to watch in our hotel room, figuring after all the rave reviews that it would be a solid choice. By the end, the two of us were slack-jawed - not by the effects, which, granted, were very visually attractive, but by how a movie so formulaic, so full of ridiculous clichÃ©d one-dimensional characters and simplistic dialogue, could be the talk of the world. James Cameron has an amazing eye for aesthetics, but he seriously need to find someone with a gift for writing scripts, specifically engaging dialogue. Everything about the plot, from Sigourney Weaver essentially reprising a watered down version of her role in Gorillas in the Mist to an evil army commander who reminded me of a sad caricature of every 'ignorant, war hungry army guy' ever made, the characters just... don't matter. It's saddening that this movie is sliding by on its visuals to such a high rating. If you want to watch the exact same story, only with more moving dialogue and far less bloat, rent Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest. Cameron pretty much ripped off the entire plot from it, anyway.

It is a film meant to be seen in 3D and multiple times. One time viewing is not enough to absorb all the details and visuals shown. The visual effects are eye-popping and jaw-dropping.

Whoa....,"Its basically the visuals. I could see why this film took 12 years to make. The plot is relatively simple.

The visual effects are crazy son! Its an entirely lifelike world created in a desktop. There's a detailed explanation to every fictitious wildlife. However watching this you realize that the imagination is only limited to whatever we see. Everything in the film comes from something we have seen before. Native tribes, tigers, rhinos, lemurs, horses, wolves and giant birds. 12 years of work went into it so the hype didn't fail. One thing.

To Dream of Another Time.,"When I was 10 years old, I remember seeing Terminator 2: Judgment Day in the theater. And when Arnold first saves John Connor from the T1000, I recall the vivid awareness that I wasn't just watching that Summer's action Blockbuster. It was something more. At the time, I didn't really know or understand that feeling. But years later, when I'd revisit T2 it would click into place.I wasn't watching a movie. I was watching a Dream.Across the years, I've been blessed to encounter a handful of other films that gave me that same feelingâthe feeling that I could close my eyes, and awaken to a new world of distilled imagination. Blade Runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Metropolis, and Nosferatu are a few names on that short list. Early in Avatar, when paraplegic Jake first links with his Na'vi avatar and races across the Pandoran landscape, exhilarated to be running again, I leaned forward in my seat and smiled. Once again, I wasn't watching a movie. I was watching a Dream.Avatar uses the classical narrative structure of a man who must step beyond his culture, become one with a society alien to his own, and ultimately make a stand with his new brothers. And unlike previous telling of this tale, Jake can literally step outside of his human skin and take on the form of a blue-skinned and golden-eyed humanoids called the ""Na'vi.""Neytiri, a female Na'vi, guides Jake in the ways of her tribe, and as they make this journey together a bond forms between them. ""I see you,"" she whispers to Jake. ""I see you,"" he whispers back the way two lovers might exchange ""I love you""s. And there couldn't be a more appropriate expression of affection for these characters. ""I see you."" Director James Cameron wants to open his audience's eyes, as Neytiri opens Jake's eyes, to the breathtaking sights of Pandora. But unlike visual effects masturbations like G.I. Joe and Revenge of the Fallen both of which throw CGI out randomly in an effort to create the most/biggest/boomest explosion, Avatar aims to recapture the child-like wonder of experiencing a *vision* that, to quote Manohla Dargis, ""really is bigger than life.""Another director would be content to show the majestic floating ""Hallelujah"" mountains in the distant background, but not James Cameron. He goes further and invites us to climb them with Jake and the young Na'vi hunters. After dangling perilously from vines and rock faces and clawing our way to the top, Cameron then lets us ride on the back of winged dragon-like creatures, the Mountain Banshees, and soar above and between this magical landscape of towering miracles and impossible valleys.But more importantly: amidst the overabundant spectacle, Cameron never loses sight of that child-like curiosity driving all fantasy. Do you remember staring at the cover art of your favorite book asking, ""What would it be like to fly? How exhilarating would it be holding on to a Banshee for dear life while it dove 300 feet straight down? To feel the roaring wind rush past with the intensity of a hurricane as you flyâreally, truly, honestly fly?"" James Cameron remembers asking those questions.He's filled the worldâthe visionâof Avatar with sights both grand and subtle. This is a movie that will go full throttle into an epic battle where a legion of Banshee-mounted Na'vi fly fearlessly through the airborne mountainscape while the military gunships unleash a hellstorm of missiles, and yet it also has the patience to let Neytiri reverently pause to observe where the drifting Seeds of Eywa fall. It will show you giant colorful dinosaur-like creatures smashing through trees in the all but obligatory stampede sequence, but look closely when the Na'vi get ready to ride a Banshee and you'll see gill-like orifices through which the creatures breathe. The world of Avatar feels bigger than life, yet I felt like I could reach out, grab a sample, and take it with me.Is Avatar perfect? Far from it. It blatantly contradicts itself during the climax and brushes a little too close with propaganda in places. But like a dream, it didn't matter. When you've looked across the Pandoran landscape at night and absorbed the mystical beauty of the self-illuminating flora, when you've felt the thrill of watching Jake command the meanest predator on the planet and unite the Na'vi tribes, when you've *seen* Avatar Â you don't care about its logistical faults.It's a movie about sights, and James Cameron isn't shy about that point. It's the heart of the film. It's in every frameâin the very fabric of the film. Hell, it's even spelled out in the dialogue.""I see you.""In the cold mechanical adult world of unforgiving cause and effect, Avatar is the movie to reawaken the forgotten child of so long ago. The child who believes in searching for undiscovered frontiers to explore, who believes dragons and magic exists, and who believes dreams are real. It's always refreshing finding out our inner child is still alive, that the jaded real world hasn't killed him off entirely yet.Thank you, James Cameron.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Average film.,"I, like everyone else, went straight away to see this movie on the big screen. I saw it within the week of it coming out. It was a spectacular film from a visuals point of view.

One of cinema's most visually ambitious efforts,"""Avatar"" by James Cameron is arguably a perfect film judging by its methodological approach, and from a technical standpoint it still stands unrivaled as a feat of the vision of a director. Add to that charming characters as well as a touching theme, and a great film is in the mold.The film is a mere spectacle to look at with well-deserved visual effects winning the team an academy award. Cameron did a fantastic job at writing, directing, and editing this film into a smooth script with excellent punchlines. The production design is overwhelming is still to this day practically unparralelled with incredible attention to detail from the sky to little bugs flying around in the evening air. The score by James Horner is nothing short of magnificent and fitting very well with the grand visual scheme of the film.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and others deliver excellent performances, all of which are portrayed in very natural ways in spite of the sci-fi avatar-driven production.Avatar has received a lot of hate for its seemingly adapted screenplay from Pocahontas. Rather than focusing on the plot this is a film which really utilizes the narrative in new, constructive and creative ways. As a statement in cinema history, I believe ""Avatar"" is a brilliant example of a director's vision for a film which at the time of its inception molded the state of the art.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A vision of hell,"The real theme of Avatar is the megalomania of the director. He thinks he can create a world from scratch, and he thinks of this world as Paradise. The only problem is that beauty comes from within. Bloated with megalomania as he is, his vision of Paradise comes across as Hell instead. I found the viewing of Pandora excruciating. There was a persistent sense of nausea throughout. It was meant to be the essence of beauty. But blue men with long tails undulating behind them are a utter perversity to the eyes. The garish plant life reeked of poison. The animals combined insect, reptile and mammal, bringing out the worst features in each. How anyone can conceive of this concoction as beautiful is beyond me. Compared to this the slimy aliens in Cameron's earlier films are tame.In truth, I am suspicious of anyone who calls Pandora beautiful. My theory is this: There is something ugly inside that is compels them to say that Pandora is beautiful. They take into consideration the budget of the film, the fact that it's made by the ""king of the world"", that it stands as a testament to human ingenuity (technology, CGI and so on), that the film becomes the byword for hype, that it promotes the cult of celebrity, etc. In other words, those who find Pandora beautiful are also those who idolize the megalomania of Cameron. It's all a matter of worshipping excess, and if you do, you find Pandora beautiful. Otherwise you say, Hey, why are those slimy tentacles sticking out of all those animals on that planet? Yuck! The rest is a thinly disguised critique of the American invasion of Iraq, or more generally the military industrial complex. But of course it is hypocrisy through and through. Hollywood excess is an integral part of the military industrial complex, and Cameron is at the vanguard of Hollywood excess. He's a hypocrite, and no wonder his vision comes across as so ugly. Of course, not many people will say so. Not if they are worshipping at the altar of pride and excess. So Cameron taps into the general malaise and makes a lot of money. That's all there is to Avatar. It's a testament to greed and megalomania. In this universe of excess there is a ""paradise"", which the film tries to recreate. If you live in that universe you will find the vision beautiful. If you don't, it is the very definition of repulsive.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I'm disappointed it's taken so long for a sequel to come out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Vastly entertaining and visually impressive,"I was originally a little harsh in my first review of ""Avatar,"" believing that the film was too reliant on its visuals and CGI to make up for its one-dimensional story. However, after having watched it a second time, I noticed that the flaws didn't seem as big as when I first watched it, while the film's pluses shone even more.As many reviewers have previously mentioned, the quality of the visuals are not up for debate. Pandora is wonderfully realized; you can see that James Cameron was obviously inspired by the Amazon rainforest for his fantastical, near-dreamlike visions. The floating mountains, as well as the floating waterfall, seem to be like Angel Falls broken up and thrown into the sky (I don't think it's coincidence that Cameron had Jake Sully serve in Venezuela once). And as for the Na'vi, there were a few moments when they seemed photo-real. Cameron has had a long history of getting the CGI to look as close to realistic as possible, and just like in ""T2"" and ""Titanic,"" his attention to the graphics pays off.Another thing I noticed was that the acting was mostly solid by everyone, and that there seemed to be no weak performances (something I could not say about ""Titanic""). While there are no standouts, both lead and supporting actors and actresses seem very in tune with their characters and with each other. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana carry the film well, and their romance even felt a little touching. Sigourney Weaver isn't as strong here as she is in some of her earlier roles, but she's fine nonetheless. Stephen Lang also gets to chew the scenery up as one of the meanest soldiers this side of Colonel Kilgore.As for the plot, it's pretty similar to ""Dances With Wolves."" Only Jake Sully and (more or less) Neytiri feel developed into three-dimensional characters, while the rest of the cast either lack dimensions or only serve for important plot points. There are also a couple of hokey, heavy handed moments during important parts (kind of to be expected from Cameron's pictures). Perhaps another rewrite would have fleshed out more characters and cleaned up some of the dialogue.Still, it works. Because Jake Sully was well developed, I felt engaged in his quest to get to know the Na'vi better and, eventually, defend them. I was always impressed by ""Avatar's"" visuals and CGI. While I wouldn't call ""Avatar"" one of the best film's of 2009, I will say it is definitely one of the most entertaining, and represents another solid hit for Cameron's attention to great visuals and superb CGI.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Avatar Is Simply Put..Cinematography At It's Best,"It seems whatever film James Cameron is involved in, it's always breathtaking, i mean what with his history of amazing films such asThe Terminator 1 & 2: Judgement Day Aliens Titanicand now he has created a film, that had so much of a buzz it became the queen bee of films, named AvatarAvatar which uses special cameras and exploits the use of 3D technology to create a spectacle of a film, honestly, when i watched Avatar in 3D, the only thing in my mind was....Completely Freaking Amazing!The Storyline is not some sort of massive, other-world, freaky, killing film, it takes a simple storyline of infiltration into ones nest and using its information for personal use but end up failing because the person that was sent to do it completely forgot about it and became a member of the family and didn't want anything bad to happen to it.Now i know it looks like such a massive storyline and the timing (over 2 hours) seems like it will last forever, but this film makes those 2 hours so spectacular you would wish it was going on for 5 hours. James Cameron was in Mr. Out Of This World for this film as it takes cinema to a whole new level.This film you MUST see, i would recommend to watch it in 3D FOR SURE, but if your happy with 2D still watch it & if you fail to watch it you ABSOLUTELY have to obtain it on DVD!! This is a MUST SEE!!Avatar - A*",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Every few years, watching this simple film is a treat.","It's got the same balanced mix of clichÃ© and easy watching pleasure as a Disney animation. Somehow it's a workable blend of military high-sci-fi in a Halo fashion mixed with the messages and visuals of something like a Miyazaki animation.Its obvious dialogue and simple plotting allows breathing room for the pioneering CGI and 3D and even though it's got a hefty running time, it's breezy and not as bogged down as it's other blockbuster counterparts. (See: Any Transformers). Here the CGI and technology is used to create believable, breathable worlds with stunning photo-realism. It's a great push forwards instead of the prior sterile all-CGI worlds before.Watching it on 3D Blu-ray for the first time, and it's really pleasurable. Considering it's influence on 3D, it doesn't push large objects such as characters to us. Instead the image is pushed beyond the window with sumptuous layers. It's always normal and always impressive. It's easy to forget you're watching 3D in a way that feels natural and is an absolute compliment. I think much of the reason 3D had failed is that many filmmakers neglect this subtle effect and instead push objects to us in obvious ways but like good score or photography, 3D is best used when it enhances and doesn't distract.Remember Sam Worthington? Because I didn't. Considering he's proven himself largely hollow and charmless, here, with the right character, it's easy to see why Hollywood glommed on to him so quickly. His Jake Sully is inquisitive and childlike, always eager to try hard. Enjoying himself. Despite him being a Marine, it's a refreshing change to the macho hogwash or teen angst of its peers. Saldana is great also, understanding how expressive and appropriately animalistic and charismatic she needs to be.But it's so obvious that Cameron wants to make Pandora the main character. And at that he has succeeded entirely in creating a world that I enjoyed visiting, learning more about, and want to visit again. Cameron has managed to create a world that is so utterly believable physically, which is the hardest part, with a sort of unified design and created ecology where I feel like I get it. The design overall is a little exaggerated much like in animation, the Robots are a little comical and everything is dialled up to 11, but why the hell not. The Na'vi faces are absolutely superb and flawlessly mocapped in a way that is hard to appreciate these days.So the simplicity of Avatar, much maligned, is a strength in many ways I think. It's exactly like a fun rollercoaster; colourful, brisk and yet a little bit longer than you want it to be but when it's over you could maybe do it again.Fun like a ride. I have to say I'm fully ready and willing for Avatar 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and whatever plumb new depths of Pandora and forge new cinematic technology.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Mesmerized, worth living an extra 30 Years to see","I went in hoping for a good flick, but instead was mesmerized for 162 minutes. After it was over, it took me a few minutes to peel myself off the theatre chair. Having seen well over 10,000 Fims in my 53 Years, i now have a new #1 movie, by the unassuming name of AVATAR. Let me preempt the nay sayers;To LOVE this film, you need to appreciate at least one or more of these Genres; (1) Epic Sci-Fi / Fantasy, (2) Action Adventure, (3) Sub-Text Morality stories, (4) Love Stories, (5) War & Technology, (6) Mind-Blowing special Effects, (7) Superb storyline. Amazingly, my wife & 2 teenager children would have none of this, and were not willing to even give it a chance, all they saw was silly BLUE people in the ads. It is their LOSS, as it is irrelevant to me if it is not their type of flick. I assume that Moviegoers that accompanied a Fantasy fan,& do not like these genres, have dragged down the rating from the rightful #1 position. If you do have an appreciation for the listed genres, this is an absolute MUST SEE in the Theatre in 3-D movie. Travel 100 Miles if necessary, you will not regret it.I have become very JADED over the last few years. Many movies & TV Series have been ""Pretty Good"", but nothing recent has Blown me away, like this new classic. The Original Star Wars on opening day was the first time i was this in AWE of a movie. Raiders of the Ark on opening night, was the next time i found myself overwhelmed by a mere movie. Only every once in a while is a film SO GOOD that it was worth living an extra 30 YEARS just to see it, & this was THAT film for me. It was so darned good that i had Shivers going up & down my Spine thru much of the movie. The 3-D was so good it almost felt like i was inside the film. I was pulled right into the Fantasy Storyline & wept for the characters. It is so far ahead of the recent competition, it might not be surpassed for decades to come. Go with another Fantasy fan, & hold on to your Socks ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visuals Spectacular, Story Decent","After revisiting the film after so many years it still has some really beautiful shots and scenes. The story isn't particularly unique and there are some striking similarities to the animated film ""Atlantis"". The similarities are so striking that the characters almost match character for character with the only difference being one is animated and the other live action . Both movies have the invaders attacking an indigenous group for a lucrative power source. The indigenous group in both movies even use their connection to the power source to ride their methods of transportation in a very similar way. The only difference being in Atlantis they use their power source necklace and in Avatar they use their tail.Looking at the overall picture, it's a fine story, but is heavily carried by its cinematography.On a last side note I did find it a little odd how quickly Jake Sully was able to move up the ranks despite his questionable actions. He managed to go from informant snitch that cost the lives of many of the indigenous to essentially the groups leader all by successfully mounting the largest banshee on the planet . Sure he helped redeem himself to an extent with his actions by the end , but I certainly wouldn't declare him a full blown hero either as was the idea.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cameron Terminates the silence with a spectacle!,"In the 12 years since his mega-epic turned into a 'Titanic' even at the box-office collections, James Cameron has been busy transforming his childhood fantasy into an epitome of Hollywood's celebrated creativity standard. Drawing inspiration from several sources including George Lucas, Wachowski Brothers and Peter Jackson, Cameron created an all new world of unprecedented sights and sounds in Pandora where the Na'vi live in spiritual harmony with all of Eywa's beings. Humans, as always, have a selfish plan that would require displacement of the native race for extraction of a precious resource 'unobtainium'. Pandora's lethal atmosphere and the need for a humane approach prompt the invading Humans to back Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver)'s scientific technique of infiltrating Pandora with Avatars created by mixed DNA of Humans and the Na'vi. Thus, a paraplegic ex- marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is chosen for this experiment and while he lays in the sealed chamber, his mentally connected Avatar lands on the stunning surface of Pandora.Jake's mission is to provide military information about Pandora to his commander while he engages with the natives to gradually become a part of them and eventually convince them to relocate. This engagement reveals to him the the sheer enchanting beauty that lies within the homeland of the Na'vi. The bioluminescent forest grounds, the eccentric creatures that ram through the woods, hounds, little apes and the Banshees that soar over the majestic floating mountains of Pandora are all exotic creatures that are vividly depicted by the trusted WETA studios. Jake befriends Neytiri, a Princess of her land who, with her big golden eyes, big pointy ears and defensive snarls in moments of aggression introduces him into her world. The following tender love story between them is only disrupted by the urgency of Jake's real mission with an unreal deadline. Human greed gets the better of Jake's selfless attempts in salvaging the lair of the tribe and so, War is declared.....James Cameron leaves no stone unturned on Pandora. His exhaustive attention to detail is simply overwhelming to the eyes that are hopefully wearing the 3-D glasses! With a plot that will by no means get him even an MTV Movie award, Cameron keeps us entertained through the 2 hour 40 minute duration of the film by making it a non-laborious tour of delight, exotica, fantasy, destruction, battle and victory. The plot could have been more convoluted to excite the nervous system or draw more sci-fi fans, the dialogues could've been more epic than generic and our world could've had a more unpredictable future but Cameron caters his Avatar to a wider audience with simplicity in those aspects while the focus of the entire cast and crew was to create the special effects, perfect the depth of field of objects for 3-D, delineate every detail demanded by Cameron's fantasies of another world and make sure it all looks awesome on IMAX.Avatar is a showcase of tomorrow's motion picture. It sets a new standard in special effects for films and with its beautiful hues and colors, makes an absolutely stunning journey into a fantastic adventure on Pandora. Do your best to catch it on IMAX 3-D..... else, just be jealous of those who did.9.19 on a scale of 1-10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A blue movie,"I expected better of Avatar. I saw advertisements of it everywhere and then when it came out, I watched it because that's what most people do. It was boring. It beat doing nothing...by a little.The logic of this movie is very confusing. The idea that we will be able to get transferred to other bodies is an excellent idea, but the way they portray makes no sense to me. They do it to be able to infiltrate and kill the blue inhabitants of a planet that is not Earth. Then of course the main character falls in love and that affects how the movie ends, because he gathers an army and kills the people. As doing so, saves the planet and stays as the blue man he was transformed into for the rest of his life. The effects were really good in this movie. That deserves a compliment. I also like what they did to the planet to make it look different from ours (especially the giant tree). All in all it was an OK movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated and Over-Hyped,"I can not stand this movie. In my fictional list of most hated movies, Avatar is ranked numero uno. Don't get me wrong, in a cinematic view, it's not that bad. It's not garbage, it IS stomachable.. but it was definitely not good or ""brilliant"". Actually sub par is a good way to describe it. It was a let down considering how much hype this movie gets.How can i hate a movie that is a tad under average? well my hatred of this movie stems from the fact that everyone think's it is a masterpiece, and the sad part is, i think half of these fanboys only like it because they're supposed to like it. I could sit here all day and list reasons why this movie is garbage, but instead i'll just leave you with a quote from my English teacher before every power point assignment: ""Visuals and extras do not make a powerpoint, content does- don't waste your time with special effects, animations, background, or transitions until your message is perfected.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Way beyond words,"Seen this the day after it hit USA, I am a big fan of CG anime's and other CG films; Final Fantasy, Vexille, Appleseed. Also video games and such. Never before have I seen such detail in textures and animations in a film like this, it was flawless! This is hands down one of the best films ever conceived in todays technology.Just to explain abit (No Spoilers) about what it looks like, there is next to no difference at all between the cg rendered avatars and the human actors. facial expressions, the lip sync, motor skills and physics. Everything is so well blended you can not help but stare in awe at this movie.So stop reading this, get off your computer chair, grab your keys and get to the movies.

Some interesting observation,"A lot of words has been written so far in relation to Avatar so it makes no sense to write the same again. I fully agree with people who claims that this particular movie lacks innovative plot, subtle script an so on. But who cares?! The sole purpose of this movie was to introduce REALLY stunning visual effects and the purpose has been achieved in 200%. Leaving the cinema I felt like 30 years before when I saw Star Wars for the first time. And I don't care if others claim Avatar is shallow in terms of intrigue.I made however quite interesting observation. I have scanned through opinions of people who rated Avatar 0 of 10. More then 30% of ""worst"" opinions has been written by people who did it for the first time. Another 30-40% has been written by those who previously have written maybe 3 or 4 opinions. It was also quite interesting to see what kind of movies they referred to. I have found maybe 2 or 3 persons whose attitude was quite ""stable"". They had also write quite negative opinions for other SciFi movies - well I can understand that. They do not like this kind of art. I have found however one person who knocked me down. He has given Avatar a 0 score and at the same time rated Transformers at 7 or 8. With all due respect Transformers are in every aspect inferior to Avatar. Special effects - fine but Avatar is a class for itself. Screenplay - give me a break. Transfomers are so childish, infantile I couldn't bear some parts of it. And finally actors. Avatar is not outstanding if acting is concerned but at least there are no superheroes like MacGyver able to defeat a huge army of adversaries with a lighter or swiss knife.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Clearly more than just a fantastic film,"I saw this movie today after having wanted to watch it since it came out. The movie is one step beyond in animation technology than anything else I had seen before, it is impossible to tell the difference between the real footage and the special effects. This innovative technology allows for the movie to become real, specially if watched in 3D, and brings the spectator closer to the movie, so much so that it almost feels you are actually inside the film.Apart from its astonishing visual effects this movie delivers a very well developed story from beginning to end, and although many people will say this is the typical invade the indians movie, there is clearly a lot more behind it. For starters there is a clear criticism toward the draining of natural resources of less developed nations, only for the benefit of those who have power, without the consideration for the people and the homes they destroy in the process. There are also a lot of environmental ideas behind this movie, and can be clearly observed on the relationship between the Na'vi people and their surrounding nature, also on the way they relate to other animals.Overall this movie delivers more than fantastic visual effects and story, but also takes the next step and delivers some moral values.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
avatar is OK,"the visuals are great even superb, however like titanic it is fatally flawed and like titanic in 1 years time people will vote this either best film of all time or worst film of all time. it is neither . the hype however is not matched by the film, a good cartoon is still only a cartoon. if anything this shows up the major problems with this kind of film. however much you try to make a cgi character look and act like a real actor it can't be done, try going to see a real live play twice and see how the actors vary and improve performances. Here we have the nearest a cartoon can get to a real film, that is Cameron's triumph, but a hackneyed script and weak dialogue make it seem like a bad episode of star trek or lost in space. This may be the way forwards for film but not yet!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Visually Stunning Adventure with a Few Hiccups - Avatar,"Avatar, the groundbreaking film by James Cameron, presents audiences with a visually stunning world that pushes the boundaries of modern filmmaking. It undoubtedly offers a unique and immersive cinematic experience, but beneath the awe-inspiring visuals, the plot feels forced and lacks smooth transitions between scenes, relying heavily on familiar and stereotypical tropes.First and foremost, the film's visual effects are nothing short of exceptional. The lush and vibrant world of Pandora, brought to life with remarkable attention to detail, is a true visual marvel. The imaginative flora and fauna, combined with breathtaking action sequences, transport viewers to a mesmerizing alien landscape. Cameron's use of cutting-edge technology and 3D cinematography enhances the immersive experience, making Avatar a groundbreaking technical achievement.However, where Avatar falls short is in its plot execution. While the film presents an intriguing premise of humans versus the indigenous Na'vi people and explores themes of environmental destruction and cultural clashes, the narrative feels formulaic and predictable. The characters, particularly the human protagonists, often fit into stereotypical roles and lack depth, making it difficult to form a strong emotional connection with them.Moreover, the transitions between scenes can feel abrupt and disjointed, resulting in a disjointed narrative flow. The pacing suffers as a result, as the film tries to balance the spectacle of action sequences with the need for character development and world-building. It occasionally feels as though certain scenes were included solely for the sake of showcasing the visual effects, rather than serving a clear narrative purpose.Despite these flaws, Avatar's strengths lie in its technical achievements and immersive world-building. The film's environmental message resonates with viewers, highlighting the importance of preserving our natural resources and respecting indigenous cultures. The attention to detail in creating the Na'vi culture and language is commendable, providing a level of depth to the world of Pandora.In summary, Avatar's stunning visual effects and immersive world-building make it a must-see film for its technical achievements alone. However, the forced plot and lack of smooth transitions between scenes detract from its overall impact. While the film manages to deliver an entertaining adventure, it relies on stereotypical character tropes and fails to reach its full potential as a truly groundbreaking narrative. Nevertheless, Avatar remains a visually impressive spectacle that left an indelible mark on the world of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"This is how cinema should be, Avatar is the first","Avatar sets a new standard of movie watching. It's said before and i agree. Avatar is beautiful, new, fresh, amazing. The 3D is so natural, we are on Pandora with Jake. The story did we see before, boy meets girl. Its like Matrix, its like Dances with Wolves. Weve seen this kind of story's a hundred times. But it doestn mather. Its not that important. But every scene breaths love for cinema. The 12 year of waiting for a new Cameron was worth every day. And now we wait for more amazing movies.

This movie is Dances with Wolves in 3D/Modern 2D,"Don't get me wrong, technically Avatar might be one of the most spectacular movies created to date but if you see it from a movie stand point it falls between average and good. The acting was just horrible, the story we've seen/heard of several times for example dances with wolves, the last samurai. Maybe James Cameron should have spent more money on better actors instead of spending useless amounts of money on the technology. I can't believe that he took 4 years to make this movie. I am very disappointed. I think that Avatar is a very overrated movie and should not be in the top 250 at all, James Cameron is just an average director and Avatar was just another average movie with bad actors like Sam Worthington(Jake), Stephen Lang(Colonel) and always trying to be cool but is actually retarded Michelle Rodriguez(Trudy). I also must say that whoever wrote the script for the actor was either a red neck or a college bully. I see, you see?(Wtf)Overall I think James Cameron is just like Michael Bay, he only knows how to do one thing right and in this case its the animation/technical part of the movie and he left out the basics such as good actors, solid story line and obviously a good script to go with all of that.I watched this movie a second time before writing this review.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life,"Back in the summer when i first saw the trailer of this movie, i thought why not i don't see this, it seemed like a mass production blockbuster Alien movie, with 3D screen, but i was wrong.. This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life.The movie is delivering an idea, i didn't think that i will find great performances from the actors and actresses in this movie, i enjoyed every second in this movie, the details are just perfect and i really think that this is James Cameron's masterpiece... Sam Worthington as Jack Sully, did a great job in this movie as an ex marine on wheeled chair,from the moment he was connected to his avatar he managed to give the viewer 2 different characters and did them both perfect. and Zoe Saldana as Neytiri, she managed to deliver emotions(Happiness, Sadness,betrayed, loving) through a computer generated character, and i think that was awesome . Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, she proved that she is a legend i really enjoyed what the art director did in this movie. i loved the every creature on the Planet Pandora, the soundtrack was awesome, i never though about been touched by two aliens in love.

I was surprised by all of the negativity surrounding this film.,"Especially once I had seen it, for myself, I was able to understand that the allegation of racism is completely ridiculous, as I understand this allegation/criticism made against this film. I do think that some of the characters in the film, specifically the Colonel, definitively, & Parker, probably, are at least bigoted in a way that borrows rather heavily from the racism inflicted upon the 500 Nations people of the Americas; but, that doesn't really make the characters racist, such as & specifically, in the way that those who inflicted the racism, of Manifest Destiny, etc., were onto the people of the 500 Nations. Yes, there's a similarity there; but, it's not the same thing. Although, a definitive argument against this is when the Colonel asks...""Hey, Sully, how's it feels to betray your own race?"" On the whole, the bigotry is about speciesism...not racism. So, maybe the Colonel is a racist apart from what it is actually about for the movie as a whole.Another important difference is that this film uses a corporatist justification for the bigotry, theft and murder of & from the Na'vi. The bigotry, which was undeniably racism, inflicted upon the 500 Nations people was predominantly Manifest Destiny, which was a religious - Christian fundamentalist - justification for the rape, murder & theft of & from the 500 Nations people. Yea, maybe it is splitting hairs to say that this one is racist & that one isn't, when the differences, religion, species not race, are relatively meaningless when you really look at it. But, even if the bad guys are racist in this film, at least it's the bad guys that are racist & not the good guys and not the film as a whole.Probably the biggest flaw about this film is that there is no attempt on the part of the characters to make a thoughtful examination and comparison with & between what is being done to the Na'vi, in this story, & what was done to the 500 Nations people, in reality, & if that also had been a part of this story. If that conversation had taken place within the dialogue & between the characters during this film I think that while the film may still have received some criticism, specifically from bigots, it would have received praise, overall, for tackling the subject.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dances with Pterodactyls, or, I'll Have a Blue Quetzalcoatlus Without You.","Have IQ's dropped sharply while I was gone? The overwhelming special effects of Avatar simply cannot hide the vacuousness of its story. As just about anyone who can read has noticed, the plot is a rehash of the ""civilised man goes native"" fable popularized from ""Last of the Mohicans"" to the present day (I'm sure even the ancient Egyptians have a version preserved in hieroglyphs somewhere on a dusty temple wall). The CGI is realistic enough that you can become engaged with the digital characters... except, then your attention is focused on the story. Which is almost as lame as a 6th graders summer vacation essay.I did not see the movie in 3D as I assumed it would be pointlessly distracting. I have seen polarized 3D movies before. Starting with one of the first, ""The Bubble"" in the late 60's. The peak of this in-your-face technology was reached years ago in the 70's with the release of ""The Stewardesses"". Nothing in this movie can compete with real 3D boobs.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the most satisfying movie-going experiences in years.,"I'd heard a lot of hype about Avatar, about its innovative technology and groundbreaking special effects, about all the anticipation, about the strong reviews and very strong opening weekend and Golden Globe nominations, and as much as I was intrigued, as much as I was wanting to see it, I was a little apprehensive. More often than not, hyped-up movies disappoint me, or at least underwhelm me. But this time, the hype was right. And this is one hell of a movie.True to the hype, the special effects are astonishing. And the 3-D used in the film was spectacular. Visually, it's one of the most amazing films I have ever had the privilege to see.Now, some people had indicated prior to my viewing of the film that the story and dialogue were a little weak. While I won't say it was the best-written movie of all time, and while I wouldn't hold my breath for a Best Screenplay nod at the Oscars, it was far from a bad script. At least, it didn't distract from the movie and leave a bad taste in the my mouth. Whatever it lacked in originality it more than made up for with the way it sucks you into its world and takes you along for a ride.And its world is well worth being sucked into. Such depth, such sheer creativity, in the world and its ecosystem, is unequalled. As alien as Pandora is, by movie's end, it seems perfectly natural, and the beauty and grandeur of its scenery and life-forms is staggering.Finally, the acting was competent, and ""right"" enough not to distract, though, again, Oscars are unlikely. The music is another matter; I expect Horner will at least get a nomination for his powerful score.Basically, all the individual pieces of this film are well-crafted, and they all seem to fit together into one tapestry that surpasses just about everything else in the movies of the past several years. I won't say it was 100% flawless, but whatever flaws it did have were minor, and completely shadowed by the magic of this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will eagerly await its DVD release. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I had it before entering the cinema and exactly before the movie started. Then it all disappeared. It got me sooo much that I watched it twice in the theater, ad perhaps will go to watch some more.Another one of those few that should never be forgotten.

I wish I were one of them. And an amazing love story also completes the film so everyone who goes will be satisfied. Yes, the story is one that we have heard before and is really nothing new but, it is a story we love and is told in a whole new way. Avatar is doing right now what Star Wars did for its time.

Enough to make old eyes feel young again,"I'm not really that old, but I've seen quite a few movies in my day. After Lord of the Rings was completed, I wondered if I'd ever be truly excited by a motion picture again. Well, James Cameron has done it with Avatar. There are the obvious cinematic innovations to acknowledge: carefully used 3D, the new motion capture technology, etc. The film just simply LOOKS great. I found myself giggling with joy at the pure beauty of so many of the scenes of Pandora (the alien planet) and its fauna. Cameron's time deep sea diving has obviously fired his imagination for strange and wonderful creatures. There is solid acting (particularly Stephen Lang, as the Colonel, who somehow pulls off a gritty depiction of a now very clichÃ©d role), and there wasn't a single line in the script that had me checking my brain at the door. (There are some recycled lines, to be sure, but I didn't find them distracting.) Score by Horner was subtle, yet still moving. Frankly, though, what worked more than anything for me was the overall storytelling. A number of my friends were disappointed with the ""gone native"" tale, that has been ""done to death"" through previous works like ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Last Samurai"", but I didn't find it old at all. Rather, this is a fantastic re-imagining of the age old human tendency to colonize and obliterate other cultures and environments. Cameron is definitely spinning us a morality yarn, but it is one that cannot be spun enough times, and he does make every effort to make this iteration the most beautiful you will ever see. 10/10 p.s. Without any intentional hyperbole, I consider this to be the finest movie I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This is the BIG one.,"James Cameron's Avatar is the reason why I love movies. Avatar revolutionized my viewing experience once more just as Star Wars did.Starting with the plot and characters, others were right about the lack of originality in the story and some underdeveloped characters. I thought the characters weren't for us to know them but to 'feel' them. It was as if I was with Jake and Neytiri every step of the way, it was like a 'bond' as one of the movie's many themes suggests. I thought the story was told very well.I haven't seen Dances with Wolves but I could compare the film's story to Disney's Pocahontas. You could easily point out who is mirroring who and pretty much what's going to happen to them. Still, this was executed wonderfully that even if you knew where it's all going you still feel the thrill. Somewhere in the middle I lost my way for a while then quickly got back as things started heating up. I pretty much understand now why some people didn't like the movie for it's plot and character development. Overall having seen it my way, it's Epic.Acting is credible on both the live and computerized characters. The indigenous Na'vis looked and acted so real that you'd sometimes think them as better actors than the real ones. Not that the real actors did a bad job or anything like that.The visuals are nothing I've seen of before. I almost forgot to take a breath, my brain was stimulated to the awesomeness that is Pandora.

It IS a predictable story. But... It's about so much more than just that.,"When Avatar first came out I didn't understand all the hype. I saw it in the cinema, and thought it was okay. I had very high expectations. I was only 16 years old then. I watched it a few more times afterwards, and thought much the same. It was very beautifully done with all the visual effects and with a story you've seen before, with the spy switching sides once he falls in love with an enemy, the foreign culture or the society he's invading.I am now 30 years old and just watched the movie again before the sequel. I noticed other things this time, and saw the film with new eyes and with different perspectives. I can understand others who think the film's story is clichÃ©d, which I myself used to think and to some extent still think. It IS a predictable story. But... It's about so much more than just that. It shows how evil and disrespectful the human race is towards nature and other cultures. That humans can destroy something as beautiful as Pandora, blinded by greed and lust for power. Just as it is in reality. But reality is worse, since we are doing it to our own planet. This made me rethink the movie and made me appreciate it more than before.Movies are a lot about personal taste too, of course. This is certainly not a perfect movie, but I think it was better now than previous times I've seen it. I agree that the visual effects on the Avatars don't measure up to today's standard, but it did back then. Now I'm going to see the sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How To Retire Early: Volume 2.,"Without doubt the most hyped and publicly marketed film in the history of contemporary cinema, Avatar has since dominated the big screen in all corners of the world, going on to generate over $2.7 billion in revenue and giving director James Cameron the highly- respectable title of having been at the helm of both the most, and second-most, financially successful cinematic endeavours of all time.Avatar takes us more than one hundred years into the future, where the Earth (played by the United States) sends a group of Marines to mine the foreign planet of Pandora for an extremely rare MacGuffin known as Unobtainium. Involved in this operation is the crippled Jake Sully, who is given the task of fusing his body with a cloned native in order to gain the trust of the planet's Indigenous population, the Na'vi, and convince them to flee their home in to accommodate the excavation of their sacred site. Along the way, Jake becomes more than friendly with the Na'vi princess Neytiri and begins to question the underlying motives of his employer.For many cinema goers, this film offered a comprehensively positive answer to the most debatable of movie topics: can a film made with the budget of a small (or, in this case, not- so-small) country which is made to appeal to the masses also be embraced by the critical community?Unfortunately, I'm not one of those believers. For pre-hype about Avatar to include such claims as 'it will revolutionise the way people watch and interpret cinema', it's fair to say expectations were pretty high. I walked into the film expecting a heavy dose of originality to complement the many socially conscious themes suggested by trailers, and ultimately implicated in the film's plot (including a criticism of America's involvement in the occupation of Iraq, as well as the need for us all to make our thumbs a little greener).What I got was same-old, same-old, Hollywood production-line stuff. A plot recreated dozens of times in different environments, coupled with a 'romantic' sub-plot lacking any sense of depth meant this was 'just another movie' in my eyes. I'm always open to give two thumbs up for innovation in film and, quite frankly, would have had no problem in seeing the closing credits roll following Jake's refreshingly insightful monologue about how 'we all have to wake up sometime.'Of course, the film dragged on for another 45 minutes, climaxing in a fierce battle scene allowing the special effects crew to show off to their heart's content, which was, that's right, thrown in to appeal to the masses.Despite this, I am impartially obliged to list three positives to come out of what was otherwise a disappointing film. Sam Worthington's portrayal of Jake Sully was, while by no means Oscar-worthy, leaps and bounds ahead of his previous enterprise in the dreadful Terminator: Salvation. The attention to detail offered in terms of the mannerisms of a paraplegic was something I was worried would be pushed to one side in the scope of such a grand undertaking, but Worthington did the role justice.Secondly, Avatar has given 3D cinema the push it needed to avoid being just some flavour- of-the-month promotion, and I for one am glad to see it hang around. Avatar is the first, and by no means the last, blockbuster to accommodate this revolution in filmmaking. And speaking of revolution, no one can voice their opinion on Avatar without mentioning the visuals. Not since our encounter with a real-life T-rex in Spielberg's suspenseful 1993 roller-coaster have computer-generated effects taken such a huge step forward. Now if only JC and company could have formed the plot, character development and dialogue to match.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

A work of Art! This is a fantasy ride you don't want to miss.,"I have been looking forward to seeing Avatar in 3D for some time now, so when I arrived at the IMAX theatre in Wimbledon on Saturday, my expectations were extremely high.Unfortunately this meant that I wasted the opening 5 minutes scrutinising every detail of the beautifully created 3D environment. Thankfully this was short-lived because once the story and characters grabbed my attention there was no looking back.I spent the next two hours and 40 minutes glued to my seat completely and utterly captivated by a truly unique and visceral experience that has left me aching for more.The basis of the story may not be the most original with similarities to 'Dances with Wolves' and to a lesser extent 'The Matrix', but this in no way impedes what is fundamentally a beautiful story of self discovery.The characters are engaging and the story is extremely well paced considering the length of the movie and at no time did I look at my watch and wonder how much longer the film had to go. In fact it was the opposite, as the story progressed I found myself worrying that it would end all too soon.I'm a huge fan of James Cameron so should not be surprised by just how good this film actually is, but the love and attention that has been paid to every single element of this film is evident, from the fantastic environment to the character relationships, it delivers on every level.Thank you James Cameron for giving us such a beautiful work of art, it really is something quite special.In case you didn't get the message: DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fooey to the Bad Reviewers,"For some reason I decided to read the ""Hated It"" comments before writing my own. Almost without exception this pompous crowd opined that AVATAR was merely ""eye candy"" and nothing else; e.g., so-so script, acting, storyline, ending, etc.""Eye candy"" has been an feature of film for awhile now, only somewhere about 100 years, when audiences gasped at the moon beings in "" A TRIP TO THE MOON"". It was certainly scary candy to the early 20th century viewers who ran out of the theater when the train directly approached them on screen. We were still eating movie ""candy"" when the Mighty Kong climbed the Empire State Building. The rubber suited creatures in ""THE TIME MACHINE"" had me afraid for weeks. I also caught a buzz on the film that journeyed into the human body in a yellow submarine, certainly a thoughtless piece of fluff. Personally my ignorance is demonstrated by having loved, at 12 years old, a""JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH"" and other Jules Verne adaptations, not to mention just about any other flick starring dinosaurs, space creatures and dudes from beyond the grave.I might also point out an relatively unknown director named Steve Spielberg who has produced an abundance of mediocre fodder full of tricks and sentimental effects that captivated and pulled tears from a sap like me. It seems you cerebral brainiacs see right through those gimmicks that have me leaving the theater with tears and/or smiles.Why, I should've told my kids to dry those eyes and/or wipe those smiles off their faces and get down to some serious business!Message to the snob egghead crowd who believe themselves above a jolly good time. Stay home. Most of us wouldn't enjoy meeting you anyway. Apparently you were born 30 years old, infertile and over educated. If by some some chance you academics managed to actually parent a pre-teen who you took to the movies and who remained enthralled by AVATAR for the rest of the day, be sure to sit him/her down and instruct your son/daughter that such was just industry junk. I'm sure he/she will be the better for it.PS: To you nerds who believe me a complete idiot, Read some of my reviews on low budget domestic dramas and other stuff. You see, I really want to pretend I'm as smart as you guys. But you know better because I liked AVATAR.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Classic ""first release shock""","As a prolific reviewer here, I have on many occasions encountered what I call ""first release shock."" Essentially a film so off-the-beaten-path, so unique, so different that, instead of appreciating it for what it is, initial viewers go into a sort of shock and become numb to what they are watching.This film is the poster child for that syndrome. On its own, it is one of the most daring, best written, best acted, best SFX'd, films of all time. It comes from a man (Cameron) who is known for blockbusters, but this is easily his greatest work.This film should rate a perfect score regardless of the rating system. But as explained above initial viewers did not know what to make of it. And the cost of the film became an issue for the studio when the numbers failed to meet expectations.It is not the job of the reviewer to worry about studio receipts. The job of the reviewer is identify brilliance and recommend it. See it six or seven times, it just gets better. One of the greatest films of all time and also timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"To quote John Locke (Lost), I was wrong","A while back while watching the teaser trailer of the movie, I started to wonder what the hell it was. I immediately jumped on the ""I hate Avatar"" bandwagon even though I wasn't aware of the story.Fastforward to the present day. The only reason I watched the movie was because I have not watched a 3D movie before. I was pleasantly surprised & came out wanting to watch the movie again & again.As the other comments have said, this movie is an experience. It has a little of everything & you experience everything between laughter & sorrow, hope & despair, love & loss. I believe in the movie so much that I had to write a review (my first ever).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie for What it is...an Action Film,"I liked JC's return to the big screen here - it is pretty epic but I really hope they keep the world to just this one movie as it's pretty much told everything we need to know. I wasn't too excited about seeing a 60% SFX / 40% live action split but I was pleasantly surprised by this product (saw the 3D version). Some of the plot lines a seasoned veteran can spot coming a mile away but that doesn't detract from the above-average acting and stunning computer visuals. I think the greatest challenge to any SciFi ""thinker"" like Cameron has always been in creating an ""alien"" world that is wholly unique, not just another movie filmed in Hawaii or the Sahara - I think JC accomplishes that here with all his little details in the terrain and the alien environment. His alien natives are well developed though obviously borrowing a TON from man's world history. You can easily relate the situation in this movie (the Big Bully versus David) to much of what's already been made of humankind - America forcibly taking lands and driving out the Native Americans, the British/German/Belgium/France/Spain/Portugal/Italy rape of Africa - sad to note but we're no better to one another let alone to this peaceful alien race. That aside, Avatar plays it well - perhaps a bit too ""eco-crazy"" for those Republicans out there - but a great action movie at its core nonetheless. The 3D version didn't add much to my overall experience BTW - it really just adds a little visual depth with the camera target staying in focus while the entire scene is ""layered"" in front and behind the target. So you'll see passing leaves and embers moving about in front of you - nothing too distracting/overtly cool there.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Am I blue?,"After you dismiss all the superficial reviews for the movie as ""I bought this for my granddaughter"", ""It came in a package that was only slightly chewed"", ""Blu-ray is the greatest, just look at all those pixels,"" ""The producers hate America"", ""See the corporations are just money grubbers."" and so forth, You can get down to why you buy movies and specifically this one as plot and presentation.The basic story is that we found a new planet with a valuable mineral. We want that mineral at any cost. Therefore, we attempt communication and barter, if that does not work for some reason then it is coercion and displacement. One misplaced person is stuck in the middle of the decision and is torn between two ways of life and loyalty. Will his actions affect either way of life or is he just a pawn?Now I know I have seen this whole movie before in animation but cannot seem to locate it. I was surprised and more so. Because it is one thing to follow a formula but another to downright copy another movie. There was nobody substitution in the animated film. Yet that was the only real addition.O. K. For the technocentric I only saw the Blu-ray 2D version. I think it was the 46"" screen that made the impressive presentation. It almost looked 3D. Also, the sound was all you would expect it to be.For people that come to think of the DVD extras or Bonus as a relevant part of the package. Moreover, many times it is. You will be disappointed with the version I watched, as there was only a screen/bookmark section.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Return to Pandora,"Very well made movie. The plot and storyline were epic, the visuals were stunning, and the music was also very majestic. It had an interesting twist with how you sometimes have to ""wake up"" from some of life's interesting moments. The movie had good action scenes and cool futuristic military equipment. Unique characters and some decent humorous moments throughout the film. There's not much bad to say about this film. It's practically one of the most thought out and detailed movies since almost any of the Star Wars films. And it all looks even more stunning on a Blu-ray disc (no joke at all, every detail is clear compared to other films on Blu-ray). I'm quite anxious to see there sequels when they come out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
OK You Got Me!,"This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don't like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God's sake. This is full of spectacle, ""humanity,"" and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I'm surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren't complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren't as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great technical feat,"This film, with that kind of world building, visuals and narration style, feels more like a triple A video game in story mode than a movie in retrospect from the twenties. But concerning that this movie came out at a time when smartphones weren't even a thing, one can only imagine how pioneering and groundbreaking it was at the time of initial release. The film struck a fair balance between telling the story while sprinkling in the underlying themes, with the advantage of powerful and striking visuals, helped elevate the emotional impact and bring out the message from the filmmakers as they obviously intended without making the movie feel too much like propaganda.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visual Extravaganza...Enormous yarn of a film..,"---May contain spoilers--- OK, so here we have Avatar, the most monstrously-hyped, obscenely expensive and ultimately biggest let down of a film in history.I'm not gonna lie, I was completely blown away by the fantastic visuals and thought. The CGI and special effects are breathtaking...I accept. However, this film just fails to deliver on so many levels. I would like to think of myself as one of the few individuals that saw this movie who was not blind to the glaring limitations thanks to being absorbed into the aesthetically pleasing elements of this film. NO THANKS!I am well aware that there are numerous reviews on the site that equal disaffection to the movie as I do but I had to chip in with my two pence because the fact that this film as become the highest grossing film of all time worldwide is not at all surprising but is utterly disgusting.The staggering global revenue of this film doesn't mean anything. What do you expect when you have a film twelve years after James Cameron's last cash cow of a film, Titanic, that swept the Oscars and generated obscene amounts of money? I suppose we can thank James Cameron for taking almost $300 million and producing a cinematic experience that is so vastly inferior to The Lord of The Rings and Star Wars in terms of imaginative scope. Thumbs up Cameron! I have to admit that the film had stacks of potential after the first half an hour. Sam Worthington, who played Jake Sully, an ex-marine who is sent to the world of Avatar as a one of the locals, falls in love, has to gain the approval of her father. I don't think we have ever seen these concepts in a film before. Oh wait...yes we have. The film, however, transcends shamelessly into a catastrophic blend of CGI-fuelled emotional emptiness and mediocre acting, excluding Stephen Lang, I liked him. The films ending is laughable! Truly pathetic. I cant remember ever being so bored watching a series of mindless explosions and gunfire in an imaginary world. Well done Cameron.So there you go, Avatar, an unbelievable visual extravaganza that fails miserably in every other aspect that film can. I will be extremely disappointed if Cameron pips his ex-spouse Kathryn Bigelow for the Best Director and Best Picture awards at the Oscars, not that the Oscars get many things right.Oh yeah! Almost forgot, the Avatar's live in a huge tree! Brilliantly inventive and exciting...oh wait on second thoughts, not so much. Calling Avatar a masterpiece and a breakthrough in cinema is bordering on unforgivable.2/10 A point for the visuals and a point for the film actually being made.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The greatest film ever,"I wont go into plot details, I will just tell you my feelings about this film, because it is so powerful I wanted to share this. I have now seen this film twice. The 1st time I saw it I rang my eldest son he asked me what I thought of it, I see many films love the cinema, my response was simple, It was the greatest film I have ever seen. He saw it the next day, I asked him what he thought he said the same. The 3d is stunning the story while simple is emotive during the film you are fully engrossed by the characters and their inter-relationships, it fully captivated me. I am going to see it for a 3rd time at the IMAX. My only fear is that I now expect even more from my cinematic experiences in the future. This is a classic and another brilliant film from Mr Cameron",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I was on another planet.  Cameron's just showing off at this point.,"The ground shook, and the crowd cheered. They wept. They gasped. They laughed. And finally, they applauded. What they experienced was something only a master can make, an adventure so spellbinding, so memorable, and so exhilarating that it's worth holding your bladder for almost 3 hours to sit through. It's worth tearing up behind 3D glasses. It's worth admitting that to your friends later. Finally, it's worth telling people that you saw this movie. I'm lucky to say I was a part of that group.Can anyone possibly set the bar higher than James Cameron? I think the only one who can set the bar higher is Cameron himself. He described it as his masterpiece, and that it is. Make no mistake: when seeing Avatar, know that you're witnessing cinematic history. Something directors like Peter Jackson only flirted with, Cameron mastered. Not only is Cameron's creation of a character astounding, but what truly sets Cameron apart from the rest is his ability to create a whole new world, where you can escape to, learn from, and bond to. At first, you'll be asking a lot of questions. ""Who's he?"", ""What was that?!"", ""Is that real, or CGI?"". But soon after...I can't say at what point, because I imagine it being different for each viewer, you'll become immersed in Cameron's beautiful Pandora, as he opens the box and reveals a beautiful new world to us as viewers.There are two kinds of Visual Effects, in my opinion. The first kind is the ""Transformers"" kind. These effects are the kind that wow you with their showy exterior, but are just there for entertainment. The second kind is the kind that enhances the background, works within a setting, and improves the overall viewing experience. Cameron did it with Aliens. He did it with Terminator 2. He did it for Titanic. And now he's done it again. At this point, he's just showing off. Cameron's incredible immersion into the world of Pandora is what makes it work. Without it, this is just some other alien movie. Cameron's impeccable attention to detail, such as whenever our characters are roaming through a forest, or flying on a winged beast...this is what gives the movie its life, its energy...which is what the entire theme and point of the movie is. Life is connected through us all, and Cameron's incredible work will bond every viewer through their love of movies and the very escapism Cameron provides.You'll notice that I've spared you a plot description. I believe this movie is best viewed with little or no knowledge. It helps with the immersion. Don't watch a trailer. Don't read a synopsis. I will say, however, that the true stars of the film are Zoe Saldana and Stephen Lang, who will undoubtedly go down as two actors who played their classic-in-the-making characters to perfection. Yeah, the screenplay is not a truly original product, and the film does play out in a semi-formulaic fashion...but this doesn't matter. It's the experience of Avatar that will move you, by what you're seeing, what you're hearing...and what you're experiencing. A beautiful score makes this seamlessly edited film flow even better, while the colors of the movie, so bright and vibrant, assure the viewer that they're about to have the most unique movie-going experience of their lives.I can't really recommend an experience like this more than I already have. I was on another planet for almost 3 hours. This is truly a movie to experience, a movie that makes us glad that we live in these times. It's the best motion picture of 2009, and one of the most revolutionary, immersing, and incredible movies ever made. I can say this without a doubt. Do not miss this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"This film is truly awe-inspiring. After leaving the cinema, reality kicks in... and it sucks compared to Pandora.","Many reviews have stated that Avatar is unoriginal, that it is simply 'Dances with Wolves' in a different planet. Reviews who have stated this, also mention that the script is weak and that the characters need to be developed. I have realized that there are really two main viewpoints to those who have seen the film: 1) you observed and focused the ups and downs of the film (like a reviewer) 2) you did not observe and focus, instead you watched and 'lived' it. Now that I have put this into perspective, I believe the reason why many of the reviews state that the story is unoriginal, the script is weak etc. is because the reviewers fail to experience the film in its entirety. Reviewers are paid to review, their job is to highlight the ups and downs of a film, focusing and scrutinizing every detail. With Avatar, reviewers are not going to pay the film its full appreciation because they lack what is necessary to enjoy this film, which is to leave behind their ready and prepared criticisms. For those who had a viewpoint as no. 2... Well done! You appreciated the film as a whole, and truly did experience living in Pandora for two and a half hours, and that's what Cameron intended for his audience-to immerse themselves in this fascinating world of Pandora and experience the sorrow, laughter, anger and joy while watching Avatar.

Best Movie Ever,"Samuel Common ENG 101 WP#3 May 24, 2010 James Cameron has given us some of Hollywood's most notable films in history. His work is as diverse as it is compelling. From 'Alien' to 'The Abyss' his films are full of action and are intelligently crafted. As with many Hollywood action movies the plot and dialog often suffer as if that aspect has to be sacrificed in order to make way for the boom and bang of the film. With Cameron this is not the case as one of his greatest achievements 'Titanic' proved in 1997, which went on to be the highest grossing movie of all time. Hard to believe that one could do much better than 'Titanic' but one better believe it. I saw Avatar at the Arizona Mills Mall Imax in 3D with my fiancÃ©'. Arizona Mills is a family oriented shopping and entertaining Megaplex. We were exhausted that day and didn't really want to go but we had already purchased the tickets. Despite not really having much of an idea what this movie was about going in we had heard that it was nearly 3 hours long and I couldn't imagine ANYthing that Hollywood could make that would be worth over 2 Â½ hours of my life but I was pleasantly surprised. Avatar is not a movie, it's an experience. The characters are are REAL, you identify with them and their plight. Jake Sully (the main character) and the audience become one, we connect to him and his emotions, we actually care about whether or not he succeeds. The visual experience of Pandora is breathtaking. The audience is given a real treat, for nearly 3 hours we are no longer on this planet. No longer do we have the burdens of our jobs, the stress of the economy, the turmoil of our conflicting government, and all of the other things that weigh us down here on this planet. For nearly 3 hours we are in Pandora a beautiful, vibrant, pulsating planet that is alive and glowing with life. I couldn't help wondering if the Garden of Eden wasn't something like Pandora. I don't wish to spoil this experience for others so I am purposefully excluding details of the film, but if you are in the mood for something so new in it's concept, so creative in it's story and so beautiful in it's design then Avatar is the movie that you are looking for. 11 stars out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

So I judged on how well it told said cliche story and in my opinion it did amazing. The setting is absolutley beatiful,the creatures wild and filled with beaty everything is so creativly made, ending on am enderenalizing finale. But the length of the movie is felt and some characters being played by very talented actors still manage to fall flat to me.

Best movie in years,"I can't remember a time when a movie has ever lived up to its hype, but this one did. Avatar is a stunningly beautiful movie, but beyond cinematography and special effects there was excellent acting, very engaging characters and gripping storytelling. While some may consider the storytelling somewhat clichÃ©, I would respond by saying that the simplicity of premise is more than made up for by the masterful way in which it is presented. This movie is simply a cinematic masterpiece and if there is any justice it will garner a lot of attention from the academy. It was easily worth the increased ticket price to see it in IMAX 3D. This one is a must see.For parents - you don't have any worries with sex or nudity in this one. The PG-13 is definitely for the violence, though even that avoids gore. Mostly explosions and some big alien creatures. Besides the violence, there's a little language, but really nothing you wouldn't encounter on television.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Yes, I did say overrated","Avatar is considered by some to be the greatest film of all time and I do say that I disagree. While it is the highest selling, I do not think it is the best by far.There are plenty of good things about the film. There are a few good acting performances that made the film better. Obviously the effects were incredible, breathtaking to say the least. It would be stupid to say otherwise. And for once a film wasn't mediocre in 3-D, Avatar got this accomplished well.However, I feel cons outweigh the pros for this installment. First off, the clichÃ©s killed me, such as ""Unobtainium"" and ""Pandora"". That was a minor annoyance compared to the plot. It was so obvious and predictable that is was hard to try to get into it. I felt I was watching a laser light show rather than a movie: beautiful, but no substance.I do think that the movie is was too overrated. Far better ones came out that year and this year. While it obviously raised the bar in effects miles ahead of where it had been, it just couldn't take you in like a magnificent movie does.

This is a must watch movie just for the CGI. Nothing more , nothing less.More over there is nearly nonexistent acting.

Everything that can be said about this movie has probably already been said but I'll still go ahead and speak my peace regardless lol.,"I loved avatar and I'm happier than anyone there's going to be a sequel but I must say it was a ballsy move to, after over a decade, not only make a sequel but confirm 3 more movies that are going to follow that without waiting to see how the sequel does. In preparation for that avatar was re-released in theatres so I went to watch it.It really was a breath of fresh air, something completely new in the genre. It's shocking it wasn't 'based' on a book. I've come to then learn it's a scifi retelling of the colonial history of north and South America with the conflicts between the military groups and indigenous people. Made me appreciate the movie even more now.The faith and beliefs of the Na'avi made it more than just an alien movie with big guns and exotic forests because there's actually something worth fighting for, something to lose. There were stories to tell, one of which Jake Sully's who in my opinion didn't really feel like an actual marine, it's not down to the actor playing him but more of how his character was written. That's literally the only thing I think it could have done better.There was great action, most notably in the third act when it became just an action flick. Coupled with the great cgi it was really captivating to watch on the big screen, as well as the beautiful scenery all throughout the movie. I was most impressed by how well everything is thought out, it's not just some other ambitious sci-fi that relies on it's visuals and action scenes. A lot in Pandora was based off things and ideas of animals, tribal culture and how people people treat their faiths, these are things we're familiar with in real life or other sci-fi movies, so it felt like you could relate with it but still had a unique feel.Adding to concepts that felt familiar, Jakes addiction to his avatar life which could be compared to someone into virtual reality or games, reminds me of Ready Player One. So as much as this was a unique sci-fi it felt like a coming together of every sci-fi book and comic you've ever read, as James Cameron himself said.There was also a love story being told, a bit generic with someone falling for the enemy after realizing they aren't on the right side; but I'm a sucker for romance so even though it isn't as a prominent feature of the movie it was still important to the plot and I loved seeing it.Nearly 3hrs long but it went by quickly as it wasn't plot heavy, could've been squeezed into a shorter runtime but why would you want to. I wasn't as emotionally invested or in awe as I was during my first viewing but this was still a beautifully made and captivating science fiction masterpiece, and I'm looking forward to watching The Way Of Water.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolutely Mind-Blowing.,"I went to see Avatar this afternoon in 3d, and I must say; it was simply one of the most mind-blowing experiences I've ever been subjected to. The special effects were completely out of this world, and the attention to detail was astounding. Pandora is absolutely beautiful and it's crazy to understand that someone had the imagination to create such out-of-this-world imagery. The story-line was strong, and the characters where easily relate-able. What I believe to be, completely original piece of film-making, and a template for many movies to come. The three hours weren't a drag either, I was never bored. Fantastic Performances by Sam Worthington and Zoe Salander as well as an impressive supporting role performance from Giovanni Ribisi I suppose there's nothing more I can say thank to tell you to watch it and see it for yourselves!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not Avatar the movie, Avatar the EXPERIENCE.","""Avatar"" is, for all intents and purposes, hardly on the same level of visual medium as a ""film"". It is, it was, to me, an experience. An experience that I happened to witness in a movie theater (luckily enough in an IMAX 3D theater)...and during this experience I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I got excited, but most of all, I was entertained. Entertained, entertained, entertained.I knew going into the theater that Avatar would be clichÃ©. I did. And I didn't care one bit. I was too preoccupied with the mind-blowing experience before me to care about how stupid a line was or how well I could predict the plot. With Avatar, it really doesn't matter. And to say this film would be nothing without its effects is like saying orange juice would be nothing without the orange. In other words, the effects cannot be separated from the film, NOT BECAUSE the effects make the film, but because story and effects go hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in a way that is not only appealing to the eye, but for the most part, the hearts of the mass audience.In a way, Avatar's plot not being the most original thing in the world was a good thing. Suppose it did have some wonderfully complex story - would I have enjoyed it as much? Probably not. It doesn't make Cameron lazy for not using original ideas...I mean, Pandora itself is pretty original for film-making (name a movie where a world has literally been created). This is the man who dreamed up the idea for Terminator, we know he has original plot ideas, he didn't need to prove that to us with Avatar.Avatar is probably the greatest film experience, ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic,"I saw the movie in 3D. It was a night I was very sad because of bad family news, I was doubtful if to use the long time booked tickets. I have to say that during the movie I completely forgot all my troubles, I was in another world, much better then the real one, full of magic things and landscapes. This movie for me is a fantastic journey, that let your heart flight free in your child's fantasy. I think Cameron and his staff have done a fantastic job, writing a new page in movie history. I don't care the plot is not new, I like if good wins over the evil, but this is a true masterpiece, the future of movie will change. The 3D in the future could be improved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated and overstuffed,The movie had an interesting and intriguing premise but there was absolutely no need for it to be as long as it was. There was just so many moments that could've been trimmed down (even a little bit) and the enjoyment factor really suffers from this.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I can't imagine the render farm this took to make!,"Years ago when Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was released (2001), it set a benchmark for rendered animated actors in a movie. I remember reading about the hundreds of hours of rendering time it took to make and was in awe of the animation. Man have we come a long way! Thanks to Moore's law, computing power has nearly tripled since then and the complexity of animation that's capable now blurs the line between CG and live-action & effects. Cameron has reportedly spent MILLIONS of $ on this movie and it shows in every aspect of the movie. Cameron is a master at telling a story and what I HATE in a lot of movies using live action and animated/CG characters is certainly absent from this movie. I SO hate it when some CG monster pops out at the actors and it HAS to roar (or do some OTHER formulaic action that's been miserably repeated ad nauseum in other movies) and stands there for a few seconds looking menacing and THEN it attacks our main character(s). I think Cameron must have did some homework and observations in nature to see how animals and such respond to threats and aggress in the wild. That part I feel he got pretty bang on and you CAN feel hair rise up on your skin and some semblance of what the character would probably be feeling. One example is when Jake accompanies the two scientist as a guard and is chased by some kind of creature. You can literally feel the panic, the branches banging on the characters face, and the wind as the creature takes swipes at him. I also like that the character's CG looked about 95% lifelike and not hyper-rendered or ultra-fluid. We CAN see the state-of-the-art in Avatar. The CG animation is ALMOST 100% like-like. Better than anything we've seen to date. When you encounter an animated actor in other movies, you can tell right away they are animated as they just don't have that certain human gait to their mannerisms and expressions. Cameron has pulled an ace out of the hat with the CG in that respect. I would guess a LOT of characters in the movie had some kind of motion-capture applied to them as they appeared vastly more realistic to what we recognize as motion and expression in the natural world. OK, on to the story and other elements.I can see some of the elements of what people say with regard to Last Samurai and Dances With Wolves BUT this is not THAT kind of movie. If you don't want to know TOO much of the movie, skip this part NOW! We learn that humans have pretty much plundered and rendered their own world sans ""green"" and have traveled 6 years (light years?) to a planet called Pandora because it has this stuff called Unobtainium (probably because it's unobtainable on earth, could have had a better name but I ""get"" why it's called that, slight allusion there) that goes for 20 million an ounce (or some such measure of weight) and the aliens are sitting on a mother-load of it. The human have been trying to court the aliens to swindle them...I mean, relocate them so they can dig up the Unobtanium. That's as much as you'll need to know in terms of premise of the movie. So with that, you can see the allusion to the ""white man"" coming in and taking away the Native American's land for a few baubles and beans. I think it was Cameron's intent to liken the aliens to Native Americans as it gives the story a bit of accessibility and digs into our collective past and how we treated the Native American's when ""we"" arrived. What it boils down to is Cameron saying to his audience that we as humans need to do a much better job of taking care of what we HAVE rather than progressing towards being a people who take from others and will ignorantly kill anything and anyone just to get what we THINK is ours.Overall, I don't agree with others saying this is the Star Wars of this generation. I thought the story was worthy of Cameron's name and his production and direction of this movie will not be rivaled ANY time soon. You will not notice the 2 1/2 hours length of the movie. Yes, it is THAT good. I look forward to watching it on BluRay or in 3D to see what I am really missing. If you walk away from this movie thinking ""stupid CGI, pro-alien, and anti-human"", you missed the whole point of the movie. BUT, if you walk away thinking that even if we ever live long enough or advance far enough to explore other worlds, we should always remember that if there is life already on another planet, it was there, long, long, LONG ago before we showed up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Masterpiece,"You know the story from the trailers, you know the director has been working on it for the better part of two decades. So the question is this the film that revolutionizes film? 3-D films in the past have been notorious for breaking the fourth wall needlessly, but Avatar is full immersion 3-D. At no moment do you look at the Na'vi and remember you are in a theatre. Some critics complain that the run-time is far too long, but when Jake is spending time on Pandora you feel as if you are emotionally invested in each and every one of the people and places.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paralyzed former Marine joining the Avatar program after the death of his brother. With his new Avatar he can walk again and once he infiltrates the Na'vi and convinces them to move away from their land based on a very valuable deposit of Unobtanium, Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) promises to get Jake's ""real legs back"".Avatar is one of those moments in film that cannot be missed, this is bigger than Lord of the Rings, The Dark Knight, or any movie of this decade. This is the wonderment in cinema that has been missing for so long. Cameron firmly establishes you into a new world filled with some of his old mainstays. There is no lack of strong female characters - something that has been lacking for far too long. If you didn't know any better you would almost say Sigourney Weaver's Ripley had returned in the form of Grace. Zoe Saldana's Neytiri is going to launch her career in a way that Star Trek didn't. Instead of playing the eye candy she embodies a brave warrior that drives the story and rehumanizes Jake.Welcome back James Cameron, we missed you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Huge Weaknesses Alongside One Huge Strength,"The dialog, plot and overall action of this movie was unremarkable from a story standpoint. In fact the dialog was downright bad. Some lines were picked straight out of previous movies, including Cameron's Aliens, such as a Sgt. calling his troops ""ladies"" which has been copied to death in other movies that followed Aliens, making the dialog sound dated at times.The story was also predictable and formulaic and we've seen it all before... humans come to a new world, want something, and take it at the expense of the natives. Sci-fi fans that like sciencey plots that challenge the mind will find none of that here.Even much of the action was repeating what worked for Cameron before, like the famous scene in Aliens where Ripley is strapped in a loader doing battle with Mommy Alien. Star Wars, Iron Man and several other movies have used the loader-type artillery machines, and Avatar does too, particularly in a key scene near the end, delivering the message that you've seen it all before, and now you are seeing it yet again.For all of these reasons I found Avatar disappointing in a way I wasn't expecting. I expected more out of Cameron's writing. But Avatar did have one major strength that will ensure it is a huge success, because no other movie has it... and this is where Cameron put all his marbles.Avatar has a planet no one has seen before that is filled with exotic forests, plants and animals that are entirely original and fascinating. Cameron's wild imagination explodes in the habitat of the Na'vi, and will not likely disappoint viewers. The time involved in creating such a lush world with so many different life forms and plants boggles the mind. (And of course he invented or helped to invent much of the technology to film it too.) On this count, Avatar rates a 9.5.With its story getting a 5, dialog a 4, and the movie being overlong for the story it told, I'd give it 6 or 6.5 overall, but it will probably be a 6.5'er you will enjoy, despite its many weaknesses.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I See You,"An ex-Marine finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people.I'm a huge fan of James Cameron. The best film ever created is TITANIC, in my opinion. I'm not afraid to admit it. It should be no surprise that I absolutely loved AVATAR after walking out of the screening room. Now, did I walk in with a certain bias toward the film? Probably, yes, I would say. However, to be fair, the film surpassed the hype which made it out to be a revolutionary film that will change the course of film making of all mankind. And I will say this now: This revolutionary film will change the course of film making of all mankind.What makes this movie so revolutionary is that it sets a standard for 3D movies, and a high one at that. It not only puts the 3D to good use, in a way it contributes to the overall story than having things pop out every five seconds, but it is also successful at integrating motion capture with live performances in a way where it blows every previous films faulty attempts away. The technology is that good. Trust me. Technically, the film should be able to win every award dealing with it because, let's be honest, Cameron knows how to tell a broad story, especially in this size and scope.But what about the story? I've been rambling about how good the technology and the effects are, considering it has a budget of around $275 million. The story is sometimes predictable and clichÃ©d. If anything, people usually commend Cameron's ability to tell a story on screen but don't put his screen writing skills as high as a place as that and I see why people would say that. There are many films this movie borrowed from, but you know what? I don't care. Every film is, in some degree, predictable, and I believe this and the earnestness to tell and end the story in a way that has been done before is what adds to the wondrous quality of the film.When I saw Sam Worthington in TERMINATOR: SALVATION, which came out earlier this year, I didn't appreciate his performance like many people did. However, in this film, I think he did a great job as the thick-minded character. Sigourney Weaver is in a role that is actually perfect for her but I'd assume Cameron wrote the part specifically for her, but I think she's great she's in a film that is good for her because her last few roles in the past few years have been very ""eh."" Zoe Saldana, I must say, did an excellent job as Worthington's love interest. She has this magnificent talent where you believe and feel every word she speaks.Stephen Lang plays a fantastic villain role, albeit a predictable and one-dimensional one. It's a character we all love to hate. Another character like that is played by Giovanni Ribisi, playing the ""captain"" who will never understand all the bad decisions he makes. Other actors I'd like to mention in this excessive cast are Michelle Rodriguez, Joel Moore, and CCH Pounder. For a film that is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long, the film doesn't have a dull nor slow moment, probably because a story this big should have this long a running time in order to tell it. The soundtrack by James Horner is magical but by no means one of the best ever.I found the film to be not only a huge spectacle but also a film with a story that is not so white and black and with characters you believe and root for. It also deals with some relevant, moral issues. It's entertaining, spellbinding, and a magical experience in 3D. Rarely have I ever found myself so entranced by a movie. AVATAR is the best movie of this year. See the movie in 3D not because it's better or cooler but because it's necessary. See it now. Run, don't walk, to your nearest theater. This is a movie you should see before you die.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Completely blown away!,"I've seen this film twice in 3D and was completely blown away each time. Hands down the best movie of 2009! It totally lived up to its hype and deserves all the credits and praises it's received.Surely it's not the most original story in movie history (then again what really is original these days?), but it's still a good story and it's very well-told and beautifully executed. The movie is also very easy to follow and easy to get absorbed into. If you like most people who have seen this movie, you'll be automatically lost yourself in the world of Pandora after 10 minutes into it without even realizing it. The CGI is the most realistic and beautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. The details are just so exquisite and breath-taking. It's hard to believe all the creatures and sceneries on Pandora was digitally created! It totally put films like Transformer 2 or 2012 to shame in the CGI department, not to mention the former had a much better story than the latter two. I was so in awe the whole time with how lush and beautiful this movie looks that I kept thinking about the movie long after it ended. And the CGI characters they created for this film were very natural and realistic-looking! They may not be 100% photo-realistic but they're close enough. The ""Uncanny Valley"" is nowhere to be found on the Avatars or the Na'vi. You totally believe them as real characters with real emotions and souls, and you forget that they are computer generated after a certain point in the movie. In fact, I found myself related to those CGI characters much more than the real humans. James Cameron really get it right this time! The movie's visuals (as well as the 3D) are stunning without seeming gimmicky. The story, despite being slightly predictable (which happens to most great epic films), is fast-paced and engaging throughout the movie. The theme is inspiring and thought-provoking without seeming forced and preachy. I can go on and on. There's just so many to talk about! Seeing this movie just once wouldn't be enough. I've seen it twice and I still want to see it again and I definitely will. It's weired but that's just what this movie does to you (or at least to me).To those who haven't seen this movie: Don't judge on the advertisements, previews or internet clips, none of which did the movie justice AT ALL. This is the one film you have to see and experience for yourself. And don't let the hype affect your desire of seeing this movie either. The movie is hyped for a reason, and a good one. So what are you still waiting for? Get out of your friggin' house and go see this movie already! And you'd better see it in 3D, either in IMAX or regular theaters. To truly appreciate the beauty and the awesomeness of this movie, a 3D viewing is a must!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Reverse Pocahontas Guilt Trip,"A visually brilliant if not stunning work, but let down by having a highly derivative plot line - almost a clichÃ© - being basically a ''Reverse Pocahontas Guilt Trip'' - (i) Reverse Pocahontas - because the main protagonist fell in love with a native girl and who then went native (in Pocahontas its the native girl who fell in love with the foreign invader and went abroad). Yawn - haven't we been there & done that before? (ii) Guilt Trip - James Cameroon basically spent US$200mil filming a thinly disguised apology to the Taleban here. Switch ''Navi'' with Mujaheedin, switch Pandora with Afghanistan and the plot survives almost identical - as a thinly-disguised apologia rooting for the local insurgents combating highly-armed foreign invaders against huge odds in an asymetric contest. Its like Rambo - except that Stallone refights Vietnam to make Americans feel good, but in the Avatar it seek to make America's conscience feel bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"500 million bucks, now only if they could've squeezed in a scriptwriter into that budget","Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, T2. The man named James Francis Cameron has etched his name into sci-fi genre (and as a film-maker par excellence) with almost as much intensity as Hitchcock did in the suspense/ thriller genre. We know that he makes technically brilliant and supremely entertaining movies.I wonder why he blanked out on the most important aspect of movie making on this one - and no, I'm not talking about life-like CGI or agile animatronics or even 'human-emotion capture' computerized actors.It's a simple story: it's 1500s in 2100s. It's the oft-told tale of Europeans coming to the new world and taking away the pristine goodness of it all. I won't fault the story, simple stories are good. We connect to those. Now, narrative - I'd have liked to think that Mr. Cameron thought that all of us weren't 8 year olds (no offense meant to the 8 year olds!).We are required to suspend belief not just on the fact that a completely alien ecosystem evolved sentient beings who are strikingly similar in all aspects (physical, cultural, psychological) to humans, but also on human race's own progressive cultural evolution as well. The marines are caricatures from a bad Vietnam-Era movie, the corporate boss is from an equally bad 80s investment bank ('screw the science, I gotta make me some money baby') and we are still letting vets ride around in wheelchairs that are driven using the manual power of their hands.The psyche of avatar-wielding protagonist is never explored fully. What makes him 'switch-over' to the other side (some emotional complexity please, it needn't be a Christopher Nolan a la 'The Dark Knight' but just a little more internal confusion might be more, well, human?). And Pandora is many things, it's beautiful, scary and enthralling - but there's one thing it's not: it's not alien. It's just an idealized recreation of how 'jungle people' would live dreamt up by a bunch of people who live in high-rise condos or sprawling houses.At the end of it all, I'm left asking - why aliens? Why did this movie have to take place on the moon of a giant planet many light years away? This story could have been more than adequately told in umpteen number of 'conventional' settings: Incan Americas, India of early 16th century,West Africa of late 17th century. I have too much respect for the director to think that the answer is - because we could put a CGI super-tiger that looks like it could have a T-Rex for breakfast fighting an animatoric robot on a giant 3-D screen.But from the looks of it, the answer is probably very close to that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing Movie,"Avatar is centered on the Human mission to a planet known as Pandora, in which it took just over five years to reach. In the story, Humans have depleted their resources at home and are in search of a new mineral on Pandora referred to as ""Unobtainium."" The native humanoid race on Pandora, known as the Na'vi, are resistant to humans and their machines and their guns. The Na'vi live in harmony with everyone and everything on the planet, and have ways of bonding with them.I don't want to spoil it, but it's worth every bit of the nearly 3 hours the movie is. The CGI is phenomenal, as everyone says. The story, albeit, has some obvious hooks to the roots of great movies before it. However, I feel like Cameron tells it with a brand new twist through the whole movie.I saw the movie in 3D, and the 3D was interesting although in my opinion not worth the extra five bucks I paid.

The special effects are amazing and the attention to detail is brilliant but this is not just a fx showpiece like 2012 was, there is depth to avatar. I just could not see how anyone could dislike this, the 2 and a half hours drifted by and left me wanting more. James Cameron truly is a master of movies. Perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You can't afford to miss this one,"James Cameron did it again after 11 years of Titanic. His new directorial venture Avatar is simply masterpiece and sets a new standard in film making. However the story is bit inspired from Pocahontas kind of situation but this has been compensated by fast paced presentation of each developments & twists. I was in awe how 170 minutes passed because of crisp screenplay.The visual effects are perhaps the best since Lord of the Rings. On acting side, Sam Worthington as Jack Sullivan was convincing. His positive aura and decent look worked well. He is actor to watch out. Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Rodriguez were also did there job effectively.The lush vegetation and ferocious animals of Pandora were breathtaking. Everything looked so real. The sound effects were also something I haven't experienced before and I liked.The entire credit goes to James Camroon and only James Camroon. The film does live upto its expectation. What I liked about Avatar is that it has mass appeal. Everyone from elders to kids were enjoying and clapping in the theater.Please don't miss this one in theater as big screen is better for this big venture (in terms of content and not budget).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it.,"While by no means a perfect movie, it's very, very good. Great entertainment. Great characters and although a rehash of an old story, and parts of it were a bit ho-hum, it's generally creatively massaged into a new environment, although I couldn't tell if he was going for a Native American experience or an African one. Character development lagged a bit and I thought it weird how Weaver's character had such a different personality depending on whether she was in her human shoes or her Na'vi ones. As far as the acting goes, nothing real taxing here and the cast did a pretty good job. Neytiri was far and away my favorite character, Jake coming in as a close second. TBH, the only thing that turned me off were those tails. Not sure why but there had to be a better way.All in all, great entertainment and even though there was some violence, no blood and guts so OK for younger viewers. I watched it twice on two different days because it was such a ""new"" concept, I wanted to be sure I caught everything. Enjoyed it the second time as much as the first time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellence in motion,"The last time I thought a movie deserved a 10 star rating was "" The Color Purple ""; unfortunately we've had a plethora of bad to mediocre movies that have been made recently. Avatar takes the spotlight for excellence, innovation, creativity, character design and a legion of other qualities. The thing I noticed most about Avatar is the beautiful graphics the attention to detail; I also noticed with sheer awe is how well the actors and actresses acted out their part. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana were absolutely spellbinding in their roles; Zoe Saldana made me look at her acting ability in a different light with her playing Neytiri. She played a very compassionate, and mundane role in the movie so well that she should be awarded an Oscar along with Sam Worthington. Everyone played out their part awesomely; Avatar is easily one of the best movies made in the history of cinema. James Cameron is an absolute genius at work people; I look forward to similar quality movies made by this man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Over-hyped, but still mildly entertaining.","After his previous, ground-breaking feature 'Titanic' (1997) director James Cameron has returned to playing things safe and by the rules.'Avatar' is a nice pastime, though it will not amaze you. Its premise is very familiar, and it takes the audience nowhere new, but still to places they like. It also seems to enjoy monkeying about with huge issues, concepts and themes, such as genocide and religion, though there is nothing depicted here that we haven't seen done before, and done better.Even its visuals â which are supposed to be the film's crowning glory â are immensely overrated, and however splendid they may be, they have been outdone time and again by the greats (Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Robert Zemeckis, Baz Lhurmann, Steven Spielberg, Jim Henson...). After all, when has CGI ever stood a chance against puppetry and stop-motion animation? A dimension is added by the stunning 3D, but a dimension is taken away by the paper-thin, unsustainable plot.Nevertheless, it still manages to be entertaining and frequently rather affecting, but it's excruciatingly slow-moving for an action film and surprisingly ordinary for the highest-grossing film in cinema history.Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang try their hardest not be outdone by colourful trees, unintentionally hilarious digital monsters and blue-skinned, elf-like Aborigines.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Connects you to a different world...,"Extremely Outstanding...I have watched this movie in a 3D IMAX Threatre just yesterday.. and still it keeps circulating my mind. What a movie.. James & his crew had created!!! Hats-0ff to them...It speaks of the connection of oneself to every living thing outside. Its very concept has been beautifully designed and pictured.I have been watching this movie and all of a sudden, I was into the movie. It looked very real and I was completely involved. I even thought that such a 'pandora' world actually existed for sometime. Only at the end of the movie, I have to realize that its a 'movie'. Hope such a outer world really exists, we never knew. :)Seeing the publicity for the movie, I had the feeling that there is much unnecessary hype being created. Its only when I saw the movie, that I have completely changed my feeling. I even registered to IMDb now, to rate it as my best movie so far.

"Entertaining, but won't hold up over time","Avatar tells the story of a man who is paralyzed from the waist down, and through controlling an alien body with his mind, gets more and more absorbed into the alien culture, their respect for the world around them, and their fight against encroachment by humans.For someone who typically dislikes movies which try to walk the line between mindless blockbuster and subtle storytelling, Avatar exceeds expectations. There was a ridiculous amount of hype for a movie which appeared to have graphics which were nothing new, and a silly story. Well, the graphics are better than expected. The story is not told in an especially compelling way, due to the blockbuster style where everything is just as it seems and the plot flows in a straight line. However, the world of Pandora is quite immersive, especially in 3D, so the graphics make this movie. While the effects, especially of alien characters and animals, still do not quite look like they were filmed, the trees and rocks are very convincing. The 3D interfaces that the humans use for their computers are slick, the ships look real, and the mystical glowing alien plants and insects are cool.The live-action 3D is very engaging for now, although a little glitchy. Most likely we will look back on this movie in the future and wince, after the technique is improved. For example, sometimes the side of an actor's face has a strong highlight as seen by one camera, but not by the other, which produces a disorienting effect when one of the viewer's eyes sees the highlight but not the other.As for the story and message, it is a rather standard one of not messing with nature and the indigenous people, which honestly distracts from the expected brainless blockbuster action, romance, and coming of age story. Many of the serious things in this movie were done better in Mononoke-hime. The parts where it is a blockbuster work well enough despite somewhat uninspired action, and it probably would have been better if it had stayed fun and dumb. All in all, worth watching, but by a slim margin.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing visuals.......but thats it.  (SPOILERS!!!),"I walked in to this movie to have a good time, i heard about the superb visuals and great story so i thought well so many people cant be wrong. Even though i am well aware that movies heavy on CGI can be huge disappointments. I walked in with an open mind and having seen a lot of movies in my time i was ready to se what the fuss was about this one. The trailer or the movie pretty much gave away the ending, i knew from the get go that there will be a huge conflict between humans and Navi.As the movie entered the stage where Jake meets the pretty Navi chief daughter i knew where this movie was going....... Dances with wolves in space. Thing is Jake is from the start coming of as someone who really has no intention of serving any cause.....it would be far more interested if Jake was this hardened marine that has a change of heart and truly undergoes a transformation of personality....that is not the case here.The film is amazing in 3D but the characters are stuck in 1 dimension. The evil General was your stereotypical villain only out for blood and no mercy.Navis are your typical native population who se their lands destroyed and taken advantage of.The corporate evil guy is also very typical. Compare that to the corporate guy in Aliens whos true agenda we at first did not really se through......because of a good script. But in this movie the guy is directly portrayed as this money hungry greedy asshole.I knew what was coming and i was not surprised by anything the story threw at me, i felt rather unmotivated to sit through, the only motivation to do so was the pretty graphics.Even here, i will always be amazed by true stunt choreography, jackie chan and anything made realistically with real people than a bunch of computer programmers creating explosions and graphics behind their desks.You might think i hated the movie, no it was OK and a fun ride, easy to follow and enjoyable. But deep and surprising? Nah.....",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It had everything from amazing visual effects, spectacular acting, a story line that keeps you interested above and beyond, wrapped up into one amazing movie. The Pandora world Cameron has produced was so pure, beautiful, and surreal. The Avatar people were amazing and even the little details were genius work.

Entertainment,"Whatever it costs to get a HD big screen TV capable of playing 3D, along with the player and the glasses, I WILL PAY IT. I don't care if I have to sell my corvette.

So I wasn't expecting something nearly awesome. This was. People say the story is weak. It isn't. People say it is derivative - ALL movies are derivative, even Terminator, even Aliens and even Titanic - this movie has plenty which separates it. And the characters have depth even if you sometimes have to read between the lines to see it. Aside from those talking points, the f/x, action sequences, epic scale, and raw fun are all magnificent.

"Avatar 3D - See it for the visuals, not the plot itself","Saw this in 3D Imax and highly recommend it in this medium. I am sure it is also outstanding in the standard format but the visuals ARE the movie and if you have a 3D screen within driving distance, definitely take advantage and go see it.The plot itself is somewhat generic. It's the stereotypical military / industrial complex (i.e. â The USA) exploiting the natural resources of indigenous peoples (i.e. â Iraq) with ruthless and inhuman efficiency. The protagonist is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who is an Army soldier who is transformed into one of the indigenous natives in order to better exploit them (ie. â steal their oil, or ""unobtainium"" in the film). The natives are 9 feet tall blue people who can communicate with other organic beings in their universe through their hair. If this sounds dumb, it is.

"Weak Plot, Derivative of what came before","One hallmark of a poor movie is that the experience significantly degrades upon repeated viewings. For all the spectacular CGI, incredible scenery, and highly imaginative landscaping, the movie bores repeatedly with one movie clichÃ© after another. Do I need to count what was stolen from The Matrix, Alien/Aliens, Dances with Wolves? Why rely on what has become known plot twists and conventions? How could Cameron recycle so many overused ideas in one movie? Sure the concept had much potential -- but with the focus on the FX, the more subtle plot details get washed out in predictability. Of course, the movie looks spectacular, especially in 3D on IMAX. The movie could have been so much more...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually spectacular, marred by gaping plot holes and awful characters","This is a truly spectacular movie to look at, but it is not a spectacular movie. While you are never convinced the CG characters are ""real"" (opposed to, say, Benjamin Button), the forest and its unusual foliage is beautifully done and the sweeping shots of the alien planet are gorgeous. The 3D is largely treated well, particularly in the aforementioned fly-throughs, but there are plenty of gimmicky ""look, Ma I'm in 3d!"" shots that I thought we would be past by now - when they occur you are jolted totally out of immersion. Golf ball, I'm looking at you.That aside, the plot is totally by the book. The characters and their interactions are shallow and predictable, and bring to mind the ridiculously clichÃ© Doom movie. The actors know it too - their performances are stilted, unbelievable and self-aware. In particular Sigourney Weaver's character is god-awful. This all lead to the impact of the major events being strictly audiovisual, not emotional. Add one of the WORST ""call to arms"" speeches I have ever seen, and a scene uncomfortably like animal rape, and I left wondering whether ""Aliens"" was as good as I remember.This stuff I guess can be ignored, not everybody needs realistic characters. What really annoyed me were the array of small but noticeable plot holes and inconsistencies. Minor, but enough of them that I became more and more annoyed as the film progressed.Go see it for the 3D scenery and sweet tech, but don't bother bringing tissues (or your cognitive abilities, for that matter).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sigourney Weaver saves Ferngully...that pretty much sums it up.,"Mr. Cameron as much as I appreciate the amazing special effects and gorgeous animation as well as the detail you put into creating a new world with species, I can't help but think I have seen this exact same movie before. I must say I am also a big fan of Ferngully just like you (assumed lol), but you should really consider on coming up with your own original story, granted it was a great concept. Besides making this movie is probably just an excuse to throw other people under the bus (military.) I mean ptsh, it's not like they are putting their lives on the line defending our country or anything, right? Way to go on making a film with so much potential turn political. Maybe a sequel should help, let's make them fly and have the ability to surf!

Its just a fantastic movie.I'm pretty jaded - I usually don't feel very satisfied with most movies. But this one was different. It felt like it lasted an eternity - but in a good way. It was as if you were there with Jake for the whole three months he spent with the Na'vi.By the way, the IMAX 3D was expensive, but it was worth it in this case if only for the sound and the high quality screen.

Ahead of time,"When Akira Kurosawa made Seven Samurai in the 50s he never thought that people will consider his movie a masterpiece and him one of the greatest directors of the twentieth century. His passion for excellence was his driving force and being a perfectionist he made it with all his heart no matter how much time it took. There are very few directors who master the art of movie-making not because they know it, but because they want to make something different every time and excel in their field. James Cameron is one of them. When he made terminator it was ahead of time, same was the case with Abyss or Aliens and Titanic. And now its Avatar. Some viewers did not like the movie mainly because they went with too much expectations about the story and performance. This movie is not about the story, its not about the actors, its neither about performances but its about taking your viewers to different world, its about making them see something they have never seen before. When you watch it again you will realize that such movies can never be made again. The CGI created on screen is so advanced and complete that you enter a different world altogether and leave the theater spellbound. And watch it on 3D as such movies are made for 3D.

Mindblowing Masterpiece,"This is not just another 'I LOVED AVATAR' comment but here I go:Avatar is a beautiful and awesome film. The aesthetics are insane, out of this world designs and environments. James Cameron did all his homework, the movie shows some serious screenplay and superb acting in both animated and human characters.The message is not unique but it gets to you, at some points you wished you were in Pandora, you wished you could change things, you wished it wasn't true. There is definitely more in that film than just an amazing imaginary world with a beautiful breath taking environment and polished designs.I honestly loved this film, it has everything I wanted to see: a mature and original script, good acting, a message to take with me when I left the cinema and impressive action and computer animated scenes. At some points all the 3D animations look real, the special effects are something you've never seen before. Guaranteed.The acting is brilliant, not only by Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver but also Stephen Lang who did an excellent work as the 'bad guy'. So much enthusiasm with the animated characters too, they almost looked real.Take my advice, watch this film and enjoy 'kinda long film' but it's sure worth it!10 stars for a brilliant adventure!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

That is what I found most interesting about the movie; the historical nature of the human race.This could be a wake up call for humanity and maybe that was James Camerons ambition? It is certainly better to make your own decision but I would thoroughly recommend watching Avatar yourself on big screen.

Fantastic Setting and Enjoyable Characters,"Wow.I just returned from seeing this movie in 2D, and it truly was fantastic. I plan on going back to watch it again in 3D, as I hear it is even better.Setting/Environment: 10/10 The setting in this movie is gorgeous. Absolutely fantastic. James Cameron really has created the most wonderful world I've ever seen. From start to finish the movie was simply visually stunning. If you're interested in seeing the most fantastic CGI ever presented, go see this movie.Characters: 10/10 Like all movies, the viewer must suspend reality a bit here and there to enjoy the full spectrum of what the movie has to offer. Avatar is no different - viewers trying to match the film to real life at every turn will walk away disappointed. Those who can relax a bit and invest themselves in the movie just a tad will find themselves become quickly attached to the characters as portrayed by a mostly great cast of actors. Sam Worthington is very convincing in his portrayal of a wheelchair-bound veteran who revels in his newfound freedom, and effectively carries the movie on his shoulders. I found it very easy to follow Sam's feelings and thoughts as the movie progressed. Overall, a great job with the characters draws the viewer into the movie even more.Plot: 8/10 Yes, the plot is nothing new. So what? This movie simply wouldn't have worked with an overly complicated plot line and lots of twists. The plot was not the theme of this movie. Rather than a story based film, it was a focused introduction to the wonderful world of Pandora. That being said, the story was delivered in a clear and enjoyable manner. The task of the story in this film is to give the viewer an easy to follow yet enjoyable ride that allows full appreciation of the visuals and characters, which are the main strong points of the movie. A few corny moments aside, it does exactly that. We all had that one book as a child that we knew by heart, yet read again. Like with that book, the familiar plot in this movie doesn't really take away from the movie, like many claim. And again like that book, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable even if you do see most of it coming. That being said, the movie certainly doesn't reveal everything at once. I still had questions in my mind about the resolution of the plot and the final development path of several of the characters when entering the last portions of the movie. Sure, it's not an Oscar winning story, but if you're willing to relax and not psycho-analyze it, it keeps you happy and entertained as you enjoy the other aspects of the movie.Overall: 10/10 Although this is not a mathematical fit to my rating breakdown, I feel that setting and characters should be weighted more highly than plot in this movie. Where it really tries the hardest, this movie succeeds in grand splendor. Do yourself a favor. Go watch it.Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A New landmark in Cinematic History.,"I didn't expect too much about this movie, simply because i really hate the previous film made by James Cameron (you know which one), but then i remembered what i felt when i watch The Abyss and Terminator 2; so i said ""why not?"". And you know what? I spend the most entertaining 150 minutes in a long time; WHY?, Just because James Cameron made a cinematic masterpiece and created a world that breathes and shine with its own sun. It simply blew me away. Avatar it's a film so full of details, colors and life that just watching the gorgeous and magnificent landscapes is worth the money that you pay for your ticket. For all the detractors of this film, i just can say that just time will give this film the place it deserves in the history of cinema.

A Visual Masterpiece,"I went to the cinema not really sure if I was going to like this. I was worried that I'd spend the (almost) three hours wanting to do anything but watch this, and did not expect to have a new favourite film by the end of it.The effects, as you can expect, were the best I've ever seen ever; it was almost better than reality. We were on a new planet 'Pandora' and it was all so real. There were new animals, aliens, and plants and no matter how illogical they were they were still made believable with all of the cinematography.The storyline wasn't the best ever but it was still made great by the feelings that the audience had from the characters, and the question of 'who is morally right?' The 3D wasn't as good as the quality of the effects, but it wasn't worth complaining about because this was one of the best films I'd seen in my life. This was a visual masterpiece.

Pretty Visual Effects Are Not Enough,"I'm giving this movie a 2/10 because undeniably the art and beauty that is the setting of Avatar is outstanding. It's a gorgeous movie but I find it offensive as a movie-goer that we should be expected just to like a movie because the hype and a gorgeous setting.This movie severely lacked plot and character development, especially the latter. The main character had some depth but the supporting cast had very little, and I did not feel at all attached to their causes or goals. The movie was far too long to cover as little as it did, there was more to uncover about the characters, their past, and how they interacted with one another but it was shown through quickly progressing scenes, with little dialogue relying on the score and beauty of the setting to speed us through the time of the movie. Months were shown over the matter of minutes, which would be okay if they had some fully formed characters I could believe in, but that was not the case here.As mentioned in other reviews, the plot originality is severely lacking, I found myself during nearly the entire movie thinking..""oh this is just like that movie"" or ""that is just like this movie"". That's not to say that similar themes are recycled in many modern movies, but this one wasn't even cobbled together convincingly to be its own story, you can see the loose threads of other movies everywhere, only turned into a Avatar themed world. ClichÃ©s abound here.This movie is getting way more positive reviews than it deserves probably because of the expert animation/visual effects and the huge hype before hand. It's disappointed to see such a sub-par movie getting such a fabulous reaction from movie-goers, we deserve better.

"You are not in a cinema anymore, gentlemen, you are on Pandora.","Blockbuster movies come in dozens these years, special effects flood us with so much flash and bang and hiss that we went blind and deaf to them long ago. Maybe that's why I see some people automatically discard the new Cameron movie - only because they saw on trailers it has special effects. I say let them stay ignorant, for they are only hurting themselves. And for all of you that love cinema, and waited so long for that sense of wonder, that was lost for decades - wait no longer and buy a ticket and watch Avatar in 3D and your inner child's most incredible dreams will come true before your very eyes.Why is it so different? We saw a jungle and monsters and wild chases before - in King Kong for example - so why bother? Isn't it the same? The answer will hit you while you immerse yourself in the world of Pandora. We became immune to 2D, we stopped caring long ago. But this is different. You ARE inside, you are no longer an external viewer, you are a silent actor that is following the actors - on a strange, wonderful alien planet. You share their amazement and emotions, fears and desires.Cameron created something you can believe in, a world that is so coherent and *real* it sucks you in completely, and after the movie is over you wish to go back to Pandora and experience its beauty again. It might well be the most artistic movie ever made, the details of the ecosystem connect with the story perfectly, allowing us to see more of Pandora's rich environment. I really wish I could tell more without risking spoilers.The story is what you expect it to be. If you have any movie experience you will not be surprised and will predict what happens up to last second of the movie - but I tell you it doesn't matter at all! You will actually want for it to happen the way it happens - and Cameron simply knows that. I realize it would seem the movie must be very boring because of that - but the truth is you will not get out of amazement for the whole duration of the movie. I can hardly believe it myself.I am not mentioning special effects - because there were none - if you ask me it was all real. Cameron took his camera team to another world inhabited by Na'vi. And that comes from a guy who knows effects by heart and is immune to most of the flashy trash we are served year after year. Avatar is one giant quantum leap to match.It's more than a movie, it is an experience. It is art. It is fantasy with emotions and important messages crucial to the world today. Give your inner child a favor, and believe the hype - you will not regret it. See it in 3D - words can't describe the feeling.You won't believe your eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So you think you're hot stuff? Watch this movie and be humbled,"My first thought was, the 3-D isn't as good as I was led to believe, but then something straightened out. I'm not sure whether it was my brain or the screen, but either way the problem cleared up fairly quickly. (Though pretty entertaining I don't think the movie is going to suffer much from begin watched in 2-D.) My second thought was, everyone who fancies himself a little above average or more in intelligence should be forced to watch this film. If you're right, you will come away convinced you've been touched by the work of someone far more intelligent than you. If you don't feel that way, you're initial assumption was clearly wrong.This film is not miraculous in an off-putting sort of way. It is geared to reach the average American mind. The thing is, I remember having similar sentiments as this film, years ago, and I would have bet anything that getting ordinary Joes to sympathize with its point of view was an exercise in sheer futility. That to me is the real mark of genius in this film, that James Cameron was able to make it so that no one is likely to escape being confronted with its message, though whether they believe it or not, I can't say. The whole of my own belief about this country's foreign policy to date is stated fairly simply in a very few words. It begins with: ""We want something someone else has..."" There's no doubt in my mind many won't care, but this film will stir the optimism of the rest of us about there being sufficient numbers of those who do care to make a difference.Everyone in this film does an exemplary job.

It is not only a technical and visually flawless movie (like everyone says), but it is also a great and profound story. It combines action, spirituality, love, humor and it actually brings a great message to the audience. It is a trip; you actually leave your seat and travel to the world of Pandora (where the Avatar story is developed). For a time you feel intrigued, after a while amazed, then completely outraged and finallyÂwell go see it. After watching the movie and exiting the cinema, it is amazing how gray reality appears (I mean literally, the movie is so colorful). With the risk of sounding like a nerd, it actually made want to be a Na'vi (the people that live in Pandora), share their beliefs and live in the world of Pandora.From the message standpoint, I may only add that the movie actually tells us something about how destructive we are, as a human raze. Earth has so many places like Pandora; just take a look at the Amazons. We have to preserve it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar...,"Not about air-bending...A new, technological re-make of ... Fern Gully. I mean does everyone not see this? I'll see the movie for the effects, but the story is OLD, and it is getting older since nothing changes in these movies. Male is 'seduced' by a 'local' girl to support her side. blah blah blah.I would much rather had no local interaction and the 'intruder' realize, on his own, that what they were doing is wrong. Why does it take someone else to make us realize we should stop doing something? This 'teaches' the young to not think for themselves... He could have had a 'relampago' moment of realization that what they were doing is wrong--perhaps in discussions with others on his 'team.' The movie could have been about how he struggled within the system while helping the 'locals.' I think that would have been a better movie.Talk to your kids about critical thought and why they should think for themselves rather than just 'accept.'",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
In the end it's all about story...,"Avatar is one of the most amazing looking films I have ever seen. The story however, sucks (as does the music).THE GOOD -Great 3D, best use of it I've seen. No gimmicks like sticking things out at the audience which snaps you right out of the film. Here it was just depth and exhilarating.As I watched the visual effects in Avatar all I could feel was a sense of awe and also a sense of sadness. I felt sad for any other film that might have been up for any forthcoming visual effect nominations. Avatar will take them all.Some scenes felt truly magical. Like the first time jake and Neytiri fly together. I was totally engaged.The BADThe script was bad. We have seen this story countless times. The storytelling wasn't great either. It would have been great to see the state earth has become - would have made Pandora seem all the more virginic. It would have been great to have some character development. To illustrate Jakes change a bit better. To shade the two dimensional bad guy a bit more...The music. The music was lazy and unimaginative. James Horner phoned this one in and Avatar could of had a unique sound - like the way LOTR has - but instead sounds like every other blockbuster. This is a shame.All in all. A visual feast for the eyes but nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Quite simply a masterpiece,"I went to see this film with very high expectations. As I sat in the theater I thought to myself, 'well, now I'm going to watch a masterpiece.' With such high expectations, you'd think I was going to be easily disappointed, but I wasn't. This film fulfilled my highest expectations. I've got friends who've gone all intellectual and muttered about the shallow characters and weak script, but as far as I'm concerned they're the ones who are losing out. If you go to watch this movie, just immerse yourself in the spectacle and enjoy the ride. It's spectacular. I didn't have any problems at all with the story line. It made me think of the old colonial days and what has been going down for centuries in the name of business. To have such a visually spectacular piece of art with such a noble message is a double blessing. Don't ruin it with your cynicism. Just enjoy it. I'll be going to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent concepts - well-researched,"As always for James Cameron movies, this has been an extremely well-researched one. I am a sci-fi & science fan, and a researcher by profession. Good sci-fi movies intrigue me. But in recent times it seemed that directors & writers had lost ideas. The last real good ones I watched were the Matrix and the Terminator(s). Since then it has been suffocating years of crappy sci-fi concepts in movies. ""Avatar"" feels like a fresh new breeze. Besides all the excellent special effects, the concepts are very well-grounded from a scientific perspective. I like the way Cameron has fantasized of establishing direct neural connection between organisms, and the depicted ""soul"" as information content in neural networks. If one has read scientific articles on possibilities of extraterrestrial life forms and how evolution can create & mold life under bizarre environments, one would readily be able to appreciate the life-form designs & concepts in the movie. Hat's off to James Cameron - looking forward to the sequels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a benchmark film,"I was looking forward to Avatar. I saw it on the second day it played and paid the extra money for the 3D. I enjoyed it, but it's far from the benchmark film some have been claiming.First the motion-capture technology is fine when used to replicate body motion, but not facial expressions. It can duplicate basic broad facial movements, such as anger or laughter, but anything subtle is simply not there. You still relate to the alien characters as being animated and the earth characters as being real actors. We're obviously expected to not be aware of any difference between animated characters and real actors, but there is a substantial difference.There is also a huge lack of original ideas for both technology and the creatures inhabiting the planet. Star Wars, Alien, 2001 A Space Odyssey or even going back to Fantastic Planet, gave the public technology and environments which had never been seen on the movie screen before. It's not that these films were absolutely original as they did borrow ideas. But when they did borrow, for the most part, they were not from other films and so it was new to the general public. Avatar just borrows too heavily from other movies we've all seen. For heaven's sake, did the bad guy REALLY have to get into one of those giant robotic suits for the climactic battle? Technologically, there is nothing in here that compares to the first time the public saw the space station wheel in 2001, or the H.R. Giger sets of Alien, or the giant planet walkers in Star Wars. Then there are the animals which inhabit the planet which look far too similar to earth animals. Basically, the alien tigers look like tigers and even the dinosaur-like creatures, well, look like dinosaurs!And the action scenes, somehow didn't generate the excitement they should have. For example, when they were flying on the backs of the giant bird-creatures, I never felt the particularly thrilled by it. A flying scene like that should have made you feel a sensation of vertigo. I was thinking that it might have been because the jungle environment was so strange and foreign that you had no sense of height the way you would in a city scene when buildings give your mind something to relate to. But I think there may have been a bigger reason. Greater importance was given to hammering home the message of the film, rather than simply being caught up in the action. So, flying on the backs of the birds was to show ""the majesty of the natural world"" instead of just the thrill of it. And the battle scenes were not the battle scenes in a Star Wars film, because it simply more important to feel the sorrow and horror of war. Compare the actions scenes in Avatar to Dark Knight and there is no comparison.The only place Avatar excels is in the depth and detail of the planet. The jungle is probably the star of the movie. However, I could just go to an Imax showing of the real Amazon jungle and get the same experience.If you keep your expectations reasonable, you'll probably enjoy Avatar. But this isn't the new Star Wars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Excellent on so many levels,"We have only one complaint about this movie. Many good reviews have already been written here...many also are spoilers which is a shame. The experience should not be spoiled by anything other than ones own imagination which, for this film is not difficult. It does not take much predicting to preceded the story in your mind as you watch. Very few surprises are written into the story but that in NO WAY takes away from the power of the story. All a viewer needs to know before hand are what is presented in story synopsis which do not reveal the ending or resolution of any number of conflicts that arise in a good story. We compare the impact of this movie to that of the Lord of the Rings. The fantasy creatures become very believable very quickly and give the viewer a sense of being among them. We completely forgot all the hype about the animation and effects and watched the film in 3D (highly recommended) as if we were watching life action. Our only complaint is in the casting of Sigourney Weaver. She does not have the ability to act beyond her past roles. Alien clings to her like irremovable paint. The film excelled in finding so many good actors that were not beset by past roles. Putting Sigourney Weaver in the role she plays could only be compared to casting Nicolas Cage instead of Sam Worthington and John Travolta instead of Steven Lang. Thank goodness Cameron had the sense not to do that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is a great film.,"Even critics of action and science fiction movies would be hard pressed to not like this film. The story line is not exceptional but the message is a powerful one, perfect for anyone who cares about the environment, and for young people who may not have strong awareness of what corporations and governments can do to people and the environment for the sake of profit. The battle to save Pandora and its life forms translates to our very own planet. It is a humane and emotional story about a soldier who comes to understand what his employers are about to do. I applaud Cameron for giving this film some depth to compliment to powerful special effects.Only see this film in 3-D. It is a remarkable technical achievement as it takes us into another world full of natural wonders and nature based inhabitants. The entire film in it's 3-D glory is engrossing, from the fancy technology of the invaders, to the beauty of the Pandora environment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great.. unless you over-think movies,"This movie is enjoyable across all age groups and anyone who says differently is probably just being a killjoy.For example if you're the type of movie watcher who likes to point out things like ""McGuffins"" and ""Deus ex Machinas"" you may not be able to like a movie like this.Is there social commentary in this movie? Sure. But Sci Fi tends to lend itself to that. I personally didn't mind it at all hence my rating of 10. If you're sensitive to this kind of thing you may like the movie less than I did. But it is still 100 percent worth watching.Also special recognition should be paid to the cast here. Worthington is great as a new face who plays his role very adequately. Sigourney Weaver is a great addition. And Michelle Rodriguez brings some nice spirit to the production as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Breathtaking visuals meet lackluster, propaganda-heavy script.","James Cameron's Avatar is an endeavor of titanic proportions, no pun intended. It took upwards of 12 years and a budget larger than that of some third world nations to come to fruition. So... Was it worth it? Well, first of all, the script is lackluster. The plot is standard and predictable, the characters are cookie-cutter at best, overblown caricatures at worst. With a none-too-subtle message about the evils of technology encroaching on the natural balance.This was the part of the movie that didn't sit well with me. I'm the first to admit that the human race is full of arrogant jerks, but I'd like to think we've progressed as a species to the point where we wouldn't be willing and in fact blatantly eager to drive an indigenous people to extinction for our own financial gain. Maybe I'm wrong...But the message of this film seems to be, ""People are stubborn, greedy, ignorant, and violent creatures."" That constant message bothered me a lot, as did the characters who reinforced it. They're not just stupid humans. They're not just evil humans. Their adamantly uncaring and violent attitudes are physically abrasive. And there's few things I hate more than abrasive characters. I know enough irritating people in real life, without having to pay to see more.And then we have characters like Colonel Quaritch, who's not only evil and abrasively irritating, but almost totally devoid of motivation. Like Richard III, he is determined to prove a villain, and continues to be ruthlessly, sadistically antagonistic without any real reason, or at least not a good one. Unlike Richard III, he's not at all fun to watch. He's not so much a character as a personification of the Evil, Technology-Wielding Humans that the film seeks to vilify.On the other hand... The story may be lacking, the characters may be irritating, but the visual effects are stunning. The animators manage to create flora, fauna, and general topography for a completely alien world. The colors are vibrant, the details are exquisite. It's a unique and fascinating experience, incredible to look at.But then again, so was the movie Hero. And that one had a terrific script too.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good but not magical, very overrated.","After much speculation i finally saw Avatar. Mmm... Where do i start? The graphics were of course great filled with pretty good acting to back up the lengthy story line. If you have children or you yourself enjoy animated movies sorta say than this movie would be great.Now, would i watch this movie again? No. I don't care how much money anyone pays me. 2+ hours sitting watching this movie got to be difficult at times. It's really overrated in my opinion. It was good yes, things were done here that have never been seen yes again but it's really isn't movie of the decade let alone of the year.How it grossed over 2 billion is really beyond me because there were much better movies out at the time. But again, this is one of those movies that some people will really either love it or hate it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
don't ask just watch,"Lets clear the air first, Avatar is one of the greatest if not the greatest film ever made on a large scale.Even though the CGI was state of the art and is to this date unmatched, as opposed to 2012 it was not just an engine to impress the audience with its cgi, it adds another to the dimension to the story telling which was actually magnificent to say the least. Yes i know people have said it is a copy of other stories such as Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, Alien, it doesn't matter it is completely irrelevant, James Cameron makes this story his own. As soon as pandora was shown i was completely sold, absolutely breath taking shots. I was taken back to my child hood, i could feel myself welling up with tears as it gave a sense of awe and wonderment i had not felt in years. The story was completely balanced, it embodied everything we love james cameron for, emotion, empathy, character development and everything else. to be honest its really difficult to try and explain in such small gap the entire spectrum of this film and everything it contains, don't ask just watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
People give this film waaaaay too much credit,"Anytime a movie this hyped comes out the natural reaction will always be a non-critical endorsement of its ""awesomeness."" Science fiction fanboys often lack the ability to separate excitement from any objective critique of movies that play to their sentimentality's. Don't get me wrong, this is a feel good and visually spectacular movie that has the viewer awestruck leaving the theater. However, this can be said about a July 4th fireworks display or a Las Vegas magic act; just because it's entertaining does not make it worthy of praise - just look at the news. It is necessary to take some time to reflect on the film for what it is - a film, and should be held up to the time-honored standards of all film criticisms.To begin, I think it's worth noting that the main thrust of creativity in Avatar comes from solely the visual aspects - if you want to see it then the 3D format does make a difference. The plot has little creativity, it's mostly a splicing of Dances with Wolves, Aliens, and a little Fern Gully. This has led some to joke that the only original cast member was Sigourney Weaver. Sam Worthington plays the role of Kevin Costner while Giovanni Ribisi replaces Paul Reiser for the role of the corporate shill. Michelle Rodriguez even closely resembles the Latin stereotype of Private Vasquez from Aliens. Given these obvious parallels and recycling, we should be comparing this movie to Dances with Wolves and Cameron's Aliens and unfortunately Avatar just does not stack up. The messages of the movies are similar yet Avatar lacks the depth of Dances or even Aliens, instead choosing to hand feed and spell it out for the viewer and watering down complex issues of imperialism and corporate motives present in this movie's predecessors.Furthermore, while Dances is comparably long, Avatar spends most of the film developing a world instead of a plot and focusing more on being visually appealing than attempting to challenge the viewer - although this might be a side-effect of making science fiction rather than historical fiction.All in all the acting was fine, the action was fun, but these can be found in most films. Would I recommend it? Yes, I enjoyed it, but I also enjoyed Grandma's Boy and that's hardly deserving of the top 50 movies of all time. And on a side note: do not watch Grandma's Boy before this film or else you won't be able to take Joel Moore's character seriously.And on one last note, further enforcing this notion of how watered down this film is are the constant commercial tie-ins that have been littering TV to promote it. The film's message seems inherently at odd with McDonald's actions as both a corporation exploiting indigenous populations and in terms of the products they sell.I highly advise people to examine this film critically and as a film rather than a fireworks show.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Nutshell Review: Avatar,"So was the experience worth it? You bet, save for the end credits being unceremoniously cut off toward the end because of another screening. James Cameron is indeed no stranger to science fiction and the creation of new worlds, having been there and done that, even when there are quarters which point to plot similarities. He had continued Ridley Scott's Alien and made the sequel just as, if not even more memorable, having a Titanic film that stood out amongst those created before his technological marvel, gave spy films a good run with his True Lies, and even upping the ante of his own Terminator film with its sequel (which those that followed struggling hard to fill those shoes he left behind).To say Cameron was a technology junkie is quite the understatement. For each film that he made, there's something new added with a Wow factor, and I still remember to this day the liquid T1000 rising from a patterned floor, making the ugly Harrier jet look sexy, and made us gawk at the recreation of the ill fated ocean liner. Between that film and this one, he had made another 3D documentary exploring the wreckage of the Titanic, and I've watched that on 3D IMAX, which sadly such a hall no longer exists in Singapore. The 3D experience now with Avatar is nothing short of mind-blowing, for the first few minutes at least, and it subconsciously just melts into the background as you continue to enjoy the visuals of the film, hardly noticing the effort that had gone in creating that depth of field or the photo- realism of the fantasy realm of beautiful alien flora and floating mountains, as if you're now watching something real that's unfolding as if you're staring out with your very own eyes, witnessing a perfect blend of live action and computer generated wizardry.He's created a new world with Avatar, which may have jolly well been Dances with Science Fiction Wolves, or any parallels with other films cutting so close that it's easy to scream plagiarism, but like the title of the film, it's only a vessel in which to tell the story of what's probably a major mind-set shift of how a science fiction 3D film should be like, and exploited for the modern audience. The story has been told countless of times in many different forms, about the prophetic messiah who would come from outside the community, to lead them against adversary. And although the idea has been reported mooted at least a decade back, one cannot but feel how close the concept of Nature Vs Man being all the more relevant now, with that constant reminder that Nature will fight back one day, and Man will be on the losing end should we be up against a concerted force.Sam Worthington continues his charge as leading man material, even though he's covered in blue and in gangly animated form for more than half the time He's the perennial flawed hero (and I think come complete with touched up limbs) who sees his initial mission as a chance to reclaim what was, only to find that the grass is greener on the other side, due to what else, but love. That pits him against his master, and his dilemma to regain the trust of a community that he had chosen to betray and regret. I can't help but to compare his Marine Jack Sully to Kevin Costner's John Dunbar, with his time spent living amongst the natives (here it's 3 months worth) and to learn their ways, so much so that he's more of them than he is from his own, despite the need to report back, and knowing that they will be the eventual enemy when push comes to shove regarding land and minerals.And the great good versus evil divide comes from Colonel Miles, played to wicked perfection by Stephen Lang as the war mongering officer who just can't wait to lock and load and pick a fight given any opportunity, and the diplomatic scientist Dr. Grace (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew, who are all for mutual co-existence and the sharing of cultures in a bid to understand what makes the native Na'vi tick, not to mention the countless of secrets that lie hidden in their eco-system, besides some valuable mineral to mine, the largest deposit which is sitting directly under the Na'vi's million year old giant tree.In the Na'vis, Cameron has created quite the indigenous alien beings complete with a pigtail, which can be used to plug into nature, from binding and controlling just about every living creature (there was a mating scene, though I didn't get to see if this was put to good use), and to plug themselves into a spiritual realm as well. I suppose this provides for plenty of empathy, and I liked the part where Zoe Saldana's Neytiri chides Jake for thanking her when she fatally dispatches the more aggressive beings which in a way, were provoked to action. Action too is something not short of in the film, though one must be patient for that full scale, all out war that was done quite in the mold of Battle For Terra, leaving you without a doubt who to root for.I don't suppose this film will make as much at the box office as Cameron's last even though it shared that similar romantic angle behind events that are of a higher magnitude. Instant classic this is not, but Avatar has its moments, primed for a sequel or even for an expanded television series, that could continue on its ecological message, its technical wizardry, or just plain old narrative familiarity that could put the spotlight on the other hastily added clans that made up the final stretch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The blue folk seemed pretty bizarre on their own, but later in the movie when they showed them next to their human counterparts, we can see that while the 3D is much improved, the graphics have not evolved one whit farther than Jar-jar Binks.

CGI at it's best,"Developed as a action/fantasy/sci-fi film it has all the makings of a wonderful story. The cinematography is truly magnificent as are the scenery and tremendous action sequences. A film that has heart, defines what humanity is on a completely different level.Jake Sully (Worthington) is a paralyzed Marine in a wheel chair that takes his murdered brother's place to go to the moon Pandora. He has no science background, just the will to complete a mission, he's a soldier. Once there he meets the rough, ego centric Colonel Miles Quaritch) Lang who is hell bent on destroying the Navi civilization. It comes to light money is the root of destroying this peaceful moon. However Jake has a change of heart when he meets Neytiri (Saldana) and learns the ways of the tribe. Sigourney Weaver (Grace) has a pivotal role as lead scientist and really gets inside the reasoning of Jake's turning point.The moons components and CGI effects are amazing to view through the entire film. The character development is slow at first but truly picks up. I really enjoyed the complete package, BUT came away with a similarity of Dances With Wolves.

Honestly a Pretty Good Movie,"Despite being extremely successful at the box office, Avatar always gets flak for having a poor story line. But is it that bad? I honestly don't think so.Yes, the plot is neither particularly original nor sophisticated, but it is told well. Unlike the second film, were this kind of criticism is much more justified, each setup has its payoff, each character is there for a reason and each scene has a purpose. That's definitely good enough for this kind of a movie and more than a lot of blockbusters nowadays can claim for themselves.In addition the world building (a virtue often overlooked by critics) is top notch as are the visual effects, even a decade later. If you can, watch the extended cut that gives quite a lot more backgound on the conflict between the humans and the Na'vi.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's not a must see but a must experience movie.,"Seldom, you find a movie that takes you into it and enthralls you right from the start to the last frame. And only after the movie is over, you realize that man, the joy ride is done now it's time to leave and wish that it would have been there for some more time. AVATAR is one such experience. What is it about?It's in a way story of person saving his race and fighting for it. He wants love, he wants trust. But never did I feel that it was told splendidly as it was done in AVATAR. When a guy who has lost his legs jumps in joy we feel man I would have done that too. When a person with his courage has won the trust of many and feels to lose it then he would do anything to get it back. Each nuance was stunning and oozing in beauty and splendor. A new world PANDORRA has been created and AVATAR makes you feel right there, you can touch those ferns, those plants, those wild animals (or monsters, I can't term them). The screenplay is perfect with each new scene revealing something new and by the end we can figure out what each thing was all about.A scene, in which the lead couple takes a ride and explores PANDORRA, is just one example of beauty that this movie has. The editing is awesome and the acting is apt. The background music, (I concentrated the least as the visuals were too very stunning) is just perfect. But hey, it's not a movie where all these things should be looked into. Just sit in a 3D thing put your goggles and see for the first few minutes after the time would just flew.Kudos, to James Cameron for visualizing AVATAR all in the brain and his crew who meticulously draw translated his vision to screen.

Pandora,"The brilliant film ""Avatar"" directed by James Cameron turned out to have a very deep subtext. But this subtext is the most important thing. While the audience is worried about the main characters, gradually becoming on the side of the Na'vi civilization, the main idea of the brilliant director and screenwriter is in the background. And it is quite simple - modern civilization lives in an absolutely wrong paradigm of development, in which the dominant idea is personal immeasurable enrichment due to the robbery of the majority by a parasitic minority.It looks simpler on a computer, but the movie was made so that we could enjoy it in 3D on a huge screen. Because of this, some people dislike ""Avatar"", since they watched it only from a computer. These people have lost a lot. Personally, my opinion is that the film deserves the highest rating!

The holy grail of 3D is not so much.,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is groundbreaking in many ways.

That being said, I just didn't see what all fuss was about. You get used to it and it then becomes another pretty movie. I have no trouble watching a movie for the cinematography, alone, but to be a great story you must have something else. The acting, and therefore the directing, what there was of it, was O.K.

Still excellent 7 years on and without 3D,"Like many others I watched Avatar as a 3d spectacle of sorts and while the 3D was indeed spectacular, I also mostly remembered it as such.I then watched 7 years on without 3D and was very pleasantly surprised.In my opinion it is better than any science fiction to come after it, with the exception of perhaps Interstellar.On second watching I was mostly surprised by the emotional response I got, despite being essentially Dancing with Wolves in space, or perhaps exactly because of it, I was emotionally invested the entire film and rooting for the hero.It is a beautiful film, also without 3D, amazing CGI, which has also not been topped in 7 years.It's a damn shame Hollywood doesn't take more chances on original material and instead trots out episode 7 of Marvel or constant remakes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movie ever made,"Sadly, I needed to watch it in 2D, however even with that, this film was simply splendid. I think we as a whole know the fundamental framework of the story at this point, and I concede, a portion of the film's blemishes is that the plot is to some degree unsurprising, and that it had some banality minutes and some messy discourse, however all things considered, I thought the film was generally speaking fabulous. We as a whole realize the SFX are the best ever, however what you cannot deny is that the manner in which the film is executed really conveys a serious passionate punch that the vast majority won't expect, and the entirety of the exhibitions generally speaking are extraordinary, even Worthington's, yet I can without much of a stretch say that Zoe SaldaÃ±a was the best one, which carries me to my next point, and what I believe is the feature of the film.
In the event that you thought Gollum in the LotR films or the prawns in Region 9 were amazing in how much feeling and authenticity they passed on, just you hold up 'till you see this current film's blue humanoids. They're, without a sorry excuse for an uncertainty, the most attractive CG characters I've ever observed. In addition to the fact that they look genuine, they FELT genuine, and following a couple of moments in, one could undoubtedly overlook they were all entertainers moving catch suits. The na'vi indicated more feeling, more articulation and essentially simply more life than what most true to life entertainers have today. I trust the Institute Grants consider movement catch exhibitions starting now and into the foreseeable future in the Acting classes, since they were only exceptional in this film, and route better than most true to life exhibitions we get today. What's more, the activity, obviously, was additionally fabulous. Cameron simply demonstrated to individuals like Michael Inlet that the Lord is back. The fight scenes, yet even a few sections that were simply, state, a few characters flying around on their banshees were only a delight to take a gander at, since all shots simply show how astonishing the extraordinarily profound and definite world that Pandora is. To the faculties, it's the most dazzling film I've ever observed. With respect to story and discourse composing, it could've been something more, it's not great, however this current film's truly about how the story is executed instead of the substance.
Another feature for me is, obviously, exactly how profound and point by point everything in this film was, and being a craftsman myself, you could without much of a stretch envision exactly what an attack on the faculties it was for me to observe such a perfectly made world that is Pandora. Going from its verdure to its fauna, everything in this world are in fact outsider, yet additionally have a natural sense to them from our reality. One who's been viewing Cameron for as far back as hardly any years would realize that he's constantly been into profound submerged investigation, and you can undoubtedly tell that a great deal of what he saw down there impacted his vision for a large number of the things we find in this lavish magnificence of an ever-extending rainforest.
Concerning the film's score, I truly don't get why a few people are getting disturbed about it. As I would see it, James Horner gave us an enormous score that fit consummately to whatever was going on during the film. Furthermore, indeed, I even like Leona Lewis' melody in the end credits.
Numerous movie producers out there consider CG impacts and put no profundity into the account or story, yet that is not the situation with Cameron. In this film, the embellishments made the story. He places embellishments and story in a blender, and lattices these components up so well that what we get is one of the most exceptional movies ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Join the Na'vis,"I must admit the film had me at the very beginning, when a paraplegic says that he loves to dream because dreams make running and walking possible, my head keeps nodding as if it was mounted on springs. And the emotional outcome of that moment occurs when the Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) wakes up in his avatar's new skin and doesn't feel any weirdness, he's just so happy he starts to run as if he was in a dream, as if nothing mattered anymore, not even the mission. I loved that moment because it felt surreal yet so real, Sully wouldn't have cared about looking like Jar-Jar Binks if it made him feel his toes again. Youssa better believe it.And this might be Cameron's way to tell us that even something as big as ""Avatar"" started as a tiny dream, and the first images with the hybrid Na'vis might have inspired him the same eccstatic reaction than Sully, his babies were alive, in synthetic images but alive nonetheless! Now, maybe it's because ""Avatar"" involves a giant alien species but the film is so cinematically ""big"" that it doesn't just dwarf other movies, it dwarfs any attempt to criticize it on the sole basis that the plot carries many dÃ©jÃ  vu feelings.You see me coming, but come on, who the hell am I to say, this movie is a retread of ""Pocahontas"", ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Princess Mono-noke""? James Cameron himself admitted to have made the story out of several inspiration and that included his childhood books and his mothers' dreams. Was ""Titanic"" any more original? Yet it made Cameron the king of the world. ""Avatar"" turned him into an undisputed Emperor and the film was so unique, inventive in the concept and innovative in the treatment that it flies over the critic.That's not to say you can't criticize it but the amount of things worthy of praise is so overwhelming critics would be like complaining that the Sphinx misses a nose. So I guess I'd feel better if I gave ""Avatar"" ten points already and then talk about the eventual little things that-could-have-been-better. So let's goI still remember how big ""Avatar"" was in 2009, the last film to be as big without belonging to the ""Star Wars"" franchise was ""Titanic"" so since this was from the same director, people knew they were going to be blown away before swallowing the first popcorn. And they were. Yes the film is marvelously lookingÂ but it's CGI. I loved it as far as I can appreciate a good Pixar movie but reading Roger Ebert's reviews, I felt like he loved the film on the sole basis that it created a whole new world, and that it didn't matter that the film didn't break any narrative ground.Now, does it matter? Not really, I also praised ""Titanic"" while it wasn't the most original story ever, but it had characters I cared for, and worthy antagonists. There was a moment in ""Avatar"" where the scientist played by Sigourney Weaver was describing the power of trees, the way they use their roots as a synapses and so on (which can be a rationalization for the trees' magical power in ""Pocahontas""). This part had me intrigued and involved but then Ribisi's character had to ruin it by saying ""there are just goddamn trees"". I was baffled by his lack of empathy, it's just as if they wanted to supply his mouth with some villain's dialogue and the same awkward attempts were made with the Captain of the mission played by Stephen Lang.Basically, you have the good natives, who behave exactly like extra-terrestrial natives and you have the good and the bad white and in the role of Lieutenant John Smith Dunbar, there's Worthington. The film recycled so many plots elements that it's difficult to disconnect your clichÃ©-radar. But if the radar doesn't work, how about forgetting about the story and listening to the dialogue, the new language Cameron invented by pulling a Tolkien, watching the little details in the scenery, yes, yes CGI, but what CGI! We're not talking about any computer imagery, this is a vision that kept on Cameron's mind since before ""Titanic"" and he waited for the technological advances to make them possible.Even the king of the world was disarmed but he wisely waited for the right time and it became the highest-grossing film of all time. Any good team of computer programmers could have done it, the film is a feast to the eyes, it's a deep story, but I was reminded that there were more than special effects to make a film, ""Avatar"" might not be a triumph of storytelling but it doesn't have a bad story to tell, its environmentalist issues, the way they foreshadow our future needs, echo some masterpieces from Miyazaki. In fact, I kept thinking of Mono-noke while watching the film, now is the film less worthy of praise because one was drawn? Let's say I prefer the way there's no villains in ""Mono-noke"" but to Cameron's defense, the film couldn't have had another third act.And let's acknowledge the creative force behind the very concept of the avatar and the beauty of the Na'vis; Cameron created a world, a myth, he stole George Lucas' thunder and proved that cinema wouldn't just rely on ""Star Wars"" and then on comic-book movies. The man had guts, vision and the guts to follow his visionÂ and he also had the dough. You refuse nothing to the king of the world, but if all it took to make great movies was money, blockbusters would never flop. ""Avatar"" was deemed to succeed, because it was a game changer. And as far as critics go, the game is over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A visual masterpiece !,"I saw Avatar at a preview screening two days ago and I have waited until now to comment on the movie because it left me in a state of shock and wonderment. As a technical achievement in film making, James Cameron's new visual masterpiece follows in the footsteps of Metropolis (1927), Forbidden Planet (1956), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), Star Wars (1977), Alien (1979), Bladerunner (1982), TRON (1982), The Abyss (1989) and Jurassic Park (1993) as an absolute benchmark in visual effects.James Cameron has pushed motion capture and computer generated imagery to its current full potential, previously only hinted at in the last decade in films such as the Star Wars prequels and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The last two years have seen impressive visual effects work in films such as Transformers and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but Avatar makes such leaps ahead that it is truly unlike any movie I have ever seen. Its world is so immersive (helped by great and subtle use of 3D) and its characters, alien wildlife and futuristic war machines so detailed and larger than life, that I feel this movie will set the gold standard for the entire decade to come.It may sound like I am merely judging this movie on its incredible visuals alone, but my emphasis on discussing the look of the movie is only because that is the main draw on first viewing. Beyond its effects, the film has much more to offer. Whilst somewhat simplistic and drawn in very broad strokes, the story is a timeless one that deserves to be retold in such grand fashion for this new generation. I have heard criticism of the film's dialogue, but I loved it. Several lines, especially those delivered by Stephan Lang, had me giggling in a good way. Speaking of Lang, he makes a truly great villain, and his final battle against the film's protagonists is one of the better fight scenes I have seen in the last few years. It isn't as drawn out and entertaining as the fight in They Live (1988), but it is pretty damn epic !See Avatar on the biggest screen possible in 3D. It is the must see film event of the year. What an experience !",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"James Cameron has created a beautiful beast that you just can't stop staring at, but it isn't without it's flaws.","Ultimately Avatar will be remembered more for it's visuals, than it's plot but even as faulty as the movie is, it's still a technical marvel in every way possible that must be seen. Avatar is essentially a sci- fi/adventure flick. Jack Sully (Sam Worthington) Is stuck in a wheelchair an ex-marine, after being given the opportunity to participate in the Avatar experiment, led by Sigourney Weaver's character. Jack must learn from the Na'vi, an alien race that oddly enough have a lot in common with the Indian tribes in the Nature aesthetic. After awhile, Jack feels for the tribe and of course he makes a decision. It ends up being a battle between the human race and the Na'vi. Of course, the human race has the guns and the firepower the Na'vi have bow and arrows so it transcends into how they are going to defeat the humans. The plot in no means is bad, and for an action sci- fi/adventure flick it's beyond those mediocre story-lines seen in other blockbuster movies, however it still feels a bit generic. It just didn't feel original in any way for me. Still, it's a passable story which holds you glued to it, and either-way the general audiences wont care much, as they will enjoy it. It ends up being a beautiful story, if not a flawed one. But where Avatar really hits the cannon is with everything else. It's a visual feast, that puts everything else before it to shame. The CG is simply something that must be seen, as it is jaw dropping. If you see it in 3-D, than the jaw will drop twice more. The combination of live action, and CG is blended perfectly, it is obvious that you will be able to tell apart the CG, but it's still very impressive neither-less. The soundtrack composed by James Horner, is best to be heard elsewhere. It's beautiful, but I didn't see it used efficiently in the movie, or appear as many times as I would have liked. Still when it is there, it definitely is beautiful. The acting is good, as the actors do the best job they could possibly do within the structure of the movie and most importantly they are believable. Sam is fantastic as always, but the real star is Stephan Lang, which pulverises the screen as a villain, and does a great performance while he's at.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Greatest Sci-fi Movie Of All Time,"James Cameron's 'Avatar' is 100% a masterpiece. It is by far the most impressive film ever made in the visual department. it took a lot of efforts and years of waiting to come up with such an advanced CGI effects and motion captures. to this day, 7 years after avatar was released, i haven't seen even one movie that can be compared with avatar's visually beauties. No, Avatar doesn't resemble Pocahontas in any way. It doesn't have any direct connection to other films. It is an original story, which is refreshing since most of the new movies are based upon or rebooting something else. James Cameron made the two most financially successful movies of all time - 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', and it's not a coincidence. This guy is a real genius! I recommend Avatar to ANYONE who appreciate the art of films and the fact that a movie is not perfect without it's beauties and visual factors. 10 out of 10. an unworldly masterclass!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another lame offering from James 'Goodness Me!' Cameron.,"Goodness me! Once again James Cameron takes mediocrity to new heights. He places the mediocrity in a box made of gold and elevates the box onto a platform with spotlights pointing at it. Goodness me! He destroyed the Alien franchise with his trashy and brash sequel and then he turned a real sea tragedy into a clichÃ© ridden, money spinning bore fest(Titanic). Goodness me! It seems that any project with his name attached is bound for sure fire success because it's James 'Goodness Me' Cameron and we must, by law, consider his works genius. (Goodness me).Avatar is a computer game. Nothing more. I want to see a MOVIE when I go to the cinema, thank you very much and a big Goodness Me!I shall now declare a national holiday.

It's Not the Ripping Off - It's the Dialogue,"Avatar had a lot of potential to be amazing. It is still very good, but many argue against it since it ripped off Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves. Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don't complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue and plot points are terrible, but shut your brain off and it's a fun experience.Let's look at the world of Avatar. It's a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.Disregarding the elaborate world-building involved in this film, the movie is filled with clichÃ©s, cheesy dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. Let's look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na'vi since they're ""savages"" (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver's character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn't consult many co-writers.What this movie lacks for in quality of writing, however, it makes up with heart. The ideals the Na'vi strive for seem like they have been forgotten in the real world today, and they are what draw us and Sully to them as a community. We cheer for Sully and the Na'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?Avatar is good; it cannot be labeled terrible simply because it takes plot points from Dances With Wolves, but it does lack quality based on its disregard for good dialogue and some underdeveloped characters.3.0/4.0",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A simple story rendered with almost hallucinatory precision.,"Special Effects / Artistry - 10/10 Acting - 9/10 Script - 5/10 Story - 6/10 Score - 7/10 Foley - 10/10As a creative and technical achievement, this movie is the new benchmark of special effects and immersion. The story is simplistic, and often predictable, serving as a plot device to take you on a ride so the fantastical world of Avatar can be shown off.For the first time, the CGI organic elements - creatures, plants, Na'vi, humans - look better than the mechanical elements. The movements, inflections, detail, and sounds infuse these alien lifeforms with life.However, without the 'wow' factor of special effects, it would not be a great film as the story on its own is simplistic if not clichÃ©.Of James Cameron's films, I would still say that 'Aliens' is my favorite. A darker, but still iconic film, its 'Na'vi' not so sympathetic.We are moving towards a future world where dreams are turned into visceral reality.After watching this film, you will understand what it is like to leave your Avatar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Opening Pandora's Box,"As much as I don't agree with all of director James Cameron's ideologies, I do respect him as a filmmaker and a storyteller. For better evidence, I looked into his grand epic, Avatar. Released in 2009, it brought innovative visions in CGI, motion capture, and 3D. With a total of $760 million in the US, and over $2 billion worldwide, Avatar sits on top as the highest-grossing movie of all-time. Interestingly enough, the last movie to hold that honor was James Cameron's last prior release, Titanic.A lot of movies come with the 3-act structure. With a running time of 2 hours and 41 minutes, I assessed the plot of Avatar by dividing it into 4 even quarters. The first quarter is where Jake Sully becomes an operator of a Na'vi-human hybrid, or an avatar, as part of the Avatar Program over at an RDA camp on Pandora. Jake enters his avatar form by going to sleep. It's slow-moving at first, but as Jake's avatar stumbles upon a tribe of Na'vi, the second quarter kicks off. At that point, the plot begins to build up as we are introduced to this unique species that it centers around. Jake and his crew begin to delve further into the Na'vi, as his avatar becomes one of them and even gets initiated into the tribe. Here, we see how the Na'vi live, survive, and act. It even leaves an impact on Jake as he resists Colonel Miles Quaritch's orders to make the Na'vi abandon their home. The third quarter kicks off when Quaritch leads an attack on the Na'vi and their home. This is where the conflict comes in to interfere with our characters and the Na'vi's trust with Jake is tested. Finally, the fourth quarter is where the battle between the Na'vi and the RDA takes place and brings our movie to an exciting climax and eventual resolution.Together, these four quarters present an engaging story that builds up at every moment. Avatar finds James Cameron changing the game of filmmaking. It justifies his place as one of the best in original storytelling, as he invents a new species, a new location, a new language, and basically, a new culture. It's not only original in storytelling, but also in visual effects and cinematography. Avatar tells a story about a new world, and it tells us how James Cameron became the king of the world, twice.Score: 92/100Recommendation: Anyone",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ground Breaking 3d animation - same old tired battle sequence - missed opportunities.,"The special effects, 3d and animation in Avatar are worth the price of admission alone, simply jaw dropping. This movie is not to be missed if you want to see state of the art effects. I totally enjoyed the 3d aspects of the movie, but the all to boring and familiar battle scene finale left me disappointed. I thought it was so ironic that Sigourney Weaver starred in this movie and over 20 years ago was in Alien, with a very similar movie ending. The same old same old battle with a human in a robotic machine. Same as in one of the Matrix movies. Come on, think of something better! The characters in my opinion also lacked depth. There was real potential in this movie but the emphasis was on visuals and not character development and a decent story- line. This plot was lame. I so wanted to like this movie, but I came away disappointed. I'm so over these tiresome and repetitious battle sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, clever, touching - charming!","To be honest, I'm even afraid to analyze the film - I wouldn't want to destroy the wonderful state of mind into which it brought me.A really wonderful movie.The director coped with the most difficult task - how not to drown the viewer in the ocean of special effects, but to make him feel, immerse himself in the atmosphere of the film and begin to deeply empathize with the characters (almost the entire hall, consisting of a completely different, heterogeneous audience, applauded).There are really a lot of special effects, but at the same time, not only the quantitative, but also the qualitative boundary has been overcome, when they do not look like something inappropriate, made as a simple tribute to fashion. Rather, it is better to use not even the word special effect, but just an artistic technique. The film is incredibly beautiful, you get aesthetic pleasure from every minute.The plot is a vivid example of how you can make an eternal story out of a fairly old story! The struggle between civilization and nature in this form is much more convincing than, for example, in 2012, although I can't say exactly why yet, apparently the real talent of the director consists in such elusive things.The love line is simply charming, I believe unequivocally.

Ultra-linear. Only 3D and subtext make it a very nice experience,"Avatar keeps you waiting for marvelous images to emerge from the screen. That's the main reason why this ultra-linear/flat 2h40 story would make an interesting show. Every spectator wants to be surprised, so the National Geographic/Pandora Discovery Channel first part is enough to make us wait and watch through child's eyes.Then the story is mainly against militarism, imperialism and about people living in harmony with their likes and the Nature. So it's not the usual heavy-handed big brawn and dull apocalyptic show of Ã¼ber-blockbusters. Nevertheless go find one interesting character in Avatar. To me, Neytiri is the most interesting, yet she's only the CGI rendition of a real actress (Zoe Saldana)! On the other hand Sam Worthington's avatar looks bland. In fact the whole main character is bland, passive and one-dimensional. Funnily enough Sam Worthington's character in Terminator: Salvation, very close to Jake Sully in terms of storyline, is a much deeper character...Thus there are reasons to be disappointed by Avatar if you were expecting a groundbreaking masterpiece. Seeing it in 3D is an important experience for whoever is interested in movies and new technologies; the experience ranges from nice to very nice provided you can appreciate all the good work and stop short of being addicted to the images.Simply put you can't fall for Avatar because its storyline is just too linear and its characters also just too one-dimensional. It took 12 years for James Cameron to be able to make Avatar and he wasn't able to write something better? More accurately, since he is not renown for his perfectly and subtly crafted screenplays I'd say he missed the opportunity to team up with some good writer(s). Cameron has reached such a status it's difficult for him to collaborate in a creative department he thinks he masters and thus the real joy for him must have been the creative collaboration on the technically challenging parts. As a result he put more energy in the visual creation of Avatar, not in the writing. Another very weak point is the score by James Horner: 12 years after Titanic he couldn't come up with something better that doesn't constantly brings memory of his previous score for Cameron. I suppose this shows just how much James Cameron was unable to provide the necessary amount of energy to the creative departments other than visual imagery.Now, about the visual imagery, it's nice but only a rehash of Miyazaki's visual and poetic creations: Princess Mononoke (mainly), NausicaÃ¤, Castle in the sky. Cameron didn't improve at all on these references.Conclusion: I'll not go and watch Avatar again. There's nothing interesting beyond the 3D experience so I suspect it must be far less interesting, even boring, to watch in 2D.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Benchmark movie of our generation,"Movies are escapism. They take us to other worlds, based in our reality or not, and tell us stories. These stories either reflect the best or worst of our natures, our dreams and nightmares, and communicate these themes on multiple levels. It has been said of many movies that 'it takes you to another world/place/time'. Only with ""Avatar"" is this true.There's not much to say about the movie that watching the film won't say for itself, so it's pointless to try and communicate that here. Instead, I want to focus on the experience. I watched 'Avatar' on IMAX-3D and, despite not seeing it in any other format, can confidently say this is the ONLY way to see it. At the end of the movie, I didn't want it to be over. I wanted to stay in Pandora. Never has a movie had an effect on me like this. I was literally, in every sense of the word, transported to another world, another time. To say the visuals are stunning and breathtaking are paltry adjectives for such eloquent film making.Many people have and will degrade the movie for it's 'lack of an original story'. What they don't understand is that this is not an 'American' movie, if you will. The film's story is taken from legend, legend that a thousand cultures across the planet share, and roots it firmly and beautifully in another world. It's characters and mythology are anchored in the human subconscious, which allows the audiences to fully embrace this new world Cameron has shown us.It's one of the highlight movie experiences of my life and it is my hope it will be for you. As has been said of other James Cameron movies: he doesn't reinvent the wheel, he just shows it rolling in a whole new way. There are a thousand positive things to be said about 'Avatar' but the only one that deserves mention is this: see it the way it is intended to be seen, or miss out on the cinematic opportunity of a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Motion Picture Masterpiece? No. A Film That Changes Cinema? Not Really. A Solid Good Time at the movies? Absolutely.,"Cameron has directed some pretty stellar movies over his career. From Terminator to Alien to Titanic, he really hasn't made a bad movie. But after Titanic he spent the last decade making and trying to build up his new movie which he dubs ""will change film making.""If he was intending on changing film making in the way that 3D glasses will be more acceptable in movies then he succeeded. If he was intending on creating new character archetypes and changing the way storytelling is done then he didn't. But despite the obvious ""Dances with Smurfs"" joke that everyone and their mother has already mentioned, the movie is pretty damn impressive. Sure it doesn't have the most original story but the execution is really well done.For me this is really the first 3D movie that succeeds mainly because it doesn't feel like a gimmick is being forced on you. It's simply there to give you a more realistic feel and its easily the best looking movie of the year. Cameron's obvious strengths are in directing action sequences and this is easily seen in the final 40 minutes of the movie. As for the acting he did a pretty good job there too. Zoe Saldana is the star of the show and was obviously wasted in Star Trek. All the other actors are maybe a little above average and they advance the story very well.On the script level, the film feels a bit clunky at points. Most notably is in the opening 20 minutes of the film where everything feels rushed. It jumps almost immediately into the story instead of easing us in. Also the last 40 minutes of the movie which is just a big action movie essentially, the script also feels dumbed down a bit. But despite this problem the script works more often then it doesn't.As for the characters, although most of the acting is good, the characters are very two- dimensional. They're characters you seen in other movies before and nothing new is added to them. But the movie is really plot driven or character driven so it is easily overlooked.Really this movie is all about the visuals and more importantly the 3D. I have had a really bad hatred for 3D in the past so when Cameron pulled this off by creating a subtle effect, it proved that 3D can work for a movie, even though the movie doesn't actually need it. But it's proof that it doesn't need to be shoved in your face. All the colours and effects of the movie make it feel more like a roller coaster. I won't spend to much on the story other than saying while not original or extremely deep, it is very well told and keeps the movie going.So is it worth it? Don't go in expecting the most intelligent film of the year but you should expect the best looking one. Technologically Cameron did succeed on making his movie, changing cinema technically and even if it is slightly empty in the middle it is one hell of a good time at the movies. Especially in 3D.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover,"Few movies deserve to be long. This is one of them. At no point during the picture do we feel it's dragging too slowly, nor do we ever feel like the script has been ""dumbed down"" for us. There is minimal set up and the plot gets rolling along as soon as the opening title emerges. Sam Worthington's voice-over provides us with just the enough back story while also setting the mood. He plays his character as a young, brave, but ultimately innocent, service member. His persona echos that of many enlisted servicemen who joined up after seeing a ""Be all you can be"" commercial. He has little, if any, hindsight. Armed only with courage, we witness him make calculated errors. But he has faith in himself and we sympathize with him because he's so vulnerable. Yes, this is a big budget Hollywood movie. Yes, it has many clichÃ©d and unoriginal plot elements. Yet it is unusually well focused, and it embodies the same spirit as any character driven independent feature film. And it does so very well. This is a movie which doesn't rely on A-lister movie stars because Cameron understands that movie stars and money don't constitute a great film. Cameron uses his cast, crew, and every available technology much like the great Leonardos and Donatellos used their paint brushes. Personally, I dislike going to movie theaters. I usually wait for the DVD. But this was too good to pass up as there are no other James Camerons out there. I dread the day he'll retire. He makes action sequences like no other. In most pictures, my mind goes numb once the fireballs and bullets start flying. But not this time. Cameron understands the importance of letting the audience emotionally invest in the protagonists, mean while comprehending the threat which the antagonists pose. I found myself relating to the Worthington character which made the theatrical viewing more of a genuine experience and not just three hours of ""entertainment."" Avatar is such a cinematic treat much like Terminator 2 and Titanic in that it overwhelms our senses. It would be a shame for anyone who claims to appreciate the motion picture to ignore this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Savages, savages, barely even human!","I hated this movie.Hated it, hated it, hated it.Don't get me wrong, I'm not shoving my opinion down your throats or anything â the great thing about movies is that they're debatable. The problem with Avatar, however, is that James Cameron doesn't want it to be debatable. He wants you to love it â he'd be downright insulted if you didn't like it. Everybody's going to love it because it has everything that makes a movie great â characters, action, and groundbreaking special effects. Whoever doesn't like it is obviously missing something.Bullshit.For one thing, it's pretentious â not just pretentious, but also incredibly preachy. James Cameron may have a great visual style but he's easily one of the worst directors â if not one of the worst creative entities in the world â when it comes to moralizing in his films. The story was nothing more than a recycled cowboys vs. Indians melodrama in a shallow point to prove that, ""humanity is evil, oh my god!"" It was pretty much the equivalent of being locked in a room for two and a half hours and having one of your school's environmental awareness club scream at you with stunning special effects. Yeah alright Hollywood, we get it already. Humanity is evil; we get how heartless we are as a human race and how you expect us to shed a tear as we watch our military knock down that giant tree they have at Disney's Animal Kingdom.By the way, is it bad that I rooted for the humans? Not because I'm a conservative, cold-heard violent warmonger or anything, but just for how preachy Cameron was in showing us the lifestyle of the inhabitants of Pandora. Seriously, I can picture him right now laughing at the thought of his moviegoers walking out of the theatre, invigorated and awed like they just saw a groundbreaking experience that changed their mundane, unfulfilling lives. James Cameron said Avatar would push cinema the same way, ""The Jazz Singer"" â the first talkie that came out in the 1920's â did. What Cameron fails to realize however is that you don't need all of these flashy gimmicks to reel people movies like fish. If you can see a movie and you can hear a movie, what else do you need? Vibrators built into our chair so he can jerk his audience off in the comfort of their seats? He's already jerked Hollywood off enough by getting them to financing this piece of crap so I guess it's a fair trade when you look at it. At the rate enhancing the film experience is going, the sequel will consist of nothing more than painting moviegoers blue and letting them loose in the woods behind the theatre.And then there's the fact of the storyline â god, I think this brought clichÃ© to a new level. We're introduced first to Jake Sully, a rough and tough marine who â from the moment we see him â is obviously going to not only be the one to win the heart of the girl but also turn against his people. Ne'ytri (I probably spelled her name wrong but she was a terrible character anyway) was nothing more than a spiritual guru plot device to get the main character to see the light. ""Oh god, look at what I was missing out on! Nature is so beautiful! Look at the colors of the wind!"" Their relationship was so tacky you could have slapped it on a Hallmark Valentines Day card.""Alright class, the alien and the boy don't really get along at first. What happens?"" ""They end up liking each other!"" ""Oh, that's great â just excellent! And then what happens?"" ""She ends up saving him and they get married!"" ""Oh, how wonderful. Maybe you should be a director someday, James! Then there's the archetypal marine antagonists who want to destroy this perfect little utopia because, well, they're just greedy douche bags apparently and that's one of the main flaws with this movie. Characters are either good or bad â they're not developed, they don't grow, they're just kind of cemented there and told to look pretty. Quarich is one of them. He's a bad guy â nothing more. That's not necessarily a bad thing when a movie doesn't take itself seriously, but if you're going to ask me to get into a theatre for two and a half hours to watch your pretentious public service announcement of a film, I kind of want to know where this guy's coming from. All we really get from him is that he's mad with power and wants the, ""unobtanium."" Yes, that's actually what's it's called. Along with being a Hollywood cash hound, Cameron also thinks he's witty. Bottom line though, I go to movies to see stories and characters. I'm not saying it's the right way to look at things â there's tons of films that are just mindless popcorn fests â but if you're going to try to take yourself seriously, well, at least try to do a little with the characters in between the gratuitous shots of aliens sticking their tentacles into dragons. By the way, if that's also the way they sexually reproduce then isn't that technically bestiality? And damn, is it really that hard to kill someone? Even if he was in a flashy robot suit, that guy Quartich was like a cockroach at the end. He would have given Gaston from Beauty and The Beast a run for his money with the way he was fighting that battle. Or more suitably, Radcliffe from Pocahontas.I'm suddenly tempted to watch that final fight scene again with that song, ""Savages,"" playing.So what is it? An debatable movie? An over-hyped movie? Not sure, but it made me want to boycott that new Smurfs movie they're advertising.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Most Beautiful Movie I've Ever Seen.,"I watched this film awhile back in December. Before watching it, my brother told me (even though he hasn't seen the movie yet) that it was going to be bad. When I watched the trailer, I wasn't really captivated by it. I originally thought it was only a bunch of CGI's and no heart in the movie. After watching it, I was totally surprised.This movie is a feast to the human eyes. There are things in the movie that you haven't seen before in your life. It's probably the most beautiful movie you will ever see. The visuals are great; it's like you are actually part of the Avatar world. Aside from the visuals, there's a heart in this movie. You can relate to the characters the pain, the love, and the suffering they're experiencing the plot even though most of the characters are motion-captured! James Cameron, not only gives us a beautiful movie but a beautiful experience as well. It feels like being a kid again. This movie will go into the classics and the best film-making as one of the most beautiful film ever made. A must see in IMAX 3D but even without that, the journey never loses its excitement! Go watch Avatar and feast your eyes with delight! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The best experience I've ever had in a theater, bar none","The only reason I gave this movie a 10 is that IMDb hasn't implemented 15's as a score yet. It is simply incredible.There are a few naysayers who have complained about the plot of the movie. My only explanation is that they are just too stupid to appreciate what they just saw. The plot has everything you could ask for, and is very different from anything you've ever seen in a major motion picture. This movie could play without the soundtrack and the story would still be compelling.However, the home run hit by this movie is unquestionably the special effects. Again, maybe some kids that have grown up in the 'great special effects generation' aren't able to to really watch what is going on and truly appreciate the achievement. In the car driving home, I commented that I was surprised I was actually getting us home ... the entire time images from the movie were still racing thru my head.This movie is just truly a feast in every way. From the opening shot to the last the visuals are the most incredible I've ever seen in any media. To hearken back to the famous ""Superman"" advertising ... You WILL believe a 10 foot alien man can fly on a wyvern-like alien beast!""It all looks real, from the stunning alien world to the action scenes to the acting on the faces of the aliens.Don't try to analyze this movie. Just go to see it, sit back, relax (when you can), and be amazed at this stunning achievement!I highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D. Once it is out of the theaters, it may be a long time before you will see anything like this again, and you will NEVER again see this movie like the experience you will have in the theater. Many movies are as good (or better) at home on Blu-ray. That will not be the case with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow!  This was spectacular!,"I went to see the 3D version of the movie last night with my son. We both were awestruck at the visuals. I would give this movie high marks on just that alone. I have read many other reviews on this and people have been nay saying about the plot and character development. I did not see a problem with either. I really felt connected to the main character and his struggle to pick sides. I also felt for the indigenous people for their plight. There is plenty of story telling where you get to know more about the Na'vi culture. There is talk about how earth is in the future and why the humans are there on Pandora. Some of the story telling is subtle, but it is all there. I left the theater thrilled and will go see this again. It is hands down, the best movie of the year and I recommend it to anyone who can sit in a theater chair for two and a half hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best movie ever made!,"I've experienced Avatar in a local theater in Amsterdam with IMAX and I must say that this movie is one of the best movies ever made. I've never experienced all the human emotions in one movie, this movie made me happy when I was drawn into Avatars world, I mean I would wanna live there and never come back to the real world. In the first scene of the 3D world of Avatar the blue species girl's first line is genius with so much emotion and so powerful. The actors did an outstanding job with convincing me why the Avatar is the most special thing ever. Mr Cameron best work,the movie is about 3 hours long, but it felt like one minute, if you can take me in one breath, this director did it. It's outstandingly perfect, and all the emotion's crying, happiness, anger, depression, feeling real love from the screen this MOVIE comes in with a BANG!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A solid piece of entertainment,"It's impossible to watch AVATAR for the first time â especially a good two years after it first came out â without being influenced by all the fuss surrounding it, with endless critics, fans and reviewers praising it as a game-changing FX movie, a film heralding in a new era of cinematic spectacle, the best movie of all time, yada yada yada. Such praise invariably leaves me cold, which is why I finally caught up with this film not in the cinema but on television during its debut showing. I was in no hurry.My thoughts? AVATAR is a decent film, yes, and one that's highly entertaining â but it's no masterpiece. Cameron works hard and puts in a great deal of effort as director, but it doesn't come close to the strength and power of his earlier one-two pairing, THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS. AVATAR is a film that works on a superficial level as long as you don't think about it too much, and the overly familiar storyline has already been done before in the likes of DANCES WITH WOLVES. Except Cameron had the clever idea of transporting the action to an alien planet and hoping nobody would notice. And you know what? It seems nobody â or very few people - actually did.Does the somewhat slim storyline justify the rather excessive running time? I'm not entirely sure it does. The beginning feels a little slow and the whole fish-out-of-water premise involving the central character's induction to the alien society is rather familiar. Much of the film just seems like an excuse to show off the CGI effects, which are admittedly impressive although not quite as lifelike as Cameron would have you believe. I'd still have preferred them to use unadulterated human actors for the aliens, rather than converting the performances by the actors into pure CGI, but then you can't have anything.As is usual with Cameron, the film is more about the technology and the science rather than the characters. The actors don't make a great deal of impact, it has to be said; the dull Sam Worthington made his name with this and TERMINATOR: SALVATION, two films which barely require him to act. Still, Sigourney Weaver is on hand to show him how it's done, and Stephen Lang makes a great villain, as always (I still remember him from the likes of Steven Seagal actioner FIRE DOWN BELOW in the '90s, and I guess it took a while for everyone else to catch up). It's hard to assess the performers playing the aliens because the effects are just too distracting.At its heart, AVATAR is a simple and straightforward action film, offering the kind of breakneck, breathtaking effects-infused sequences that highlighted TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. It's admittedly beautiful to watch, particularly the alien landscapes brought stunningly to life and the various creatures that inhabit them. The action is engaging, particularly the extensive climax in which the speed picks up a gear and Cameron really lets loose with all kinds of pyrotechnic mayhem. The climax, which seems to run for about forty minutes, displays a willingness to dispatch important characters in a realistic and gritty way, really ending the movie on a high and leaving the viewer with a good impression. It may be familiar â too much so in places â but as a piece of spectacle, AVATAR ticks all the right boxes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Breathtaking - a visual feast for you eyes & an escape for your imagination,"This is the 1st time I'm reveiwing a movie on IMDb after watching hundreds of movies and this movie is just so great that I had to do it justice by posting a review about it.Without revealing too much, the visuals are absolutely stunning, God only knows how Mr Cameron even conceived the design of such a world in his mind. It must be seen in 3D to be fully appreciated in all its grandeur. There is so much detail, from the bodies of the Na'vi to their fingertips, from the little insects hovering in the air in the forest to the way the individual leaves of grass move on the screen, everything is a visual treat, at times there is so much going on on screen that you don't know which way to look and what to enjoy. It was my first time watching a movie in 3D and the experience was at first uncomfortable during the 1st 30 minutes because I kept switching between the glasses and without the glasses trying to understand the optical illusion before me, after which I convinced myself that rather than question it, I'd go with theflow , once my eyes adjusted to the feeling, it felt like an engrossing experience from there onwards. The film is much like a different kind of Matrix meets Jurrasic Park.The depth of the characters helps convey the reality of the fictional world unfolding before your eyes, without much effort you want to find out more and more about the Na'vi, how they congregate, how they pass their time, their religion and so on, The performances are fantastic, the lead actor and sigourney weaver steal the show.Director Cameron has definitely set the bar high for other motion pictures out there within this category. Thus far, I don't think there's a similar Sci-Fi movie experience out there that truly moves the movie-goer like Avatar does throughout its 180 minutes. It may be a little long to endure but the experience which is uncomparable is definitely worth the cinema ticket and also a revisit or two.It is quite simply a masterpiece of film-making that has to be seen and appreciated (leaving home all your doubts and pessimistic criticisms), enjoy this for what it is meant to be, a surreal, visually magnificent, unrivalled, beautiful and magical experience that totally blows you away from scene 1 to the end. You don't expect to see anything quite like the magic that captivates you when you see Avatar for the 1st time.Naturally, some girls may hate it, some people may be put off by the alien love story or the mushy romantic scenes, its not everyones cup of tea,but then again, not everyone goes in with a blank canvas, thats what you need to be blown away by this movie - an empty canvas to paint this new experience on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Cameron managed to create a completely self-contained world which is 100% believable and emotionally involving.The only weak side of the movie was the story, which could have been developed better.

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overrated ...,"Avatar is a movie you can describe in a short list: - pretty - terribly old and dated story - leaning too heavily on technology - predictableI can see this movie enthralling 8 year olds since the story is probably still cool to them but to for me? It was so painfully predictable, it became annoying to watch. Sure, there's quite a few great movies with predictable plots but Avatar's ONLY other strong point is the 3D and, frankly, colourful plants and stuff stopped being fascinating to me since I was 12.Being a gamer, I've seen far more interesting digital worlds. For all the effort put into it, it came across as a fake cartoon world instead of a real threatening one. Making everything look as if it jumped out of a Pixar movie doesn't help either.In the end, it's a gimmicky movie with nice 3D, a terrible story and mediocre acting. 8+/10 people?

The fourth time, I was nudging my boyfriend saying, ""Can we go see that?""So, when we went to see it, I was expecting something that probably had the potential to be good, but I wasn't quite sure. When we left the theater, I was stunned by the--yes, I'll say it--epic nature of the movie. I don't think I can sufficiently describe the movie, other than it is just full of fantastic.I've seen reviews on here about how 3D makes the entire movie. I respectfully disagree. If you went to ""Avatar"" expecting a 100% original, never-before-seen storyline with characters who aren't even slightly predictable and all that, then you might as well never watch another movie. You will never, ever find a movie that does not depict something that someone else in time thought of or already made a movie about. That being said, the 3D simply added to the movie. It was not the only reason ""Avatar"" was amazing.If you're looking to see incredible visual effects, on both the 3D and imaginative levels, then go see ""Avatar.""

James Cameron said that it would be a seamless viewing meaning that you would not be able to tell the difference between what was CGI and what wasn't â he was right.James Cameron said it would be photo-realistic - he was right.

Fabulous world ruined by the clichÃ©s...,"OK, I'm a woman. And a non-American. And I adore mostly artistic movies, not really the Hollywood blockbusters. So, maybe I'm not the right one to comment on this. Still I have to say, for the sake of the ones who are like me (and I'm sure I'm not alone here) - it's just not THAT good, and it could be much better.Visually, this movie is really amazing. The world in it is just completely magnificent. From that point of view, this movie will not disappoint anyone and is truly something new and special. On the other hand, since they've put so much effort into trying to make something really revolutionary - I really expected that the scriptwriters would not hold onto every possible existing clichÃ© they could put in a movie. The characters are SO one-dimensional (to begin with the two main characters, the main scientist, the Latino girl, the ""jealous guy"" and to end with unbelievably the same ""army general"" figure), the dialogs are hundreds-of-times-seen-before, the development of the story also, not to mention the ""the cool American guy who is total newbie and quite stupid does something several generations of native people couldn't do"" thing.I truly expected more from this movie, because I expected at least a bit more of originality in every aspect and not just with the special effects.Still I have to say - everyone should see it.

Exotic and Sublime,"Wow! My wife and I just saw Avatar last night and we were both blown away! We chose to pay the extra money and see it in 3D and it was worth every penny. I was concerned at first, because all of the 3D trailers (and there were a bunch) looked cheesy and a bit unclear, but the opening scene, in the ship, took my breath away and it stayed that way throughout the entire movie. The visual effects were so stunning, they could have easily overshadowed the story and plot, but as amazing as they were, they still took a back seat to this story of good vs evil. During the movie, I became so caught up in the characters, I truly cared what happened to them and how it would end. I am a sci-fi fan, but I almost chose to see a different movie, because I thought the trailers had given away the plot and I didn't see myself enjoying a bunch of thin, blue giants. Luckily, I know not to judge a book by its cover. My wife, who hates sci-fi, may have liked the movie even more than me. She talked about how great it was all night.

Decent entertainment,"I had very high expectations walking into the movie theater before watching this movie, but I have to say that I was disappointed (probably because my expectations were too high). On the positive side, the movie is somewhat exciting and has good special effects as well as action scenes. For example, the action scenes around that huge tree was awe-inspiring. On the negative side it is filled with clichÃ©s and is shockingly predictable and unoriginal. The obvious reference to the current climate debate is just another example of politically correct, self loathing on part of the materialistic lifestyle of rich people in the world. I won't spoil the ending, but don't expect any surprises, because the movie basically tells you what is going to happen at the end by using obvious foreshadowing techniques. The love story is nothing new either.I would still recommend that people watch it so that they can make up their own minds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just pretty eye candy made sour by Sam Worthington's horrible acting and not so subtle environmental propaganda,"Let me preface this brief review by saying that my IMAX viewing of this was hindered by the fact that the 3D was broken and I got to see it in glorious IMAX 2D. I went into this knowing how horrible the story was going to be and I just wanted to see what it was like in 3D since everybody wouldn't shut up about it. So I go in and I see 30 seconds of trees in 3D and it goes dark and the manager says the 3D is broken, but my stub will work as a free pass the next time I go to that theater. Only problem was that I was on vacation at the time and so I just wasted almost 20 bucks on a 2D movie.So anyway onto the review. Sam Worthington, God bless him, is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. I wouldn't have minded so much if his bloody Aussie accent hadn't been bleeding through his horrible attempt at an American accent. Just be an Aussie for crying out loud.Now I will say that the visuals were, for the most part, very beautiful to look at, even without the 3D effect the Na'vi appeared to be incredibly life-like and not CG. However, everything else was pure obvious CG dribble, but pretty CG dribble at least.The not-so-subtle environmental message literally made me feel like I was watching Ferngully again, with Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves's story mixed in. Now I'm all for saving the planet, but seriously, watching this makes me want to chop down every tree I see.Lastly just some nitpicks I have. The name of the planet/moon/world Pandora is probably the most unoriginal name for anything I can think of. Also, unobtainium or whatever is also very stupid and unoriginal, see The Core to see what that movie stole that elemental title from.James Cameron, PLEASE, just make another terminator or aliens movie and leave this film to the rest of the hippies in Hollywood",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A True Showcase!,"Avatar is obviously a visually appealing film. The CGI is expertly done and the details in everything is amazing. The color is rich and vibrant, the moving is fluid, and everything is beautiful.Okay, enough. The above is essentially what most reviewers say about Avatar: that it is a revolutionary visual masterpiece. What else? A movie isn't just the visual appeal! If the visual appeal is so very wonderful, they why don't they film natural beauty? Visuals are just a tool to make sure the viewers know what's going on. So? Why spend so much money and time making a visual masterpiece without understanding the ultimate elements to a quality film? Basically, what James Cameron was like after making Titanic was: ""Oh my god, I want to make another film. Let's make this film so visually stunning that everybody will be captivated."" James Cameron is doing his animation business, and a few weeks before the release, a man notifies James Cameron of something important: ""Um, sir, you know, you have to make, um, a storyline."" ""What? I have to make a STORYLINE? WITH CHARACTERS! Are you insane?"" ""Well, um, sir, I'm sure you could write something up on this weekend, uhh, yeah!"" ""Brilliant! That'll do!"" In the long run, nothing happens for the first hour, the characters are pasted into the story, and when emotions try to be thrown around, they are blocked.In my opinion, Avatar was just a showcase of visuals. James Cameron decided ""Hey, you know, people are stimulated by visuals. Let's make Avatar!"" An absolute insult to all humanity.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movies I've seen,"I have just seen the 3D version of Avatar. And i have to say that it is probably the best movie that i have ever seen.It can clearly be seen that the director has done his best effort to let this movie leave an imprint on your mind. There is just so much emotion going on in the movie. The story might not be the most original but it is told so beautifully that it just grips on to you.The entire movie just makes you fall in love with characters and their way of living. The beauty of the environment and the emotion put into it is just indescribable. Even though it was a 3 hour ride, the movie ends sooner than you expect and you want it to last even longer.All i can say this is a must see movie for anyone!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar Review,"These days it's rare for a ""block buster"" movie to live up to its hype and even rarer for a film to exceed this hype. But James Cameron delivered. This fill is nothing short of amazing. Cameron took on the task of challenging your reality without seeming unrealistic. This was accomplished flawlessly. Cameron created a world where you can fly on mythological pterodactyl like creature, plant life glows in the dark and mountains float. The world where this film was set in will truly blow your mind.But every rose has its thorns. With a Titanic size budget I was truly expecting a DiCaprio size performance from the leading cast but I was left wanting. I felt that the movies main characters (Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and Zoe Saldana) delivered strong above average performances. But there were far too many one dimensional characters. You honestly couldn't care less if these characters lived or died. Also there was a drill sergeant character that littered the movie with cheesy dialog that detracted from the moves over all awe inspiring feel.Despite some of the one dimensional character this was an excellent film. The story line was nothing short of original. The love story aspect of the film was well developed and realistic. This movie has forever changed the fantasy and science fiction film genre. James Cameron has set the bar so high that few directors will ever reach it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Many flaws, Incredible qualities","Yes, that's right. I said many flaws, and I didn't say ""more qualities"" or something like that, and yet I gave this movie 10 out of 10. Don't ask me why, I'm just sure that that's what it deserves.This movie is my generation's Star Wars. It is the movie we see in the theater (especially if we follow it with IMAX 3d... trust me and don't see Avatar that way for your first time, but see it that way eventually!) and are blown away by not just through sheer spectacle, but more importantly through the incredible immersion that the movie manages to give you.I'm serious about how important this is. It's a science-fiction action movie with a plot lifted out of many other films (epic classics of film history, but still other films), and yet it manages to immerse you into the setting like those other stories just... didn't. This is the sort of thing that pushes not necessarily all the right buttons, but rather pushes buttons you didn't know you had, causing you to go ""wtfomgwowthisisincredibleahhhh!"" at many different moments that are actually about a half-and-half mix between action moments and actual scenes of character development and setting exposition.Okay, so that may be over some peoples' heads. Just let it suffice for me to say that you must see this movie unless you are prone to motion sickness or annoyance from loud noises, as well as if you have to leave the theater at any point in a 2-1/2 hour time period, because the movie is really that important to see the whole way through, with proper sound, and on a proper screen.Eventually, Avatar will be sent to the tiny screens and the tinny speakers of our multiplexes and then our homes. Seriously, that is a shame because this movie is worth seeing just for the spectacle, even with all the flaws and deeper qualities (no I don't mean the moralistic messages, those are so obvious they're almost self-defeating).Enough of my yapping, get out there and see this movie, because James Cameron and the rest of the crew (who I'm intentionally going to sit through the credits for next time, with the great job they did) deserve your money infinitely more than the makers of most of the blockbusters or tearjerkers or romances of this year. Seriously, they did a good job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar (2009) Is the story really a problem?,"Avatar's biggest highlight has always been its visuals. Pandora is a magical place and James Cameron manages to build and immerse this world very well. The photography is perfect and the visual effects are magnificent. It is impossible to watch and not be enchanted by the colors and all the beauty of the planet. However, one problem that has always been cited about the film is in relation to its story and characters. The plot is very simple and repetitive. You won't find anything new when it comes to history. Stories like Avatar have been explored several times in cinema and it is already possible to decipher everything that will happen just by presenting the story. The characters are bland, they don't have a charisma that makes you fall in love with them. The protagonist is the worst among them all. These details prevent Avatar from being an even better film. But, in my opinion, the film remains incredible and these details don't make it bad or mediocre, they just weaken something incredible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""... I see you.""","This is a turning point for cinema.James Cameron has foregone the hokey throwing the Axe at the screen 3-D to forge a subtle, immersing, action adventure.It is the work of someone who is truly in control of his vision and is capable of bringing it to the screen.Put simply, amazing film, with s powerful performance at its center(hello Zoe Saldana)!Not since The Matrix has there been a film that had to be seen at the Cinema.Do yourself the favour. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice but totally predictable!,"Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington are not bad... not at all! But it's a love story that overtook all the problems and ended up incredibly well, and I don't see this as a good script. Even though it's in PANDORA, which is, by the way, what a beautiful place to live, it's just simple. This film is just HUGE, but I've seen this before, ""our green is gone"", ""human being are unstoppable"", ""what a bad behavior we have"", ""we just think about money, omg there's more than that!!!"", MANY movies has shown me this.On the other hand, the 3-D experience is unforgettable. The visual effects made the film, and also James Cameron obsession to perfection. I wonder how many years he'll take to the sequel. I don't think that 2012, Harry Potter and Star Trek stand a chance for the Academy. A great film, but I've seen better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Outstanding Genre Film,"Avatar is clearly the movie of this year, featuring visuals so vibrant that they are beautiful enough to make you weep. Combine that with a motion capture technology that actually works and you have something special. If you want a comparison go view Robert Zemeckis' ""A Christmas Carol"" done for Disney. That film featured CGI figures that were not emotive and eerily conjured visions of soul-dead zombies. In contrast, Cameron provides characters that seem to be living breathing individuals.Since there is nothing to criticize in the visual area, people have concentrated on the story telling of this feature. They seem to forget that this is a genre piece that pretty much closely adheres to the conventions of heroic fantasy. These include: (1) An outsider or low-born individual who will rise to the top. (2)He will eventually wed the unobtainable beautiful queen or princess in contradiction of cultural norms and expectations. (3)He (it is almost always a he) will justify his rise in prominence by fulfilling a prophecy or legend that results in the salvation of either his people or his newly adopted people. Is this an original tale? No. Go to any book store and in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy aisle you can find tons of slight variations of this tale. These tales would include the Lord of the Rings, The Sword of Truth, The Wheel of Time, and The Song of Fire and Ice among their many volumes. While there are dozens of dozens of similar tales, these are the well-done titles of exemplars. This is what Avatar is--a genre film that has been realized to the nth degree. If you are looking for more creativity, you'll have to await the sequels.Accept this film for what it is and you'll not be disappointed in any way. James Cameron did not attempt a genre busting film, he fully embraced the genre and then knocked it out of the park.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avatar: Cameron's Comic Flicker,"With great expectations, my guest and I laid down $20.00 for a matinÃ©e, to view the greatest 3D film ever to be shown on the silver screen! Three fourths of the way through, I was still looking for that film. To be more precise, I felt as though I had gone through a time machine, to my youth in the 1950's on a Saturday afternoon, watching 35 cartoons and two 3D science fiction films. Avatar was the same old Cowboys and Indians all over again but in reverse. On the planet Pandora, humans are seeking the path to unlimited power at the cost of the indigenous population. The name of the planet, Pandora, should give the audience a clue, that maybe this is a box better left closed. The citizens of Pandora live in harmony with each other and their entire planet. The humans, who want to study the Na'vi, incubate Avatars in which they can join psychologically and mingle with the general population. The company the scientists work for are a paramilitary organization who will stop at nothing to obtain their goal. So we have the Na'vi on one side and the paramilitary on the other side, who do you think will win? Does the name of the film give you the slightest hint? I thought so. James Cameron who wrote and directed this 3D film to end all 3D films should have stopped at 120 minutes and left the other 40 for his director's cut.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
C'mon!,After all the hype and praise from all my friends and movie critics I saw it in the movie theater. I didn't see it in 3d but even if I did it would have still been the same crappy movie.After the first hour of sitting through the movie I started to think is it going to get better. It never did. The one thing that really made me angry was the blue chick that kept screaming at Sam Worthington. She made me wan't to pull my hair out. If i had to say something good about this movie i would have to say the cgi was pretty amazing and the last battle scene was also pretty OK.If you haven't seen it yet then i prefer you don't.,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best Film Ever - Newest Classic Movie on the Block,"This was the best movie I have ever seen, by far.If you like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings you will be thrilled by this one.The first time I sat with tears in my eyes during three quarters of the time.This is a classic. And the current rate people are giving it is far to low.It's way above Shawshank Redemption (which is also one of my favorites).True is doesn't have much room actors finesse. The film is just to fast and overwhelming to blend in much subtle play. But anyone knowledgeable on politics and the few cultures still living on our planet in conjunction with nature will recognize and appreciate all kind of stuff, like the way the Pandorians greet each other, woven into the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Far from perfect... but won't matter for most,"Let me start by saying Avatar is rough around the edges. Not the greatest acting, cheesy lines, and a predictable and worn out story are a few of its problems, so why do I give it a ten? It comes down to one factor: emotion.Simply put, Avatar took me to a different world, figuratively and literally. I found myself entranced for the entire 160 minutes. How many movies can leave you extremely entertained and happy beyond your wildest dreams, yet sad because you cannot be a part of the world that you just experienced? None before Avatar in my experience. This movie is by far and away my favorite movie of all time. Even the sadness of coming back to reality and realizing in our lifetimes we will never come across a world (pandora) or group of people (the na'vi) as beautiful as those in Avatar is worth it.Unfortunately, Avatar's greatest asset is also its downfall for those that don't see it as beautiful. If you are not emotionally gripped by Avatar, all that is left is the so-so acting, script, and tired story. While this may be so for many movies, I think has a greater effect on Avatar.If you are one of the people who saw Avatar and were transported to another dimension, then good for you. I'm right there with you. For those that didn't connect with it on a deeper level, well, I'm sorry. I feel like you are missing out on an experience that should be felt by everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awesome and Magical,"James Cameron is back and he really shows, that he did not loose his ""Mojo"". Avatar is just mind blowing and the visuals are absolutely stunning. The story might not be new, but with mankind robbing and destroying the earth, unable to listen to the sound of nature, it is more actual than ever. With Pandora, Cameron created a unique new fantasy world, worth every minute watching. The CGI sets new standards in movie making and animates a breathtaking environment, magical, spiritual, threatened by the human race in its excessive and disrespectful greed for money and economic growth. Sounds familiar? Hello rain forest. Anyway: entertaining, beautiful, sad, funny, dramatic, thrilling, romantic, spiritual,....: Hollywood at its best. Cameron is the man. Thank you for Avatar! Hope it does not only entertain but will also make people think. Cause we got our own ""Pandora"" here if we don't destroy it... The 3-D added a touch of magic that Im going to miss later on BluRay... Just awesome...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best films of the decade.,"James Cameron (Terminator 2, Titanic) returns after a 12-year hiatus with his ultimate yet risky science project that he said he would make. Cameron promised that we will not only love it, but it will change the way movies are made forever. He was right. After his brother was killed in battle, paraplegic Jake Sully (Worthington) decides to take his brother's place on a mission to the distant moon of ""Pandora"". There, he learns the greedy intentions of Parker Selfridge (Ribisi), who plans to drive out the native humanoid ""Na'Vi"" by any means necessary to mine a precious material that is worth 20 million US dollars a kilo. In return for providing Intel as an ""Avatar"", he will be able to have an expensive surgery to heal is paralyzed legs. He quickly falls for one of the beautiful Na'Vi, Neytiri (Saldana), who helps him become one of them. Jake soon finds himself torn, and he must decide to do either what is right, or carry out his mission and doom the Na'Vi. ""Avatar"" is a sweeping epic filled with beautiful visual effects that are literally as big as James Cameron's dreams. ""Avatar"" is as technically stunning and influential as ""Star Wars"" was in 1977. The moon of Pandora is the most fascinating and creative setting in a film that I have ever seen. There is no doubt in my mind that ""Avatar"" at the very least has ""Best Visual Effects"" Oscar in the bag (and hopefully many more). The technical achievements definitely outweigh the story-line, acting, and screenplay, but only because that the visual effects are so mind-blowing and so groundbreaking. Not to detract from the other elements, but they are simply just not groundbreaking. We have heard this story before (Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai), one could argue that it is mostly voice-acting, and as far as the screenplay goes, everybody says what they are supposed to, and the story itself is fairly predictable. Even though we have heard this story before, the execution is nearly perfect. The acting was very good as far as action flicks go. Sam Worthington (who was brilliant in Terminator Salvation) is on his way to being one of the top actors in Hollywood. He gives a fine performance, and makes us truly care about him and the choices he makes. Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Gorillas in the Mist) shows that she hasn't lost her gusto since her heyday as Ellen Ripley in the ""Alien"" films. She fits in the genre so well and embraces her character, Grace. The greatest job of all was perhaps Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) as Neytiri. She gives an excellent voice-acting performance as the alien princess, showing incredible range and emotion. Perhaps Avatar's weakness is the screenplay. A lot of people will attack the film for being too long, and that it had little to no characterization or character development. They will say the characters were one-dimensional and bland compared to the technical achievements of the film. Although this is Avatar's (very minor) ""weakness"", I would have to disagree. Okay, the characterization isn't perfect, but neither was ""Titanic"" (which went on to win 11 Oscars). There are MANY moments when the characters are so dynamic, so multi-faceted, and show true emotion. ""Avatar"" is a sweeping and immersive epic that will change the way movies are made. It takes you to a spectacular world far beyond imagination. Cameron's 15 year-old concept is now a reality after 4 years of meticulous film-making. The themes are so advanced and allegoric, but are executed beautifully and not shoved down the viewer's throat. This review in no way can do it any justice, except for when I tell you that it is a MUST-SEE. It is one of the best films of the decade, and of all time.Rating: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The End Of The Gimmick,"This is my first review ever on IMDb, and it follows me leaving the cinema 15 minutes ago. The movie gave breakthrough advances in cinematic technology, the birth of the new 3D, Real D, and also a good 2 and a half hours of great entertainment which left me wanting more of the same breed.I watched the film with huge expectations after seeing a 20 minute preview in new york, back in July.I was originally sceptical of the use of 3D having seen the other releases this past year, Final destination, my bloody valentine and a handful of 3d animation films, using 3D as nothing more as a unique selling point, and a use to get cheap shocks. Avatar finally see's the breakthrough of this.Since the 1920's 3Dimensional cinema has tried to make its mark and failed, but with focusing more on deep field photography as oppose to the objects flying towards you, is now a proved success. The elaborate colourful world of Pandora is really brought to life with the long shots viewing the never ending wild mountains and forests, whilst fast-paced action entertains the foreground.The huge artillery used by the army to the arrows used by the na'vis also shows massive steps into making animation looking as real as possible, and for first time i can recall, actually looked impressive alongside real action.My only snag about the movie, is that some of the performances could have been stronger but nevertheless, they pulled together to back up the breathtaking special effects.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Basically says money can make a movie,"My review of this film is guna be short but sweet. This movie for me was very simple, i easily identified who the bad guys were and the hero. The movie itself was well paced and had impressive CGI. As for the acting it really wasn't that great, i mean honestly the computers did most of the work. But where i got a little thrown off was when this movie somehow broke all the box office records??! It just goes to show that with enough money to pump into a film, and enough hype it can be a powerhouse, But that doesn't mean it deserves Oscars and globes. Avatar was good just not THAT good.

The acting was not the best feature but it was still good, especially sam worthington, who i thought was the ownly positive to come out of terminator salvation.Some people complained about things not being explained but these were events that occurred before the movie and are unimportantIts hard to put into words really, just go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Utter garbage,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was subjected to it during a three hour bus ride home, with little other entertainment. It turned out to be like many other Hollywood films, a good basic idea but the execution of it was appalling. In future, Hollywood should pass its ideas onto European film-makers, just to make them bearable.Aside from the bad acting, I have two main gripes that make this film so much worse than many of its Hollywood fellows. Firstly, the only original thing about it are the CGI effects. These, admittedly, are stunning. However, the actual plot of the story is so similar to many other Hollywood films, I'm surprised James Cameron bothered making it. It's basically Fern Gully with a massive budget. My second complaint is the budget itself. It's astronomical and was totally squandered. Just think how that money could have been spent, say on healthcare, education and the like. But no, instead it gets spent on a shockingly average film.This film could have been great, but the recycled storyline destroyed any vestige of that.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
