The Cougar & Her Prey...,"What would you do, after coming back from college, a transition is required, to expand and fill your knowledge, you're not sure just what you want, with this new world, in which you haunt, and you feel a touch distressed - as Mrs. R. slips off her dress. You make a run and disappear, uncomfortable, abashed, there's fear, but days later you have courage, which you find is not discouraged, rendezvous are orchestrated, passions sated, unabated - there is mutual satisfaction, until the train loses some traction. The ladies daughter is a spanner, and you become somewhat enamoured, but you just will not be warned, the dangers of a cougar scorned, as her claws unsheathed like daggers, scythe you from, immortal swagger, and all your futures take a turn (again), as your fingers feel the burn.Benjamin Braddock is snared by the older Mrs. Robinson as he struggles and juggles with his transition into a post college world that only emerges gradually, and then never really reveals itself in total, although everyone else seems to know what's good for him and the paths that he should take. A timeless classic, as relevant today as it was back when it was made, and sometime before, albeit the older lady scenario not one most young men would encounter, no matter how much they would like it to.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best photographed films in history!,"I saw this film for the first time in September 1968, after working for just one year as a professional cinematographer. I rapidly saw it five more times, in order to observe technical details of the photography of the film, but every time I completely forgot to look at those details, since I became so absorbed by the film every time. Now, after more than 35 years as a cinematographer and film teacher, I still marvel at Mike Nichols' and Robert Surtees' work every time I see the film. Almost everything you can do with a camera can be seen in this film, and everything is perfectly right for the story. The Graduate is groundbreaking in more areas than the photography. The casting, writing, acting, picture and sound editing are all exceptionally good, and have influenced film-making ever since. I was very happy when I saw that The Graduate reached the 7th position in the American Film Institute's voting of the best American films in history.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I have one word for you : PLASTICS,"What a ride....This is a perfect example of what art can generate if one puts soul and wit into it. Firstly, I find human emotions and life issues depicted in a bitter-comic manner to be a charming combination.Love,sex,insecurity,family relationships,shyness,deception are treated with great humor and witty dialog in this movie.Long and elaborated shots,incredible story-telling creativity (like 1-st person camera views,long still frames,distance frames),video-clip like sequences (beautifully sustained by Simon and Garfunkel's heart-warming poetry and sad irony).There is enough creative film work in The Graduate to suffice for 10 movies.The dialog is excellent and the acting pure genius.And, oh...the time frame...the sixties...don't get me started.The 2000's are like an insurance seminar compared to that... No need to praise this movie anymore, it speaks for itself.It is not,however,a movie for the masses.This is no Ben-Hur type of flick,with spectacular imagery and epic storyline.It is an epic of the inner soul.It requires a bit of meditation, it is only entertaining if you get in touch with your inner self and not expect to watch the screen and BE entertained. Despite its comic appearance,I always felt that it touched a sensitive somehow sad chord in me.It's kinda like:""Haha very funny, but I felt those type of emotions and they didn't seem funny then.""It's also so easy to laugh at other people's feelings,torments and emotions, but when you realize that you are also part of that old human comedy and drama, your laughing becomes more restrained.More mature.I always connected with this movie, and with Mike Nichols.Too bad they don't make'em like this anymore.We live in an era where people like John Woo and Michael Bay are starting to dictate what we will be watching more and more.What a shame....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best-EVER Soundtrack. #1 Greatest Comedy üíØ,"'The Graduate' is THE best movie comedy of all-time, ranking #1 on my IMDb ""Top 10 Greatest Comedies List"". The film is culturally significant and a flawless work of cinematic art.The film propelled director Mike Nichols and actor Dustin Hoffman to the top of the Hollywood A-List.For baby-boomers, this is an iconic film - a snap-shot of rapid cultural change that occurred in mid-1960s suburbia, complete with its post-college let-down, introspection, angst, and confusion.Baby boomers perceived things much differently than their Greatest Generation parents, and Nichols (along with screen-play writer Buck Henry) integrated the resulting ""generation-gap"" in a way no film had done before.Dustin Hoffman was fortunate to get the lead part as legend has it, and Nichols was fortunate to get him - both took advantage of the opportunity, and we are all fortunate they did so.The best soundtrack sync in movie history...Upon awakening one morning at the beginning of the film's production planning, Nichols had an epiphany about using the introspective and melancholy music of Simon & Garfunkel in the film after listening to their music on his bedroom record player - The resulting film sound-track ""music sync"" in 'The Graduate' established what was then, a new standard for use of popular music as an integral part of story telling. NO film since then has done this better. Without that music sync, this would have been a fine film, but it would not have reached its legendary film status.Buck Henry's original screen-play delivers some very funny scenes - the hotel scenes running from the approximate 20 to 35 minute marks in the film are hilarious and everyone pulled it off to subtle perfection. Nichols ensured those comic moments were delivered with impeccable timing by utilizing Henry as a Day Player in the role of hotel manager.Anne Bancroft is brilliant and hot, and portrays her tragic and narcissistic character ""Mrs. Robinson"" with perfection, in what has become an iconic film character.Much of the film's success is due to the performance of the ensemble cast. Nichols directs the movie like one of his stage productions where every line by every actor has impact.This is Mike Nichols' greatest and most important achievement in film, and over time has made many top 10 greatest comedy as well as all-time favorite movie lists. If one were to place slap-stick into its own separate genre (as so often the Chaplin and Marx Brothers films are cited as greatest comedies but are based largely on physical pantomime, not dialogue based comedy-drama), I believe this film is THE all-time greatest comedy in film.What else can I add that hasn't already been stated by many others?See 'The Graduate' again when the mood strikes.First timers, you are in for a treat.""Here's to you Mrs. Robinson!""üé∂üç∏",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good moovie.,"What I like the most about old movies like this one, are the subjects (Nowadays) that are quite controversial and that very little will likely be dealt with.

"Dee da dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee da dee, Doo da doo doo doo doo doo da doo","Here's to you Mrs. Robinson. Was it the song by Simon and Garfunkel made popular by the film, or did the film entrench the song into popular culture? Who's to say either way? It's a matter of opinion, and it's irrelevant really. The fact is, it's a great song and a great movie and the two compliment each other like peanut butter and jelly, ham and swiss or May and December.This movie is for anyone who's ever wondered what they are going to do with their future, anyone who's been in love with someone their parents didn't approve of, or anyone who's had an affair with one of their parent's friends. Granted, not many will fall in the latter category, but it throws an interesting spin on the film.The film perfectly encapsulates and portrays the feelings of self-doubt, alienation, disenchantment and unwanted pressures and expectations for a twenty-something just out of college. Dustin Hoffman is the only person we can possibly imagine in the role of Benjamin as his imprint and superb acting makes this film a great one. As reflected on in an interview with Dustin Hoffman on the DVD, ""The Graduate at 25"", his life changed after this film, propelling him into something of a superstar status as his incredible talent found wide recognition. When I saw ""Rushmore"" I had a similar feeling about young Jason Schwartzman in the lead role. For him, time will tell. Although ""Rushmore"" isn't the time tested success that ""The Graduate"" is, anyone who enjoyed ""Rushmore"" would likely enjoy ""The Graduate"" if they haven't already seen it. They are, however, distinctly different films.This comedy is something of a benchmark in many ways. Not many films of a comedic nature are so socially relevant and of such high quality that they make the A.F.I.'s top ten of all time. The film by many standards is more than just a contemporary comedy. It is quite possibly the best one ever made, given its widespread appeal.It is well shot with interesting sequences and hilarious segments that hold up against the test of time. It has been a long-time favourite of mine, and I can scarcely imagine growing tired of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just one word...plastics,"Any film that has a shot of Moe's Books in Berkeley scores extra points with me.A recent college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) is given a brand-new red convertible by his affluent parents and a place to hang out at while he figures out what he wants to do with his life. One of the friends of his parents (the gorgeous Anne Bancroft at just 36, lol) seduces him, and despite Hoffman being as awkward as he was in his Rain Man role, the two begin having an affair. Things get complicated when the husband encourages him to date his daughter (Katharine Ross), who's also returning from college.While the film is entertaining, it was hard to connect with Hoffman's character. I felt for him most early on when his parents were forcing all their friends on him at a party, and you could really feel the generation gap. ""I just want to say one word to you, just one word ... plastics,"" says a friend of his father, trying to talk to him about a prospective future. I wish there had been more of that kind of thing, or that the affair had played out in some more interesting way. As it is, when he's bouncing from mother to daughter, it's hard to really understand the emotion of it, because I didn't sense much of a connection to anyone from him. The mad race to stop a wedding seemed odd for such a film, and clich√© besides. Also, as much as I like the Simon and Garfunkel songs that were on the soundtrack (including The Sounds of Silence, an all-time great), they really don't seem to fit the film all that well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Hello, Benjamin.""","What a wonderful time capsule. Not being old enough to grasp the entire ""Swinging 60's"" movement, I can't help but think this was pretty true to form to what was going on back then. Dustin Hoffman is of course great, but Ann Bancroft steals the movie, dominating every scene even when she's not in it. It must have been quite a risk for her to not only play an ""older woman,"" especially in age conscious Hollywood, but also to play so much against ""type."" The music, the clothes, the houses all harken back to when America was discovering not every one lived like Ozzie and Harriet, and that a stiff martini could certainly loosen ones morals.

"""The Graduate"" is a Tale of the Sixties.  You Had to be There or you Won't Understand.","Many of the remarks which are critical of this film are coming from people who are too young to have fully understood the mood of the sixties. Young people today embrace the goals of career advancement and material success as all-important, and in that respect, they are much like the older generation of the sixties. The younger generation of that era are, of course, today's older generation. At the time (though it may be hard to tell now), they rejected the values of their parents and were idealistic and Utopian in their approach to life. The generation gap was the biggest issue of the day (aside from the Vietnam War) and it was a recurrent theme in this film. The shallow, cynical, and corrupt older generation were wonderfully depicted by the boozing Robinsons. They wallowed in bourgeois elitism and hypocrisy, an apt theme the extravagant, big band lounge music that Mrs. Robinson puts on after Ben drives her home from the party. Recall, as well, the seemingly off-the-wall advice given to Ben by a man at the party: ""One word, son -- plastics!"" Actually, it might have been good advice, considering the way things have developed, but it sure didn't seem so at the time. The older generation were ""plastic"" (artificial and phony), whereas the younger generation strove to be honest and natural, though obviously, few succeeded at it for long. In any case, you had to have been there to fully appreciate and understand these references, which at the time were anything but subtle.Even though Mrs. Robinson is undeniably a far more sophisticated and sexy woman than her pretty, naive daughter, Elaine represents the unapologetic and uncompromising idealism of the younger generation. Ben, who more than anything wanted his life to be ""different"" and grew tired of his purely physical relationship with Elaine's mother, just naturally shifted his romantic attachment to her daughter. The movie's score began to play a more important role as he courted her. I don't necessarily agree with those who claim the second part of the movie wasn't as good as the first. Although Ben indeed may have been kidding himself about just how much he loved and needed Elaine, he nevertheless fervently pursued her, and his love for the girl, whether real or imagined, represented what he considered most important in life. This was a real parting of the ways from the values of the older generation, who appeared to place romantic love fairly low on their list of priorities. In fact, without so many examples of their cynical and oft-nauseating attitudes continually in evidence, the movie changed into something else, just as it did in real life when the relatively innocent younger generation tried to experience life on their own terms (which few of them ever succeeded at doing for very long).""The Graduate"" was thus a classic movie that spoke for an entire generation. It is easy to understand why many members of the younger generation of today would be turned off by this movie. They are like the older generation of yesterday (only more so)-- boozing at an early age, driven by a desire to achieve material success above all else, obsessed with gadgets and other ephemeral distractions, and terrified that they might be perceived as ""losers,"" which not coincidentally is the biggest insult they can apply to one another or to members of the older generation of today. Benjamin Braddock would be, to them, ""a loser"" who didn't know what was important or what he ought to want. When their own kids reach maturity and begin to seek greater meaning and purpose than the emphasis on money and position that is obviously so important to their parents, watch them reject almost everything Generation X stands for. It will be ""The Graduate"" all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

But soon Ben and Elaine fall in love with each other affecting the Robinson family.""The Graduate"" is an unforgettable movie for people of my generation. The story is dramatic and funny and Anne Bancroft is perfect in the role of the unbalanced Mrs. Robinson. Despite his actual age (30), Dustin Hoffman is hilarious and convinces in the role of an unexperienced young man seduced by the alcoholic wife of his father's partner. And Katharine Ross is extremely beautiful in the role of Elaine. The wonderful soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel fits perfectly to this great movie. The rushed conclusion is silly but adequate for those years, with the couple in a bus without knowing their destination in the bus and in life. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Primeira Noite de um Homem"" (""The First Night of a Man"")",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Defining Film of a Generation...and it has lost its relevance.,"When ""The Graduate"" was first released in 1967 everyone went to go see it. The college crowds devoured it hungrily, as it was the first of its kind ¬ñ a film that proposed adults were emotional sell-outs who thrived on superficiality and materialism.It earned Mike Nichols a Best Director Academy Award as well as solidifying itself as one of the biggest and most important films of the 1960s, a motion picture whose influence would extend effortlessly into the generations to come.But is ""The Graduate"" really a great movie, or were moviegoers simply too caught up in the moment to realize what they were watching was nothing more than an exploit of the times? This is clearly an anti-bourgeois film, one with a liberal message of hippie politics; it was a drug culture movie, the defining motion picture of a generation of free love, school drop-outs and loners who sat around drinking beer all day moaning about how awful life was.Perhaps I sound overly critical of a film whose purpose is to examine (or more appropriately define) an era? Surely it is not the fault of this movie that it is about an unlikable person? No, its fault is that it tries to sympathize with him ¬ñ Benjamin is a spoiled rich kid, and it's hard to feel empathetic towards him when he wallows about drinking beer poolside, staring into his aquarium and ignoring everyone around him: A self-absorbed cynical.Yes, Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is going through an awkward change in his life. He's an East Coast graduate who returns home to his parents' estate in an upper-class suburb and finds it hard to adjust to life again.The opening scenes are promising ¬ñ Benjamin is unable to interact with the adults, finding solace in his bedroom, where he stares at his aquarium, contemplating whatever it is gloomy college graduates contemplate.A friend of his parents, named Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), tries to seduce Benjamin after he gives her a lift home ¬ñ inviting him in for a drink and then undressing in front of him, blocking his exit.Benjamin resists at first, but the temptation is too much to bear and he begins an ill-fated sexual relationship with the older married woman ¬ñ driving to a nearby hotel every few nights to meet her.Benjamin's parents don't seem to catch on at first, although his mother has suspicions that he's seeing someone. Benjamin shrugs her off and ignores his father altogether. When they set him up on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter (Katharine Ross), he feels extremely uncomfortable and takes her out to an unsuitable place for the evening as a way of making sure she never wants to see him again. However, much to his surprise, Benjamin finds himself falling for her anyway.Here ends the first half of the movie ¬ñ the second half is more serious, moody and focused on Benjamin and his new love interest. And of course the anger of her mother, who threatens to reveal the truth to everyone if he continues to date her daughter.""The Graduate"" uses some cheap tricks to force us into seeing things Benjamin's way ¬ñ for example, before having sex Benjamin wants to talk like a normal person, and have a conversation with Mrs. Robinson. We're meant to stop a moment and reconsider Benjamin's morality ¬ñ when in fact it's just a way of Benjamin trying to make himself feel better about what he is doing; justifying the basic animal instincts by twisting them into formality. By holding a reasonable discussion, the depravity of the casual sex is lessened. It all benefits Benjamin, no one else.Furthermore the characters have little depth. Benjamin falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, in what seems an instant. Their abrupt decision at the end of the picture (which I won't spoil) is now laughable, because in 1967 it offered an optimistic, endless adventure for the wide-eyed teens, I suppose; but now it just leads to foreseeable misery, and comes across as juvenile and ridiculous.The film has influenced a wide array of modern directors, most noticeably Wes Anderson, whose style of film-making is based around similar themes of contempt, quirky humor and oddball characters, typically led by a cynic. (For example, Bill Murray in ""Rushmore"" or ""The Life Aquatic."") Its cultural impact is phenomenal, being referenced in such popular entertainment as ""The Simpsons"" and an endless array of movies. (Perhaps most memorable of all, the extensive spoof in ""Wayne's World 2."") And whom do you know that wouldn't recognize the line, ""Mrs. Robinson, I think you're trying to seduce me""? Indeed, the cultural impact of ""The Graduate"" is unarguable ¬ñ this is a milestone movie and few others have had such a diverse effect on how we live. Like ""The Terminator"" and ""Star Wars,"" most people would recognize the material itself even if they haven't seen the movie. Hum the first few notes of the ""Jaws"" theme song and see how many people can guess what it is.Similar is ""The Graduate"" in its appeal and popularity. It continues to endure, remaining a key word amongst film buffs and college crowds. But as a film it is just good, not great. It is not expertly crafted and is actually quite awkward. This is essentially a snapshot of the era and little else ¬ñ the characters aren't likable and we're forced into feeling false admiration for them; the direction is somewhat clumsy, the script is often unbelievable and the movie's two halves ¬ñ its drastic change from comedy to drama -- never really form a satisfying whole.Like Benjamin, ""The Graduate"" just kind of sits there, staring at you ¬ñbored, self-absorbed, and lazy. This movie has no soul, no heart ¬ñ and after forty years of sulking, that is what proves to be clearest of all.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wonderful, and one of Dustin Hoffmann's best roles","Much has been said about how good The Graduate is. I have one word really to say, Amen! This film is wonderful in every way, from the cinematography, to the acting to the soundtrack.ACTING- The acting is really quite excellent in The Graduate. In his first major role, Dustin Hoffmann(a great actor) is sensational as the innocent college graduate, while Anne Bancroft is also excellent as the older woman who seduces him. And Katherine Ross was surprisingly effective as the daughter Hoffmann's character falls for.DIRECTION- Mike Nichols' direction is very, very good, easily one of his best directing jobs. He ensures flawlessly that there isn't a single wasted scene while watching The Graduate. And in my opinion, he thoroughly deserved the best director Oscar.SCREENPLAY- I don't know when to start when saying how good The Graduate's script is. The humour is sophisticated and has the bite of a dry martini.CINEMATOGRAPHY- The Graduate also benefits hugely from having beautiful cinematography, and it is quite innovative too. It also has a sense of visual irony about it, especially in the scene where Hoffmann runs to the church.SOUNDTRACK- Maybe I am biased because I am very fond of Simon and Gunfunkel. In The Graduate, the soundtrack is so moving and beautiful, perfectly captures the mood of disaffected youth seething beneath the laid-back exteriors of the 1960s.STORY- The Graduate works brilliantly as a satire, and the story is never less than engaging and thoughtful.So all in all, The Graduate is a wonderful film on every level, one of my personal favourites of the 1960s that's for sure. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Here's to you, Anne Bancroft!","Anne Bancroft's recent passing brings ""The Graduate"" back into our minds. It was of course one of my parents' generations favorite movies. Some people may just think of it as a story about young Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) stuck in a weird relationship with the much older Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), but it really is more than that. It embodies America's move away from the innocent, prudish mindset that had held sway for so long. Obviously, Ben is learning about sex from Mrs. Robinson, and then gets interested in her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). The movie also makes an interesting use of telling us things without anyone talking: in one scene, Ben unbuttons his shirt, which says as much as any words could have. As IMDb.com noted, none of the adults had first names, a reference to the ubiquitous generation gap. Anyway, 1967 was certainly the year in which American movies made a giant step into the new mold, with ""The Graduate"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""In the Heat of the Night"" (some people might also include ""To Sir with Love"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner""). ""Sound of Silence"" may have been ""The Graduate""'s theme song, but the movie itself will never go silent.Oh, and one more thing. It appears that two ""Bewitched"" cast members appeared in ""The Graduate"": Alice Ghostley (Esmerelda) and Marion Lorne (Aunt Clara). Although they never appeared together in any ""Bewitched"" episodes on account of Lorne dying before Ghostley joined the cast, I now have to imagine Esmerelda and Aunt Clara telling Samantha of a strange young man's relationship with an older woman.

"Fools, dancing around in a vicious circle","Young Benjamin Braddock (Dusting Hoffman) has just graduated from college, but now he doesn't seem to know what to do with his life. His parents are not of much help, being more interested in climbing the social ladder and having him help them along as the perfect, dutiful son.Enter Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), an old family friend, with whom Ben begins an affair to relieve some of his inner anxiety. Later on he also meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).The Graduate could be seen as a romantic comedy. The plot itself, if a bit heavy, especially for its time, is lighthearted enough and the character archetypes on display are such that the jokes practically write themselves. Yet a dark undercurrent floats just beneath the surface, transforming the whole thing into a scathing satire. The song The Sound of Silence, by Simon & Garfunkel, is often played over central scenes, almost functioning as the theme for the whole film. And anyone who has ever heard the song knows that it's rather dark in its message, despite the light melody. ""Hello darkness, my old friend"" indeed.What this film is trying to talk about is being trapped in a circle from which you cannot escape. Ben's character gets progressively worse as the movie goes on, but you cannot really blame him, not entirely. You can see from his parents and from Mrs. Robinson and her husband that he's merely imitating the sins of the last generation. It's easy to see that he and Elaine could very easily end up just as shallow and empty as their parents. It wouldn't take much. And that's the horror behind the usual rom-com antics.A peculiar film. It requires you to look underneath the surface, to question the events that are taking place. And for that it needs to be praised.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Scourge of the Sixties,"""The Graduate"" scourges the shallowness of the sixties, kicks against its smug and sanctimonious middle classes: xenophobic, materialistic and spoiled. Mrs. Robinson is the epitome of the devil-may-care LA bourgeoisie and represents the darker side of America's American Dream that is sedated by pills, desensitized by liquor, mind dulled by television, sanitized by the latest Tupperware and gleaming colors to sugarcoat the humdrum of suburban life (Mr. McGuire: I want to say one word to you. Just one word. - Benjamin: Yes, sir. - Mr. McGuire: Are you listening? - Benjamin: Yes, I am. - Mr. McGuire: Plastics.). The adulterous relationship between Mrs. Robinson and Ben is sex for sex only and is cast in terms of indifference, coldness and vulgarity. Mrs. Robinson is like a beast of prey, hungering for sex, absorbing young men's bodies to fight off the specter of old age, hysterically suppressing the anxiety that it causes, keeping her young daughter, whom she regards as her competitor and therefore, adversary, neurotically at bay. The true love between Elaine and Ben, on the other hand, surpasses the tasteless, the absurd and offers hope of a better generation to come (Mr. Braddock: What's the matter? The guests are all downstairs, Ben, waiting to see you. Benjamin: Look, Dad, could you explain to them that I have to be alone for a while? Mr. Braddock: These are all our good friends, Ben. Most of them have known you since, well, practically since you were born. What is it, Ben? Benjamin: I'm just... Mr. Braddock: Worried? Benjamin: Well... Mr. Braddock: About what?

A Resonating Story!,"If there is one movie from the 1960's that my family loves to rave about, it's this film, the Graduate. I can see why my family loves this film. It's a coming-of-age film set in the time period my parents grew up. A childhood classic, my father would say. As for myself, a generation or two later, I found this to be mostly a great film. If I had a complaint, I would say the film is very outdated and it grew old¬Ö..fast. But the themes of post-college troubles are very much prevalent in today's world. I liked this film not only because of resonating themes, it's the movie that introduced us to the careers of a legendary director in Mike Nichols and a fantastic actor in Dustin Hoffman. I also liked the soundtrack created by the folk-rock duo, Simon and Garfunkel. Their songs are very catchy and easy to hum along to. Of course, now we all know where the song, ""Mrs. Robinson"" comes from.Mike Nichol's film is about a young man named Ben who has just graduated from college. His parents expect great things out of him. At a homecoming party, he drives the wife of his father's business partner home and he begins an affair with Mrs. Robinson. But things get complicated when he falls for a girl named Elaine. But Elaine happens to be the daughter of Mrs. Robinson!The film is very well-acted. Anne Bancroft does a wonderful job as the sexy, manipulative Mrs. Robinson. Dustin Hoffman shows everyone why he is a great actor. He kills every scene he is in. I think Katherine Ross did a solid job as Elaine, although we don't meet her until late in the film. For those who are fans of the 90's TV Show ""Boy Meets World,"" you may recognize Mr. Feeney himself, William Daniels as Ben's father.Overall, The Graduate may be a bit old and weary, but it tells such a wise story with great acting and fantastic music, that it's hard to not see pass those rusty pipes. As I said before, this film has themes that are easily prevalent nearly fifty years after the film's release. It's one of those coming-of-age stories that shall stand the test of time, even if only because of the themes. This is a very memorable film to say the least.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Entertaining, but Really Kind of Dumb","While this movie has become iconic, with the famous seduction scene, the Simon and Garfunkel song, and the unforgettable ending, it's still a bit ridiculous.First of all, Benjamin is a naive 21-year-old who falls for the mature charms of Mrs. Robinson, who, along with her husband, is part of his parents' social circle, but in real life Dustin Hoffman was 30 and Anne Bancroft was 36, so she wasn't all that much of an older woman. I'm guessing part of the reason for this (the rest being the talent of the actors, who both did a great job in their roles), is that if they had cast a younger actor as Benjamin and an older actress as Mrs. Robinson, audiences might have been bothered by the bed scenes. Having them be real life age contemporaries prevented that.Also, if the bored, unhappy, frustrated Mrs. Robinson wanted the fun in the sack her husband obviously wasn't providing, why turn to the son of people you play bridge with? She could have trolled the local college campus if she had it bad for young guys, or whatever. She had to know that, sooner or later, they'd be caught. (Unless that was a turn-on?)And can we really believe for even a minute that Elaine (Katherine Ross) could possibly be happy with a guy that slept with her mother? It may have been the swinging sixties, but she seemed more of a family fifties girl.There was one scene that's kind of poignant. It's when Benjamin wants to see if he and Mrs. Robinson have something besides sex, and tries to get her to talk about something, anything. She casually mentions art, and then she reluctantly reveals that's what she was studying in college when she got pregnant with Elaine and had to drop out to get married. The regretful tone in her voice when she said the word ""art"" said it all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Proclivity for the Unorthodox? One Woman's Response: Me Too!!,"The year,1967, was a pivotal year for movies. The Academy Award nominees were: ""Dr Doolittle"", ""In The Heat Of The Night"", ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and, of course, ""The Graduate"". These five films revolutionized the movie industry, and addressed social issues for adults (as well as children) which changed the ossified formulae for making movies. The innovate genre to movies in 1967 manufactured a mystique to movie goers, and cultivated an enlightening dynamic to the directors and producers of the American cinema. Esoteric concepts which were emphasized with these films, encapsulated the movie audience with socially clairvoyant philosophies. The implementation of the egalitarian dichotomy between social commentary, and ,paramount Hollywood film making, for all of these five pictures, accommodated a pique for movie productions in the future. The realm of creativity with these five films manifested a cinematic ideology which was a harbinger of Hollywood's ensuing years ahead. By the beginning of the year, 1968, ""The Graduate"" had a gross revenue which ranked it the third highest for any movie ever made in the whole history of major motion pictures! ""The Graduate"" was surpassed only by ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""Sound Of Music"". As it turns out, ""In The Heat Of The Night"" won the award for best picture in 1967. Winning the Oscar for best picture is always a rare and coveted accolade, however, the final assessment to winning the Oscar for best picture can be conceptualized accordingly: If a film wins the academy award for best picture, it is put in the category of films like ""Casablanca"", ""Best Years of Our Lives"", ""Ben Hur"", ""Godfather"", ""Deer Hunter"", and ""Forrest Gump"". If a film is nominated for best picture and does not win the Oscar, it is put in the category of movies such as ""Citizen Kane"", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", ""Network"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", and, what else? ""THE GRADUATE"" (This scenario literally being, six of one, half a dozen of another). What was the basic gist to the film ""The Graduate""? Men do it all the time, so why not have the shoe on the other foot. It is very possible that the script to this movie could have been motivated by the advent of the XYY theory, which became a sexual revelation for women! The elusive sophistication of Brentwood, swimming pools, one martini after the next, and the double-entente solution to quelling your boredom, all became acrimonious elements to surviving the affluent monotony of corporate, well to do suburbia. The director, Mike Nichols, who also directed ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever made, does a brilliant job at expediting the aggregate comical rancor in ""The Graduate"". This stupendously identifiable technique exudes Nichols' directorial genius all throughout the film from start to finish! Often times, ""The Graduate"" is ranked as high as the eighth best film ever produced in the history of all film making by the critics of AFI (American Film Institute). ""The Graduate"" was an integral part of 1960's pop culture, the sixties were a complex potpourri of taboo tenets of radicalism which inevitably erupted and wound up precariously influencing the American people in one way or another. ""The Graduate"" became an unprecedented executive class freak show for unconventional actions and capricious mannerisms. This movie's astute depiction of disconcerting and latent emotions serves as a necessary ingredient to fortifying the foundation of the entertainment curriculum designated for movies and television! The acting in ""The Graduate"" is phenomenal! Dustin Hoffman was impetuously perfect as Benjamin, the sexually befuddled and precocious misfit. Ann Bancroft was sensational as Mrs Robinson. Making a relatively impossible role look naturally easy to perform is a proverbial needle in a haystack, yet, Ann Bancroft succeeded very admirably. That year,(1967) she was up for best actress, Bancroft was a lot of movie critic's choice. Second, was Faye Dunaway for ""Bonnie and Clyde"". The winner ended up being Katherine Hepburn for ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"". To say that the nominations for best actress were intensely competitive in 1967, would be a masterpiece of understatement. Other stars in ""The Graduate"" included: Katherine Ross, Murray Hamilton, William Daniels, and, even a cameo appearance by Richard Dreyfuss. Mike Nichols won for best director for ""The Graduate"", suffice it to say, this award for best director given to Mike Nichols was extremely well deserved. The Simon and Garfunkel music contributed to this movie in a very uplifting and auspicious manner, and became one of the movie's most memorable trademarks! The most poignant line applicable to this movie was from the song ""Mrs Robinson"", that would be ""Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes"". ""The Graduate"" became a flick which set a higher standard for the discerning criteria pertinent to the findings of all of the prominent American Film Academies. Yes, as this film illustrates it, a situation can be simultaneously funny and deranged! It boils down to Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) battling with the macabre repercussions of true love! Humour about an individual's blatant imperfections is one of the crucial cornerstones to Hollywood filmmaking, ""The Graduate"" epitomizes such a feat. See this film!! It is outstanding!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rebelliousness and reality...,"I'm not sure why evil, decadent Mrs. Robinson sets her sights on dazed and shy college grad Benjamin Braddock, son of the middle-aged couple she and her husband socialize with; it's never really explained, and neither is Benjamin's sexual past (it's hinted that he's a virgin when they end up in a hotel room together). It's also not explained why Mrs. Robinson definitely does not want Benjamin to get to know her daughter (she's angrily adamant about it, even willing to expose her own affair to prevent the two kids from going out for a drive!). Despite the gaps in the narrative and the lapses in logic (and taste, some might say), ""The Graduate"" is still a landmark film, crystallizing the helplessness of the '60s. Surprisingly, the ultimate theme of the movie is love--an impulsive, rebellious kind of love, but still the rather old-fashioned notion of love conquering all. And yet this brings up another question: is Benjamin really in love with sweet college girl Elaine or is she just a conquest? Or maybe the best thorn he can stick in Mrs. Robinson's side? Benjmain is told he cannot see her, he cannot have her, and that surely fuels his desire to marry her. The film presents love as the answer, but then (with an amusing, sobering final shot) second-guesses itself. ""The Graduate"" doesn't dig too deeply, it's lightweight (even with Dustin Hoffman's outburst in the church--the only time the movie gets some fury going), but it does take chances; it wasn't ahead of its time, it just came along at the right time and is still a relevant, glossy modern comedy. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece,"""The Graduate"" (1967) is a cinematic dark comedy satire masterpiece that effectively captures the complexities of youth and a common disillusionment among many following college. Directed by master Mike Nichols (best director Oscar winner), the film features a standout and breakout performance by young Dustin Hoffman as impassive Ben Braddock, a recent college graduate grappling with uncertainty about his future. His somewhat unique romantic entanglements only complicate matters, a lot. The film's iconic storytelling is complemented by its sharp, witty script (Charles Webb) and a memorable soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel, enhancing the emotional depth of Ben's journey. The cinematography (Robert Surtees) is equally striking, with innovative framing and composition that evoke the character's sense of isolation and confusion. The film's exploration of generational conflict and societal expectations remains relevant today, making it a timeless classic. Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross, Murray Hamilton, Buck Henry and others put in great supporting performances, and a very young Richard Dreyfuss also appears as well. This is a brilliant blend of humor, drama, comedy, and social commentary, making it a must-watch for anyone interested in the evolution of American cinema. Its impact on film and culture is undeniable, securing its place as one of the greatest movies of all time. Just one word...plastics!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

To the rescue comes the inimitable Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his next door neighbor. The affair that follows is one of the most comedic in cinema history.

Simon & Garfunkel's soundtrack is classic,"A classic? Yes. An essential? Not in my book.

Not As Good As They Say,"I was born the year The Graduate was released, but only watched it for the first time yesterday. I had heard all the praise, the hype, and academic analysis of why The Graduate was one of the greatest films ever made. I already knew about the Robinson affair, and even about the importance of ""plastics"". So clearly this film was influential. Otherwise, how could I know so much about it without actually watching it? I also kept seeing The Graduate toward the top of the IMDb's 50 Most Popular Comedies, which kept reminding me that I must watch this film one day. Not with the same anticipation I look forward to each new Star Wars installment, but definitely with interest and high expectations.So I finally watched it, 37 years after it was released, and instantly recognized that it's not a very good film.On the positive side, the casting is excellent, and the acting superb. Dustin Hoffman's uncomfortable awkwardness at the beginning is genuinely funny, and holds your attention. And let's face it, who doesn't want to watch him be seduced by Anne Bancroft? But after a while this humor becomes nothing more than comic relief in an otherwise dreadful film that lacks a real story, and somehow manages to simultaneously trudge along like a dirge, while developing the story by introducing major changes almost instantly. For example, we watch the main character Benjamin stand, sit, lie down, stare and think about things that are never revealed to us for minutes on end, wondering when the story will ever get moving again. Then he suddenly meets a girl and decides he loves and wants to marry her after just one date. Realism clearly wasn't a goal here.Furthermore, the lead character, Benjamin, has no goals, interests, ambitions, or purpose. He's not fun, or intentionally funny. He doesn't exhibit any talent, and not much knowledge for a ""graduate"". He's a man without a personality, and when the film was over I was still trying to figure out what an older woman and her daughter could possibly have liked or loved about this character. Benjamin is a boring person.So what was the appeal of The Graduate? I suspect it was a sign of the times in 1967 that shocking audiences with a young man-older woman affair and dysfunctional families would result in strong sales and praise, much like ""All in the Family"" would do for television four years later. But ""All in the Family"" was really funny, and focused. Each week it made important points in a highly entertaining way, then the episode was over. The Graduate seems to make only one point: We are going to show you some social taboos you've never seen before, on the pretext of a deeper story about a young man who is disillusioned by America's growing fascination with the material world.In fact, it's really just a vehicle for showing a young man having an affair with an older married woman, in 1967. That's all it really is. And in the 21st century, that ain't nothing' new.To make matters worse, The Graduate has the most annoying soundtrack of any film I've seen. It is merely repetition of the same few Simon & Garfunkel songs. During one particularly tedious section of the film, the song ""Are You Going To Scarborough Fair"" is played not once, not twice, not even three times in a row. It is played four times in a row! And this is a traditional English song about a town in England, not the WASP suburbs of California. Indeed, the lyrics throughout the film have absolutely nothing to do with the story, aside from mentioning ""Mrs. Robinson"" in the title track. This is an example of great songs being thrown together to create an awful soundtrack.Director Mike Nichols won an Oscar, presumably for using some clever camera angles and transitions here and there. Yet I would think the primary job of a director is not to use innovative visual tricks, but to ensure that the finished product tells a good story in a compelling manner, keeping the audience's attention, entertaining them throughout, and leaving them with thoughts and emotions to deal with after the film has ended. When The Graduate ended, my only emotion was relief that this film was finally over.So with all due respect to a great cast, and to the warm legacy The Graduate has enjoyed, I cannot recommend watching this film unless you are mainly interested in the nostalgia. 5/10 (almost entirely for Hoffman's performance).",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Every actor is perfect. The story is amazing. The scenes are absolutely aggravating. A character stuck in personality is frustrating. And Simon clearly did not need Garfunkel.

Overrated comedy,"Perhaps I had too high of expectations for The Graduate because I knew before I watched it that it ranked #9 on AFI's top 100 Funniest American movies.

I actually would never think to classify the film as a comedy...it evokes more drama.  If you want to watch a masterfully directed and edited film, this is one you shouldn't pass up.

Disjointed,"The opening sequences are amusing and beautifully timed. Benjamin's effort to achieve a conversation with Mrs. Robinson is very funny. Benjamin's descent into his family's swimming pool is a classic. But once Benjamin meets Elaine and begins to pursue her, the film falls apart. It becomes spasmodic and radically unmotivated. There's just nothing between the two young people. Why he pursues her is unclear. Why she responds is incomprehensible. The only good two moments occur when Mr. Robinson feels insulted after Benjamin says that making it with his wife meant no more than shaking hands, and when Benjamin uses a broken cross to bar a door (to be more specific about that would be to utter a dreaded spoiler). This is a movie that runs of of ideas halfway through -- and we lose the glorious Bancroft as well!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Consider sparing your time and to stop watching halfway through,"It was a movie of three sides. The first half (or so) of it was witty and inventive, with great acting that made the story and the characters convincing. At some point I even started to believe Dustin Hoffman to actually be 20. The dialog was laconic (which I don't mind anyway) with more emphasis on quality.Lets call it the third quarter, starting from the big revelation, where the movie turned into a boring failed teen drama. At this point the occasional witty inventive tricks started to gather more focus that I suspect was intended. You started to scrutinize them more and they started to appear more pointless and embarrassing than before. And this development culminated at the end, where the movie became outright absurd.The soundtrack on the other hand remained solid all the way through.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Richard Dreyfuss and Harvey Keitel,"There is one scene that floors me when watching ""The Graduate.""  Toward the end of the film, Elaine confronts Benjamin in the room he's renting at the boarding house.  Suddenly the door opens and Norman Fell as the boarding house operator comes in.  The doorway is filled with nosy male residents looking in on the argument.  On one side of the door, a young Richard Dreyfuss announces ""Someone should call the cops.  You want me to go call the cops?  I'll go call the cops.""  On the other side of the door, Harvey Keitel watches but has no lines.Dustin Hoffman had gotten his break into film with a short cameo in THE TIGER MAKES OUT, as a boyfriend who, his back to the camera, dumps the girl Eli Wallach will spend the rest of the film obsessing over.  Seems only fair that a Dustin Hoffman film give a similar break to two future stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
the graduate,"What made this movie hilarious to me, (and probably most everyone that made it through the movie) was exactly what should have made this movie absolutely horrible to watch. Dustin Hoffman suits this role pretty well, being a very young, naive, and awkward college graduate. It's no surprise when his neighbor's mom, whom he has known for years comes onto him, he has no idea how to react. That is what i liked best about the film, was the cleverly written dialogue, and charismatic demeanor of young Ben. I also enjoy the negative take on suburban life this movie seems to have. There are also some beautiful camera work, such as the scene when he is underwater in the suit, or when he leaps onto his pool raft, cutting to him jumping into bed with the devious Ms. Robinson. What I didn't like however, was the gaps in plot line, and how this ridiculous situation just suddenly turned out alright and worked out for the better. There is no way Ben would ever be able to make sleeping with Elaine's mom, bringing her to a strip club, and onto of that stalking her all the way out to Boston, to ask for her hand marriage. And then he takes her away right at the fateful moment of her hand being put in marriage with some other guy?! The first half of the film has a lot of enjoyable moments, but I really can't make heads or tails of the second half.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Film That All Cinephiles Can Appreciate,"Truly fantastic filmmaking.A nearly perfect film. Hoffman is excellent. Aside from maybe a few problems with the story and some character choices. I think this film was absolutely amazing. I was never bored. The music in this film by Simon and Garfunkel is beautiful. Even though songs are repeated 2-3 times throughout the film, each time those song are played they just hit different and invoke a different feeling or emotion out of the viewer every time. Each time a song is played or repeated it feels like it was a specific reason or to invoke a certain feeling.The cinematography, camera movements, and camera angles are all masterfully done. The cinematography is used brilliantly in order to tell the story. The POV shots where Ben is watching Elaine tell us everything we need to know with just our eyes. There are a multitude of shots throughout the film in which the shots are composed in a specific way in order evoke Ben's feelings. It's among some of the best composed shots I have ever seen. There are endlesss shots that are just breathtaking, for such a simple story too.Overall, The Graduate is honestly an amazing film. I'm so glad I watched it. It's a great story with amazing acting, a beautiful score and some of the most well composed shots I've ever seen. It's hard to tell a story and evoke emotions just by the way you place the camera, and this film does it perfectly. Nearly a masterpiece honestly. Ben is also a super relatable character. I recommend checking it out if you haven't already, it's free on Amazon Prime. It's definitely worth your time. This film is also one of the films that had the biggest influence on Hollywood during its time, actually being one of the first films to start the New Hollywood movement, along with Bonnie and Clyde.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cougar On The Prowl,"I finally got to see The Graduate having never seen it when it came out in 1967. At the time this film purportedly spoke to the young folks of The Sixties. If in fact it, it doesn't say a whole lot for my generation.We've got a name now for what Anne Bancroft is, we call those predatory older woman looking for young sex partners cougars. She and husband Murray Hamilton haven't been having much of a sex life for many years and she's not getting any younger.The question is asked by more than a few reviewers why would she choose the sexually inexperienced Dustin Hoffman, son of a couple that she and Hamilton socialize with. To me the answer is that part of her component is control. She doesn't want some young lady killing stud around who might just abruptly leave because there are other fish in the sea. Bancroft wants to control and dominate the situation.In the meantime Hoffman is having problems with his own parents, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson. Daniels wants Hoffman to start job hunting and soon, we really don't know just how long Hoffman has been The Graduate so Daniels might just have a point. Wilson thinks it would really be nice if Dustin would find a nice girl and she's got the answer. She thinks that Dustin and Katharine Ross who is the daughter of Bancroft and Hamilton would make a proper wife.Here's where I have a problem with the film. Bancroft is one possessive woman and she ain't sharing Hoffman with her daughter. She's right though for the wrong reasons. Things like that tawdry affair that she and Hoffman have been having have a way of slipping out and that would just get too freakish for one family. Of course Hoffman being the dunce he is and feeling full of sexual confidence says he'll have her come what may.What may does come indeed.I don't want to reveal any more, but I think the ending that Mike Nichols has for this film is highly unrealistic, even if you just take the characters as generational symbols.The Graduate was a big hit back in the day and is considered a classic by many. It got Mike Nichols an Oscar for Best Director and nominations came for Dustin Hoffman for Best Actor, Anne Bancroft for Best Actress, Katharine Ross for Best Supporting Actress, Best Picture, and a few others. No one would argue that The Graduate isn't a well made film, I'm just not crazy about the message it sends.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Embarrassingly dated and unrealistic,"That idea that anyone could love a disturbing stalker or fall for someone who has the personality , charisma and sex appeal of a rotten vegetable like Benjamin are just two of the many reasons i find this films enduring celebration hard to understand.Characters that were naive and easily manipulated one minute become manipulative and conniving the next and vica-versa as often as the contrived story requires.Iconic as the soundtrack is, i laughed as the song Scarborough Fair played for the 7,000th time.This film has some quite repugnant messages at its heart and i'm not talking about it encouraging polyamory, adultery or it depicting people wanting more from life than 2.4 children and a house in suburbia; i'm talking about it suggesting you just need to stalk and harass someone until they like you and that if you can force a kiss out of someone well, there yours.It has aged very badly compared to other 'Classics', it is not timeless it is very much of its time- embarrassingly so.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Movie,"The Graduate is a superior feat of cinematography.  It is the unique story of a confused youth fresh out of college, unsure of his future.  Ellusions of The Graduate are still being made after almost 4 decades since its release.  Evidence of this can be seen in the numerous modern films and tv shows we see daily.  Good acting, directing, and musical scores together made this movie worth watching.The arrangement of scenes in this movie are striking.  In particular, the scene in the hotel when Ben truely begins his affair with Mrs. Robinson.  As the couple undress and make love, scenes flash through his mind.  The scenes join together seemlessly, Ben's symbolic actions in the pool link directly to his actions with Mrs. Robinson in their hotel room.The main character Ben, played by Dustin Hoffman, did an excellent job of acting.  Throughout the course of the movie you see a definate character evolution.  By the end of the film Ben actually seems to have found a backbone.  He came out of his shell.  Dustin Hoffman is a believable character, you can literally feel and see the change in him.The music for this movie is greatly different in one sense from most movies. Simon and Garfunkle performed the music.  They use only a few songs, but different version of it.  At first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but by the end of the movie I found myself enthralled by unique soundtrack.  All told this was a very well made movie, and I enjoyed it greatly.  I would recommend this to everyone.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Still hilarious, still affecting","""The Graduate"" has been part of American pop culture since long before I was born. The story of uncertain college graduate Benjamin Braddock, his affair with older family friend Mrs. Robinson, and his eventual pursuit of her daughter Elaine is now common knowledge, and the many upheavals of the '60s have come and gone. Despite all this, ""The Graduate"" is still emotionally involving, rather than dated. The acting, screenplay, and direction are all skillfully done, and overall the film truthfully conveys how it feels to be ""adrift,"" like Benjamin.""The Graduate"" is hilarious and painful, often at the same time. Some great humor comes from the satirical skewering of American culture (""Plastics""), but most is character-based, arising from Ben's awkwardness and knack for saying exactly the wrong thing.Technically, Dustin Hoffman was too old for his role and Anne Bancroft was too young for hers (they were just 6 years apart in age!). And sometimes it's hard to believe that Hoffman is supposed to be 21, but his performance captures so much of Ben's post-college angst, insecurity, and confusion, it's easy to forgive him for looking a little old. Bancroft is able to play older than her actual age, and more importantly, she makes Mrs. Robinson into a complex and human character. Mrs. Robinson could easily be a cartoon of a sex-hungry woman, but in Bancroft's portrayal, she is rueful, bitter, wry, and determined.""The Graduate"" has inspired many other films focusing on youthful alienation and anomie. But, in my opinion, a lot of those movies fail by trying to be ""hip"" or ""ironic"" or ""quirky"" to such a degree that it's impossible to empathize with the characters. ""The Graduate"" avoids most of this. Sure, the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack was very hip at the time, but the music always serves the mood of the film, rather than just proving that Mike Nichols listened to cool bands. The film's montages, underscored by this sweet, melancholy folk-rock music, have a surprising emotional power.The famously ambiguous final shot practically begs you to speculate on what will happen to Ben and Elaine in the future. In other words, the characters are interesting and relatable enough to keep thinking about long after the movie has ended. That should be proof enough that ""The Graduate"" is still an excellent, relevant, involving film. Go check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?","The Graduate is a true timeless classic that struck all the right chords. Benjamin Braddock is character that I can totally relate to and pretty much all the teens who had the same exact problems after graduating college. Dustin Hoffman's breakout role as Ben is a dead on impression. He gives a wonderfully underplayed performance, he got the awkwardness bit right down to that uneasy smirk and the deep lifeless stare. Anne Bancroft on the other hand, plays the legendary major cougar Mrs. Robinson. I have heard a lot of things about the character and my expectations for the infamous cougar queen were really high and after watching the film, my expectations were more than met. She plays the role like she knows it by heart and steals almost every scene she's in. Screw that TV show, Mrs. Robinson is the real desperate housewife.Another great aspect of the film is the soundtrack. Never have I seen a song used more appropriately in a film and The Graduate's 'A Sound of Silence' represents the problem and turmoils the characters face in the film. This is Mike Nichols' best film and easily one of my favorite movies of all-time. If you still haven't seen this, by all means watch it at any cost. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic for a reason,"The more and more I think about this movie, the more I like it. I watched this like 6 months ago, and it has aged well. First of all, this is the most 60s thing I've ever seen. The aesthetic is unparalleled. It just captures everything about what you'd imagine the 60s to be like. Second, Dustin Hoffman had a great performance (and his voice is way deeper than I thought after only seeing him in Rain Man). Third, this movie is just so much fun. It is one of the all-time highest grossing movies in the USA when adjusted for inflation, and for good reason. This is an absolutely essential movie to watch for EVERYONE, not just for movie lovers.

A Timeless Gem,"I accidentally cached this movie on TV and as I didn't have anything else to do I sat down and watched it. I'm glad I did. I've heard good things about this movie, but didn't know too much about it. Never the less I really liked what I saw. This is truly a timeless classic and one of the best films there are.Benjamin Braddock is an insecure 21 year-old who has a scholarship and a future a head of him. He just don't know what he want's to do with that future. He get's involved with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's partner and long time family friend. Then one day the Robinson's daughter comes back home and after spending time with her, Ben sees his life heading in a new direction.The story is great. It's a story that can be cute, funny, dramatic and intriguing. The screenwriter makes use of these possibilities and does so well. The story is well written and the characters are great. You get to love them and hate them and you get to understand their behavior. There's good drift in the story and you get interested and want to watch the rest.Dustin Hoffman is excellent and nothing less. His portray of Ben Braddock is great. I don't think I've seen him deliver such a performance ever (not in those of his movies I've seen). Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson is also great. She gives her character life (or lack of) in a great way. The rest of the cast also lives up to the leads and delivers great performances.Like several films in the 60's this makes use of songs that would later become radio hits rather than a classic score. It works excellent. I, however, didn't like the way they played Scarborugh Fair three times in a row with a couple of minutes in between, but it still does the job very well and the rest of Paul Simons songs fits this movie like a glove. It sets the mood and is something more to listen to then just a score. It's different and it's excellent. The other sound work is also very good.The cinematography is really a gem. The lightning is just nice and the composition of the shots are good. Only thing that pulls the cinematography down one point is some odd zooms that not always fit in, but that's not a big issue and apart from that it's excellent. The editing is also really good. There are some pretty nice transitions at one point and the rest of the film is nicely chopped as well. It's technically very good and very enjoying to watch.The Graduate is a timeless gem. I saw it and didn't think for one second that this is the 60's. The theme is timeless and there are no particular references to the 60's. That makes this move great and enjoyable still today and I hope for generations to come. This is in my opinion a movie everyone could watch and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
WOW!,"Many people who saw The Graduate on its original release, including critics like Roger Ebert, have misinterpreted the main point of the film. Ben Braddock is NOT a hero that is supposed to glorify the rebellion of the 60s generation. The viewer is NOT supposed to stand up and cheer after the final scene. Ben is supposed to represent the confused state of a college graduate stuck in between youth and adulthood. As best depicted by the scene where he holds the hotel door open for both the elderly group and the younger group, he feels alienated from both generations. He does not want to hear the loud music of the car next to him at the drive-thru, nor is he interested in 'plastics' or the materialistic pleasures of his parents.He has no idea what he wants out of life, and only thinks that marrying Elaine will be the solution to this problem. As the last shot depicts (which may be the best final shot in film history), Ben only seems to be happy for a few seconds after he and Elaine get onto the bus with no money, no prospects, and no certain future. In fact, Nichols cleverly uses Paul Simon's Sound of Silence, and drowns out much of the background sound to show that Ben's is in the same position at the end of the film as he is at the beginning. He has not found what he really wants to get out of life and is as confused as ever. This scenario is not dated nor is it only appropriate for the 60s, it can apply to anyone who is lost or has no idea what to do with his or her lives.Nichols' brilliant direction reinforces the complex exploration of confusion and uncertainty. The flow of shots after he first sleeps with Mrs. Robinson is incredible, as is his use of the swimming pool to enforce his entrapment. He effortlessly switches in and out of focus at different depths of each shot to emphasize certain characters and dialogue. It goes without saying that the performances by Hoffman and Bancroft are first-rate. Add Paul Simon's haunting Sound of Silence, Scarborough Fair, and the instrumentals of what would become Mrs. Robinson, and you have songs and images that downright haunting. As a recent college graduate who was not even born in the 60s, I can say that this film has not dated, and is deserving of its #7 ranking by the American Film Institute.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate is a totally unbelievable character,"As an overachieving college graduate, Ben Braddock is so constantly stupid and naive, he is just not believable. He is so spineless and childlike how can Mike Nichols expect us to believe that this wimp actually made it through college, with high grades, as it is implied throughout the movie and was a track star to boot? When this first came out it owned the Campus theater for an entire quarter while I was at college. Then, it seemed profoundly meaningful. Now, it just looks dated and is not the least bit entertaining. I just want to slap him in the head and tell him to wake up and find his cojones. How Elaine could be attracted to such a loser as Ben Braddock is the main mystery of the movie. All the adults (meaning, the parents) in this movie are such clueless drones they are just as unbelievable as is Ben. Seeing it again after 30 years was a mistake; I should have just left it in my memories as a good movie. The performances are excellent, the characters are idiots and the story is lame. Now, it is profoundly meaningless. What a disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"schmaltzy,unoriginal,unrealistic,un-classic piece of crap!","I can't help myself checking out IMDb's top 250 list every now and then to choose what to watch. Well I gotta say that I am disappointed again. I read many people who called this movie ""classic"".For God's sake what is your definition of ""classic""? One family friend, Mrs. Robinson, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he reluctantly does.Arriving at her home, she asks him to come inside. Once inside, she exposes herself to him and offers to have an affair with him. Initially flustered, he flees. A few days later he calls her and their affair begins. Does anyone see something original in the beginning of the plot? Then in the middle of the story he-Benjamin- falls in love with the daughter of the woman on their first co-erced date? Is there anyone among you who falls in love in the first date,which is especially a coerced one. And what is that ""romance comedy"" label anyway? Where is romance? How do you describe it? Romance is supposed to have some sort of ""exciting and mysterious quality (as of a heroic time or adventure)"" even if it is a comedy. So did I find something like that?

Great movie,"This was a prodigious movie which I essentially enjoyed, from the beginning when he was seduced to the very blank look on his face at the end. The movie conveyed a message about life and I felt it meant you only live once, so do what you have to do to get what u want; however the end of the movie is a bit pointless, on their behalf. He went all out for a girl he barely knew but loved so much. He basically stalks her around her school. On the other hand at the end, they both had a very confusing look as ""what do we do now?"" I found that to be pretty fascinating because he went out his way to get her and she ran out on the middle of her wedding to be with him. There are so many interesting more parts I would like to say but then again I will be spoiling the whole movie. Mr. Hoffman played a great character in the graduate. In all this movie was once again another attention grabbing movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Here's to you to Mrs. Robinson!,"In this timeless classic, we follow Ben Braddock on his path of self discovery. This came at the turn of the counterculture movement in 1967. The very early frame of Ben's head in a fishbowl is very symbolic, because that's how he feels in life. That everyone is on the outside, looking in on him, yet they've always controlled and dictated the way his lie was lived. When Mrs. Robinson came along in this Nichols film, she turns his fishbowl upside down. And the rest is past, present, and future-time history! The title song by Simon and Garfunkel is very important in the telling of this song, as it embodies a feeling. The stanza lyrics, ""And in the naked light I saw- Ten thousand people, maybe more- People talking without speaking- People hearing without listening- People writing songs that voices never share- No one dare- Disturb the sound of silence"" is the most telling. A generation felt silenced, and in desperate need of disturbing the defiantly curiousness time, to disturb the silence they were forced into. This film is so well made, and is, and will remain relatable for many decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Must see for classic performance,"If you want to see a classic performance, look no further than Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson, whose name became a synonym for a seductive older woman. The film's reputation stems largely from the scenes between Hoffman's Benjamim and Bancroft's older woman. These scenes are classic; pointed, funny and superbly acted, but the rest of the film is diffuse,and proceeds by fits and starts. And ultimately, Hoffman's Benjamin begins to seem more like a stalker with a case of arrested development than a college grad in love. Both Ben and Elaine act like high school kids and are so chaste, pure and mono-dimensional that one sorely misses Mrs. Robinson. Arresting cinematography, clever editing and Mike Nichols' direction help camouflage the sketchiness of the screenplay, though the trite musical soundtrack and the accompanying montages become tedious; the film seems to be marking time. The Graduate may not be the classic it's said to be, though Bancroft's performance is. It alone justifies this film, and Bancroft surely deserved the Oscar that went to Katherine Hephurn for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Hello, Mrs. Robinson!","""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?"" If there is a movie that can hit viewers of all age from this groovy decade of the 1960's, I would have to choose The Graduate. At it's base, the movie is a coming-of-age story and usually those kind of stories relate with people of all ages. The younger generation may be living through the same eyes as the characters in the story and the older generation gets nostalgia as they remember the days of old. In fact, this movie is a favorite of my family. They grew up in the era when this film is released, so they understand the struggles the character is going through. Also the movie is recognizable because it is a damn fine piece of art. It took me years to see the film, and I finally did so recently. It did not hit me as strongly as it did with my family or other people of their generation, but there is no denying how good the film is.I feel like I can relate to the film somewhat because I'm in the same boat of our main character, Ben Braddock. Ben is a recent college graduate, but is struggling to find a life after college. I know how he feels, because I have the same struggles in a much more competitive world. I can also relate to Ben's personality, because I had similar traits years ago. Ben, in the film, struggles mightily around females because of his awkwardness. Back in my teenage days, I had similar issues. Although I eventually changed and I never fell for any older women like¬Ö..ahem¬Ö.Ben does. But people adore this movie because of its very relatable themes involving post-graduation life.One of the popular things about the movie was its soundtrack. The film heavily relied upon folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel to provide the music, and provide the music they certainly did. One would say their most famous song is ""Mrs. Robinson."" Now you know where the song received its personality. Personally, I loved the music in the film but other people, such as the late great Roger Ebert had major qualms about the music. But everyone is subjected to their own opinions because everyone usually have different opinions about any single movie.This film follows around this kid, Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) as he joins the big, wide world after college graduation. Everyone expects great things out of him, especially his parents (played by William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson). At a homecoming party of his, Ben is asked to drive Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) home. Mrs. Robinson is the wife of his father's business partner (Murray Hamilton). After Ben drove the seductive older woman home, they begin an affair. But things take a sharp turn when Ben meets Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katherine Ross)¬Ö¬Ö.and falls in love with her. Now with two women in his romantic life with the affair unbeknownst to each other, Ben is going to have a lot of work to do.The film partly works because of its fine, naturalistic performances. Dustin Hoffman, despite being 29 at the film's release, convincingly plays Braddock as a shy, awkward kid who wants to take this time in joining the real world. Hoffman will become a big star, and this is the first piece in helping him do so. My word, I really enjoyed Anne Bancroft's performance as the seductive wife. She could have stolen any guy's heart with her portrayal. It's funny because she was supposed to be the older woman in the picture, but she's only six years older than Hoffman is. Those of you who seen the 90's sitcom, Boy Meets World, you'll recognize Mr. Feeney himself, William Daniels who played Ben's dad. He has some amusing scenes, and I particularly liked the scene where he forces his son to try on a scuba diving outfit much to Ben's chagrin. Murray Hamilton has a rather smallish role as Mr. Robinson, but I thought he did a fine job and likewise for Katherine Ross as Elaine, whom we don't meet until much later in the film.Mike Nichols was a well-known director who is known for his quirkiness and sensibilities in all of his films. He sadly passed away earlier this year, but he left behind a legacy of well-known works. The Graduate is his first feature film and boy what a way to introduce yourself to Hollywood. He does an amazing job directing this film and it's no surprise he won Best Director at the Oscars for his first film directorial effort. He told the story in a very crisp away and he never slowed down.The film works as a comedy and a drama, but its not funny in a way you would think. The comedy is more subtle, and that makes it refreshing. However, not everything meant as comedy I found funny. You can blame me living in a different generation for that. The movie also offers some unforgettable scenes. The very last scene with Elaine and Ben in a bus¬Ö..just a classic scene and quite funny. Just watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean.Despite how much I enjoyed The Graduate, not all is perfect. The film feels outdated. What worked in the 1960's doesn't always work well today. Some jokes are not as funny and on the technical side of the film, it doesn't hold up well. As one would say, the movie has rusty pipes. But those pipes still work perfectly fine. Thanks to the music, the performances, and the themes, The Graduate is a lesson that all young people should learn and it's a movie that still appeals to the older generations. I enjoyed this film, even if other people enjoyed it more than I did.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Victory of of Style Over Content,"Despite central miscasting of the roles of both Mrs Robinson - a part turned down in distaste by Doris Day - and of the title role, 'The Graduate' firmly established Dustin Hoffman at the top of the Hollywood heap; although he spends the whole film behaving like a spoilt brat.Far from being the fresh-faced novice straight out of college in Charles Webb's novel, Hoffman looks and sounds like exactly what he was: a thirty year-old runt who never once shows the slightest concern for those affected by his actions; least of all on Mrs Robinson, whose behaviour is obviously that of a deeply disturbed woman.The songs of Simon & Garfunkel along with Robert Surtees's photography create a unique veneer but they belong to a completely different film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Sixties Icon,"I am not able to grasp all of the significance attributed to this film by those who have personal experience regarding the 1960s, but I am able to recognize it as a very well crafted movie.

I never listened to much Simon & Garfunkel, but I am now inclined to start. The cinematography is excellent and varied with perfect examples of masking & a match cut plus underwater scenes.While the story itself is not that unusual today, it has a different quality to others I have seen from that period in time. Even though it is obviously dramatized, it seems more ""real"" than previous movies.

"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson","""The Graduate"" is generally considered one of the finest American films of all time. Originally released in 1967, it was one of the key films that heralded a changing of the guard in American cinema.The story concerns a recent college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) who begins an affair with the wife of his father's business partner (Anne Bancroft). Even if you haven't seen the film before you've probably seen parodies of some of the film's best-remembered moments, such as ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me"", ""Plastics"" and the climactic wedding scene.Yet, when I first watched the film I wasn't really that impressed, possibly because of my prior familiarity with the film through it's references in pop culture. It took a second viewing at a later date to convince me of the film's merit.The cast is well chosen, with Dustin Hoffman & Anne Bancroft perfect in their roles. They were able to make their characters believable even though there was actually only a six year difference in their ages. Katharine Ross isn't bad but not in the same league as Hoffman & Bancroft. Besides the leads there are also some memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of William Daniels, Norman Fell & Buck Henry.Mike Nichols's direction is top notch and displays many interesting touches throughout the film. He was a deserving winner of the Best Director Oscar (the film's only win out of seven nominations). Nichols also makes excellent use of the music of Simon & Garfunkel, including ""The Sounds of Silence"" & ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"".In my opinion, ""The Graduate"" is an essential film. If for no other reason, see it so that you'll 'get' the numerous references to the film in popular culture.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightfully Dry,"A Film Comedy that at its wits is as dry as a Martini and as a Film Romance it is as plastic as the lifestyle of those it criticizes. A sharp looking and creatively edited piece of the 1960's newly emerging, anti-establishmentarianism.This was a ""new"" way to use Cinema, breaking taboos and pandering to the moral shattering of its ""hip"" audience riding the New Wave of Artistic expression. A timepiece to be sure, its basic storyline of intergenerational sex and rebelliousness without a cause is not as easily approached today as it was in 1967.The second half and the unfortunately contrived ending are nowhere as good as the first half, but it isn't so bad that it ruins the rest. It just is a bit of a letdown and seems forced and faked. A shame because the best of this is not at all that. It is naturally quirky and overplayed somewhat to give it a biting, surreal feel.The songs, inventively intersected for the day, now seem overused, if not completely overdone. The performances are spot on and along with the innovative Director have made this a reflection of its time and should be embraced for its fresh, seductive style. But there is a definite weakness in the romantic part of the story and that keeps it from being a great Movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,The Graduate is a fun and exciting film filled with humor and romance. Dustin Hoffman's character is priceless as he attempts to avert one woman and pursue another. The audience can definitely see a separation of the generations as the younger aged characters do everything opposite of what the older folks expect from them. The cinematography is beautiful and Director Mike Nichols does an excellent job at creating thrill and drama. Anne Bancroft is my favorite character just because she is beautiful and she does a fantastic job at seducing her prey. The Graduate is a great film and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

"""Artfully"" Pointless","""Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?"" That is the only memorable line in the film. That is really the only worthwhile moment in the film. The Graduate is devoid of meaningful content. Its characters have little to no growth throughout the film and when they do change the changes make no logical sense. What the movie tells the viewer is happening and what the viewer sees are two entirely different things. Benjamin Braddock is supposed to be seen as a confused young man trying to find his purpose while being corrupted by an charming older woman who then falls in love wither her daughter.. Instead we are shown a weak willed little man who is taunted into sleeping with a cold old woman who then becomes a her daughters stalker. None of these characters are endearing. None of these characters make decisions that would rationally be made even by those caught in the throes of late adolescent confusion. There is some creative direction in the movie. However the long montage scene only serves to throw off the viewer's sense of time. And endless folk rock songs do not aid the films tone if they are way overplayed. This is a movie meant to portray the new generation breaking off from its parents generation. Instead it shows us a series of unbelievable bad decisions made by irritating characters whose nonsensical behavior makes them completely un-relatable or identifiable.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Sound of Silence,"It would definitely be a mistake to regard this movie just as a first hand love story. Not that it isn't! But beyond that it is a beautifully narrated story of a violent awakening from the lethargy and boredom of a ready-made life. I would say that in order to fully enjoy and understand the richness and complexity of this movie, one has to see it in the light of another movie, Antonioni's Blowup, made just one year earlier. If the ""awakening"" takes place there through the photographic art - the picture taken with the camera being the last open window through which one can see the real life - here its about the way true, passionate love can pull somebody out of the hypnotic reality of the daily life, which is merely a chimera. In both cases, the usual way of thinking about art or love is turned up side down. The art is not something apart and different from this world, a mere dream, but precisely the opposite. Its our only chance to begin to understand our inherent drifting away and apart. The same consideration applies for love too. Or, for that matter, only for that kind of love which is not reduced to making the time pass by.This movie its about disquiet and boredom. Its about the fragility of a very young and inexperienced Ulysses who finds himself at the beginning of his real life, and who inevitably falls pray to a much older Calypso; but in its nevertheless optimistic tone - unlike Blowup - its also about fighting off the suitors and finding the way home.",,Anonymous,Romance

"A film that still holds up thirty-six years later, though not to the fullest extent it's hyped to be","The Graduate, when released in 1967 (i.e. Summer of Love 1967), was a stirring, hugely entertaining event for the generation that embraced sex, drugs, rock and roll, more sex, more drugs, and then, for the most part, became what the parents wanted Benjamin to be.  That's the only reason The Graduate doesn't hold up like Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, or Five Easy Pieces- Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock, while as keen and funny an uneasy and unsure young man can get, isn't exactly a representation of a time capsule of the angst, rebellion, and freedom of characters like Wyatt and Billy or Robert Dupea.  He's more of a representation of the common suburbanite male , who feels all the pressure of parents and their friends, and is in the conflicts of love, lust, and livelihood.  It's questionable whether or not Benjamin would leave the comfort of the pool he dwells in for free-love concerts and LSD.And yet, Oscar winning director Mike Nichols realizes that the story of the torn young man is prime for certain experimentation, not only in the dialog and mannerisms of his actors (which, especially from Hoffman, are hilarious), but from the techniques he uses in Robert Surtees' camera-work and Sam O'Steen's editing tricks.  Most notable of these techniques are the following: the subliminal nudity when Mrs. Robinson first ""reveals"" herself to Benjamin, the mis-en-scene/positions of the characters in certain scenes and moments (i.e. when Elaine finds out about the affair and Mrs. Robinson says ""Goodbye, Benjamin"", look how the camera pulls back on her and how she's a complete 180 from how she was in the first seduction); a jump cut from a swim in the pool to a moment in bed that's up there on the list with the bone turning into the ship in 2001; the way the over-head shots on Benjamin when he's at the college how he seems dwarfed among the rest of the world; and one of the finest climaxes of the sixties with the quick close ups of the attendees mouthing their curses and slander at the frantic Benjamin on the window.  As a film in and of itself, there's much to look for in repeat viewings that give extra hints on some emotions or intentions from the director or writer.And then there are the performances.  Hoffman, as mentioned, is splendid in how he balances between stingy and awkward, scared and determined, and that he's the center-point in a largely first person (late) coming of age tale. And his counterpart for nearly half of the movie, Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, has a balancing act of her own- she can be alluring, demanding, sweet (with a vodka in hand), and sour, and in that sense she's the most fascinating character of the film.  She has the persona of a stern mother who's wanting to feel a little rebellious herself, and finds moments of relief with the son of her best friends.  The one performance that doesn't work today or back in the day for that matter, however, is Katharine Ross' Elaine Robinson.  While she's not like her mother, she is at her will before and after she finds out about a secret she's been hiding.  She's set to marry a blonde jock, and, until the climax, is like a puppet.  It's the least convincing character and performance of the lot, and a certain scream she has in a scene is a little too scathing for comfort.  Murray Hamilton (of Jaws fame), for the short amount of time he's on screen, is near impecable.So, would I reccommend The Graduate for younger audiences?  Yes I would, it has the classic comedy-of-manners that is instantly recognizable, in particular as an influence on the American Pie movies (coincidentally, Jason Biggs portrayed Benjamin on Broadway), and is a good starter for those who have an interest in what the old man and old lady were watching when cool was solid.  Would I reccommend it for those from the generation that cherished it and made it part of American film history?  Hard to say and here's why, some may wonder why they enjoyed it so much when the characters may have lost their ""edge"", and others will love it as much as they did when it first premiered.  I'd say it's worth the view, if only for the wedding scene, and for those three little diddies by Simon and Garfunkel.  Grade: A (like a 93 or 94)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A parable for the time, a truly funny drama, and brilliance dripping from every scene.","The Graduate (1967)Dustin Hoffman is beyond astonishing here. I mean, everyone is great in their parts, and the older generation in the 1960s is captured too well for words, the falseness, the materialism. But young Hoffman as awkward, yearning Ben, with a foot in old and new generations (it's 1967 and he's no hippie, but he longs to break away), makes you really feel his entrapment, and his liberation by the end. And Anne Bancroft is easily his equal, as an actress, and her own entrapment as the well-to-do and unhappy Mrs. Robinson, and her ability to lever a way free, is also palpable. All of this is a marvel to watch.It's so easy to like the plot of this film, some of the other innovations get lost, like the lighting, which is daring and beautiful with its willingness to avoid mere prettiness. When the father is scolding Ben in the pool, the sunlight glares behind his head. When Ben and Mrs. Robinson are in the hotel room, whole scenes go on in darkness and we only listen. The photography overall uses this lighting and extends the takes to an almost uncanny extent, so that conversations go on very long--many minutes--with seeming directorial ease (and therefore growing tension in the frame).The writing, too, is masterful. The plot is wild enough for its time, or ours, and is handled with such matter of factness (old woman seducing a completely wile-less younger man, really now). But it's funny! Really really funny. Director Mike Nichols started as a comedian of course, partnered with Elaine Mays, and the subtle, deft handling of unlikely comebacks is both realistic and hilarious and fraught with anxiety. He's one of those directors who understands human interaction, dialog as well as silence, with vivid, subtle keenness (he made many other actor's films, the breathtaking Closer and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf for starters). Nichols uses Hoffman most of all to lead us through the topsy turvy plot.You can't forget the social commentary here, one of the best illustrations of a generation breaking free and the reasons why. It's about the generation gap, about finding what matters beyond materialism. It's about young people having enough money to not worry about survival. It's about true love without calculation, whatever the impulsiveness, and whatever the prospects of their success as a couple. And all of this is done without preachiness (notice the cross in the almost last scene) and without emotional distance. Remember, this was filmed while it was happening--the 60s are still unfinished, and their meaning undigested. There is, thankfully, no nostalgia.I've seen this film several times over the years, but it has been awhile, and I was prepared to find holes in it, or a flagging pace, or something imperfect. And I didn't. Do I like Katherine Ross in particular as the girlfriend-to-be? Not really, but she's a type that makes sense for the year. Is the music plugged in and out logically or elegantly? Well, Simon and Garfunkle's attitude and introspection makes sense, adding to the mood perfectly, and it is fit into some of the scenes like a choreographed film score (as when the car runs out of gas). Fans will note that the versions of Mrs. Robinson are very different than the album releases. But songs are repeated, sometimes a lot, and you wonder exactly why.But so what? These are the oddities that make the film more distinctive and, in a way, more memorable. Nichols, Bancroft, and Hoffman, the little known screenwriters, and veteran cameraman Robert Surtees have made a film I'm sure is truly timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson","Mike Nichol's The Graduate is still as captivating and entrancing as I'm sure it was when it was released 31 years ago. Nichol's smooth direction (which he won an Oscar for) and the all round perfect performances by an excellent cast (including Dustin Hoffman in his first big role, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross) make The Graduate an unforgettable and emotional experience.The film follows Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who we first see returning home from college to a party(celebrating his scholarship) held by his upper-class parents. There he meets Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and they spark up an affair which lasts all summer long, that is, until Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) returns from college. Mr and Mrs. Braddock, and Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) are both pushing Ben to ask her out on a date, much to Mrs. Robinson's annoyance. Of course, what follows is tragedy and heartbreak.Not only is this film a gripping romantic drama, but a look at the 60's, materialism and love. Ben wants to be ""different,"" as it is obvious he feels smothered by everyone around him, congratulating him and buying his presents. Mrs. Robinson is afraid of aging, and prays on young Benjamin to feel alive again, and is afraid of her daughter, who she sees as a threat to her appearance. The characters in this film are all somewhat lost and looking for direction, and when they think they have found it they are actually far from it. Ben is lost in a world full of people worried about money, and Mrs. Robinson is afraid of aging. By the film's end, not a lot is solved and it somewhat comes full circle.Deep and meaningful story aside, the film boasts an outstanding soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, with the songs suiting the movie's theme, especially ""The Sound of Silence."" Nichol's direction is simply stunning, one scene in particular, which cuts between Ben swimming and sleeping with Mrs. Robinson is masterfully done and creates the perfect mood. I am not going to ramble on any longer, all I have said is not enough to convey how good The Graduate actually is! So I will say this: if you have yet to see it, see it now!!! 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dated and whiny,"If there was ever a cinematic epitome of a whiny counterculture kid bordering on satire, it would be The Graduate. Although his insecure feelings about his future and the clueless suffocation of the adults in his life are relatable for many, the extent to which he wallows in absolute nothingness is a chore to witness. The first half of the film, where he engages in an affair with Mrs. Robinson, shows the natural consequence of his inner emptiness manifesting as restless abandon, and the acting here is superb. Yet the second half of the film, focusing on her daughter Elaine, goes completely off the rails. The once disillusioned and awkward graduate gains a new purpose in life to repeatedly harass Elaine and somehow she falls for it every time, which stretches credulity and absurdly suggests that his single-minded pursuit of ruining both their lives actually turned out as a romantic success.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's just not likable,"I know The Graduate is a total classic that everybody feels they have to watch and subsequently praise, but I find the story very unenjoyable. I'm not a feminist, but it's so textbook ""every man's fantasy"" it's sickening. The protagonist is a floundering college graduate who feels the weight of the world's problems when he doesn't have any. That type of character gets under my skin; I don't find him easy to root for. Having an affair with a sexy, older woman who can show him the ropes is enough of a fantasy, but when he also romances her daughter, it becomes too offensive to like. In real life, he would be looked at as a despicable person. But, since he's in a movie, he becomes glorified?If you've never seen this movie, then you've obviously never been to film school. I saw it for the second time when my university screened it in the big theater. For the second time, I thought Anne Bancroft was beautiful, and I vowed to get a gray streak in my hair when I was older, but I still didn't like Dustin Hoffman's character. If you've never seen it and you feel you should, go ahead and rent it. I prefer the spinoff, Rumor Has It.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A romp from the sixties,"Watching a movie you last saw 36 years ago can be a disconcerting experience; disconcerting because so little of it is familiar. However I can remember how I felt about this one ¬ñ emotional memories seem to be recorded in stone ¬ñ and my reaction today is to a large extent the same as it was in 1968. `The Graduate' was and is no more than a pleasant light-hearted romp through the pretensions of the US upper middle classes via one of their bored (and rather boring) children. Of course back in 1968 I empathised with Benjamin, now I rather see Mrs Robinson's point of view. Neglected by her spouse, battling a drink problem, her beauty fading but her sex drive unabated, she just does what comes naturally. Seducing Benjamin is like shooting fish in a barrel, but Mrs R is not the sporting type. The relationship is both doomed and deeply authentic.The second relationship between Benjamin and Elaine is not so well established despite Ben's stalker-like pursuit. Elaine, though prettily depicted by Katharine Ross, is an ill-defined character and it's never clear what she sees in Ben. Perhaps the final scene in the back of the Santa Monica bus is the give-away ¬ñ she really isn't sure why she's run away from her wedding to the hearty medical student and Ben is starting to wonder whether his feverish pursuit of Elaine was a good idea either. They've kicked over the traces and gone for `liberation' (very 60s) but what next? A mortgage and a job for Ben in plastics or more likely with IBM (or if he were really lucky, a precursor of Microsoft) and a divorce after Elaine realises she has fallen into the same matrimonial prison as her mother?The odd camera angles and heavy symbolism look a bit hackneyed nearly 40 years on, but the comedy is not too ponderous and the film has a crisp feel to it. The better comedy is in the first half and things flag towards the end but Nichols wisely kept it to 95 minutes. The director was greatly assisted by two stellar performances, Anne Bancroft as Mrs Robinson of course, and Dustin Hoffman, who was just perfect as Benjamin the priggish bore, who finishes up causing an amazing amount of emotional damage through `self fulfilment.' As for the music, well, it's a great LP, but it doesn't always work well in the movie ¬ñ the excellent lyrics clash with the banalities of the script - the characters are seriously banal people.Well, here's to the sixties, Mrs Robinson, and Jesus knows they won't come again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Mrs. Robinson....an icon in American cinema,"This movie is very well respected and all that and I am glad it has a following.  It is a terrific movie but to be honest it went way downhill for me in the second half, when Mrs. Robinson is more or less out of the picture.  Bancroft is magnificent and should have won her second Oscar. She is the sexiest woman I have ever seen on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic!,"""The Graduate"" is one of my all time favorite movies. Mixing light hearted comedy with dark melodrama, it is the perfect film in every way.One of the film'd best achievements as a film is its ability to make the audience really feel for the characters. When it isn't being funny, ""The Graduate"" can be really, really bleak, and almost brutal to watch! I really showcases how a film can have an emotional impact on its audience. There were actually times where I needed to remind myself it was just a film. It was so engaging and I felt so much concern for the main character that I actually started forgetting I was watching a film, both of the times I watched it (I feel like watching it again sometime really soon, considering it genuinely is pretty entertaining).The film is also highly enhanced by a great soundtrack made up of songs by Simon & Garfunkel. The scenes in which ""Sound of Silence"" is played (all three of them) are really powerful, because of both the great song and because of what we, as an audience, are witnessing on screen.""The Graduate"" is a beautifully made film, as well. Some of the shots are very artfully done and, one is particular stands out. It is shown from the point of view of Benjamin, Dustin Hoffman's character, while wearing diving goggles, and proceeding to jump into a swimming pool.There's also some great montage sequences. The scene in which ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""April Come She Will"" play back to back is excellently edited and one of the true highlights of the film.This film is a true classic. Wonderfully made, with great performances, great direction and is just, overall, a genius film. It is an engaging, entertaining, emotional, funny, and classic ride, that even includes a bit of pretty smart satire on top of all that!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's almost unreal how good it is,"The fact that this remains so relevant, when it so perfectly satirized everything wrong with the 60's, is equal parts unnerving and a credit to how thoroughly it nails numerous of the darker aspects of us as a species. Every young person can relate to Ben, played flawlessly by a young and already talented Dustin Hoffman, whose troubles simply seem to keep piling up. More than a mere love story, this captures that sense of an uncertain yet steadily approaching future, not to mention the obnoxious situations that our lead finds himself in. The comedy that comes from most of them tends to be great, if it can be a tad annoying here and there. It never tries too hard, and it usually feels natural, getting laughs from stuff we can relate to. Bancroft is deliciously seductive and playful in her performance, without the character degenerating into nothing other than a sex object. Nichols the master directs it all brilliantly. The editing(as seen in the famous sequence that has been parodied and referenced countless times) and cinematography are amazing, with subtlety and smart camera angles and cuts. Superficiality, hollow values and the problems the generation gap causes, all far too prevalent at the time this was made in the environment that it depicts, are torn apart. The music by Simon & Garfunkel is beautiful and poetic, and the rest of the tunes are marvelous, as well. There is a little nudity and some potentially disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of drama. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Start - poor unwind - Doesn't endure,"The film is a must see since it was such an influence when released.  It is fab to see Dustin and Ms.Bancroft make this picture work.

But the closure and sudden love interest are poor crafted.Interesting, with charm. A classic, but not a great classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I just don't get it,"Having just watched ""The Graduate"" for the second time, I have concluded that I really don't like this movie. The repetition of the same three Simon & Garfunkel songs over and over became annoying very quickly.   Although I understand the symbolism behind many of  the scenes  and techniques  (i.e., the scuba diving, the disjointed perception of sounds and voices, etc.), they seemed unrealistic. Also, I found myself not sympathetic of, but rather irritated by the character of Benjamin. He seemed less like a fool in love, and more like a creepy stalker, and I started to wish that he would leave Elaine alone, for his sake and hers. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see this film as brilliant, or representative of confused, disaffected youth.   Perhaps I'm from the wrong era.

Review by ChatGPT,"""The Graduate,"" directed by Mike Nichols and released in 1967, is a seminal film that deftly captures the angst and disillusionment of a generation. The story follows Benjamin Braddock, portrayed by a young Dustin Hoffman, who returns home after college and finds himself in a complicated affair with Mrs. Robinson, played with sultry complexity by Anne Bancroft. The affair spirals into an even more tangled situation when Benjamin falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine.One of the film's most remarkable aspects is its direction. Mike Nichols employs innovative camera work and editing techniques that underscore the film's themes of isolation and rebellion. The use of Simon & Garfunkel's music, particularly ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Mrs. Robinson,"" adds a poignant and reflective layer to the narrative, enhancing the emotional resonance of Benjamin's journey.Dustin Hoffman's performance is a standout, marking his arrival as a major talent in Hollywood. His portrayal of Benjamin's confusion and frustration is both relatable and compelling. Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson is equally impressive, embodying the seductive yet deeply unhappy older woman with a captivating mix of allure and bitterness. Katharine Ross, as Elaine, provides a fresh and hopeful contrast to the cynicism surrounding Benjamin.""The Graduate"" also excels in its social commentary, capturing the disillusionment of the 1960s youth with the materialistic and conformist values of their parents' generation. It speaks to the struggle for personal identity and meaning in an era of profound social change, making it a timeless and relevant piece of cinema.Overall, ""The Graduate"" is a masterful blend of sharp wit, emotional depth, and innovative filmmaking. It remains a classic, not only for its technical achievements and memorable performances but also for its enduring exploration of the uncertainties of young adulthood.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Classic,"From relatable neuroticism to downright chaos, The Graduate is a beautifully shot, ground-breaking film which still manages to be a lot of fun. Hoffman is perfectly cast as the boy/man nervous about his future and spiraling in his morality, and the limited characters compliment his development excellently. Sweetly funny, the changes in behaviour and circumstance are interesting and engaging, keeping you hooked until the ending without being on the edge of your seat. Simon & Garfunkel as the soundtrack is excellent, although the repetition of three songs probably could have been done without, possibly with some others that fit the mood a little better in certain scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not so good, but good anyway","The movie tells us the story of a young student, that, just after graduate, is seduced by an old rich woman. Then, he will fall in love with her daughter, which will cause everything to collapse. The very famous movie of ""the graduate"", considered as one of the best films ever is, well, good, but I think it is not so good. The acting is very good, specially Mr.Hoffman, who was in his first film and is still stick into the movies! The soundtrack is also wonderful (impressive S&G) but that is the best things of the movie. The plot, who was controversial for the time, now is quite seen and it is causes not so great scandal. It reflects decently the world of the 60's, where the old teenagers found themselves that they had finished their studies but the don't know what to do with her lives, but the director does not spends long time about it. The beginning of the story, the seduction part are superb, and I realize that is because of this that the movie has so great fame, but while the movie develops, the rest of the story is not so well filmed and that spoils the result, and it makes a movie that could be almost perfect to a movie that is just ""good"", despite its excellent beginning,.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Top 5 Film Class Movies: FILM #4,"I am going ""Old School"" with my 4th favorite film from class with Mike Nichols coming of age hit The Graduate. A very young Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, an extremely shy and indecisive college graduate. He returns home with the pressures from his family and friends about his future goals (which he could care less about). The very attractive Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) turns Ben's life upside down when they begin sleeping together. The situation does not get any easier for the young man as he falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, despite a stern warning from the seductress.You would not know it unless you watched this film two or three times, but Nichols is a genius with the symbolism he uses in showing the confusing journey that is Benjamin's life. Framed portraits of clowns on the wall, the water motif, and the selective focusing are just a few of the now famous traits of his film that shows the goofy mannerisms and entrapment Ben has encountered. Hoffman portrays one of the finest ""airheads"" I've ever seen on screen. Not in the sense of someone who is dumb, instead someone who is always unsure and careless.This film is listed as a comedy, but probably will not provide the guffaws most would expect. The comedy comes from the relatable situations Braddock faces and the very odd ways he chooses to handle them. ""Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?"" Even this famous quote shows his unconfident demeanor and social anxiety. Nichols also shows his psychic abilities with Ben receiving the unwanted advice to invest in ""plastics."" Keep in mind, this film was made in 1967.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lightweight comedy-drama with end-of-the-sixties values and music,"A middle class college leaver returns home to start his new life, which involves having an affair with a much older married women.Too many landmarks and notables to pretend this isn't an important film, but new viewers may find that the hype more interesting than what appears on the screen. Like Woodstock, you didn't have to be there, but you needed to have been around at the time to fully understand.As is much noted elsewhere, the film plays out its best  tricks very early and we have a long yawn before we get to the memorable climax. The Paul Simon music helps us through the more draggy parts though and started a trend of using pop music to illustrate pregnant pauses.While Hoffman plays out many a youngman's fantasy, the whole thing comes off as limited and boring (sex yes - but not sexy!) Bancroft - as the seducing Mrs Robinson - is a lesson in non acting and is basically charmless. While a very good actress (especially on the stage), she seems to have a natural cold streak which comes through in all her films. Even for a women over thirty (Hoffman and Bancroft's real ages are closer than you think!) casual sex would be easy to come by. Why would a woman need to be involved with someone for sex that they otherwise had no interest in? Bancroft won an Oscar nomination for basically doing nothing but being enigmatic. And that is not to say unbelievable.While well remember and regarded, this film is more about Dustin Hoffman not having to do any more dish-washing and script writers not having to worry about including casual sex than making any breakthroughs. In fact it is only a boy-meets-girl story, spun out to  include the mother too...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly overrated. Really.,"This movie doesn't deserve to be on any Top 10 or 100 list, unless it's a list of Horribly Overrated Movies. Movies like The Graduate are why I don't like low-budget movies. First off, the sound editing is so bad that occasionally you'll have serious trouble hearing what the actors are saying--and not when it's intended for you to be deaf to the dialogue. The film editing is even worse, and it goes hand-in-hand with lousy jobs in the direction and shot selection categories. This is probably the worst feature of The Graduate because it complicates watching it. The angles of the shots often go so close up to the actors' faces that you can't tell if they're walking or standing still. It looks ridiculous. The way it's directed and edited make the film annoying to unwatchable. The script is also a mixed bag, ranging from weak to implausible (the ending is just plain stupid). And Dustin Hoffman's performance is NOT that good. Definitely not indicative of the talent he'd later show in Lenny and Rain Man. This movie is seriously overrated. Do yourself a favor and see a more disturbing movie. They're generally better done. This comedy was about as funny to me as The Silence of the Lambs.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The music was wonderful, and the camera work was hip and smooth, the film felt youthful, it felt lively and sexy and naive all at the same time,amazingly seeing as it's over 40 years old.The story itself was strange and a nice change from the Hay's Code era I'm sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is the twenty first century. Even Jerry Springer is now Ho-Hum. This movie was probably radical when it was released(1967). But the risque theme falls flat now.There are many other flaws in the movie. Dustin Hoffman does not come across as a star athlete for one. Also there is a jerkiness in the plot. Elaine mysteriously seems to guess that Benjamin is having an affair. Also Benjamin moves suddenly from avoiding Elaine to loving her and wanting to marry her. This is not even 60's.. It seems out of the 19th century.I did like some of the direction aspects of the movie. Maybe some parts are allegorical.

It's Been 41 Years And This Classic Still Feels Refreshing,"When the film opens with a depressed Dustin Hoffman seated in a plane and then standing on the moving sidewalk as the camera follows him, I immediately recognized a lot of myself. Then there's a sequence that shortly follows at a party where Hoffman's Benjamin is bored to death. He doesn't fit in with this crowd of people from an older generation. He just wants to get out. This is exactly how I felt at parties of my parents and their friends. The 60's is a crucial time period in American history. A time that brought and saw many changes. After watching 'The Graduate', I just wondered what it would have been like if I were a 20-year-old in the late 60s.Mike Nichols, with the help of Simon and Garfunkel's everlasting music, excellently displays the characters' inner turmoil. He lets the actors convey that through their non-verbal expressions and Simon and Harfunkel's songs wonderfully give voice to their silence. 'The Graduate' is one of the best examples of how effectively a soundtrack is used in a motion picture. The music is sometimes whimsical giving a gentle comic touch to the tense moments. The music is sometimes calm and quiet with only a flute playing, a man whistling or the simple sound of a guitar, so that it contributes to the mood rather than interfere.'The Graduate' is a film of few words. It has some great lines but, as I stated earlier, Nichols relies on the silence more than the words. He makes fine use of close-ups, quick cuts and long shots. Notice, the 'noisiest' moments in the film were the party scenes and Benjamin's birthday. The dialogues delivered by the actors are simple but what makes them outstanding and memorable is the way they were delivered. Who else, other than Dustin Hoffman could have made a line like 'Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.' laugh out loud funny? Moreover, Nichols also makes clever and funny use of symbolism. Note the scene where Hoffman is in a diving suit and we hear him struggling to breath, feeling closed and somewhat smothered in that suit and once he's in the pool he tries to find his way and then just stands there, under the open water in a moment's quietness away from his parents's conventional 'boring' lifestyle. But even with the underlying serious themes, 'The Graduate' is essentially a comedy.I can't picture anyone else in the part of Benjamin Braddock. Obviously the role was meant for Hoffman. Apparently Robert Redford was the first choice but I think Hoffman's performance just makes Braddock easier to relate to. He is sublime and he portrays the transformation and growth so naturally. Likewise, Mrs. Robinson was only for Anne Bancroft. The actress has a strong presence. She's sexy, classy and dominating but Mrs. Robinson does have a vulnerable side which Bancroft beautifully conveys. Katherine Ross is very beautiful and vivacious as Elaine.After 41 years since its theatrical release, I just watched it today and it felt so refreshing. I loved how it ended. The ending is a fine contrast to the beginning. The same music plays but here we see a happy Benjamin and Elaine heading towards their unknown future compared to the beginning where Ben's worried about the future. An immortal classic.",,Anonymous,Romance
I loved It.,"I had always wanted to see this movie since I had first heard about it, several years ago, but I never got to until I saw it in my movie class this semester. When I saw it on the movie list, and saw that we were still going to be able to watch it, even though it was later in the schedule, and we had already missed one of our small amount of classes, I was positively thrilled. I have always liked Dustin Hoffman, and, admittedly, I love some of his more recent work as well as his older work, but, I just think that he is a great actor. When I finally got to see it a few weeks ago, I was all eyes and all ears. I needed to pay full attention to it, because I had this great opportunity and I wasn't going to waste it. And I sang along with the songs that I already knew and throughout the movie, I could not stop smiling like an idiot. My favorite scenes were when he was a bumbling young man in the hotel at first, and trying desperately to hide what he was actually doing there, but failing to be non-suspicious, as well as the first scene that he has alone with Mrs. Robinson, which I thought involved some comedic editing and cinematography techniques. Overall, I was pleased with the movie, I thought Dustin Hoffman was great as always, and that he seemed to play his character very well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I recommend that everyone at least rent the film to experience for yourself all that is Benjamin Braddock and his very icy ""special friend,"" Mrs. Robinson. Finally, I believe that this film will continue to amaze and delight movie-watchers for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Here's to You, Mrs. Robinson","At risk of sounding trite, The Graduate is like life: comedy and tragedy are rarely far apart. This choice to never stray far from either side of the theatrical mask is largely responsible for this classic's enduring appeal. However, it's far from its only success. Fans of Wes Anderson take notice: director Nichols edits and shoots with bold experimentation for this sort of dramedy; jump cutting in time, slow shifting camera focus, and long takes full of brilliant acting punctuate this fighting-to-come-of-age romance that flies past the conventions of its era to sit alongside the best that modern indie films offer. Ben Braddock, a recent college graduate, returns home to find himself roped into an affair with older acquaintance Mrs. Robinson. We quickly realize that Ben is essentially a fish in an aquarium, with no control over any aspect of his life, as his dead-eyes blindly follow his parents, Mrs. Robinson, and society's expectations. Hoffman and Bancroft are of course phenomenal. Their characters couldn't be more different (Hoffman anxious and spineless, Bancroft cool and emotionally broken), yet they dance around each other with wit and uncomfortable believability. Tons of great moments and characters calmly ignite the screen, each filled with humor, awkwardness, and poignancy. On top of being a fairly on-the-nose coming-of-age parable, the entire piece is a giant critique of anything and everything (coddled parenting, youthful cynicism, stodginess, frivolity, romance, attaining happiness, even the idea of ultimate purpose). It recognizes that making decisions, even wrong ones, is an important part of adulthood. Yet despite its skeptical view, warm characters and strict honesty have allowed it to age with as much grace as bite.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Well, I want you to know how much I appreciate this. Really""","The Graduate is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw this movie for the first time in high school, and I've always just been drawn to it for some reason. Actually, the first time I saw it, I was really confused, but I still loved this movie. At the time, I never watched a movie like it. The subtle comedy was something I never saw before, the story through a lot of curve balls my way, and it's somewhat depressing; but this movie just has this hypnotic effect on me. Now that I'm older, I can see why I love this movie so much. I'm Benjamin Braddock. Never before have I related to a movie character so much. If you want to know what I was like in high school, just watch Dustin Hoffman's performance in this movie. I know exactly what he's going through. Feeling alone as the future approaches faster and faster, hoping all the answers will come fast and easy, making decisions without thinking of the consequences, and having a new outlook on life; this character is so identifiable, that it's scary. I also love the music and the cinematography. They complement each other perfectly. They really enhance the mood of the film, and make it feel so much more real. The movie also has a lot of awkward moments. I've seen this movie so many times, but no matter how many times I see it, those awkward moments are still just as uncomfortable. And why shouldn't they be? The film deals with a very heavy, very real, and very uncomfortable subject, so those scenes are very necessary. The scenes may be awkward, but hey, so is life. It's a great movie, and I really can't think of another movie like it. It has a great, subtle, dark sense of humor; it has very heavy emotions, the main character is great, the side characters are great as well, and it takes a lot of risks. It's another one of those movies from the late 60s that definitely broke new ground, and paved the way for modern day cinema. It may not appeal to everyone, and its unique style may throw a lot of people off, but to me, this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it'll always be one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Simon and Garfunkel, what can possibly go wrong?","Romantic comedy from 1967 that introduced Dustin Hoffman to the A-list in Hollywood. Hoffman plays Ben Braddock the 20 year old college graduate of the title. The story is based on his fears, hopes for his future life set amongst a backdrop of romantic situations with an older woman and someone who he falls in love with.The film has an excellent Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack that has you humming lines like 'Jesus loves you more than you know!' The Director of Photography uses some clever camera/lens shots throughout the film. The 1967 shoot oozes quality.

Dealing with content that is bold for its time complemented by excellent acting,"Reviewed August 2011A movie so bold taken in the 60s is an achievement on it's own. A right mixture of awkwardness, drama and entertainment value, Simon & Garfunkel, terrific performances including a first major role for Dustin Hoffman makes this movie special.Benjamin (Hoffman) just got graduated and was awarded a scholarship for his future endeavors. His family throws him a party after presenting him an Alpha Romeo. Mrs. Robinson, wife of his father's partner is at the party and requests Benjamin to give her a lift home to which he agrees even after suspecting her intentions resulting in a secret affair that continues after that night. Out of obligation, he had to take Mrs. Robinson's daughter out against Mrs. Robinson's wishes and falls for her.The initial seduction sequences by Mrs. Robinson sometimes felt a little disconnected but very entertaining nevertheless. Anne Bancroft was terrific in her role for most part except for a wafer thin part in the climax. Hoffman looked comfortable in that uncomfortable character. Katharine Ross fits well as the beautiful and shy teenage girl. Music is by Simon & Garfunkel and most of the movie features two of their best hits. The climax which is a bit dragged brought me mixed feelings which was out of tone compared to the rest of the movie.It's entertaining and bold and was a landmark for the 60s.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Benjamin Braddock is a recent university graduate who falls in love with a girl who's mother he's had an affair with in the past.,"I found this movie very comical, but almost too far-fetched that I couldn't enjoy it to the extent that I have enjoyed other films. The cinematography was great and the cameraman's ability to show the point of view of the character in certain parts made the film interesting. I found the scene where Ben took Elaine on the date to be absolutely ridiculous, for the mere fact they fell in love when neither of them acted desirable on the date. Throughout the film, Mrs. Robinson continually expresses how much she doesn't want Ben to date Elaine but never explains why. However it can be inferred it's because she has feelings for him herself, it is never clarified. When Ben follows Elaine to Berkeley, she accuses him of raping her mother, and by simply telling her this isn't true, Elaine believes it and agrees to marry him. This may have been the most far-fetched scene of all. No right woman would believe a rape cry to be untrue by simply being told it isn't. Perhaps the wild ideas of the film are what make it so enjoyable to some people. It was entertaining and kept my attention, but I probably wouldn't see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of great music,"What makes a bad movie a horrible bomb is when there is a waste of talent, money, props, and among other things, music. Lots of lame movies depend upon great music. None of the scenes in which the songs are heard even remotely match the moods of the song, not even in opposition. They just lay flat and meaningless, like giving the winner of a footrace a picture of Albert Einstein. It makes no sense. Of course this movie is dismal on its own. The lead character, the graduate, has an affair with his father's friend's wife, and his father's friend's daughter. Which makes for good locker room humor, but a boring movie line. But after the affairs, the character has a holier than thou attitude, and a complete disrespect for anyone he knows or meets. Why is he so angry? It makes no sense. And there's no reason to feel any emotion for him. None of the characters are believable, and none of them are interesting. Bad script, bad directing, bad acting.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This film being made in 1967 when the technology is not what it is today, there is no doubt about it this film is a work of art.","The Graduate (1967) The movie ""The Graduate"" was directed by Mike Nichols and released on December 22, 1967. The film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft is an incredibly made film. This film is Dustin Hoffman landed his first major role in this film where he plays the part of Benjamin Braddock. Benjamin is a new college graduate that returns home from college and has a love affair with the wife of a family friend Mrs. Robinson played by Anne Bancroft. Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson have a summer affair when at the request of his parents he goes on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine Robinson played by Katherine Ross, and soon falls in love with her putting Benjamin in the middle of a love triangle. This film is a comedy, drama, romance that's theme is a combination of love, sex, relationships, deception, and insecurity.The movie starts out with Benjamin Braddock recently graduates from college and returns home. His parents have a party at their house in his honor. When the party is about over Mrs. Robinson asks Benjamin to give her a ride home. Once they are at her house she invites him in for a drink. Before the evening is over Mrs. Robinson propositions him, she is straight forward about what she wants from him she wants to have a love affair. Benjamin is very nervous and is soon able to leave the house, but Mrs. Robinson's proposal of a love affair has him thinking about it. It doesn't take him long before he calls her and takes her up on the affair. Mrs. Robinson is quite forward about wanting to seduce him. Benjamin is a young inexperienced man trying to find his way in the world. Since he is young and inexperienced with sex he has some insecurities about himself and his life. At first for Benjamin he was flattered by Mrs. Robinson's seduction, but soon becomes ashamed of what he was doing. When they got together there was no talking they just jumped in bed to have sex. Benjamin wanted more than sex he wanted a relationship to go along with the sex. Although not talking bothered Benjamin it didn't bother Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Robinson is clearly comfortable with just having sex with Benjamin and is all right with the deception in what she is doing.The secret love affair between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson goes on all summer when Benjamin's father Mr. Braddock, played by William Daniels, encourages Benjamin to go on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine. On their date Benjamin is sure he doesn't like Elaine and at first tries to make the date miserable for her. After he succeeds at making the date a mess he feels bad when she starts crying. Something feels bad about the way he behaves and apologies to her and then they start the date over again. They end up having a great time and begin to like each other. Benjamin soon falls in love with Elaine and wants to marry her. He is determined to put his affair with her mother behind him and marry Elaine. When Elaine finds out about the affair, at first she wants nothing to do with him. Benjamin doesn't give up on her wanting to be with him. He starts following her around starting with going to the college she attends. Elaine resists him for a while even after Benjamin asks her to marry him. Elaine eventually gives into her own feelings when Benjamin comes to get her on her wedding day, she is about to marry someone else. Benjamin and Elaine run away together just before she is to be married to someone else.The movie ""The Graduate"" directed Mike Nichols has won an Oscar, 19 other awards, and was nominated for 13 other awards. I can certainly see why this film won the awards and is considered a classic today. I'm not sure it is the story that makes this film so great or the editing of the film. The filming, editing, and the music all contribute greatly to the effects of the film. This film is wonderfully edited, the scenes flow smoothly from one scene to another. This film is full of great scenes. The film draws you in from the beginning and keeps your interest to the end of the movie. There are many wonderful scenes in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when Benjamin walks out of his house, he is thinking about Mrs. Robinson, he dives into his pool and comes out of the water to slide up onto his raft. The scene shows him coming out of the water and starts sliding up on the raft and the next scene he is on top Mrs. Robinson. The next scene he is back on his raft and his father is talking to him. This is a great scene that shows illusions of what he is thinking or dreaming about. All the shots are put together to where the transitions of one shot to another flow together. The music in this film is very fitting to the movie's theme. Simon & Garfunkel's song ""The Sounds of Silence"" is a perfect song for this film. This song goes along with the mood of the characters in the film. The other of Simon and Garfunkel's songs ""Here's to you Mrs. Robinson"" is another song that goes along with the movie.I think Mike Nichols 1967 film ""The Graduate"" is a true classic and one that will be watched for generations to come. In the movie the filming, music, and acting all worked wonderfully together to make this film a huge success. This film is more than a good movie especially when you look at the time era in which it was made. This film being made in 1967 when the technology is not what it is today, there is no doubt about it this film is a work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless classic,"It was wonderful seeing The Graduate again, though I was slightly concerned beforehand that it might not have aged well. I was wrong. The 1960s period details now look quaint and only occasionally seem a little clunky, but the setting of late 1960s California adds hugely to the atmosphere. The script, acting, direction, photography, editing, and of course the music, are spot on, and the story, of misled and confused youth, up against parental and societal expectations, and hypocrisy, remains universal. The wit and focus of The Graduate has not faded. The casting was a dream, with Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katherine Ross, just perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies I have ever seen,"This film is from 1967 and now, more than 50 years later it still has a very current topic. What a timeless masterpiece!
Being born in the year 2000 I am 20 myself now and I don't think there will ever be a movie to which I can relate more. Besides the entertaining main plot it refers to many aspects of the verge from youth to adulthood. A lot of those references a very subtle and metaphorical built into allegories and dialogues which makes the movie all the more interesting and deep. Being 20 myself I can fully understand his feeling of not belonging neither to the noisy teenagers nor to the superficial older parents and their friends.
Of course also the performances by Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin and Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson are just spectacular. Furthermore the film is accompanied by the music of Simon and Garfunkel which just rounds the perfection of the film off.
I strongly urge anyone to watch this movie, especially if you are also in that weird stage of life between youth and adulthood as it is a timeless classic as well as being a turning point for the Hollywood cinema industry.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cool movie,"Dustin Hoffman plays Ben Braddock, a fresh-nosed student who has just moved back home to his parents' house after graduation. Soon after, Ben finds himself being seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), the wife of his fathers' business partner. Ben's guilt-ridden affair with Mrs. Robinson goes on for months before she forbids Ben dating her daughter, Elaine. I believe the theme of this film is about fighting for what you really want. Ben wants to be with Elaine and he is not going to let Mrs. Robinson's acts stop him. Although he had made a questionable decision by having an ongoing affair with not only a married woman, but also the mother of his love interest, he knew Elaine was someone he wanted in his life.

Great Job Dude!,"The first scene begins with the long take, and the camera moves following the main actor (kenesis). In the same time, the director opens the music with singing that is very appropriate for this movie in both content and form. I think putting the music with singing is a new thing to make a movie run smoothly, and it is definitely a way to promote the song too. In addition, the main actor has the character that is exact in the role of the movie such as his face or his manner that is the same with the concept of flat character. In the scene that the main actor lay down on the swimming pool we can see the switching between the picture of the main actor and the picture of water in the swimming pool. When the picture of the main actor is becoming dominant, the picture of the water is disappearing. When the picture of the water is becoming dominant, the picture of the main actor is disappearing. Moreover, the director use ""Ellipsis Tecnique"" to switch the shot between the room and his home many times. I think it helps to reduce the feeling of discontinuity between shots. After the main actress knew about the real between his mother and the main actor, the relationship between shots is not continuity(discontinuity editing) like his life that has no aim. Finally, he did something that is unpredictable with the brave heart that beat the audience mind, and the end of the movie finish with the same song with the beginning.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outdated but still a bit of a classic erotic classic,"This movie has gotten some good reviews and for good reasons. Movies like this shows that you don't need high budget or lots of actions to be enthralling and entertaining. Although it's a bit of a erotic comedy, except with a bit more erotic parts but doesn't go over the top with it. This movie is basically about a graduate that has a bit of anxiety played by Dustin Hoffman who is a bit confused and not all that happy and a bit disappointed about graduating although the people around him constantly congratulate him. Anyways his dad's business partner's wife Mrs. Robinson tries to seduce Hoffman's character and things lead to something more when Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine gets in the picture. I first thought this was going to be a very serious or weird drama, yes it's a bit weird but it turned out to be a bit of a light and yet erotic comedy. It's interesting to see young Hoffman in situations like this, especially since the premise takes place in the 60's which is an era I didn't grow up in. Although these types of movies seem to be constant now a days, but this movie gives off a feel of originality although it might be because it came out in the late 60's. This movie is very far when it comes to this type of genre and has been done really good afterwards as well. For it's time it really does make it a bit of a classic. What probably really makes this movie enthralling is how it goes in a direction where most guys can relate with, yeah the situations might be different but you can feel the character to some degree, well somewhat. Overall it's a bit outdated movie but it really is worth a watch, especially if you like watching these types of movies. It's not a brilliant film but it's a good one that is very watchable.6.9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The worst ""classic"" of all time","I watched this film and I wondered how.  HOW!  How could ""The Graduate"" be a classic?  This movie is a really dumb and utterly depressing piece of work. I decided to vote for this movie on the number of actual qualities it possessed.  The movie is deeming qualities of this film are the awesome performances of Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross and the incredible score by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkle.  Besides that, ""The Graduate"" is not a classic.  It royally sucks and I can't believe this movie reached the heights that it has.This is where I rant for several hundred words.  The real reason this movie bites is because of Dustin Hoffman's character.  He is a stalker and there is nothing beyond that.  I have no sympathy for him.  He is a brainless moron who needs to be beat with a chunk of cinder block.  He uses his second head as opposed to his first and that is really a stupid thing to do.  By doing that, he screws himself over as well as the woman he loves and her father too.  It is extremely sickening to see this.Another aspect was Mrs. Robinson herself.  She is evil and willing to cheat upon her own husband with a younger man.  She also blames the young man for the problems she has caused.  In my mind, adultery is repulsive and since she doesn't want to take responsibility for her own actions, it is even more repulsive.Thirdly, innocent people are hurt because the actions of the two aforementioned.  Katharine Ross' character is unfairly hurt.  She is dragged across hot coals in this.  In reality, she would have dumped the brainless moron and found someone else who actually cared for her. The scenes she played out with Dustin Hoffman were really eerie.  Realistically, she would have called the police and they would have dragged him away.Fourthly, the dichotomy of reality and unreality in ""The Graduate"" is really messed up.  At first, the story has an extremely realistic edge to it but the last third ends up unrealistic.  I was hoping that Hoffman's character would have been the loser but it doesn't happen.  The object of affection in the film finds it cute that her cracked in the head suitor is chasing after her.  She is an absolutely rational adult and she should comprehend that she isn't a teenager and what this man is doing isn't cute.  It is really deranged and beyond the norm.Overall, this is a sad excuse for a film.  It should never have reached the level that it has.  It is overrated, sickening, and above all wrong.  I despise adultery and I sometimes despise the fact that emotion overrules logic.  ""The Graduate"" give sympathy to a main character who doesn't honestly deserve it.  I wish the guy would have picked up his shattered heart and moved on with life but it didn't play out that way.  I give this sad film a 2 out of 10!  Thanks goodness for the sane music!Here ends my rant!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seduction,"This movie is full of seduction, sneaking around, lying, and relationships. When Benjamin gets home college, his parents have high expectations of him.

Ben finds himself in a messy love triangle with wanting to be with Elaine and not wanting to upset Mrs. Robinson, who is completely against Ben and Elaine dating.

A Sixties Art Film,"This film faithfully follows the story of the novel by Charles Webb.During the mid to late sixties art films were being produced by Hollywood as the family stayed at home watching television.

Also superb, in a bit part, is the guy who plays the desk clerk.On the downside, the hallmark of Charles Webb's works is that two people can be talking to one another and yet not communicating at all.

"In a Nutshell Masterpiece: ""The Graduate"" 1967 (8/10)","The Graduate...Here's to you Mrs. Robinson!40 years ago they made a romantic drama as fast paced as 21st century sci-fi action blockbusters. Starring Dustin Hoffman in his late 20s, The Graduate is a story of Ben Braddock (Hoffman), a recent college graduate who gets involved in an affair with Mrs Robinson, a family friend. Later on, Ben also falls in love with her teenage daughter Elaine, and there starts the complications.In many ways, the significance of this movie lies mostly in acting and dialogue. Having said that; there are three main characters that contribute to more than 80% of it; first of all, there's Dustin Hoffman who plays the lead role of Ben Braddock, picturing the ultimately realistic confusion of a recent successful college graduate, unsure of what to make up of his life. His tone, his gestures, his actions, his reactions, all showed worthy enough to gain his first of seven Oscar nominations in his career.Secondly, there's Academy Award winner Anne Bancroft, who plays sort of the center piece of the movie, in other words ""Mrs Robinson""; a hot, rich and strong woman in her 40s who finds satisfaction in trapping Braddock (Hoffman) in an affair. Anne Bancroft, a much bigger name then than Dustin Hoffman himself, was a necessary base for the whole acting cast to be built on, especially that the other two pillars of the movie were recent talents at that time. Bancroft has later earned a Female Lead nomination for her role in The Graduate.Last but not least, there is Katharine Ross who portrays Mrs. Robinson's teenage daughter Elaine; a young naive extraordinarily beautiful girl, who instantly strikes the liking of her mother lover Ben Braddock. Katharine Ross here excels in presenting the female equivalent of Hoffman's character, planting thoughts in the viewers' minds of what should and should not happen if they both had existed in a perfect world.Needless to say that if a movie's main reason of success is good acting, that we can only relate to a strongly genuine script. The Oscar nominated screenplay provided not only the complex reality in similar real life situations but also the blatantly realistic conversations that come with it. Now take that script, those actors and hand them over to Mike Nichols who's just made his directing career debut with ""Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf"", a picture that earned no less than 5 Oscars. If the first movie you direct earns you an Oscar nomination and wins another five, it's only fair that you win one on your second film, and that's what happened when Nichols walked away with his first Oscar for directing The Graduate and the only one won for the movie out of 7 nominations.The Graduate's identity is finally perfected by a soundtrack that spices its visual entertainment and takes it to a deeper dramatic level. Folk- rock duo Simon & Garfunkel's music fills up the film with various songs and background music from beginning to end. ""The Sound of silence"" has become a constant reminder of the picture for whoever watched it and the hit single ""Mrs Robinson"", which knocked off The Beatles from the top charts in 1968, forces whoever comes across it to recollect the whole Graduate experience, especially its ending.In a nutshell, The Graduate is a cinematic landmark of the 1960s with a directing Oscar win and 6 other nominations, and with a lead acting debut for legendary actor Dustin Hoffman. It is, without a doubt, an acting, writing and directing cinematic icon.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The pursuit towards fulfillment never really ends,"I rarely rewatch films I don't care for, largely because I rarely rewatch films in general. A movie has to be special or captivating to reel me in for multiple viewings. I usually have the mindset that there are so many films I want to see, I have to constantly tread new ground in order to hopefully see them all. On occasion, however, especially if a film is well-loved, I'll give it another try and attempt to see anything I may have missed. Seldom have I been as rewarded by such a rewatch as I was with Mike Nichols 1967 film, The Graduate. Following the point in time in a young man's life that if often aimless, that time immediately following college graduation, Nichols does an exceptional job at conveying the listlessness of spirit once ones expected education level is completed. Caught between deciding between marriage and graduate school while his parent's expectations pressure him, Benjamin finds avoiding the decision as long as possible to be the option he is most content with. Starring Dustin Hoffman, in a breakout role, and the incomparable Anne Bancroft, The Graduate is a thoughtful look at the expectations of others and the soul-searching one has to contend with throughout their lives.Just home from college after his recent graduation, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is ready to relax after finishing his studies and fill his days by his parent's pool. With no romantic interests or jobs waiting for him, his father pushes him to go to graduate school, and his mother encourages him to go on more dates. Benjamin comes from an upscale neighborhood, and the parents of his friends, all of whom expect him to further his education, wait to hear of a graduate school announcement, all of them except Mrs. Robinson. A friend of his parents, Mrs. Robinson is a beautiful and lonely woman who has a daughter near Benjamin's age. That doesn't stop her from propositioning him and prompting him to ""sow one's wild oats"" while he still has the chance. Surprised and startled by her suggestion, the inexperienced Benjamin attempts to avoid the Robinson's all together before eventually giving in to carrying on a tryst with the family's matriarch. Despite the situation remaining strenuous for Benjamin, as he feels bad for keeping something of this magnitude from his parents, the two carry on both seeming to be fulfilled in some way by the other. As time wears on, and Benjamin seems to be no closer to starting graduate school or getting married, his parents set him up with none other than the Robinson's daughter. This clearly throws a wrench into the lives of both Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, leaving the former no other choice but to begin making some decisions about his life.Perhaps, part of the reason that I didn't initially like The Graduate when I first watched it, is because I don't care for Dustin Hoffman. I can almost never get beyond him to enjoy the characters he creates. Interestingly, Hoffman was initially going to pass on an audition for the film because he was already committed to playing Leo Bloom in the Mel Brooks production, The Producers. So certain that he wouldn't be selected in the role as the suitor of his wife, Anne Bancroft, Mel Brooks released Dustin Hoffman to audition for The Graduate. As much as I may have enjoyed this more the first time with someone besides Hoffman in the lead role, I'm of course thrilled that this paved the way for Gene Wilder's first strong screen role in THe Producers. I appreciated Hoffman's performance much more this time around, as he seemed to embody the character of someone uncomfortably trying to make their way through life, seemingly unsure of anything.The Graduate begins where Say Anything...ends. Cameron Crowe's excellent directorial debut features a high school senior unsure of what direction to take his life after graduation. The Graduate begins with a long take on a young man with no direction who has just finished college, as he took the route that was expected of him. In my mind, a cinematic universe exists where Lloyd Dobler and Benjamin Braddock are the same person, endlessly wandering through life aimlessly. I anxiously anticipate a post-marriage sequel, perhaps dealing with the pitfalls of a dead-end job or unfulfilling career, I'm flexible. The soundtrack of Graduate is sensational, made up of Simon & Garfunkel songs, perfectly accompanying the mood of Benjamin Braddock. The film was also shot in a powerful way, with Benjamin's face, and the faces of those he communicates with, often obstructed excellently symbolizing the many things that hinder his life and complicate his decision-making.The character introduction of Mrs. Robinson is beautifully communicated thanks to Anne Bancroft. Embodying the perfect balance of unattainable eminence and fragile regret, Bancroft perfectly exposes both aspects of her character. Making herself at home in Benjamin's room where he retreated to for a moment of quiet introspection, Mrs. Robinson shows her strength and control over the situation. It is instantly clear to see that she knows exactly how her relationship with Benjamin is going to play out. She seems to feed off of his discomfort, never being setback by his initial refusal of her advances. Mrs. Robinson's character is fully fleshed out. She is disappointed in herself for giving up everything she wanted in exchange for the chains of matrimony and motherhood. Benjamin isn't the only one searching for something in life. Mrs. Robinson, who finds her motherly duties nearly complete as her daughter prepares to attend college, and her duties as a wife often ignored by her husband who seems to always be inexplicably absent from their residence.

I don't get it.,Boring movie from start to finish. I constantly read this movie was a cinematic masterpiece so I decided to watch it one evening. It was hard to get through. The characters had no depth and the acting was bland. Maybe it's better for people in the film industry in regards to lighting or cinematography but to a viewer as myself who simply watches movies to be entertained it was seriously lacking.,3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely One of the Greats,"Man did I have an awesome time watching this movie. I was interesting with this from beginning to end. Part of it was just because the story was not your typical love triangle type of story. This type of stuff is shown mainly on television shows and even if it is part of the plot in some movies, it doesn't hold up to what The Graduate did. At the time, it was an original story, and it's inspired many other writers to make stories like this.However, what really makes this film astounding are not the performances, not the soundtrack, and not even the story. Yes all three of those are incredibly well done and do help make the movie something unique, but what really stood out in a good way was the cinematography and editing. That's what made me fall in love with this movie. This movie showed things in a way that I could have never imagined. The movie also doesn't show your average scene with an normal shot. No, every scene was shot in a way that I wouldn't have thought of. If you are interested into filming or photography, I recommend you watch this movie since it also does a great job on the rule of symmetry.The performances were something as well. Dustin Hoffman had this performance that I was able to relate to because his character is timid and not a very outgoing type of guy. Anne Bancroft was very good too since she was very calm, gave a sexy vibe, and also was very intimidating at times. My only complaint about this movie is Kathryn Ross. It was just whenever she was in a tempered mood or just yelling in general it got annoying.If you haven't listen to this soundtrack either, go do that. Simon and Garfunkel made the music and it just has a lot of their classic songs and it's adds a lot to the movie.There are many pros to this movie. The editing and cinematography are definitely the biggest highlights for me. For some people it might be the original story, the great and subtle performances from the cast, or it might be the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack. This is definitely something that every movie fan needs to watch. This is something that I will buy on Blu Ray and watch it over and over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great use of cinematography,"This was a really great film because of all the work the cinematographer put into making this film something special. Something different for the audience. He used many different camera angles and techniques in this movie. For example when we see from Dustin Hoffmans point of view when he is in all the scuba gear and we see what we sees underwater while he is diving in the pool. They used different match cuts in this film and some reverse shots. And dissolve shots of Mrs. Robinson. I like how they used Simon and Garfunkel songs throughout the whole movie, I thought that was different than other movies. But the song Mrs.Robinson is a little different in the movie than on the radio. I think the movie really made that song popular. And I think Simon and Garfunkel became pretty popular to my generation because of The Graduate. I thought Dustin Hoffman was perfect playing the kind of awkward college graduate not sure what to do next.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,"The Graduate was an interesting film to watch it had a certain feel to it that I found appealing. It seemed almost a taboo subject, Ben just gets out of college and is seduced by an older woman. Then more plot twisting occurs turning the end of the film into something I could have never seen coming. The music in this film was very well done Simon and Garfunkel did the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" and it was a chart topping hit. The albums soundtrack is amazing ranging from Simon and Garfunkel to Paul Simon and Dave Grusin. The music I feel really helped create the mood for each scene throughout the entire film. The acting done by Dustin Hoffman was good, I definitely would not say it was my favorite of his works but he played the part well. On the other hand I really enjoyed Anne Bancroft's acting in this movie it was very interesting to see her in the light she was portrayed as a house wife looking for fun. This is definitely a movie I would watch again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Great!!,"I like this movie.  It shows how Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) struggles with his life and what exactly he wants to do with it.  And I don't think the Mrs. Robinson thing helps him any!!  An affair with a woman old enough to be your mother never does help a situation, I gather!  If the story doesn't sound juicy enough for you, at least watch it to see what all the fuss is about, with all the imitations everyone has seen!  =)  It really is an awesome film though.  Definitely see ""The Graduate"" at least once this year. Let it be your New Year's Resolution!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated,"I don't know if critics have a different sense of humor, but I really don't know how some films are classified ""comedies."" Take this film. There were two or three laughing-out-loud scenes, but that's it. At best it's a drama that, as a few others have pointed out, starts off brilliantly but fades out about a third of the way through. The problem is the ending, and what led to it, was inexplicable and cliched. Ben and Elaine had just a date, half of it probably wasted by Ben's cruel behaviors, before he decided he wants to get married. Despite Mrs. Robinson's warning against his going out with her daughter, I don't see how Ben's feeling for the her just dropped out of the picture. Well, actually, the moral is that when the man finds what he can have, he can and should go after it.That's the bigger problem with ""The Graduate."" I don't like being a morality cop but this films suddenly turned Mrs. Robinson out to be the villain, whereas Ben's role in the destruction of the Robinsons' family left no dirt on him. Elaine was also apparently not very mature - she easily agrees to marriage proposals.It just seems obvious this movie was made in a different era. Doing basically the same things, the woman is the villain, the man the hero. He gets the girl, she the blame.So is this one of the best films ever? Unless you're one of those Christian Coalition people, I'd say no.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Generational movie,"The first part of the movie isn't necessarily uninteresting but too heterogeneous, some scenes being very catchy and others a lot more flat, even long. But it's nothing compared to the second part where the script takes a turn for the worse, you end up enduring this romanceless, emotionless, unbelievable love story. Nichols piles up almost ridiculous scenes and you just don't give a rat's ass about the fate of the characters, who by the way are completely unlovable, especially Ben whose amazing corniness annoys more than it amuses.In the end, it's obvious that The Graduate relied on an anti-conformist aspect that probably worked well at the time in the 70's, in a context of evolving mores, but it doesn't have the same impact nowadays, therefore there is not much left from this generational movie except an undeniable aesthetic and artistic research from the director.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate Review,"This film is a fantastic piece of art that not only tugs on your heartstrings but also speaks volumes about the divide between the older generations and the younger generations. Many people of that time and even today can agree that older generations have a hard time understanding younger people and their interests. This theme is very apparent in the film and it makes one think about social progress and the role that younger people have played in it. In terms of the film itself Nichols does some very clever and beautiful things with the camera. He allows the viewer to not only observe the scenarios but also what the characters are thinking and struggling with. The acting by Hoffman is truly spectacular. He comes off as very awkward but this makes Ben come off as more relatable and funny. The soundtrack could've included more songs but the music that was in it worked very well. It made the movie very serious or very light hearted which made the scenes more emotionally captivating. All in all this film is a classic down to its core. It is a pure work of art that is beautifully filmed, scripted, and acted that deems this film as iconic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film that has an amazing feel to it.,"Throughout the film you get that feel of that everything has gone horribly wrong. The feeling of putting your face in your pillow and closing your eyes to try and find peace, but once you leave that pillow you still have those problems. This film is just fantastic. I love the music, the dialogue, but as I said it is that feel that makes this so good. Many films have tried to capture the films feel. Some have failed, and some have done a good job. In the end though there is only one Graduate. That delicious bitter-sweet taste in your mouth from this movie just can't be matched. The Graduate is fantastic movie that you feel so much you could watch it with your eyes closed.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hoffman deserved the best actor Oscar,"The Graduate was surely made to be a classic¬Öthe screenplay believes more in silence than in dialogues. I am sure most of the pages of the screenplay were describing everything¬Öthe camera movement¬Ösets and expressions¬Ö¬Ö but dialogues. You can see Rainman's Hoffman also in the movie. The treatment of the movie was the best thing about it. The story was simple but the way every scene is developed, it brings the best possible out of the simple story. The story at first looks to be one of a chic flick but the treatment makes it a classic. Simon & Garfunkel's music in the background also fill the silence well.The climax of the movie is also not what you see very often in Hollywood movies but goes well with the movie and it was fun to watch Hoffman in such a role. Watching it with a bunch of friends for double fun.",,Anonymous,Romance
Becoming dated,"I still enjoy The Graduate after all these years: many funny scenes, others poignant, and Bancroft so stunning. (A pity she died of cancer at only 73.)

Okay,"When it was released in 1967 and everyone had gone to go see it. The college crowds loved it because it was the first of its kind. It was a film that proposed adults were emotional sell-outs who thrived on being superficial and materialistic. The film is very creative in more ways than one. The first is the creative film shots that were filmed and the cutting of scenes and images suddely. The second is the sexual imagery which really keeps you on the edge of your seat and always thinking and wondering. I really liked how Hoffman's mother was deliberately made up to look like Mrs. Robinson and completely ironic for many reasons. Audiences were obviously very shocked yet intrigued by all this sexual innuendo and the lack of traditional values.It was such a huge slap in the face of traditions during the same time that society was questioning itself in the 60s, it certainly doesn't seem surprising that the film was one of the biggest hits and definitely created a new theme/genre in film history.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not great, but not bad","I have heard such good things about this classic movie, but I cannot say that I was enraptured by it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with fantastic acting. I just found myself constantly distracted, especially when they have the quick edits of when Ben and Mrs. Robinson get together. Ben and Elaine's romance is also a little far-fetched to me, it seems that after one night with he is completely smitten, and that's fine, but then he decides he is going to stalk her after she left him so that they can get married. I'm not saying that the movie was bad by any means, it was well done with some interesting photography, I personally enjoyed whenever he was in the pool because he always seemed to slip away to another version of reality. I also liked Mrs. Robinson. She was classy and sexy and confident despite all her life mistakes, her character was also very- well executed. The one thing that I did not like at all was the music! The soundtrack that accompanied the movie was definitely not my favorite. The Sounds of Silence and Scarborough Fair? No thanks. Especially the latter.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Doesn't Age Well,"The Graduate is one of those timely movies that doesn't age well.At the time, it probably did a decent job of reflecting the angst and worry of the young upper middle class.  Now, however, it seems very dated.  Its sense of alienation is pretty quaint compared to the problems young people have to go through today.  The scenes where Benjamin tries to win Elaine's heart are outright freaky now that people have a better grip on what stalking is all about.Dustin Hoffman has a lot of screen presence, which keeps the movie from being a total turnoff.  But the character of Benjamin is ultimately an empty one, and you strangely find yourself disliking his parents not because they're too rigid and old school, but because they're too pampering and soft.  Mrs. Robinson's explosive anger toward the end is the only emotion in the entire movie which feels genuine, and despite its best efforts, the film can't quite manage to squelch the fresh air that her rage brings to the stuffy set piece of The Graduate.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Mrs Robinson are you trying to seduce me?""","I watched this movie in my history of American cinema course and it was by far the most enjoyable film of the class. Dustin Hoffmann is as good as it gets in this 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols. Hoffmann does an amazing job of showing you what it was like for a college graduate who never really got to ""live"" during his college years. A truly great coming to age story and honestly now one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Anne Bancroft who plays the seductive wife of Braddock's fathers partner in business gives a performance for a woman that had not really seen before because of the stupid hays code. The use of cutting and ellipsis are displayed perfectly from frame to frame and adds a whole new dimension to the film. The use of the song ""sounds of silence"" is very key to the movie. It sets the tone for the movie and ends it perfectly, in both turns it signifies how in life, sometimes you lose the way of things and your stuck in silence trying to peace back what once was your dreams and ambitions.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Awkward as Hitting Puberty,"Wow, the sixties were an interesting time period. You've got the counter-culture Easy Riders on one end, and sweeping cougar trend starting with The Graduate.Mike Nichols knew what he wanted in this movie, and to sum it up in one word, it would be awkwardness. The camera's sense of space and character's sense of space during the entire movie was jarring and sometimes very uncomfortable to watch, but that's what Nichols was striving for, I think. You have Ben Braddock (played admirably by Dustin Hoffman) just graduating from college, and like so many other listless 20-somethings of that era, had no idea what he wanted. Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) of course had plans of her own.While mothers preying on young awkward men is nothing new nowadays, at the time this movie came out it was landmark and debaucherous all at the same time. Likewise, this movie was anchored by a haunting tailored soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel, and some of their best songs were written specifically for this film. Tracks like ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""Sounds of Silence"" add to the awkward coming of age in the movie, feeling comforted and uneasy at the same time.All in all, definitely a movie worth watching, if not for its racy content, then certainly for some of the best cinematography of the era.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sensational in '67 ... Disconcerting in '05,"In 1967, The Graduate caused a stir ¬ñ and understandably so. It went where, I believe, no one had gone before ¬ñ both in style and content. It is considered a classic and the music by Simon and Garfunkel definitely puts it in that category all on its own. At the height of the swinging sixties, I imagine audiences that were gearing up for the ""Make Love, Not War"" Hippy days, would have been applauding at the end.But is it a good movie? Although there's no question that many LOVE it, I have to admit that I'm not one of them. Perhaps I didn't look deeply enough into the symbolism ¬ñ who knows? All I do know is that at the end of the movie I felt as though I'd just watched something uncomfortably outside of reality and was left feeling a tad confused and more than a little bit cheated from the experience. In fact, I found myself shaking my head several times thinking, ""As if!""Many would probably argue that the charm of the movie is that it switches gears mid-stream. However, I found it disconcerting. Perhaps that was due to the fact that I had always believed this movie to be a comedy. Again, some would say that it is, but I felt the reverse was true. Although there were some quite humorous moments, I found most of The Graduate to be quite depressing. Even the ending, which should have been a joyful high point, left me feeling flat, due to the way the characters were presented in the final moments.I guess The Graduate will always be considered a classic and a milestone in movie history. No doubt it led to others, like ""The Summer of 42"" and songs like, ""Summer the First Time."" It earned its place in cinema history, and it is probably worth watching by most adults at least once. I've done that and am more than happy to just leave it at that.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Hello, darkness""","When the Motion Picture Production Code was abolished in 1967 every movie genre was irrevocably changed. Action pictures became bloodier, dramas became swearier, and romances became openly sexual. One of the earliest movies to show this change was The Graduate, a movie that pushed at the boundaries of taste not with smut but simply by showing who might be getting into bed with whom, and why.It's an interesting story we have here. On the one hand it follows a very traditional romantic story arc that can be traced all the way back to Jane Austen. Our hero is at first attracted to one member of the opposite sex, only to find the relationship unfulfilling, and find that the ""right"" choice was under his nose all along. The difference of course is that The Graduate is very frank about how bizarrely messy real world relationships can be. There is perhaps a bit of a 1950s-style dig at assertive women (the plot is basically An American in Paris if Nina Foch was Leslie Caron's mother). Ben Braddock makes a distinctly creepy lead man as well, conceivably only a couple of nudges away from Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, to the point where it's unbelievable that Elaine should fall for him. But the whole thing has such a sly, anarchic slant to it that it's enjoyable despite these dubious factors.The director here is a young Mike Nichols. Nichols is really good at playing with the images so that we only focus on the main characters. Often a minor character will appear with their back to the camera, contravening regular film grammar. Even when a character is more prominent, for example Mr Robinson or Carl, they are cleverly shot and lit so that while we remember what they do and say, we don't really get a clear look at them and they don't linger in the mind. Nichols is somewhat heavy-handed at times in trying to absorb us in the mood of a scene (the lengthy moving close-up of Dustin Hoffman at the party is a rather too artificial), but it certainly does the trick, even if it's headache-inducing at times. The precision involved can be exquisite too. The first time we see Anne Bancroft at the party, she might as well be just another extra, but she has a bit of clear space around her, and looks up just as the camera pauses, and thus we notice her, without actually realising yet that she's important.The Graduate also gives us some fine examples of acting. Ms Bancroft is the best, only marginally convincing age-wise, but certainly possessing of all the bitterness and frustration necessary for the role. Dustin Hoffman is deceptively quiet here, never really seeming to show much personality, but when for example he announces his intentions to marry Elaine he has the necessary conviction despite his quietness. Katharine Ross gives a decent turn too, having the most overstated role but keeping it within the bounds of naturalism. No-one else really stands out, but of course that is the whole point of Nichols's directorial scheme.When motion pictures became more explicit about sex, there was inevitably a great hue and cry from many in Hollywood's old guard. A lot of this was simple prudery, but others had more practical objections. Raoul Walsh for example, in his highly entertaining autobiography, says how in the old days all the tension was in when the romantic leads would finally get together, but in the modern era they will probably be shown having sex a third of the way through the movie, and that tension is gone. He has a point, but I think The Graduate puts forward a case for the sexualising of romantic cinema as something which makes the depiction of relationships more interesting, more compelling. It is, if nothing else, more true to life.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Classic,"First of all, I completely understand why this film is a classic. It's the story of a young college graduate, uncertain about his future, beginning an affair with a tempting older, married woman. It's an interesting plot, a dirty one. That's what makes it so interesting.Dustin Hoffman does a great job playing the character of Benjamin. All of his mannerisms, his words, his facial expressions work together to create a young college graduate perfect for this film. Bancroft is excellent in her role as well, as a seductive, bitter housewife. I really believe every actor did a great job in his or her role, I was impressed.Another thing I really loved about the movie is the soundtrack. I wouldn't say I'm particularly a fan of Simon and Garfunkel, but after seeing this movie, I'm considering purchasing some of their music. The way it complemented the scenes, the mood it set, was extraordinary. I really loved it. I always think it's cool when movies have just one artist making the soundtrack, because their sound becomes synonymous with the message of the film somehow. Every time I hear a song from a movie, I really want to go watch that movie, and I feel like that's what's going to happen anytime I hear some Simon and Garfunkel. I'm looking forward to it, it was really great. :) The plot is really interesting. I thought the film was only about this affair, but it evolved into more than that. It evolved into a love story, and I really was not expecting that. The only weird thing to me was how quickly and easily things happened or were resolved. Some characters seem to get a little crazy and obsessive by the end, but maybe that's just the portrait of love Nichols was going for. Hah.There are a lot of good scenes and filming techniques that make this movie a huge joy to watch. I was entertained the whole time and I laughed a lot. I definitely recommend it and would love to add it to my collection someday. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,In the beginning of this film i absolutely loved it. The whole idea of the college graduate coming home and hooking up with his moms best friend and the whole older woman idea. I thought Dustin Hoffman's character was funny. He acted so jittery and nervous in the beginning of the film. After he started hooking up with Mrs. Robinson he started to get a cooler sense of being able to go with the flow and not be so nervous all the time. Then things started to get a little weird with him starting to like Mrs. Robinsons daughter and wanting to be with her. Then he starts turning into a stalker and going a little crazy over this girl. the ending was a little bland it was like OK she ran away with him but now what.

Your parents are asking you, your family members are wondering, and even your other classmates want to know what you are going to do for the rest of your life. Not everyone knows and its alright. The graduate showed yout hat you are not the only person in the world that doesn't know what you are doing for the rest of your life. I liked how the director caught that.

This film shows a youngster's uneasiness and fear.,"This is a romantic film about a young man who graduated from college. In the film, first, at his graduation party, he meets the mature woman who is the wife of his father's business partner and has an affair with her. Second, the man's parents suggest to him that he should date with the young woman, who is the mature woman's daughter. Finally, though the man and the young woman are attracted to each other, the mature woman tries to separate them. I like the scene where the man takes the young woman away because it shows he loves her very much. In contrast, I don't like the scene where the man is having an affair with the mature woman. This is because I'm not favorably disposed toward an affair between a young man and a mature woman.

One of the most overvalued films of all times,"The great and classical soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel, a group of good actors and one of the most famous scenes in cinema history with Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman as protagonists cannot make up a poor, even lame plot, an incoherent and silly story full of holes and a dull direction and editing. One wonders how such a film could make its way through time to still be considered a ""classic"" and seemingly appreciated by a high number of people; maybe, for people in the sixties this film meant something, or touched something inside them or whatever, but nowadays The Graduate should long have been put in the bag of dated unworthy-to-watch films.

loved it,"Just a great film, and by far my favorite film I have watched yet in my American cinema history class. Right away you get a taste for what great cinematography your going to experience, the shot where Dustin Hoffman first arrives at airport and the camera stays with the his luggage bag for an extended period of times. Thats just the beginning and its gets better from there. Right away you also notice the great photography every shots lighting perfectly fits in with the scene. The editing tricks in this film are also mind blowing. The scene when he jumps on the raft, then it cuts to Hoffman jumping in bed with Mrs. Robinson, then back to him when you hear his dad voice. That was just one of the few examples of fantastic editing. The acting was also great in this film. Have only seen Hoffman before in his role as Rain man, I was already a fan but his performance in this may rival his performance in Rain man. Mrs. Robinson was just as good and I was even more surprise to see her daughter actually look like a younger version of her. The film was funny, dramatic, sad, shocking, and the list could go on and on. This film had a little bit of everything and thats is just part of the reason why it was so go. The film had a strong social message that at the time an entire generation could relate to, and the youth of today can still relate too. I related to it just because of the pressure I feel from my parents is very similar to what Hoffman was going through. Not only did this film reach out to youth, it show to parents that they need to be careful how much pressure they put on there kids.

She plays her character with a cool and brooding tone.My only criticism is the reoccurring theme song, but I am clearly nitpicking.

Ahead of its time,"The Graduate's (1967) release was a significant cinematically. The movie, unlike movies before it, discusses sex openly and depicts the life of a young man in a much more realistic light.

The film also shows nudity in quick flashes, which would have been unheard of only a few years before. The soundtrack of the movie is also ""more modern"", utilizing Simon and Garfunkle rather than the usual more classic soundtracks that seemed to be standard in older movies.

On their attempted 2nd date she finds out about him and Mrs Robinson and ends with her crying and running off.

Not A Classic.,"Mike Nichols directed this film about Ben Braddock, a confused young man trying to decide on his future in a society he can't understand, but instead becomes involved with the married mother of his reluctant girlfriend, and the various complications that ensue as a result.Dustin Hoffman leads a good cast, it has haunting songs by Simon & Garfunkel, is beloved by many of that generation, and even won Nichols an Academy Award for best director. So what's not to like? For a film that reacts negatively to the word ""plastic"", that's just how I feel about the characters and setting. Nothing about this film feels particularly real, certainly not the affair of Ben and Mrs. Robinson(Anne Bancroft) which not only isn't believable, it doesn't make sense, feels utterly manufactured and wrong. Katharine Ross as his girlfriend reacts to the news believably, but the ending will leave the viewer up in the air, since it, while dramatically staged, feels forced and unsatisfying. It just doesn't work for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Graduate Finding a Way to Spend his Summer,"This is an excellent film. It is written exceptionally well. The dialogue is funny as well as dramatic when it needs to be. The acting in the is film is particularity impressive. Dustin Hoffman is excellent as Benjamin. He portrays a young man unsure of how things will turn out perfectly. He also does a great job of playing a man who is hopelessly in love. The editing in this film is probably the most original part. There are some really amazing shots that fade perfectly into others. The famous scene of Ben jumping in the pool with his new scuba gear is purely innovative. I recommend this film to anyone, one of my all time favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One word PLASTICS. Doesn't begin to tell the story!,"IS IMPORTANT that you consider plastic in 1967. If you look around in the movie you may notice that there are very few things made of plastic in this movie. Most of the types of plastics have not been introduced yet that make up life today. Automobiles have very little plastic in them then. The soundtrack with the Angelic voices of Simon and Garfunkel are an undeniable element in this flick Could be described as a new style this movie when it was fresh, movies were mostly dialogue before this. It would be copied from time to time yet never become mainstream. COUGARS were also sort of new when this movie was fresh. Not now though Like plastic ,cheap and everywhere today. Wish I could come up with a neat package to tie this up with but I just can't think of one. This is a milestone movie,and while it was shocking when new I don't think anyone anymore would find it to be so. Maybe is enough to be the first as it pretty much was. I don't want to hang A name on it . Not sure it would help. I was twelve when it was new so it wasn't new when I saw it first.

A Dramedy Classic,"The dramedy The Graduate is a film from director Mike Nichols and stars Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross and takes place in modern day Pasadena, California.The film is about a young man, Ben (Hoffman), who just graduate college and is worried very much so about his future. But at his party to celebrate his graduation one his parent's friends, Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft), lures Ben to her home and tries to seduce Ben. At first she doesn't succeed, but then Ben finally calls her up and takes her offer. Their affair goes on for quite a bit until Ben just wants to talk to Mrs. Robinson for once instead of just having sex. Then Elaine (Ross), Mrs. Robinson's daughter, comes home from Berkley and she and Ben start to date. The tension builds rapidly and emotions begin to fly in this classic film.Mike Nichols deserves his Oscar for Best Director because of all the legendary shots in this film. There are so many, the first that comes to mind is when Ben says, ""Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?"". Another is when he is in his scuba suit. I can go on and on about the amazing number of brilliant shots. Another thing he did very well was make us connect to the characters, especially Ben and Elaine. I could feel Ben's nervousness when Mrs. Robinson is playing her little game with him and I could feel Elaine's humiliation when she was brought to the strip club.The whole cast gave fantastic performances. Dustin Hoffman developed the character into a true human that anyone could relate to by being nerdy, curious, and very stubborn. Anne Bancroft brought most of the laughs to the film in her iconic role as Mrs. Robinson. She was cold yet desirable and did a brilliant job of playing a woman tortured by her mistakes during her life. Katharine Ross was the girl next door and was absolutely wonderful, she was the girl that everyone would want to marry and will always be remembered for her performance in this film.The score of this film is just as legendary as the film itself. With music from the band Simon & Garfunkel, such as Sounds of Silence and the iconic song Mrs. Robinson. The music was perfect for the film and will always be something that the film will be recognized for.Overall this is a great film, I would say a weak 9/10 just because it is slow at some parts. I would have to say I would recommend this film to everyone, I personally believe this is a film that everyone must see before they die.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Career defining turn by Bancroft,"On the surface, THE GRADUATE is a story of a young college graduate who has an affair with an older woman. But look beneath the surface and this film becomes much, much more.Directed by Mike Nichols, THE GRADUATE tells the tale of Benjamin Braddock a recent College Graduate who returns home to figure out what to do with his life. He enters the film in a malaise and is paralyzed into inaction by no clear direction to his life. Taking advantage of this young man's vulnerability, family friend, Mrs. Robinson, seduces Benjamin but Benjamin realizes that he is in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine.Sounds pretty straight forward, right? But under the smart, understated Direction of Mike Nichols (who won an Oscar for his work), this film becomes much, much more - subverting the notion of love and lust while driving a narrative that shines a light on the generational gap between parents and adult children in a time of great change in America - oh...and doing it in a subtly comedic way (the screenplay was wonderfully written by the great Buck Henry who makes a cameo in this film as a Hotel clerk).Nichols, smartly, casts then relative unknown Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin because he was able to play the comedy of the awkwardness of the character (especially early on in the seduction/sex scenes with Mrs. Robinson) as well as showing emotion in emotionlessness. His Benjamin is empty - but not lacking of personality or interest - a tough tightrope to walk, but Hoffman plays it well and earned an Academy Award nomination for his work. His character does become...if I'm being honest...less interesting and more ""stalker-ish"" (certainly from a 21st Century perspective) as he pursues Elaine in the 2nd half of the film, so this diminishes this performance just a bit.Also earning an Academy Award nomination is Anne Bancroft who dons a career-defining role as Mrs. Robinson. She was having trouble with the part until Director Nichols reminded her that Mrs. Robinson is seducing Benjamin not out of love or lust, but out of anger at the direction her life has drifted. We find out that Mrs. Robinson was an Art Major in College but gave up anything resembling a career when she got pregnant shortly before marrying Mr. Robinson. You can see the seething anger and resentment in the way Bancroft performs this character, with just a tinge of regret. This is a woman trying to take some control over her life - by controlling her relationship with Benjamin. And, when Benjamin decides it is time to take control of his own life, she resents it and digs her claws in deeper. It is a tour-de-force performance, one of the all-time great female performances in film.The third side to this triangle is Elaine Robinson and as written - and portrayed by Katherine Ross - this is the most problematic of the characters. Elaine appears to be a well adjusted young woman finishing off her college career and is forced into a ""date"" with Benjamin at the insistence of Benjamin's parents and Elaine's father (Elaine's mother - Mrs. Robinson - is, understandably, silent on this). There is a good scene in the middle of the film where Benjamin and Elaine make a connection (which spurs Benjamin into his obsession with Elaine) but I couldn't really see what was in it for Elaine. Sure, there is the ""break away from the carefully crafted life that my parents have set up for me"" angle (and, surely, her desire to NOT marry the pre-Med student that she is engaged to lines right up with that) but I just didn't understand/buy her infatuation with Benjamin. Despite this, Ross earned the 3rd acting Nomination from this film.Credit all 3 of these performances to Director Nichols who finds the right balance in every scene along with an interesting visual style that punctuates the loneliness and isolation that Benjamin is feeling. Add to that the haunting songs/sounds of the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack - just about the only music in this film - and you have a funny, haunting and important film that is an interesting look at a time in America (the late '60's) where great change was happening and the ""Generation Gap"" was never more noticeable.One last note - I LOVED the closing shot of this film. Nichols let the camera roll just a little longer than the actors expected and the look on their faces change, subtly, from surety of their decision and direction to a more ""unsure"" look. It is a perfect, ambiguous, way to end and I applaud Nichols for making this strong choice.Come for the seduction, stay for the subtle humor and to watch a Director at the top of his game.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
the graduate,"the graduate was an odd movie. Finally a color movie. some of the things I noticed throughout the movie the music slowed down during the car scene, like when the car went through the tunnel. There were lots of long takes some of the long takes i thought were a good idea but some I feel made the movie slow down and made it kind of boring. the pool scene when he jumped in his scuba suit was kind of cool because they shut out all the sound which was a cool feature but when he was in the house he could here his father talking? this was strange.the sex scene was a little strange as well the woman started taking her close off and there were extremely quick flashes of nudity. when he started sleeping with her the lights would go out and you could still tell what was going on I liked that and thought it was a good idea for the movie.Each scene led itself into another which I liked. Think that he seemed very unknowing during the movie guess which is what it was all about.The las thing I nocticed was the running of cars didn't really sound normal to me they seemed to loud and really overbearing during the movie. The last thing I liked was the camera view through the glass table, I thought it was a really cool effect. Megan Himmel",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Analysis for The Graduate (1967),"This is another good movie that changed how people saw movies. This has some of the things that the studio system didn't have back then. The worst part about this film was the point where people saw some quick shots of partial nudity. I didn't like it at all, even though it was one of the parts that had excellent editing. The reason why I didn't like that part is that I found it way too disgusting for my taste. This is perhaps the movie that started influencing other films to do that. However, not everything is bad. There are a lot more good parts about this film. I love the way Dustin Hoffman did his character, the humor, the music, and the editing of the film. The rest of the film like the minor characters and more are mostly a hit-and-miss for me. Overall, this one is another film that you should see.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fantastic coming of age film,"I have enjoyed this movie more and more as I have matured and really related more and more to Benjamin. This movie has the perfect balance of humor and serious tone. This movie lets itself get into big complex issues and then inject humor into them in a way that makes all the characters more relatable. We can all understand where Benjamin is coming from and why he is so nervous, and the humor adds to the serious situation in a great way. There are lots of beautiful shots in this movie to really appreciate along with its amazing soundtrack featuring Simon and Garfunkel. The soundtrack really sets a mood and tone for the movie that is perfect. This is definitely my second favorite coming of age story behind Garden State.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A monumental and cinematic disaster.,"A monumental and cinematic disaster - I'm refering to Mike Nichols' so-called classic comedy ""THE GRADUATE"", which left me in a state of disbelief.  The film marks the first major film for Dustin Hoffman, who horribly portrays a uncertain college graduate who gets himself caught up in tug-of-war between his girlfriend (Katherine Ross) whom he loves than her seductive mother (Anne Brancroft) who doesn't sound very convincing - at all.  Besides that, I can't understand why this is a comedy and it degrades people.  If there was someone that I felt sorry for is Ross and not Hoffman. Not even the Simon & Garfunkel songs and Dave Grusin's musical score couldn't make me enjoy this wreck.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Movies Grow Up,"This is just a really great film, from the story which was one of the first films to show the generation gap that started in the 60's where adults and their teenage/young adult kids just couldn't understand each other from how they dressed to the music they were listening to, and The Graduate really shows this alienation that most kids felt during this era in American society.Especially in this one great scene when Dustin Hoffman is in a diving suit and goes into the water this is a great scene for two reasons: first it shows the alienation where he can't here anything (like he can't understand his parents)and he's alone all though he's surrounded by people. The reason it is such a great scene is that it's all in first person so you know exactly what Dustin Hoffman's seeing and there are no cuts during the shot.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hits Different Today But Still Works,"Lots of conflicting opinions about The Graduate but let me jump in the middle of all that (saw it in the 90's and here in 2022). The detractors say its dated and doesn't hold up well, but I say that it does, but just in a very different way. The affair between Mrs. Robinson and Hoffman is no longer shocking or breaking any barriers, but that's fine because as a story point is still works and in large part due to Mike Nichols direction. Some folks say the soundtrack is great and others the worst. I agree that many of the song lyrics don't seem to reflect the action taking place on the screen, and yet they still seem to work, perhaps because of the action/story dissonance. The mood and feel of those songs work and the lyric disconnect could be seen as a reflection of disconnect between the film's characters and their surroundings/lives. Yes, many elements of The Graduate are very much of the 60's but the basic story still resonated when I first saw it in the 90's and still resonates today.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A 60's Classic,"This is a 60's movie, so I have to begin by expressing appreciation for the 60's music. Three of the great Simon & Garfunkel songs are here: ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""Scarborough Fair"" and, of course, ""Mrs. Robinson."" It's interesting, though, that that last song really isn't the central song of the movie - that would probably be ""The Sound of Silence."" Those songs alone made this an enjoyable movie to spend time with. Songs aside, though, this is also just a really good movie - a must see if you like movies from the 60's. It's a kind of coming of age story, replete with family drama, comedy and great performances.Dustin Hoffman and Ann Bancroft are superb as the leads - Hoffman as the young Ben Braddock, just graduated from university and with no real idea where life is going to lead him, and Bancroft as the older Mrs. Robinson, a woman in a passionless marriage who seduces Ben. The seduction scenes are really quite funny. Hoffman did a great job portraying the awkwardness and uncertainty Ben felt as he found this woman, who has been a friend of his family forever from his perspective, suddenly looking to him for more than just friendship. There's a lot of sensitively funny material in the first hour of the movie, which largely revolves around this relationship: from the first seduction, to Ben renting a room for them, to the scene in which he insists that they have a conversation before ""doing it."" The dialogue was witty, and the performances completely believable. There's a superbly executed shift in genre (for lack of a better word) in the second hour, as Ben finds himself becoming interested in Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (a really good supporting performance by Katharine Ross.) The movie takes on a dramatic feel here, as Ben's feelings for Elaine complicate and then end the affair with her mother, as the secret comes out and lies are told in an attempt to cover up. I've rarely seen a movie switch so seamlessly from light comedy to drama. It was pulled off without a hitch by director Mike Nichols. The question in the end becomes whether Ben can convince Elaine to continue their relationship after she learns about the affair with her mother, and there's some real uncertainty about that. The ending of the movie comes across in some ways as a bit clich√©, although there's an openness to it as well as you wonder what awaits Elaine and Ben after all they've experienced.From an era in which there was a lot of uncertainty about the future, this movie seems to encapsulate that feeling through a series of believable characters, whose own futures are left completely up in the air as the movie ends. Sometimes a movie leaving a lot of loose ends can be frustrating, but in this case it seemed completely appropriate to both the story and the times in which it was made.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great beautiful Actress!(Anne Bancroft),"Anne Bancroft, the woman with whom many men had sexual fantasies after watching ""The Graduate"".

Horror movie in disguise about an obsessed psychopath,"That describes ""The Graduate"" more than anything.This is indeed a pretty good movie, although I don't think it's one of the greatest. Matter of fact, take away the incredible soundtrack of Simon and Garfunkel and the film gets a lot weaker.No doubt that everyone is decent, especially Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin. But there are various sequences where Simon and Garfunkel come on and you see Ben just looking psycho.And that's the core of the film. OK, Dustin's Benjamin is a loser with the chicks, can't seem to do anything right, but he soon devolves into a psychopath lunatic obsessed with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, who he has known forever, but has just shown an interest in now.Talk about a stalker! After one date, Ben decides she's the girl for him, and does everything possible to stalk, hunt down, and get the attention of this girl he's actually only kissed one time. It's downright scary how far he goes, how threatening he becomes, and how crazy he gets. And when he is actually around Elaine, all he does is ask her prying questions, like a pathetic needy little boy. There is nothing appealing about him whatsoever, making ""The Graduate"" not merely a horror film in disguise, but a fantasy, having any girl show any interest at all in someone as sorry and pushy as Benjamin.Still, ""The Graduate"" is a decent film, even though it's quite overrated, and good for one solid viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One Giant Leap For Immorality,"This is the beginning of what I would call ""popular or glossy sleaze"" in which morally bankrupt people are given credence and credibility, where doing the wrong things is glamorized in American films.That is done either through having attractive-looking actors whom people like to see, humor in the story masking the bad messages, nice photography or the film is done by a popular director or producer, thus giving it further credence. In this film, it's all of the above.This is the year profanity entered American movies and Dustin Hoffman wastes no time abusing Jesus' name.

One of the best movies of its time.,"Every teenage boys dream, a complete no strings attached relationship with and older, married woman. That's exactly what happens to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the film The Graduate. Directed by Mike Nichols, this film puts a whole new twist on friends with benefits. This film may have been shot in the late 60s but it has the drama and scandal ism that excites the youth of any day and age. Benjamin Braddock just graduated from college and has no idea what to do with his life. His family and his family's friends are very wealthy and upstanding citizens. This in turn creates even more stress for Benjamin to be as equally successful. This is a big connection to everyone who has been at a crossroad at least once in his or her life. But then he then gets the opportunity of a lifetime after driving his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson, home one late night. He has an affair with this woman; what is meant to be a one-night stand turns into a complete summer romance. Benjamin is now living the life. He's just graduated, has no job, lounges in his parent's pool for hours on end, and has a woman at his beck and call. The best part about this arrangement is that nobody knows. Nichol's directional genius throws in a twist for the entire audience when Ben realizes the chance of a lifetime isn't scoring with Mrs. Robinson but getting together with her daughter Elaine. Now Benjamin's confused out of his mind and the audience is getting pulled deeper in the drama of this film through Benjamin's anguish and confusion. What's Ben going to do now? He can continue the affair with Mrs. Robinson or create a new relationship with Elaine. Of course if he chooses Elaine, he has to tell her about his and her mother's secret hook-ups. Without surprise that's exactly what he does and what's expected of Elaine besides to slap him across the face. By this time, we as the audience are wondering how this film could get any better. This is just an entire soap opera season channeled into a two-hour film. Benjamin can't give up on his love for Elaine that easy. He must prove to her that he is worthy to have her hand in marriage, despite what he did and the lies Mrs. Robinson told to escape the talk of her affair. Only more surprise and heartache comes to Benjamin when he finds Elaine is already engaged to another man. He follows Elaine to college in hopes to win her back. He follows her around campus and gets an apartment in her same city, and stalks her for quite a while. The suspense just keeps building. Though with everything Benjamin does, Elaine still can't forgive his transgressions. It all comes down to Elaine's wedding day with an exciting act by Elaine. The happy but somewhat confusing ending falls into place and Elaine and Benjamin can live happily ever after. This film drives an audience crazy. Mike Nichols sure brings down the house with everything you'll ever need in a movie: sex, lies, excitement, love and a romantic ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beloved Classic Aged like Sour Milk,"In regards to what is often considered revolutionary and culturally significant in older romantic dramedies of a then new era of filmmaking, Mike Nichols' adaptation of the Charles Webb novel The Graduate comes to mind indefinitely. In addition to being both a critical darling and a commercial hit on its original release, AFI has even listed it very highly amongst their choices for the greatest American films of all time. Looking back however, it might not have aged all that well today regarding its subject matter. While definitely unique and even somewhat fascinating, it might be one of the more frustrating romantic dramas out there.The film follows young college graduate Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), who has no real purpose in his life. Upon being seduced by the wife of his father's law partner, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), Ben begins to spend a lot of time with her until he suddenly becomes obsessed with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). Arguably one of the biggest themes in the whole film is the relatable fear many college grads go through once their course is over, and the film satirizes the rather alienated nature of closeted youth by showing what can happen if one ends up in a different path than they ever thought possible. Ben himself is so emotionally wooden and distraught from the real world that having a family friend spend ""quality time"" is perhaps way more of an adventure than college ever was for him, especially when said woman is a depressed alcoholic who'd rather sleep with a dork than her lawfully married husband. The first half of the movie, while a bit unorthodox in how it portrays the innocence of youth gone haywire, conveys this idea in a very hysterical and even playful manner.However, once Elaine Robinson enters the picture, the film immediately loses itself in a diluted mess of insufferable creepiness. While it is only somewhat communicated why Ben would end up being manipulated by Elaine's miserable mom, there is barely any hint as to what Ben sees in her at all, or even what she would see in someone like him to begin with. Perhaps both characters are meant to be parodies of emotional shut-ins trying to break out of the conformist trap that was common in this era of film history, but at no point does it ever come across that way and the audience is left with two blank slates. Even if one could argue that Ben is trying to redeem himself out of remorse for how awful his affair was, it all comes off as selfish and frankly irritating just from how sudden his interest in Elaine becomes. If they have known each other their whole lives, maybe some more scenes with how Elaine feels about Ben would have sufficed. In the end, it just makes everyone in the real world out to stop Ben from achieving any form of happiness, and honestly, rightfully so.If there's anything else at least worth praising about the film, some of the cinematography and camera work of Robert Surtees is quite effective. Depending on a certain dramatic moment between characters, or even just one, a simple yet dynamic usage of unsettling lighting and zoomed framing will be used to heighten the tensity, almost as if we're watching a thriller. Since the film has almost no score of its own, it makes these occasional cinematic layouts rather frightening for what is supposed to be part comedy part drama. However, the songs from Simon & Garfunkel are probably the most timeless aspects of the whole movie. Not only are classics like The Sound of Silence & Scarborough Fair still worthwhile emotional roller coasters on their own, but they are also useful transitions for the more slow and often smoothly edited moments of inner character thought. Considering that this film was where the charming Mrs. Robinson number came from, it has arguably marked its status as a remarkable achievement in both film and music simultaneously, a feat not often met even today.So even if it was unique and distinctive for its time, The Graduate doesn't quite hold up as particularly pleasant and more disturbing than anything. Perhaps if this was written the exact same way but was instead a psychological thriller, it might have been even more unique, but alas, it feels more sad than charming at the end of the day. Then again, perhaps that is what Charles Webb, Mick Nichols and co-writer Buck Henry were going for, as this film does at least get across its message of non conformity fairly well, if not tastefully. It might not be for everyone, but maybe it's not meant to be after all.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate is a classic,"I enjoyed The Graduate. It was a fun movie to watch; it had suspense, drama, humor, romance; everything required for an entertaining film. All of the actors gave good performances, especially Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. I love Simon and Garfunkel music, so that greatly added to my enjoyment of the movie.Ben Braddock is kind of a depressed guy who doesn't know what to do with his life. The Graduate is a great film for young people, especially college kids, because a lot of them can identify with the main character's feelings of being lost and not knowing what choices to make.The only problem I had with the movie is that Hoffman's character seemed kind of ditsy a lot of the time and made weird illogical decisions. However, his choices were what pushed the plot forward so it was easy to go along with.Overall I thought The Graduate was pretty great. There is a lot to like about the movie and it has a lot of meaning behind it. The film is more than 40 years old but it doesn't seem like it.

Great story of a confused graduate,"This is a great film that takes advantage of the ""New Hollywood"" era in which films were allowed to show things on screen that were previously deemed unacceptable by the Hayes Code. A few things that I found interesting were the use of popular music of the time, Simon and Garfunkel rather than an orchestra like previous movies. Also there were numerous scenes where Benjamin is in bed with a woman, engaging in sex before marriage which was unheard of prior to this era. Another thing is that this movie is wide screen in order to get people to go to the movie theaters because it isn't something they can see on TV. This was an interesting movie and I could relate because at this point in time I also have no idea what to do after college. This is still relevant today with a lot of people graduating and not so many jobs available.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

first time lover,"this movie blew my mind completely, secretly this is like the American dream for young men, I think every man that watched this movie wished they were in the same position as him (no pun intended) track star of a wealthy family, and just graduated college. he sure sowed some wild oats. iv never seen this movie till I watched it in class, I absolutely loved that Dustin Hoffman was in this film, had no idea. he was hilarious! hi character just seemed so shy borderline weird and I loved it. he was so non chalet, everything that anyone said to him kind of just went over his head. he'd be so in his own mind sometimes, I can defiantly relate to that.

The Graduate,"The Graduate is a very risqu√© film from 1967, starring Dustin Hoffman. This film came out about a year before the Hayes code was totally abolished. During this time period society had moved past the Hayes code and was ready to deal with reality; the graduate did just that. Dustin Hoffman played the role of Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate. Benjamin comes from a prestigious family who seemed to have raised him right, however he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. During the summer instead of trying to figure out his dilemma, he gets lost within an affair. Benjamin is seduced by his father's business partners wife. They don't talk, they don't have a relationship, they just have meaningless sex. His plot alone in a film was recently not even allowed to be filmed, now it was boldly in front of an audience. As the summer passed on and Benjamin was yearning for more, he was forced to take his lovers daughter on a date. For what seems like the first time in his life Benjamin has finally found something that is meaningful to him. There's only one problem, he's already involved in a dangerous affair. Director Mike Nichols and Dustin Hoffman created a groundbreaking film that left the Hayes code a memory in the Hollywood film world. The plot is sexually twisted that throws reality in its audiences face. The camera shots are remarkable creating a work of art on screen, while Dustin Hoffman accents the script perfectly. This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone with a mature mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

amazing movie,"This has to be one of my all time favorites. There is nothing quite like this film. Nothing can ever recapture the feeling of this film. Its completely unique and one of a kind. It captures the feeling of social isolation perfectly. The editing and camera work are amazing, completely off the wall but amazing. So many quick cuts. The sound design is perfection. This film looks and sounds spectacular, its like you can hear every little detail. It really pulls you in, you get wrapped up in this world. Its a world we've probably all been at least once in our lives. Even though its main focus is on the generation gap of the 60s, this film still feels relevant today. Dustin Hoffman is at his best, he's so awkward, dorky, socially inept and charming. He has a lot of flaws but you can't help but root for this guy.

Still wonderful 40 years later.,"This is the quintessential coming of age drama. It is a rarity for a film to hold its own for so long, but ""The Graduate"" does it. I find it hard to come up with anything negative to say about this film. The only real negative that I can come up with is that you'll probably never want to listen to Simon & Garfunkel again. It is rare for an actors first role to do so much for their career, but Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Ben cemented his role in cinema history. Anne Bancroft is the delightfully manipulating Mrs. Robinson and Kathrine Ross is her daughter and Bens love interest, Elaine. The direction and camera work are good. The camera work aids in giving the audience a dose of what Ben is going through as a recent college graduate. ""The Graduate"" really stands the test of time, as it remains high on many movie goers lists of top films.

"""Wood or wire? They have both. ""","""The Graduate"" is the first film that has ever confused me; Not in its plot or production, but in understanding the underlying message of the entire movie. From beginning to end, I found myself revolting, even hating, Dustin Hoffman's character, who slowly becomes more and more repulsive and frightening. However, when up against a conflict, I'm rooting for Hoffman again, before sliding back into disgust, and then the cycle repeats. The rest of the film is clear as to how much I enjoy it, such as its use of water, montages, transitions, and music.

Overrated,"I finally saw this movie, after putting it off many times, and I am surprised at how disappointed I was. I certainly give the movie high marks for Dustin Hoffman's performance, and certainly Mike Nichols' direction was quite exceptional. But I expected more comedy, and I rarely laughed through the movie. I can appreciate that humor was being attempted in some of the scenes (i.e. the absurd situation where Ben is made to swim in full scuba gear for spectators in the backyard swimming pool), but the fact is, I just didn't laugh. I thought the plot was meager, the story not that interesting. The characters, as a whole, were just plain irritating. In a word, I thought the movie was boring.

A Sound of Silence,"When I reviewed ""Rebel Without a Cause"" I said that it was probably the best film ever about coming of age. I still hold that view, but ""The Graduate"" is its closest rival. The central character Benjamin Braddock, although older than Jim Stark in the earlier film, is another ""rebel without a cause"". He is, admittedly, an unlikely rebel, this being the late sixties when there were plenty of rebels with causes they passionately believed in. He has no political views, does not take drugs, wears his hair short, dresses smartly and has remained a virgin throughout the era of free love.Benjamin has recently graduated, probably from a prestigious East Coast university, and returns to his parents' house in an upper-class suburb of Los Angeles where he receives a triumphant welcome. Benjamin's problem is one that affects many university graduates. He does not know what to do with the rest of his life. His academic life, and accompanying sporting and extracurricular activities, have provided him with such a sense of intellectual and emotional satisfaction that anything else is likely to seem an anti-climax. His degree is a triumph which nothing in the rest of his life seems likely to equal. The idea of settling down into a routine job (in one famous scene a friend of his father advises him to get into plastics) does not appeal to him, but he cannot think of anything else to do with this life. (He tells his father that he wants his future to be ""different"").Benjamin drifts into an affair with Mrs Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner. (We never learn her Christian name). She is happy to use Benjamin for sex, although he is looking for a more committed relationship. The two have little in common, and Benjamin's attempts to engage Mrs Robinson in conversation fall disastrously flat. Eventually his parents, supported by Mr Robinson (who at this stage knows nothing of his wife's affair), engineer a date between him and the Robinsons' daughter Elaine. Benjamin and Elaine find themselves falling for one another, but Mrs Robinson is furious at this development and, prompted by a complex mixture of emotions (partly jealousy, partly the feeling that an aimless drifter who sleeps with a married woman is not a suitable match for her daughter), does everything she can to frustrate the romance, even threatening to tell her husband the whole truth if Benjamin dates Elaine.I was surprised to read Roger Ebert's recent review in which he recanted his youthful enthusiasm for ""The Graduate"" and concluded that it was merely a sixties period piece. Surprised, because my own experience was very different- I fell in love with the film when I first saw it in my student days more than twenty years ago and still love it today. (I feel- although the Academy clearly disagreed- that it should have won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar in 1968). Why do I love it? Well, let me count the ways. Firstly, I love it because I love Simon and Garfunkel (in my view up there with the Beatles) who provide the soundtrack with some of their finest songs, ""The Sound of Silence"", ""Scarborough Fair"" and, of course, ""Mrs Robinson"". All of these have some relevance to the plot; ""Scarborough Fair"" is about lost love and ""The Sound of Silence"" (among other things) about the difficulty of communicating with words.Secondly, I love the film for its well-written and often witty dialogue- the ""plastics"" scene and lines such as ""Mrs Robinson, I think you're trying to seduce me"" have remained with me ever since my first viewing. Thirdly, there is the famous ending, among the most memorable and emotionally satisfying endings of any movie.Then there is the acting, above all two performances of a lifetime from Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman. Much has been made of the fact that, although there is supposed to be about twenty years difference between the ages of Mrs Robinson and Benjamin, Bancroft was only six years older than Hoffman. In my view, however, that does not affect the quality of their acting at all. Hoffman is completely believable as Benjamin- shy, gauche, confused and lacking in self-confidence, but possessed of an inner decency and integrity. In a distinguished acting career he has made a number of great films- ""Tootsie"", ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""Rain Man"" all come to mind- but this is still my favourite. As for Anne Bancroft, although she made many films, when she died last year ""The Graduate"" was the one mentioned in all the obituaries. Her Mrs Robinson is in her late thirties or early forties, beautiful, seductive and sophisticated. She is also deeply unhappy- an alcoholic, bored with her marriage and with life in general. Although she behaves badly towards Benjamin, Bancroft makes her a character with whom we can sympathise. Her life took a wrong turning when she became pregnant as a student and was forced into a shotgun marriage, and has found herself trapped ever since.Finally, I love ""The Graduate"" for the timeless way it deals with the generation gap. Hoffman and Mike Nichols could have made Benjamin into a typical sixties rebel- long-haired, free-loving, drug-taking and full of righteous indignation about Vietnam and the Bomb. Had they done so, the film would today indeed look like what Ebert called it, something out of a time capsule. Instead, ""The Graduate"" both comes out of its era and transcends it. Nichols realised that the real generation gap is based on something far wider than differing tastes in clothes and music, wider than differing opinions about sex and drugs and Vietnam. The true generation gap is the inevitable disparity in outlook between those like Benjamin and Elaine whose adult life is just beginning and those like their parents whose life is half-over. When these two groups try to discuss their differences, the result is often a sound of silence. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still touching after 35 years,"This is one of my favorite love movies ever. Dustin Hoffman's first major role is - next to his 1968 ""Midnight Cowboy"" - still one of his best and most touching movies ever made. From the very first scene to the happy end it is showing the painful state of growing up, falling seriously in love with an older woman, experiencing sex and new feelings and leaving the conservative standards of living behind.Hoffman is suffering in nearly every moment of the film from his longings, feelings and dreams, and Mike Nichol's direction, the photography, the fascinating song sound track of Simon and Garfunkel (including some of their best songs like Mrs. Robinson, The Sounds of Silence and Scarborough Fair) and the brilliant cast of Hoffman, Katherine Ross and the late Anne Bancroft add weight to Hoffman's private world.The movie is also a good parody of the typical middle-class jet set lifestyle of the sixties (university degrees, good jobs, marriage, an own house and bland garden party conversations) and a soft variation of the typical 1967 topic of revolution and protest in the summer of love... this movie is as old as me, so I feel some kind of related to it. After having watched it many times during the last few decades it is still a brilliant and timeless movie about love, seduction, growing up, disorientation and alienation.

"Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, she's the reason this movie is great!","Sultry, seductive, and tempting, these are the things that describe Mrs. Robinson in the movie, ""The Graduate"". A 60's hit with stars of tomorrow. Like Dustin Hoffman, before he did this movie he did a commercial for Volkswagon a year earlier. And now this, he plays a college grad who is clueless on what to do next. Maybe, just maybe. Here you have Mrs. Robinson, wife of his father's friend, and mother of Elaine. I don't know you but I thing any scene with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft is great. The first scene is when she traps Ben in her daughter's room and is naked right in front of Ben. Too many flash backs and I got really confused. The second time was better for me. In the hotel scene, where she asks Ben to unzip her top, and then she takes it off, I said ""WHOA!"" NICE BODY, ANNE! I would rewind that scene over and over again. This scene puts other seductress to shame. Then the third hotel scene is really the one with the liner: ""Are you trying to seduce me?"" DUH! BENJAMIN! This movie is sinfully seductive and one of the guiltiest pleasures any young man would have.

I was pleasantly surprised, however.  Great performances all around, the story was great, and I particularly liked how no character was especially likeable.  They were all pretty nasty or shallow in their own way.  It was a pretty accurate representation of the times, it seems (I was born several years after it was released, so I can't say for sure).At any rate, it works on many levels.

Strange dark comedy.,"The Graduate tells the story of a young man just out of college and unsure of what to do with his life. His family annoys him, and life is confusing. He ends up starting a love affair with the much older Mrs. Robinson for reasons he can't even explain, but things get complicated when he falls for her daughter. The Graduate is a strange little film that you might have high expectations about due to it's status in cinema history.The Graduate is a very well made film that has many messages about real life, and that may be what draws a lot of people to it. People who describe this as a comedy are a bit mistaken. It's a black comedy. There are funny scenes, but not that are really laugh out loud funny. The drama in the movie is actually more involving. The plot starts out kind of strange, but it gets stranger as the movie moves on. It actually gets more and more unrealistic as the movie moves on, which is kind of annoying. One problem is that Simon and Garfunkel made up the soundtrack for this film, and people who don't like their mellow form of music might start to get really annoyed. In one sequence of the film, they play the song Scarbourough Fair way too much, and it starts to get annoying.If you want to talk acting, it's no wonder Dustin Hoffman made his career off this film. He does a great job playing Ben Braddock, and he is able to convey stress, fear, and funniness all at the same time. The other fine actors surrounding him in this film only help to amplify his talent.Overall, The Graduate is a good movie, but it's not for everybody. Not everybody will be able to understand its meaning, and not everybody will be able to even sit through it. It's a strange little film.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dated, weak.","Very funny movie that, underneath the humor, has nothing important to say. Stuff like this and ""Harold and Maude"" was probably very meaningful to depressed upper class hippies, but today it's just plain irritating. The parts about uncertain futures and love conquering all are still relevant; nothing else is. I suppose, for example, Dustin Hoffman's act of pursuing Elaine out of spite after ONE lousy date was defiant and cool in the 60's, but today it just seems... strange, to put it mildly. And while Hoffman is great at looking nervous and confused, his character has no real personality. I don't hate this movie: the first forty minutes are a blast, and the ending is a delight. But the majority of it is just empty and irrelevant today. Maybe it's important for defining the period, but if I'm going to watch a movie, I'd like to get something out of it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No Longer ""Holding Up""","More than fifty years after its release, I don't think this film is holding up. My main criticism, at this point, is Dustin Hoffman, who I feel was miscast, and his character, Ben, who does not seem genuine to me. Hoffman was too old (29 or 30) and too atypical in appearance, and he lacked the athletic form that a track star would have. Ben, the character Hoffman plays, for all of his academic and athletic prowess, is a complete loser. He can't even greet his parents' guests or engage in small talk. This makes no sense, in view of the cultured and socially motivated parents he has. Ben has no grace. The guests at the party, in fact almost all of the adults, are strictly stereotypes, although Murray Hamilton -- excellent as always -- has some good moments. But, even so, almost all of the adults are generally nice, and genuinely like Ben, although it is not clear why.Why Mrs. Robinson would get mixed up with Ben remains a mystery. Her husband (Murray Hamilton) and her alcoholism are the reasons, I guess, but there is no real character development to give us an insight into her behavior. The daughter, played by Katharine Ross, delivers a stiff, one-dimensional performance She went on to become a pretty good actress.The soundtrack is holding up fairly well, but to be honest, the songs largely deal with an individual's right to occupy the center of the universe. The music was very egocentric.All of this is just opinion, 20/20 hindsight, if you will, so no one has to get mad. It's an enjoyable flick, tedious and predictable at times, but worth seeing once or twice, but not repeatedly. As for Hoffman, he would very soon put in a timeless performance in ""Midnight Cowboy.""",,Anonymous,Romance
a love once new has now grown old,"On the face of it, it's odd that this classic product of the 'permissive society' makes sex seem so nasty and repellent: furtive, joyless couplings in darkened rooms, with no smiling or even talking. But then in the second half it segues from one of the sleaziest films ever to one of the most romantic, and ends in a radiant glow. And maybe that's the point: the whole thing could be seen as a metaphor for the hopes of the 60s, escape from the dead hand of convenience and convention, into a life of happiness, freedom and love. Of course we know it didn't turn out quite like that, but it doesn't diminish the beauty of the hope.It goes without saying that Simon & Garfunkel's songs are an integral part of it, one of the greatest ever rock soundtracks (well, maybe folk-rock in this case) and one of the few actually tailored to the film, rather than pre-existing tracks being played over the top. It sets the atmosphere of uncertainty and drift, and also acts like a Greek chorus commenting on the action (only a lot more foot-tapping). And besides, music was so important to the time; here it helps make up a complete and authoritative statement of the spirit of the age, cinematic, dramatic, musical and social.There's a bit of an anti-jock as well as anti-square subtext, with that scene of ten identical dufuses in the washroom. And is this also the film which introduced the now commonplace convention, of romantic devotion being represented by running...?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thank You Mr. Nichols,"Thank you, Mike Nichols, for giving us ""The Graduate,"" because it, along with the superb ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" finally blew the cobwebs off of the Hollywood film and gave movie audiences something immediate and relevant. Because of the audacity of directors like Nichols and Penn (and Peckinpah and Hopper and Schlesinger and Kubrick) the 1960s are now known as the decade that ushered in a movie renaissance when they could have been known instead as the decade that gave us ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Cleopatra.""""The Graduate"" just has a different feel to it as compared to many of its contemporaries that's hard to explain if you can't see it. Like ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" it's about restless characters, and the movie feels restless too. It's quick, jittery, fast paced. The camera moves and does original things. Actors seem to be occupying real three-dimensional space rather than manufactured studio sets. And then there's that fantastic Simon and Garfunkel score, the first time a pop soundtrack was so integral a part of a film narrative (and its marketing). While studios were still trying to churn out big-budget, ponderous Biblical and historical epics, or antiquated musicals that felt like products made especially for grandma and grandpa, ""The Graduate"" feels like a product aimed squarely at the youth market, and reassures young people that film has something to say to them. And let's not forget that the movie also introduced audiences to Dustin Hoffman, who would be such a major player in said film renaissance in the upcoming decade.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yes, I'll say it again ... I LIKED THIS MOVIE! The question is: Why? None of the characters in the story, with the exception of Elaine, are particular attractive or nice. In fact, they are some of the most reprehensible characters ever portrayed in a movie. I say this sweeping statement because these characters behave in ways that they know are morally wrong, and despite their knowing better, continue to flaunt themselves anyway. They are angry characters, angry at the world, angry at themselves, angry at each other. They are also boldfaced hypocrites, flaunting their middle-class materialistic trappings, like their nice houses and expensive cars, and so smug, like that fool Mr. Robinson and Ben's father whose only concern is that Ben get a good job and keep up appearances, all of which masking a shallowness and depravity that is the central theme of this story, which is why I liked this movie.

"Brilliant, Flawless, and Then Some...","Obviously, this is a great movie.

Unless you're employed in a field that involves a great deal of plastics, probably not very much.

What does plastics mean to him?  Nothing.  But, if an opportunity to do something with plastics came up, would he take advantage of it?  I think so, simply because he couldn't think of anything better to do with his time.Which explains the ultimate confusion of Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"". Why would a guy like Ben every have an affair with someone like Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft)?  Because there wasn't any real glaring reason not to, and because he couldn't think of anything better to do with his time.  Mrs. Robinson simply becomes available, just as Elaine (Katherine Ross) becomes unavailable.  In a world where nothing makes much sense, what seems easiest and most available is, only too often, what we take advantage of.Enter the world of Ben Braddock, where nothing is quite what it seems, and yet everything makes complete sense.  Everyone has, I believe, been in Ben's shoes.  If not, they will be sooner or later.  Confusion and self-doubt are a part of everybody's coming of age, and ""The Graduate"" turns these feelings into a bizarre, inexplainable masterpiece.

Ross is also great.Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie was fine,so was he in Kramer vs.Kramer and especially Rain Man,but I loved the Graduate.I recommend this movie for people ages 10 and up(it also depends on how mature the child is).It might have some scenes are too inappropriate ,but at 10,11,12,it is a good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"entertaining, amusing, delightful, and insightful","Id like to firstly say that the music in this movie, done by Simon & Garfunkle was truly great and really made the movie what it was. The music goes hand in hand with the storyline. Sam O'steen does a wonderful job at editing the film to fit in tune with the certain songs done by the group. Dustin Hoffman plays a great part in this movie. He is intelligent, but wittfully stupid in a fashion that is pretty funny. He gives his character a certain innocence throughout the film, which is very entertaining to watch him get in certain situations. The sexual content of this film really was revolutionary for its time. 1967 the cultural revolution was in full swing, and you can certainly see it portrayed in this movie. The rebellion against the Hayes Code, which would very soon after this movie get reduced by the federal courts was stand out. Certain scenes directly offend and step on the toes of Hayes code enforcers. I thought it was great to see, I think that it was director Mike Nichols way of joining in on the cultural revolution and making a bold statement that the old road is rapidly fading. I would certainly suggest this film to anyone. Great stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very interesting,"The graduate was definitely on my list to see, I've heard people make reference to it and other movies/t.v. shows. The Jen Aniston movie Rumor Has It, for example. So I kind of knew in a nutshell what it was about. All though overall I cant say it was one of the best, most remarkable films I've seen, it was quite good. After taking a film class I've come to appreciate how this movie was for its time, it was one of the earlier movies that chose to take on such a risqu√© subject.Faults I had with the movie, Ben's love for Elaine was so intense but their were very few scenes leading up to that, it kind of through the whole movie off for me. But there were some very funny parts throughout. Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness as Bed was just down right hilarious. It was really interesting to see Hoffman in a younger role as well. While watching this film I noticed some very interesting things. Towards the end there's a scene where he steals a small red sports car to chase after Elaine before she gets married. He pulls into a gas station to ask for directions. While watching this I instantly was reminded of the movie Wayne's World. He goes into the church and starts banging and screaming on the glass window above the ceremony, and then locks them in the church by sliding a broom handle through the door. A minute later when the car brakes down, the couple hop a bus. Waynes World totally ripped this scene off from the graduate.There was also an earlier scene in the movie where Mrs. Robinson was trying to seduce Ben. So for me personally it was very interesting to see how more current films are still keeping The Graduate alive. definitely a classic that im glad I got the opportunity to see, I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind watching it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Possible the greatest movie ever made....,"This movie has changed my life, from a careless person to a person who always tries to succeed whenever there is a challenge.  This is the greatest movie, I have ever seen.  It has a good story line, wonderful music, unbelievable acting, and cinematography that is unsurpassed.   My most favorite shot is the zoom out of Mrs. Robinson(Anne Bancroft) at the Robinson home.  I highly suggest that anyone who does not know where their life is going should see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but could have gone further,"This film focuses a lot on one area; the main character's relationship with two women. How he comes to know both of these women was a little too quick for me and their relationships change too quickly. The film did not portray exactly what was going on in the main guy's head. However apart from that the film is great. Using music from Simon and Garfunkel which fits the film almost perfectly, the film portrays the main character in a strange light which is unusual but refreshing. The characters are played very well, especially Dustin Hoffman as the main character. This brings magic to the film. The camera is used in a very rare way but a way which gives the film a different aspect. The plot is decent with a lot of sways and turns but focused a bit too much on the main character. Overall a good film but I hope the classic story in the last half of the film does not bore or disinterest viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Astoundingly Bad for Something So Adored,"What the hell was this garbage? Groundbreaking for the late '60s it might have been, but this is a terrible film.Every character is detestable, but none more so than the protagonist.Let's start with 30 year old Dustin Hoffman absurdly playing the most unlikable and unrelatable spoiled 21 year old imaginable. On the one hand he looks way too old for the part, and on the other hand he acts way too young, or perhaps mentally handicapped, like he was trying to do Rainman before Rainman. He's a spoiled, entitled rich kid whose apparently absurdly wealthy and indulgent parents put him through college, buy him an expensive sports car, and then let him lounge around jobless and aimless while giving him what must have been a ridiculous amount of money to blow on hotel rooms, eating out, gas, alcohol, and later apparently finance his move to another locale complete with a rented room and of course all of the other imaginable expenses. For this he is both oblivious and ungrateful, and thinks his life is terrible. How anyone could not find him repulsive on the surface is beyond me.But of course Hoffman's character is only getting started in the unlikability department. One supposes it's not out of the question for a young man to be tempted into an affair with a beautiful older woman, even if she is his father's business partner's wife and a close friend of the family. And to his credit, he does make a half-butted attempt to avoid going on a date with his affair's daughter, but then he immediately reverses himself, engages in the date enthusiastically, decides he is in love with the girl, and pursues her despite the situation. And while he does come clean about the affair (when his hand is forced), he then goes on to stalk the daughter in what has to be one of the creepiest sequences in film history not intended to be creepy.The entire latter portion of the film is a travesty of unbelievability, with characters acting in ways which make absolutely no sense, and entire sequences proceeding without logic. (Remember the scene where Hoffman breaks into the house, the cops arrive, and then we cut away to Hoffman back in the car? What the heck happened there?)And then there's the music. Yes, Simon and Garfunkel wrote some amazing songs that are used in this film. But they're played over and over, sequence after sequence, the exact same notes used scene after scene, often the same song played over three or four scenes in a row, always starting with the exact same notes. It is mind-blowingly bad.There is much more that could be said, but all in all this film is simply terrible. I know there are a lot of film students out there praising the Oscar-winning direction, though I can't for the life of me understand way, but in terms of telling a story (which is what films are supposed to do), this one is an utter failure.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Aluminum Film,"This film falls into the ""commercial"" category of Mike Nichols' work that he needed to finance his later experiments.

It was a shame he had to get cynical about it, but hey every great film has a great conflict. I recommend this film for anyone with a keen sense of humor.

The exploration of loneliness,"A film that is a must for every movie lover, a film that promotes a story in the best romantic comedy style and yet is surprising, with absolute mastery of technique, script and performances, the American director Mike Nichols knew how to conduct his work with almost complete perfection in what it provides to do. Take a look at the story of Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a 21-year-old who gets caught up in a sexual journey with the mother of the girl he loves, the movie script is perfectly told, always exploring all sides of the story, the pains, anxieties and fears of all the characters, and we are glazed and stuck to its narrative, even being a romantic comedy, a genre that massively searches for cliche. Benjamin is a character who is embraced by loneliness, he is completely desperate to quench his emptiness, even though he may not know it, when Ben is invited to participate in a sexual adventure, this temporarily fills his void, but after a while he realizes that it only leaves him empty, and when falling in love with Elaine, he sees a desperate attempt to get rid of this ""darkness"", Ben is a completely broken character, that even in love, he has no idea what to do, loneliness who pursues Ben is the drama of many, and the way she is explored in the film is spectacular. Not only does the script have its merits, but the direction too, speaking first of the camera angles, aiming always show well in zoom and then rolls a large zoom out, always showing how small the character is in the scenario, in addition to always using outlets and not to abuse in the cuts, even being a 1966 movie, besides, we have great songs on the soundtrack, sometimes it may seem little distoante or repetitive, but the track talks with the drama of Ben, besides, we have a great editing and sound editing, as well as beautiful photography. Dustin Hoffman is a great performer, and he is one of the pillars that makes the script get to explore so many themes without the actor, the movie would perhaps be a dramatic romantic comedy, we also have the magnificent Anne Bancroft. The use of the spectacular song ""hello darkness my old friend"" in the end contrasts somewhat the idea of ??what the film is going through - unless it is interpreted that the character still feels empty - in the end, it is not a perfect movie, but it accomplishes everything that promises and a little more, a lot more.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Classic,"The film was recommended to me by my dad, who was going through a similar transition in his life- graduating from university- when this film came out. As a result, it had a great impact on him. Although I was only in high school when I first saw it, I feel anyone going through a stage of transition can relate to this movie. The character of Benjamin is clueless, confused, but lovable. His innocence makes him endearing. And though it deals with mature themes, the movie will most likely have you laughing out loud. The film's visuals also made a great impression on me. It was one of the first times, along with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, that I noticed how much cinematography can enhance a film. Add to that a gorgeous soundtrack, and you have a classic film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Slow-paced, kinda boring","I can see why this is considered to be a classic, but honestly I was pretty bored until the second half of the movie when Elaine came into the picture. I was also sick of all the Simon & Garfunkel songs repeating constantly by the end. I understand that this movie is supposed to be crafty and artistic but it's just boring. I would give it a 5/10 but am adding one extra point just for that iconic ending scene.I'm 21, if you're curious.

This CLASSIC can change one's life,"This movie is everything one can expect from a classic, but it's still MORE. Excelent actings, wonderful cinematography, astonishing direction, and most important of all, touching story.What makes of ""The Graduate"" a real classic is the conflict in the carachter's life: how a fool and intelligent guy turns into a smart and decided man; how can such a sensual woman use a man to get sex and then take him off her life; how can a girl, seemingly presented to us as being so boring, conquer the heart of that fool guy and make him change his mind.What makes ""The Graduate"" become a mark in my life is its poetry. It doesn't talk about a virgin guy who discovers the world. It's about a man who discovers himself, a man who finds himself after years trying to be what the parents, the neighbors and friends wanted him to be. Suddenly, discovering sex and love, The Graduate becomes a real MAN.If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST see. I never thought it could touch me at such a deep way, but it did. Go see this movie. Maybe you'll find out that a guy comes a MAN not when he makes sex, but when he learns to fight for the things he loves.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visually Amazing if you can Stay Awake,"Let me first start out by saying that visually, ""The Graduate"" is amazing. The color is so rich and the variety of shots keeps film buffs interested. The layering in the scenes is excellent. There is a shot of Ben (Dustin Hoffman) through a fish tank with Mrs. Robinson standing in the doorway in the background that exhibits this layering. There was also interesting choices in framing. Characters who were talking oftentimes had their heads cropped off or the camera on the back of their heads.My main beef with the movie was Dustin Hoffman. He just doesn't do anything for me as an actor. And on top of that, the movie was long, slow, and boring.Another strong suit is the amazing soundtrack and how music is effectively intertwined with the plot and transitions. The film also does a good job of showing the generation gap. The ending at the church and the fight scene are amazing and almost make up for the pace of the rest of the film. Overall, I have mixed feelings on ""The Graduate"" and recommend others to watch the movie when you're tired and in bed so the slow pace won't annoy you.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A TRULY horrible film,"Why was this movie made?  I'm a Simon and Garfunkel fan, but I have to believe that this sorry waste of celluloid was made only to showcase S & G.....again and again!

One of the best and funniest,"Granted there weren't any big ambitions for this film when it came out so you'll often see the scars of a low budget, various scences rushed due to time constraints, and the plot will often seem illogical and hurried. Nonetheless, this is one of the best and funniest movies I've seen.Unlike should-be flop ""Virginia Woolfe"" every character puts effort into his or her role and literally becomes their assigned character (so much so it's easy to forget Hoffman is 30 an Bancroft is only 35.)  What makes this feature of the cast more compelling is that it is made up almost entirely of second-choices.  What the cast gives in acting, Nichols doubles in directing, catching the emotions of every seen from Ben's timidness and confusion on the first night of his affiar to the chaos that ensues when Elaine's wedding is hilariously interupted in a completely anti-Christian way.It is best to watch this movie while your young as Ben will seem to alienate himself from you farther.  It's often not on TV, so check it out from the video store some weekend.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Great A Film Should Be...,"I've heard a lot of mixed reviews on The Graduate, and most of the time the negative reviewers judge the movie the wrong way. I see it like this...The movie is as perfect as the movie should be. If they had to make a remake of this film, it wouldn't be as good as this one. This is possibly the only romantic comedy I know that has no flaws whatsoever. Basically what the movie is trying to tell people is that Ben Braddock is a teen who doesn't know what to do with his life. Many people of his age can relate to that. But when Ben is seduced by Mrs. Robinson and at the same time in love with her daughter Elaine, it becomes something much more and Ben must realize what to do with his problems.There's a couple of scenes where Ben is in the pool, looking like as if he's drowning. To me this means that he truly is ""drowning."" Drowning from his external problems... the pressure from his parents, from Mrs. Robinson, and the pressure from Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine. He really doesn't know what to do with his ""life.""The movie is just pure brilliance.

This movie answers all of these questions, and more, along with having the best folk soundtrack in the history of movie-making (tracks from 3 Simon & Garfunkel records plus a custom title track written  by Simon & Garfunkel).  Dustin Hoffman plays a mixed up ""track star"" just graduated from college and looking for something to do with his life, when suddenly, at his graduation party, the wife of a close family friend locks herself in a room with Dustin and throws herself at him.This is the film that launched Dustin Hoffman's career.Look for a 9-word cameo by Richard Dreyfus 5 minutes from the end.Good to watch on a slow-mo VCR or DVD to see if Anne Bancroft really was topless or whether something else is flashed at Dustin while locked in the room !",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
good enough to watch,"The Graduate is about Ben, who just finished college who is advised by Mr Robinson to relax a bit and enjoy life. He ends up being seduced by Mrs Robinson as her marriage was forced onto her after she got pregnant with their daughter Elaine. The movie pretty much becomes Ben not knowing what he wants to do with his life whilst being in a secretive relationship with Mrs Robinson and everything comes ahead when Elaine comes home from Berkely. Mr Robinson and others want a relationship between Elaine and Ben, but Mrs Robinson works against this.The Graduate is a good film. However, I do not see a world where a young girl with a stable relationship with her boyfriend would end up being okay with being in relationship with a dude who had an affair with her mom resulting in their parents divorcing. So that sequence of events seems very forced on the idea the guy should get the girl. I would also say I might have preferred The Graduate if it was directed with the focus point on Mrs Robinson. Ben is an interesting character but a bit boring.Acting from everyone was good. Ben is supposed to be a non-experienced life character, so Dustin Hoffman did act him as timid, however sometimes he did overdo it.The filming was really nice, the movie proved me wrong. I previously did not think movies prior to the 80s did scene transitions. I also can see why people always talk about technicolor, sad some modern movies don't have it as this was the colours were vibrant, I did not need to increase my vibrancy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Love Mrs. Robinson,"The movie The Graduate which was directed by Mike Nichols in 1967 is a great story about a young boy and an older woman next door becoming intimate lovers by having an affair. Benjamin Braddock who was played by famous actor Dustin Hoffman is a boy who has just graduated college and is just turning 21 throughout the movie. He then encounters his next door neighbor's wife, Mrs. Robinson who makes him driver her home and then tries to seduce him which is unsuccessful. Then they end up by getting a hotel and start their affair with each other. This goes on for a little bit and then Benjamin is forced out on a date with the Robinson's daughter Elaine. Mrs. Robinson is furious at this and tells Benjamin not to go and he tells her not to worry he doesn't want her daughter.He takes her out and she has such a bad time that she runs out crying from the strip club he had taken her too. He chases after her and ends up by kissing her and from then on he was in love with her. The difference between Mrs. Robinson and Elaine was that Benjamin liked the mother because she was beautiful and it was purely a sexual relationship. Elaine was different though he actually cared and loved for her and wanted to be with her. From there the mother confronts Benjamin and forces him to tell Elaine that he had an affair with her mother. She immediately cuts him out of his life and goes off to school. Where Benjamin finds her and tries to win her back, unfortunately her parents get in the way once again and she ends up by getting married to her boyfriend. He breaks into the wedding and interrupts the ceremonies and then Elaine and him see each other face to face and run away with each other onto a bus, with everyone chasing behind after them. I thought that it was interesting to see in the end that he acted the same way with Elaine as he did with her mother all along, and that was being silent or even secluding himself from the outside world. We saw him laying on the bed or the float in the pool seemingly forever throughout the movie. Then we see a different side of him when he starts hanging out with Elaine but then at the end of the movie it seemed like he was in his same state of seclusion as before. We see him just staring out into space sitting in the back of the bus with his lover Elaine right next to him. He didn't even look at her as well as not talking to her and that's how the scene ends. Also with the movie bringing in over 100 million dollars in sales with only putting in 3 million into the movie. Also with Simon & Garfunkel having numerous tracks in the movie corresponding with the narration was a big hit with the audiences back then, thus giving then even bigger genre of people coming to see the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,"Dustin Hoffman is great in this as the impressionable twenty-one year old ""Ben"" who falls prey to the wiles of the woman immortalised by Simon & Garfunkel. ""Mrs Robinson"" (Anne Bancroft) is married to the husband of his father's business partner. She is sexy, alluring, sophisticated - and he, well he is just young, naive and horny. Their assignations proceed with few problems but in parallel, his own family are trying to hook him up with her daughter ""Elaine"" (Katharine Ross). The plot thickens and poor old ""Ben"" finds him self more and more conflicted, Whom might he choose? Whom might he be allowed to choose? Can their secret stay just that? What, I think, keeps this stylish effort from Mike Nichols relevant fifty-odd years later is it's ability to expose the human, visceral, need for sex, for love, for ""more"" - without graphically demonstrating it! How characters evolve into more rounded, measured, less ""instant"" human beings - and Hoffman carries that development role off perfectly. Bancroft is simply a class act. She manages to morph from glamorous wife and mother to seductress and back again with a distinct panache and chic that is both menacing and tantalising in equal measure. You just know that the equilibrium, the balance of power and dependency between the two will change, it has to - but how? That's the question. At what cost - collateral, emotional, personal? The production standards are excellent, the dialogue potent and the chemistry between the initially hapless Hoffman and Bancroft palpable. Of course, a memorable soundtrack helps it along too and if you can see this on a big screen, then it's well worth the effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seriously overrated,"As much as this film is famous, it promises more than it delivers. While it may have been indeed ¬´culturally, historically or aesthetically significant¬ª, it is far from being good. There are some elements of comedy, such as the lead character's embarrassment whenever Mrs. Robinson is seducing him and his famous line ¬´Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me¬ª. Other than light comedy, this movie is worth for Dustin Hoffman's talent and charisma, Simon & Garfunkel's brilliant music and for the 1966 Alfa Romeo Spider 'Duetto' (a car with character, a great engine sound and lines to die for).But a good movie? Definitely not! And just because it is old that doesn't make it a classic.Here we see a young Dustin Hoffman in the role of Benjamin Braddock, a recently university graduate worried about his future. Even then he already had the same face and big nose. It's a surprise to see Dustin portraying such a shy and nervous character, that really made the actor seem extremely tense.Another surprise is to see Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson. I will always remember him as the mayor Larry Vaughn from 'Jaws'.I didn't even like much 'The Graduate' for a start and that ending was clearly over the top.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, but not what people say it is.","So many reviews of this movie talk about benjamin (dustin hoffman's character) being a ""rebel"". And many reviews i've read now feel that the movie is out of date because he no longer seems like a rebel. I don't know what rebellion they're talking about. Benjamin is not portrayed as a rebel at all, he is a somewhat jerky guy who is at a (seemingly) monumental time in his life, where he should chart out the course of his life but has no idea of where he should be headed and no standard but his own emotions to guide him.Notice how after his affair with Mrs. Robinson begins, He suddenly feels no need to fight his fear of the future, and just lies around all day. To him, this affair seems to answer all his needs, and he is no longer motivated to try to do anything else except lie around and meet mrs. robinson in the evenings.I read reviews where the reviewer said when they first saw it, they cheered for benjamin's rebellious behavior. I don't get it. At no point in this movie did i want to cheer for benjamin, but i could sympathise with him.If you know nothing about the movie, you should know that it does not follow the formula of hero, heroine, conflict, resolution, happy ending (jurassic park, armageddon; romantic comedies; any old musical). In fact, there is no heroic character at all in this movie. BUT, at no point is tragedy forced into the story for drama's sake. the people all act like real people would, and the story is pretty straight-forward. If you liked movies like fargo, american beauty, or godfather 2, you shouldn't have any problem with this movie.It seems kind of dated to me for two reasons: the simon & garfunkel soundtrack seems a little pretentious, lyrics-wise (""hello darkness, my old friend"") where music today seems to be a little less earnest, and the camera work is not as fluid as today's movies are.All that said, it is an ""entertaining"" story, which left me thinking not about affairs or careers or love or plastics, but about how we should make decisions. Is there a better way than where my heart leads me? Do i always know what's best?",,Anonymous,Romance
the presentiment of something important there,"perfectly evokes that certain feeling; being able to say that about a movie is the biggest compliment you can pay it; this is true for art in general, to have nothing to say but ""that feeling that that movie is to me, I know that feeling, it is in me and outside of me, I love it."" Back to the graduate, let's talk a little about the feeling, floating in the pool, dull but deep aching, the presentiment of something important there, the detatchment from the world, the singularity of it, it is the soil of greatness, the state which allows for great love that is not bound by conventions of society...It's a blue movie too, a good color blue, and a great soundtrack also; I love Elaine, don't we all?

Good job Mrs. Robinson!,"When people think of the movie that gave the boost to Dustin Hoffman's career, they think of ""The graduate"" which is totally correct in my opinion. However, even though he got a nomination for his role as Ben Braddock, and considering the fact that he is my favorite actor, I must admit that I believe he did such a good job in the movie because he was acting with one of the best actresses of all-time, Anne Bancroft.  I believe that the team they made is really what makes this movie an American classic.Ben Braddock (Hoffman) has just graduated and so his parents decide to host a grand party in his honor and attending the party is Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft).  She manages to get Braddock to take her home and even gets him trapped in her daughter's bedroom as she stands totally naked in front of him.  Completely out of control, Braddock tries to break out of the room but Mrs. Robinson keeps him inside explaining to him that if he ever wants her services, all he has to do is call her.The next week, Braddock calls Mrs. Robinson and asks her to spend a night with him at a motel.  She agrees under the one condition which is that he must never take her daughter out on a date.  However, when Mrs. Robinson's daughter (Katharine Ross) returns home from college, Ben's father tells his son he should take her out on a date just out of courtesy and this is when everything starts screwing up.Fine performances by Bancroft, Hoffman, and Ross, great directing by Nichols, and excellent music by ""Simon and Garfunkel"" are what make this one superb.  The only flaw the movie has is a rather simple dialogue but the originality of the script is so good that it helps back-up the movie's only weak spot.  Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Coming of age or dragged in,"Finally I've seen it. One of the most authentic films ever made. I guess at the date of release on a lot of movies, and am usually within 2 or 3 years. But I was off by 5 years, and the Hoffman film with a colossal cast of supporting actors was in theaters in 1967. Totally and thoroughly enjoyed this movie which felt like a cultural predecessor of the ""me era"". If Mrs. Robinson(Elaine's mother) was not the epitome of a selfish, sad, hateful and probably scorned woman, I don't know who ever was. I don't think any of the assorted cast from ""Bewitched"" were that way(there were several at the party at the hotel). I get the idea that the Robinsons were loaded and Ben's family was not. It was difficult to grasp that concept. Shortly after coming home from school, Ben met the elder Mrs. Robinson and it looked like Ben picked up the tab for the room. This was a nice hotel. A lot of movies made at that time did not ever get transferred, and it's very cool to see the archives or things of days gone by. Like that hotel. Motels usually worked well for me in my late teens.Ben's parents see their son lounging about ""a few weeks"" after he graduates from college. They worry he will not get on with their life. Ben has a new playmate, and the arrangement is one that makes him happy despite the fact that his girlfriend/lover has become very possessive. This emotion plays an important part later in the movie. None of the humor in The Graduate is silly or shallow. The things that Ben says to his elders is at times direct and obvious, a little ingratiating(to them) and sometimes sarcastic. Screenplay in terms of scene changes is fresh and new--nothing I see in more recent or modern movies competes well with the movie in that sense of direction. I only now see there were seven Oscar nominations and one win for Best Director. There were more than one light in the thoughtful movie besides Dustin Hoffman-- the other one who's movies have lasted are Katharine Ross, who was in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A true classic film for the 1960's generation,"What memorable characters and vivid portrayals by all concerned! It was the summer of love and a time for questioning traditional values. 1967 California is perfectly captured in this charming comedy. Who can ever forget Mrs. Robinson or the final hilarious scenes in the church and bus? Many do not realize that the introspective folk rock songs of Simon & Garfunkel had already been established hits before being adapted into this soundtrack.In 1967 there had been race riots in Detroit and a few other cities, a prelude to worse riots that would come in 1968. At the end of the year the Academy gave the Best Picture Oscar to ""In the Heat of the Night."" I suspect they felt it was the politically correct thing to do. However, the Best Director award was rightfully given to Mike Nichols of ""The Graduate.""

The starting of the movie is fine, seems funny, a 'mamas boy' stuck to doing what his parents want. His only escape to become a real 'man' and independent is by having an affair with Mrs.Robinson. That part is also fine, and funny too. But when Elaine gets into the picture, things move without any sense or plan in mind. One scene Elaine is mad with Ben(and this is the first time we see her), then next she wants him to kiss her, then they want to get married..suddenly Mrs.Robinson his calling the cops on Ben ( mainly because she had asked him to stay away from Elaine and he did not, now why he was asked to stay away is questionable )...full of unanswered questions and no solid plot.... By the end it seemed like a waste of time.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not the film it was,"There is plenty to like in The Graduate.  From the masterful technical work - great camera and editing, even by the standards of cinema 35 years later - to the wonderfully ambiguous ending.However, there's plenty to not like too.  I don't personally connect with Hoffman's performance.  I can't imagine how anyone ever did for that matter (odd considering how good he usually is.)  Which of course would be of top-most importance in order for the film to work.  I found the dialogue to very stilted too.  Possibly a difference in the era it was made in, but I don't recall feeling the same way about other films of the day.  The Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack didn't fire on all cylinders either.  Not really S&Gs fault.  The single most ineffective element of this was the repeated use of 'Scarsborough Fair' in rapid successive reprise.  'Mrs. Robinson' is used similarly, but works as it appears to have been recorded (not the version you will find on ""The best of S&G"" and be familiar with) not only for the film (of course, hence the specific reference) but for the specific sequence of Benjamin rushing from L.A. to Berkley to Santa Barbara.  'Scarsborough Fair' in contrast seems lazily added back to back... to back.  If I'm going to hear it three times in the film, I would hope it was spread through the film.  Sadly, not the case.The thing which stood out most for me is definitely a societal difference from then to today.  In the same fashion that ""Taming of the Shrew"" doesn't work in a modern context and seems misogynist, I found that ""The Graduate"" was a film wherein the main character was a stalker who was given an inappropriate and ineffective attempt at making him sympathetic.  Where that once worked to the point of being Oscar worthy, it now comes across in a flaccid manner.",,Anonymous,Romance
Beyond Goofs,"Have seen this film so many time I talk along with the characters. The theme of glass and water is shown over and over and no one can explain what it's supposed to mean. The goofs listed on this cite are really very trivial and don't affect the film too much. However; please answer the following: 1. How does Elaine find out where he is staying in Berkeley? She suddenly just bursts into his room to confront him. How does she get into the building? How does she know what room he's in? How does her father find out where he's living and waits for him in the apartment. Did Mr. Roper just let him in? 2. If Mrs. Robinson claimed Benjamin raped her, why did she never report it? 3. How does Benjamin know which fraternity Karl Smith belongs to? He just shows up and asks about him leading to the chase. 4. When he get to Santa Monica, he turns into a gas station and quickly rips through the yellow pages trying to contact Karl's father. I imagine there are more than one Smith in the book...even more than one Dr. Smith. How is it he's able to figure out which one is the right one? ""Hey father....need any gas?"" With it all, probably the most entertaining film I've ever seen. The only problem is Hoffman's voice. You can barely understand him sometimes. ""I want my life to be different"" one of his first lines is usually followed by someone in the audience going ""What did he say?""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
HK Neo Reviews: The Graduate,"As much I love movies, I actually never thought, I would watch a 60s classic. In saying so, The Graduate isn't your usual clich√© fair; in fact it is something special. Apart from launching Dustin Hoffman's career, The Graduate provides a cynical view on love, relationships and life. In doing so, it feels more like a Woody Allen movie and without a doubt for the next 40-50 years it has inspired, referred or referenced by many other films. I remember in 500 Days of Summer, there is a quote ‚Äì ""Tom completely mis-read The Graduate"". Years ago, I will probably have mis-read this film as well, perhaps it is timely I waited till now. Regardless, this is truly a wonderful film and a magnificent soundtrack to bootNeo rates it 9/10.www.thehkneo.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Use of Filming Techniques,"The Graduate is a wonderful film to look at either for its sheer entertainment value, or to analyze.  The use of camera angles to depict feelings is extremely well done, as was the sound track, and the music was well used.  The montages in the middle of the film were excellent pieces that developed the characters in a wonderful way.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,"The Graduate is somewhat set in its time, with some elements carrying over to the present day. The sense of rebellion of Benjamin's generation is made clear throughout the film in its own quirky way. Dustin Hoffman's acting was simply outstanding; he played the lost, awkward character of Benjamin quite well. Anne Bancroft also portrayed a strong role as the confident, desirable mother. The editing of the film is also worth noting. The various montage sequences are very well put together, particularly the bed-to-pool scene. I'd consider the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack to be timeless, and the movie would not be the same without it. The Graduate may seem a bit dated to a younger audience, but the editing, acting, and soundtrack are some things that make it worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent Movie,"This movie is one of the better movies I have ever seen because all the aspects in the movie are perfect. First, the cast. Dustin Hoffman in one of the best role of his life. Totally nervous at the beginning, intimidated by Mrs. Robinson sensuality and toward the end completely in love and devoted with Elaine. Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross with also excellent roles. Anne Bancroft brought so much sensuality to the character in a very natural way. Second, the directing. An also excellent direction by Mike Nichols, in the pool scenes, in the scene when Ben sees Mrs. Robinson nude for the first time, in the wedding scene all possible by the great cinematography. The writing was excellent with phrases like ""Plastics"" or ""Mrs. Robinson you're trying to seduce me aren't you"". And finally the great music by Simon Garfunkel playing songs like ""The Sound of Silence"" or the greatest ""Mrs. Robinson"".This is a great movie for the ages, a true cinematographic jewel.

There are many very funny moments too, but in the end, many of the sequences stand out because they are technically brilliant. And for a comedy, that's a great achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Status well deserved,"I personally belong to ""generation X""; I seldom watch a film older than '79 because I have been mis-educated via TV that most pre-80s movies are dull and poorly edited. This film will open your eyes to the past greats. The shots, the cast, the story and the music are all first class. I did not expect to find such a gem in this film and I am pleasantly surprised. Some people may not be able to identify with the characters portrayed in this story. This is no Romeo and Juliet, rags to riches bullsh1t but a very real set of scenarios beautifully sculpted together, that I'm sure most men have experienced.There seems to be a few people out there who struggle with the concept of the female characters in this film, well I guess what follows can be taken as a guide for life. Yes women can be as dumb as men, think of the dumbest guy you know and then put him in a skirt; is he more intelligent than Katharine Ross's character? Probably not! The story between Dustin and Anne Bancroft is one of youth vs. experience as far as manipulation is concerned, look again if you can't believe what I'm saying. The people who call this film debauched or depraved obviously would prefer to live in insular communities of their own creation however this film doesn't take place in; The Bible, The Koran, dreams, make-belief or any other substitute for reality. This is the real world whether you shield your eyes from it or not.If you see a review below 7/10 then expect the reviewer to be a social outcast, so physically deformed that the characters and story portrayed, bare zero resemblance to them or their lives.

movie review,"This was a great movie. Ben Braddock played by Dustin Hoffman is a college graduate who ends up getting into a sexual relationship with his mother's friend Mrs. Robinson. This movie was made right after the Hays Code era and for good reason. This movie added to the definition of ""New Hollywood"" Sexually suggestive themes, partial nudity, swearing and overall morals that said go against the system. The music also had an awesome soundtrack, primarily Simon and Garfunkel. The movie was so well done. The movie was technicolor, shot in 35mm panavision. The cinematography was amazing. The movie had incredibly unconventional angles and even some shots were the camera would remain stationary and people would walk off and all you can notice is people talking out of the shot. I think after the code, it was a breath of fresh air for collaborating filmmakers, because so many films were made that would have never been approved anywhere before 1967.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Somebody Has To Say Something Different; A Dissenting View,"It is a sad fact of cinema history that when a film develops the reputation of a ""masterpiece"", it never loses the label no matter how outdated or worn out it becomes. I have to wonder if much of the praise on this page comes from people just being conformists.It is undeniable that THE GRADUATE spoke to a whole generation. But is it really as powerful now as it was then? I think not. The years have been unkind to it. Seen today, Hoffman's ""Benjamin Braddock"" character comes across as a bit of a jerk instead of as the heroic, young idealist he was seen as in 1967. Simultaneously, in 1967, Mrs. Robinson seemed ""sultry, sexy, with a hint of sinister"", as I heard one admirer once say. Today, though, she just seems like a pathetic wretch, and you wonder what Benjamin sees in her.We shouldn't be so afraid to say that what worked on screen in bygone years doesn't always hold up with the passing of time. THE GRADUATE is the perfect example of this. The ideals of the 1960s and early 70s are no longer today's ideals.",,Anonymous,Romance
It's the 60s Man,"I applaud the Graduate for challenging the mores of the time. Even today, young people are challenging their guardians more and more on life, love and the pursuit of happiness. My spouse and I eloped at age 21 and 20 respectively, and have been married 33 years now. Although, we eloped five years after this movie was made, and there would be an argument this movie had a profound effect on our lives, I would argue that point. I know there was no thought in my mind at the time relative to this movie, and I can't speak for the better half. Yet, this was an important movie about relationships and sex.Making this movie special is the music of Simon and Garfunkel so beautifully carved into the movie, the first of many running scenes for Dustin Hoffman, a stellar performance by Anne Bancroft, the interplay of emotions between Bancroft and Hoffman, and the message about plastics, which turned out more real than even the business community at that time and in the next fifteen years would know.

i loved it,"I simply adored this film. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant with Mrs Robinson...and simply divine with Elaine. I also loved the music(Simon and Garfunkel especially), it really got out the characters's state of mind. Everybody should see this movie, because it has it all: from great comedy to psychological drama. And the ending is simply wonderful- the whole image with Elaine in a bride's dress standing at the back of the buss with Benjamin and all the people staring at them, and them just smiling because what was it left to say?! This movie goes definitely into my top ten. It was full of symbols to. Take for instance the aquarium, or the fact that Ben started smoking after Mrs Robinson hit on him. Another great scene was at the Zoo near the monkey's cage, after Elaine left and in the corner appeared the sign: ""Do not tease"". I thought this was fantastic. Katherine Ross was great to. She was perfect for the role, and showed the complex personality of her character. I highly recommend The Graduate to everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Point for the Soundtrack,"Unlike the soundtrack, this movie does not stand the test of time. It always shows up on ""Greatest Movies of all Time"" but I'm not sure why. Perhaps you needed to be living in the 60s to appreciate it.

I gave it a 1 rating because the soundtrack is great. Movie was a waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Too High on the AFI,"To have this film ranked #7 on the AFI's 100 best list is an injustice to the majority of the films that followed. This is a good film, however, not top ten material.I'm not really sure why so many people have said that Dustin Hoffman gave an incredible performance in this film. Sure he showed emotions of confusion (although very naive for a college graduate) but how hard is it to make somebody think that you are confused? I believe that Anne Bancroft gave the only credible performance to this film. Whatever Mrs. Robinson's motives were for getting Benjamin into bed will always remain a mystery to me, and you can tell that Mrs. Robinson even has her doubts as well. Katherine Ross had the only other role of substance as the daughter of the Mrs. Robinson, and seems just as confused as Benjamin does throughout the film. Other than a few scenes of emotion, Ross adds very little to the film.The ending of this film has its great points - the whole exiting the church and taking off on a bus part, and its lackluster points - would you go off with a guy who slept numerous times with your mother on your wedding day? The music by Simon and Garfunkel played well throughout the film, although ""Scarborough Fair"" just might have been played to death. Nichols did a very good job directing this film, especially the scene in which Benjamin is to meet all of his parents friends after coming home from college. Look for Richard Dreyfuss as the dorm student who says that he will call the cops.8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A classic tale of Anomie, Alienation and Meaning","This is a wonderful film. Benjamin is a college graduate lost in a venal, empty universe, a ""plastic"" world. Against this backdrop, Benjamin (literally) drifts, unable to find something that stirs his need for meaning. Director Mike Nichols' visualization of this post-collegiate anomie--Hoffman floating in a pool, virtually catatonic, or waddling helplessly through crowds of gawking adults in awkward scuba gear--are unforgettable, as are Hoffman's and Anne Bancroft's touching performances...Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson, her hardened aggressiveness concealing the hurt of a child, is particularly fantastic. Nichols' takes us along on Benjamin's journey from Mrs. Robinson's burnt-out, cynical embrace to his sudden realization, under the red lights of a seedy strip-club, that some things are still pure and unsullied. In the end, Nichols' direction elevates Benjamin's ensuing struggle to something broader, more profound--we feel Benjamin is fighting not only for the girl he loves, not only against her cynical parents, but for a life with integrity against a bankrupt and wasted society.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Small acts of youth rebellion,"The Graduate is generally praised as one of the ultimate youth rebellion films of the 1960s. True, it was made in a time when many teens were searching for some way to rebel against various aspects of society--parents, government and other standard conventions of American society. However, it is not entirely as rebellious as it is made out to be. Benjamin Braddock is a college graduate, confused and lost. There are many occasions throughout the film where the audience can sense his feelings of entrapment and confusion. ""I'm a little worried about my future,"" is a line that is consistently repeated in the beginning of the film when he is seemingly trapped at his welcome back party. The entire party sequence is filled with images of being trapped. The camera is extremely close to all of the people, every time Benjamin tries to get out of the room where he is he is blocked off by another guest, and he is being flooded with others' acknowledgements of his past successes. When Benjamin finally escapes to his bedroom to drown out the noise of the party, we get the sense that he is truly lost and very worried that he will be a disappointment to his family and all the people who are at this party. The opening sequence of the film, when he is in the airport on the moving sidewalk and ""The Sound of Silence"" is playing, we get the sense that up until now he has just been kind of floating through life, being told what to do and being taken in one direction or another without having any real say in the situation. The three acts of rebellion that seem apparent during the film are this: his relationship with his father's business partner's wife, Mrs. Robinson, his feelings for her daughter Elaine Robinson, and the waste of his mind. The relationship with Mrs. Robinson is very rebellious in the sense that it's an affair, and an affair with someone whom he has supposed to be respecting and looking up to during his life. Mr. Robinson gives Ben advice in the beginning of the film and it is at that point that we really understand why it would be so truly radical if he slept with Mrs. Robinson (besides the fact that she's old enough to be his mother). Later on, after being told to stay away from Elaine by Mrs. Robinson, he falls in love with her anyway and goes to extreme lengths to be able to share his future with her. It is apparent that he really just needed a connection with someone more his age who could understand all of the decisions he had to make and the confusion that he was suffering from. After he meets and talks to Elaine it is clear to him that although he may not know what he wants from life, he knows that he wants Elaine in his life. The biggest act of rebellion that is seen in this film seems to be the waste of his educated mind. Benjamin wastes away his summer floating in the pool of his parents' house and sneaking off to a hotel to have sex with a married family friend. He does not use the education he has just received to try to find a job or to make a difference in some way. Instead he feels comfortable with his life, at one point telling his father ""I would say I'm just drifting¬Öit's very comfortable just to drift here."" These ""rebellious"" acts are not entirely the same acts of rebellion that the real youth of America were performing at the time this film was made. Benjamin does not have long hair or dress in any way to make him stand out like the hippie generation of the time, he does not make any political or radical statements with his rebellion¬óonly rebellion from the conventions of suburbia during this time. It is clear that he does not want to become like his parents, it is clear that he does not want to look at life as though he is looking through the lens of the scuba diving suit that his father bought for him. He is not trying to make any radical change in the world, but in himself, and that is really where the rebellion comes into pay.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A really enjoyable movie, above all things.","When people think of this movie they often seem to forget that this actually a comedy. And a pretty good one it is!It's a very simple movie, in about every way imaginable. It was a very cheap film to make, with a very simple and straightforward story in it but none of this is a downside really, since the movie actually is all more about being subtle with its approach and its storytelling.Its simplicity actually makes this a very honest and sweet little film. It makes the characters human and believable ones and all of the emotions and actions within this movie sensible and easy to identify with.But like I said, people foremost shouldn't forget that this is actually being a comedy. It's so easy to see or remember this movie as a drama, with perhaps some thriller elements in it, since the premise of the movie actually make it seem that way. It's also not really a comedy that tries to force its comedy upon you. Just like the entire movie; the comedy is subtle. It's also not the sort of stuff that will make you laugh at loud but it does occasional put on smile on your face and its approach makes the movie a very pleasant one to follow. You could really thank director Mike Nichols for this, since its a style and approach that he has mastered and has put to use in some of his other movies. Pretty surprising from a guy who prior to this had only directed one movie, which was a completely different one as well, namely; ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".The story does at times looses some of its focus though and we just have to assume- and take for granted a lot of things within the movie. This isn't always really working but it in no way ever makes the movie a bad one to watch, just a not perfect one, which is no big shame of course really.The movie is also being made really better by its actors. It actually made me realize once more what a great comedy actor Dustin Hoffman actually is. His delivery and timing is absolutely spot on at times. It actually was one of his first real movie roles, which makes his achievement ever more impressive. Also a fun fact hat he only was only 6 years Anne Bancroft's junior, even though in the story she was supposed to be twice the age of the Hoffman character.It's a (deliberatly) minimalistic made movie but that is really not saying anything about the quality of this movie, which is simply very high. Just take the Robert Surtees cinematography for instance, which was simply superb. It got also nominated for an Oscar and really should had won as well, in my opinion. The movie was further more nominated in 6 more categories but it strangely enough only won in the best director category. I say strangely enough, since it is quite unusual for a movie to only receive an Oscar for the best director and win nothing else. But Mike Nichols still of course deserved it though. It's a really well made and directed movie by him! It also was the only Oscar he has won, till date.A really good but above all things also a really enjoyable movie to watch! Even after all those years it hasn't lost any of its power.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
full of ambiguities and contradictions,"I've always had something of a problem with this film. At the time of its theatrical release I was the same age as Dustin Hoffman was playing in the film (even though he was actually ten years older) and I had just got married. Also, and certainly at the time more importantly, there was the music. I had been a great fan of Paul Simon's and this soundtrack seemed overly sweetened with the use of Garfunkel's voice. However that is all a long time ago now and I found much pleasure in watching this on Blu-ray. Hoffman still seems a bit old for a college kid rebelling against his parents, Anne Bancroft still doesn't strike me as sexy and the whole setting seems so awfully privileged and stifling, whilst, of course, at the same time allowing these 'kids' to motor around in sports cars and to give no thought to work. However, the film is well put together, the performances are uniformly good and Buck Henry's script seems spot on. Even if Hoffman's character does seem rather spoiled there is enough believable angst to have some sympathy and to enjoy the very end. Here, also though, I know notice, nothing is anything like as clear cut as seemed a few minutes earlier, which is good. The film is full of ambiguities and contradictions and it is why, in the end, it works so well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The watchability of this movie is timeless. Every single moment could easily be the highlight in any other film. No other movie I can remember has mastered this so well. Nichols never reached again this level of perfection. The dialogs are memorable, the silent scenes are even more. The soundtrack has survived the test of time.

A Haunting Classic,"It's true that ""the Graduate"" is a timeless masterpiece. It is also a piece of its time. As someone who experienced the sixties like Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), I have always recognized the film's ability to capture the zeitgeist of its time. Caught between changing sexual mores and the need to establish himself as a man, Ben feels unanchored. He is a product of his parents and his community, but he feels the need to break free of their stifling expectations.Ben seems to be collecting memories, not advancing toward any defined goals. He is, at his core, desperate. As the United States grapples with gender roles, racial upheaval, the onus of a wartime draft, and the ever-present threat of the cold war, Ben feels an anxious nation turning its expectant eyes to him and those of his generation.But Ben has no answers. He really has no idea where to begin to search for them. And so he is never running toward anything, always away. This is best exemplified by the final scene (which stands in marked contrast to the ending of ""Picnic"", for example).Director Mike Nichols, aided by the lyric poetry of Paul Simon's music, has created a film that is simultaneously the quintessence of the sixties and a component of its creation. No pretty boy, like the others who were lined up to play his role, Dustin Hoffman eschews the part of the early-laurelled head being ""chaired through the market-place"" and instead gives us an everyman performance that captures the world of possibilities and the falseness of that world's promises. We feel him struggle under the weight of ""eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase"", like ""plastics"".This is a film classic for its content and its style, which do transcend a moment, taking the viewer to an uncomfortable place, perhaps, but it might be the beginning of a run to some place better.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Scarborough Fair,"Despite the over playing of Scarborough Fair which drones ON and ON in the film (Simon and Garfunkel ROCK, but enough is enough...) this movie is fantastic.It's the story of a young man graduating college, at that great cross road in his life.  ""I'm a little worried about my future,"" Hoffman's character says throughout much of the film.  This movie redefined comedy, and pushed the boundaries of acceptable sexual material in a film.  This was Dustin Hoffman's breakthrough role, and, in my opinion, his best peice of work.WATCH IT!  It's well worth any rental or purchase price.  Also, it makes watching Wayne's World 2 ***A LOT*** FUNNIER.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Want to Know About Uncertainty? Ask Benjamin,"Who is the Graduate? He's every person on that narrow thread of time after school is over and adult work has yet to begin. I could really identify with Ben (Hoffman) when I was on the verge of graduating from college: I was staring into an abyss, an uncertain path which might go anywhere or nowhere; it was a scary prospect. This doesn't apply to those who have mapped out their next 10 years after college with icy precision. No, this is about indecision, lack of confidence, uncertainty - all applicable to Ben's character. It was why this picture was such a huge success, with young people, with older viewers curious to see their past or their kids' perspectives; Hoffman, though quite a bit older than a college joe when he played this role, easily captured the sense of uncertain youth, of a kid still a kid though suddenly expected to behave like a man. He gets a crash course on methods of being a man courtesy of Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft). It's too much too soon, but it sure unstuck him from a slog through extended childhood, and the other reason for the huge success. Back then, an older woman getting it on with such a young punk was unheard of - scandalous, really.The movie isn't perfect, nowhere near it: there are too many languid portions with that Simon-Garfunkel song piping in yet again. Unless you're a fanatic for their stuff, it wears thin by the 2nd half of the film. But it's this particular picture which made me realize how truly artistic a film can be, by comparison to most of the drivel released in the eighties, nineties and so on. I think this was only Nichol's 2nd film, but he laced it with suggestion and framing unheard of in later decades. There's the jungles just outside the nice housing in the background, the animal stripes on the woman in foreground; there she is, she's the predator and Hoffman is her unwary prey. The water motif, of being stuck, surrounded, suffocating - Hoffman at the bottom of the pool, his one brief escape from reality. Bancroft, tending to appear in frame as a reflection - is she a dream or a nightmare; both, of course. All the actors are close to perfect, including character actor Hamilton as the wronged but slimy Mr. Robinson; my favorite scene is when he confronts Ben in Ben's apartment near the end and calls him all those names, and Norman Fell appears looking befuddled as usual. And in the very end, Ben and his girl (Ross, her best role) are still on a road to nowhere, on a bus, of all things, a future very, very uncertain. The theme of the film holds true to the end. None of those pat Hollywood endings of the eighties and nineties. And so on.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
American Cinema Par Excellence,"The Graduate is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.  It is a film that works on a myriad of levels; as a comedy; as social commentary; as a coming of age film; as a satire about American family life; and as a pure entertainment.  The photography by Robert Surtees is visionary, it gives the film the precise look it needs to set the tone for the story and at times precedes the boldness of underexposure that cinematographers would delve into only a few years later.  The script by Buck Henry is marvelous and serves as all great scripts as both a foundation and springboard for great possibility.  In other words the nuances, the quirks, the subtleties that lend a film of the magnitude and resonance of The Graduate its distinctness always belong to the people that bring it to life, namely the actors and the director, but the screenwriter gives us the body.  The casting is one of those sort of conundrums or quirks of fate that all great works seem to have.  Initially, as the producer of this film talks about they were shooting for a more typical all-American cast particularly in the case of Benjamin Braddock the track star, but looking back at it now with 20/20 who can imagine anyone else playing the role of Benjamin the way Dustin Hoffman played it.  This illustrates that sometimes a project takes on this whole life-force.  I'm not saying that the film was destined to succeed, there is no doubt that the film is a testament to the hard fought genius of artists like Mike Nichols, Robert Surtees, Buck Henry, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Banecroft.  With that said there are these things, these curiosities, these chips that seem to fall into place, a perfect alignment of the stars.  But at the end of the day to me the most beautiful thing about the film is the story.  You have these two products (in Elaine and Benjamin) of the so-called all-American family who had Mrs. Robinson not interrupted would have no doubt married each other, it had been set up from the beginning. Note that when Ben comes over to the Robinson house to pick Elaine up Mr. Robinson says, ""It's about time you got around to this Braddock,"" and that Ben's parents are persistent in nagging their son to take Elaine Robinson out.  Perhaps things are not so different in America after all.  If Mrs. Robinson hadn't intervened then there would have been nothing unique about the story.  But of course she does, she wants something for herself, to take something that her daughter might have had and to possess it for herself, in a sad way it is her last attempt at trying to reach out and connect with someone, and after it is over it is too late for her, she is dead.  In the end despite the brief road block of Elaine being married off to Carl Smith, Benjamin's back-up since Benjamin was deemed by Elaine's parents to be inadequate, they have set things back on course, but not before shaking them up, and doing it their way.  But then we have the ominous and somewhat ambiguous ending where both characters get on the bus and go through different emotions, but not at the same time, portending the all too often uneven ebb and flow of a husband and wife.  In the end these two characters must accept that in spite of all their kicking, scratching, world-shaking and hell-raising there is only so far they can go, they can only be so different.  They are still going to get married, they have taken a slight detour, only to realize in the end that perhaps there is only one road.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A timeless classic that is a must see....,"The Graduate is a remarkable movie with its dry humored, anti-establishment theme. Dustin Hoffman gives a wonderfully underplayed performance while Anne Bancroft delivers a foward, aggressive and sexual role perfect for the part. Symbolism is an important part in this movie and the fish tank motif truly represents the feeling of alienation from the corrupt adult culture and the pulling away from youth. The soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel embodies Ben's disdain with the materialistic sub-culture that he is expected to conform to... ""hello darkness my old friend, I've come to talk to you again..."" And everybody knows that there is a promising future in plastics...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My #2 favorite film of all time,"How can a film feel as fresh and original now as it was 40 years ago? If the Graduate was released today for the first time it would be as good, maybe even better, as it was back then.Mike Nicols revolutionized film directing. The timing of the acting is impeccable between the chemistry of Hoffman and Bancroft. The soundtrack is easily one of the greatest if not the best. The script perfectly reflects the sexual revolution of its time. The dialogue and situations are poetically offbeat and hilarious. Benjamin Braddock may be the one of the most brilliantly developed character in film history.This is an absolute must for the student of film in everyone of us.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A biting satire against upper middle class boredom,"Dustin Hoffman's offbeat, quirky, Benjamin Braddock is one of the most interesting and realized characters in movie history.  His cluelessness and disillusion after college, and the resulting affair with the infamous Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), are told in such a empathetic way that you completely understand the choices he is making, even though they are the result of sporadic behavior and poor judgment.  This leads to perhaps the most gratifying ending in movie history, as our hero breaks free from upper middle class oppression to make a wild and romantic gesture that ultimately may save him from the unoriginality his life seemed destined to be heading towards.  Katherine Ross is delightful as the object of Benjamin's unique affection, and the soundtrack is the perfect punctuation point for Benjamin's confusion and desperation.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Absolute Classic,"After viewing this film, I fell in love with it!  The film not only launched Hoffman as one of the greatest actors of all time, but was a wonderful film that not only was a serious drama, and touching romance, but also a slap-yer-knee funny film!  Although it was nominated for Best Picture in 1967, it lost to ""In The Heat of the Night,"" which I haven't seen yet, and can't say if it's better!What was most enjoyable about the film was how I could relate with Hoffman's shyness.  He didn't like being around his parents friends, and the acting was so wonderful to show how bashful he really was.If you have not seen this film yet, rent it tonight or buy it!  You won't regret it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Here's to You, Mrs. Robinson","The Graduate is a 1967 film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. The story follows Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate, who is not quite sure what he wants to do with his life. Faced with family and neighbors with high expectations, Benjamin finds himself apathetic and depressed. When Mrs. Robinson, an older woman and friend of the family, approaches Benjamin with a proposition, the young man finds temporary solace in her arms.The Graduate is a fantastic movie with interesting characters and great cinematography. Hilarious and emotionally stirring, the film carries you along with a terrific soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel. Dustin Hoffman plays his role wonderfully and the casting for the characters is perfect.Although The Graduate is a superb film, the third act falls short. This movie and many of it's kind make you wonder where the line is between hopelessly romantic and criminally inappropriate. While the ending is thoughtful, the climax is stale and generic.Overall, The Graduate is an absolute must-watch. With elements of comedy, romance, drama, and characters with quite a bit of depth, nearly any audience can enjoy this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,"The Graduate (1967) directed by Mike Nichols was one of the first films that became known as a New-Age Hollywood film. Many scenes made this film a New-Age Hollywood film. The whole scene where Benjamin took Mrs. Robinson home and she tried to seduce him. That scene would have broken a rule in the Hayes Code. In a later scene they showed the man and woman in the same bed, and they also slept together. Also a line that was said where Benjmin said ""God damn it"" was not allowed had this movie been made 3 or 4 years previous. This whole movie was really about an affair.

A New Film For the Time,"This film was a new kind of film for it's time. For one it showed things which never would have been shown before such as nudity, dry humor, and a love affair. I enjoyed the scene when the main character Banjamin is under water in his scuba suit and all you can hear is the sound of him breathing into the air tank. I feel as though this is a metaphor for how he really feels with his life. For one, he just graduated from college and his parents are expecting great things from him. This puts a lot of pressure on him because he does not know exactly what he wants to do. I feel as though it represents how he feels he has no where to turn, and he is just drowning in his own life. I liked how this film showed the consequences for infidelity. It is also a very romantic love story, seeing as how Benjamin will do anything to prove to Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine how much he loves her. It is interesting to see how the affair between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson turns out, and what happens between Ben and Elaine.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"This is a brilliant dark comedy that captures the uncertainty that surrounds a person after a formalized chapter of his life has come to a close.

An introspective masterpiece with some of the best characters ever created,"Mike Nichols, absolute master of the craft.What a journey. The movie presents itself as a shallow, fun and exotic comedy but in reality hides deep in itself so many hints for an existential introspection all for the viewer to explore. The structure, the editing, the cinematography show us why Nichols is one of the greats and why I was really blown away excited by what I was seeing. The characters are just so deeply studied and brilliantly performed: for more than half of it I thought that Mrs. Robinson was actually one of the good guys and that she had something to her that made her really complex and fascinating to read and I wish I'd seen her more; one of the best villains of all time. Even though we are left with some questions to be answered (like what was the dynamic between the families? Was it something that happened in the past that led the Robinson's to act like that toward Benjamin?) the finale makes us forget everything, answering the question that matters the most. As a big fanatic of music in movies I have to say that I don't mind Simon&Garfunkel being played over and over and actually it worked better than some other movies (it was one of the first movies to have not composed music in a film).Fantastic movie with some great driving sequences. What a vibe.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You are scum! You are filth! Your a degenerate!,"***SPOILERS*** Even though it ended up becoming one of the biggest movie hits of all times ""The Graduate"" had trouble getting any of the major Hollywood studios to distribute it! With them feeling that it's story was either too spicy or it's cast with with exception of Anne Bancroft, as Mrs. Robinson, too unknown to make the film profitable. As it turned out the 3 million dollars it took to make the movie ended up cashing in some 200 million, in the USA and aboard, for the almost unknown Embessy Pictures who took the chance in distributing it.After graduating with honors, as the debating team captain and top track and field star, from collage Ben Braddock, Dustin Hoffman,had the world at his feet with a bright future ahead of him. What turned out to be Ben's insecurity in his shyness in making friends with the opposite sex that soon ended up turning into a nightmare for him. Long time family friend Mrs. Robinson seeing the young man at a coming home reception set her sights on him in both deflowering Ben and making him her both secret lover and personal sex toy.Tricking Ben to drive her home Mrs. Robinson gets the confused and shy collage boy all alone! She then starts to both flirt and disrobe, doing a very sexy and provocative strip tease right in front of the shocked and startled young man. At first resisting Mrs. Robinson's advances Ben soon gives into them having a wild and illicit affair with her. It's when Mrs. Robinson's 20 year old daughter Elaine, Katherine Ross, came home from collage on the East Coast that this cozy relationship between Ben and Mrs. Robinson starts to fall apart. In that even though Mrs. Robinson felt nothing wrong with her, a married woman, having an affair with Ben she at the same time was outraged that he would end up very possibly doing the very same thing with her both single and available daughter Elaine!Even though at first Ben is anything but interested in Elaine the fact that he was matched up with her by both his parents and the unsuspecting Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilion), who was unaware that Ben was having an affair with his wife, Mrs. Robinson turned both vicious and vindictive towards the by now emotionally destroyed Ben Braddock!As much as he tires to avoid it Ben falls in love with Elaine but when Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose his relationship with her Ben, what I think stupidly, beats her to the punch! It's with Ben confessing that he once was ""making it"" with her mom that Elaine, who at first was in love with him, throws him out of her, the Robinson residence, house and cuts Ben out of her life forever!Even tough it was the best part of the movie Ben's attempt to win Elaine back never seemed to ring true. Instead of the sensitive and feeling person that he was at the beginning of the film Ben turned out to be a down right and, for the most part, unfeeling jerk in the end.Hounding Elaine all throughout the city of San Francisco, that he traveled to from his home in L.A, where she was enrolled in Berkley Collage a hot bed for student activation Ben both insulated and humiliated Elaine at every opportunity. It was when Ben found out that Elaine had a boyfriend medical student Carl Smith, Brian Avery, that he really went to work on her. Ben soon gets under Elaine's skin by him gleefully taunting her in public, in the Berkley Collage Library, about when she first made it with Carl. This has Elaine leaving the sneering and nosy jerk in a rush and in tears! It made you wonder why Elaine would have anything to do with Ben again but amazingly she did!***SPOILER ALERT*** Despite the films many shortcomings in it trying to make Ben Braddock a hero or just plain nice guy the outrageous actions of Ms. Robinson more then made you forget as well as overlook Ben's hurtful actions, towards Elaine, in it. The by now legendary and unforgettable ending at Elaine and Carl's wedding ceremony has Ben snatch Elaine just moments after she and Carl took their wedding vows. You wonder why Elaine was so happy to at first become Carl's wife and then, on a dime, decide to leave him for an almost insane and hysterically acting Ben! As unsound and unrealistic as both Ben and Elaine's actions at the very end of the movie were they still made a hell of a happy ending!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
American Cinema Par Excellence,"The Graduate is undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made.  It is a film that works on a myriad of levels; as a comedy; as social commentary; as a coming of age film; as a satire about American family life; and as a pure entertainment.  The photography by Robert Surtees is visionary, it gives the precise look the film needs to set the tone for the story and precedes the boldness of underexposure that cinematographers would delves into only a few years later.  The script by Buck Henry is marvelous and a serves as all the script as both a foundation and springboard for great possibility.

This is really *that* good; but not perfect (and so what),"The Graduate is a ""must see"" film for its fun and inventive cinematography, terrific acting, bold and cynical screenplay by Buck Henry, and certainly, its tour-de-force ending with a wan future upon wan smiles.  Other comments I've read complain about Katherine Ross's acting (I disagree), the overuse of Simon and Garfunkel music to move things along (maybe overdone), the unbelivability of the plot (in context, it has consistency), and that some scenes just go on for too long (perhaps, like the underwater diver pool scene).  But these are truly minor quibbles among an otherwise splendid quirky view of a spoiled, nihilistic, horny and obsessive rich kid in the California 60s.

A boy trapped in his parents shadow looking for an escape with his parents hot friend.,"The film was very good. There were a lot of great qualities to the movie. First off, the acting was fantastic. The main two characters, Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, really played their roles well and made you either have empathy for them or hate them at times. The editing had an impact on the film, making it stand out. There are a couple scenes where they are dissolving and jarred to represent his point of view. The yellow coloring of the film made the feel of it more old school and as though him and his family live in this perfect little world. Aside from Cinematography, the meaning behind the Graduate was very important. It really showed that breaking out of your shell is harder than it seems. Not only that, but it shows that the stereotypical prep boys don't actually have it all. They actually are trapped in a world following their parents footsteps and can't act outside how they're expected to behave.

`The Graduate' graduates Hoffman from amateur actor to a great professional.,"The Graduate, a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols is a wonderful film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft.Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a graduate from Berkley college has just arrived back home to find that there is a graduation party for him. He feels a little down throughout the entirety of the party and then he meets up with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). She asks if he could take her home in his new car, as she cannot drive. When they get to her house, we learn that she has known Ben for his entire life and that her husband is Mr.  Braddock's boss. They have a few drinks and then go up to her room, where she gets undress. (`Can you get that zipper for me Benjamin?') Ben thinks he is trying to be seduced and is frightened out of his wits. What would happen if Mr. Robinson came home? Mrs. Robinson goes to the bathroom and she undresses, then comes into her bedroom, naked. Ben is there, and is scared out of his wits. A car is heard. Mr. Robinson is home! Mrs. Robinson presses herself onto the door while telling him that it is perfectly okay and Ben grabs the doorknob trying to get out. He does without Mr. Robinson knowing that he saw his wife naked, but he does see Mr. Robinson. And they have a long conversationTrying to ¬ëwin back' Mrs. Robinson, Ben asks her to go to a hotel to get a drink at night. She accepts and unbeknownst to her, he rents a room. They sleep together for the first time, and they  talk in the darkness of a hotel room. After several times of this adultery, we learn that Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross) is coming home.

Mrs. Robinson tells him that he must make sure that she doesn't like him.

Yes, it is a master class in it's use in photography & cinematography and the abundance of techniques on display makes for a wonderful tool in teaching a variety of concepts to budding filmmakers. Yes, it is thematically sound as well as having a decent plot to make everything understandable while still providing a lot of depth in its storytelling and something that you could pick apart endlessly. It's a standout film of its time, shining a big bright light on the direction that American society as a whole seemed to be headed, successfully being both deconstructive and even predictive of what kinds of conflicts people of the film's generation would undergo. The writing, camerawork, and symbolism is some of the best you'll ever find in a single film.I just think it has absolutely zero entertainment value.Direction is where you could start to find the cracks in the wall. While technically sound on every level, The Graduate is slow, plodding, and probably only got a pass at the time of its release due to the subject matter. There's a telephoto shot of Hoffman running towards the chapel that makes him look like he's running in place for about 20 seconds. It's cool from a production and cinematography standpoint, but its 20 whole seconds of ""get on with it"" that I can't shake while watching it. Awkward party conversations, Hoffman wallowing in self-pity and uncertainty, a slowly decaying love triangle that gets more cynical as it goes along.

Two other quibbles are that Elaine, though very pulchritudinous, doesn't have very deep dialogue and that the movie will seem very dated because there is no longer quite so deep a divide between generations.

"Five Viewings, Five Different Reactions","1. I first watched this film in 1968 when I was 12 years old. I didn't understand anything about it other than the music, which I liked. Later that year I ran out and bought ""Bookends"" by Simon & Garfunkel, and the album got me through junior high school alive. (The best song on the album IMO is ""At the Zoo,"" a mostly-forgotten classic that hasn't been played on an FM station in 40 years.)2. I next watched the film in 1973. I was 17. I fell in love with Katharine Ross and remain enamored to the present day.3. Next time I watched the movie was in 1976 when I was 20. I loved it. I felt, with all the fervor and angst of an undergraduate, that it summarized and articulated my life, i.e., what's it all about? Plastics? Really? OMG.4. I next watched it in 1981 and found it enjoyable, watchable, somewhat dated, not accurate about the '60s.5. I watched it in December of 2015. It seemed radically dated and essentially unwatchable. The thought crossed my mind: it's the most over-rated ""cool"" film of the '60s; it is to the '60s what ""It Happened One Night"" is to the '30s, i.e., I guess you had to be there. It has a lot to do with being a smart graduate of Williams College in the late '50s and early '60s (the author of the novel, Charles Webb, is Williams Class of '61) but very little to do with the middle and late '60s and nothing whatsoever to do with Berkeley in the '60s when political engagement was robust. The sensibility is a hip '50s sensibility (i.e., a Mike Nichols sensibility) besotted with its cuteness.6. Watched it again today (April of 2024) or, rather, watched it for an hour and got bored with the endless idiotic banter between the two principals. I previously gave this five stars and I'm knocking it down to four.Memo to Benjamin - get your own apartment. Everyone else in the '60s was, why not you? (The answer, as noted, is because you're in a '50s film rather than a '60s film.) Memo to Mrs. Robinson - smoke some weed. Every rich hip suburban lady circa 1968 who was unhappy in her marriage, craved sex, and lived in a college town was smoking weed, why not you? Memo to Elaine - grow up. In the second half of the '60s, young women like you were breaking loose, reading Cosmopolitan, smashing conventions, and going for it.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ground-breaking,"And you kinda had to be around in '67 to realize just how ground-breaking this movie was.  Lots of new issues not yet addressed by a major film. Bancroft as the bored, aged manipulator and Hoffman as the innocent babe play off each other very effectively.  I think this film ages so well that if it was released today it would be accepted without missing a beat.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece of film,"The Graduate is one of a handful of movies that will be appreciated for a very long time.  The work of a great director on a hilarious yet subtly poignant script is too incredible to be forgotten.Dustin Hoffman plays a college graduate who has an affair with a much older woman, Anne Bancroft (who in real life is only four or five years older than he is).  I loved it the first time through, and laughed harder than I have for most movies, but it was the next viewing that I really began to fully appreciate everything the director did.  See this movie!

One of my favorites!,"Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) doesn't know what to do with his life. After taking Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) home she tries to seduce him. He starts to have an affair with her, and she is much older than him. But than he falls in love with her daughter Elaine(Katharine Ross).I liked the story and especially the great performance of Dustin Hoffman. It has great scenes and the music, by Simon and Garfunkel, fits great in this movie. And I really liked the end scene. The look on there faces and the music is just great! I recommend this movie to everyone, especially Dustin Hoffman fans!Also the extra's on the DVD are nice to watch. It has the making of and some interviews with the actors and the film makers.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
uhhhh,"The Graduate epitomizes New Hollywood for me. The way Dustin Hoffman's realistic performance and awkward character contrasts with the campy, airy adult characters is New Hollywood's generation contrasting with Old Hollywood's generation. Simon and Garfunkel's music is used to excellent effect, and I still say that this style of soundtrack hasn't been used to its greatest potential yet. The film is still relevant to today's youth as every new generation inevitably has some sort of rift between their parents/former generation. In fact, more so than the 60s, there's a rift between individuals and their own generation. And the movie's theme(s) fit perfectly with that too. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who can relate with the tragic Mrs. Robinson.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Review Of ""The Graduate""","""The Graduate"" is a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Dustin Hoffman. The film tells a story of a young somber graduate student (who knew) who finds himself tangled up in an affair with his father's business partner's wife. Now, first off, I've heard nothing but great things about this movie. I heard that Hoffman was great in it, it had a great story, soundtrack, dialogue, etc. I can say that after everything I heard, this film definitely lived up to it's hype. The film is almost half a century old and yet I found myself (a generation Z college student) relating to it in a myriad of incredible ways. The fact that this film stands strong after an immense amount of time is, in my honest opinion, the most impressive aspect of the film. Dustin Hoffman is arguably the greatest actor in the business and he's in this movie - it's common knowledge that he's going to be good in it. All of the characters in this film were well written and well portrayed as well. Even the side characters were well-written. The script, in general, seems to be the epitome of good writing. The soundtrack is written by two of my most favorite artists - Simon And Garfunkel. Needless to say, it's timeless and unforgettable. The ending of the film was really well done, and the direction altogether seemed to be executed with the utmost precision. There were even a few editing techniques that impressed me in this film. Overall, ""The Graduate"" is a film that truly impressed me. Every person that was at once a student (pretty much everybody) should see and identify with this film. Really good stuff here.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sexy and fun entertainment. Mike Nichols has a timeless classic story of the coming of age of a young man.,"It's amazing how well ""The Graduate"" stills holds up well today after 4 decades, it's a film that doesn't seem to age from the way Mike Nichols done it, the story could be relevant in any time frame. Dustin Hoffman in one of his earliest roles is Ben Braddock a shy and anxiety like introverted young man who's just graduated from college. Upon graduation he returns home to his cultured and sophisticated overprotective parents(William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson) in Los Angeles, California, and upon arrival the parties and social meetings of his parents friends make Ben feel uncomfortable, because he already feels pressure about his future. The film then gradually changes it's course when Ben upon the gathering at his parents house meets one of his father's friends wife that the very sexy and attractive yet aggressive and extroverted Mrs. Robinson(played gracefully and wonderfully by Anne Bancroft). Ben is then completely lost and caught up in his own little world as for the first time it's time for him to relax and have fun and for once feel like a rebellious youth of his counter culture generation. At first Ben is nervous and hesitant, yet slowly and surely he gives into the seduction of Mrs. Robinson. It clearly is a coming of manhood for Ben as he gets to explore his sides of lust, pleasure, and feel good nature. The scene of him and Mrs. Robinson together are so memorable they stick with a viewer for their fun and sexy wit nature, plus Anne Bancroft was a sexy knockout choice for this role very memorable of her scene when Ben unzips her and she's wearing that black colored leopard dotted strapless bra. For the 1960's Anne sure was the sex symbol of the day. Only soon Ben feels the guilt and entrapment, yet that will change when he meets a younger college girl named Elaine(Katharine Ross) only to find out that she is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robinson! Now talk about a dilemma for a young man. As Ben knows Elaine is his only escape and likely true love, he must still face the fact that Mrs. Robinson wants them separated forever! Ben now shows his manhood by being at his best to stop everything and escape with Elaine. Really a great film at it's time that's held up due to it's story and Nichols done a great job to show that it's thru life experiences that one comes of age and learns how to make decisions and find what's right for them just like the Ben character did as after getting pleasure experience he finds what is right. Also the songs by Simon and Garfunkel relate and move the film so well. Clearly Nichols directed a gem here that's a timeless coming of age classic that a viewer can find meaningful anytime.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

So many iconic scenes are instantly recognizable,"It's a romantic comedy about two aimless, unhappy families in Pasadena, Berkeley, and Santa Barbara, California over several months in the early 1960s. Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is a recent graduate of an elite college on the eastern seaboard. He is naive and unfocused about his life. His father (William Daniels) is a wealthy lawyer; his mother (Elizabeth Wilson) manages the house, and they both try to manipulate Benjamin. Benjamin's father's partner is Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton); Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) is an alcoholic and unhappy in her marriage. Their daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), is a student at Berkeley.Benjamin returns home with no ideas about his future and loafs around the family's swimming pool. An aggressive Mrs. Robinson seduces Benjamin and demands he not date her daughter. Somehow, Benjamin and Elaine connect, but indecisiveness stalls their relationship. Benjamin persists, but Elaine is to be married to Carl Smith (Brian Avery), an old college friend. Benjamin persists further. How does it all end?""The Graduate"" is brilliantly filmed, and many iconic scenes are instantly recognizable-the opening credits, which tell us much about Benjamin's personality, the initial seduction scene, the stripper scene, and the whole final wedding sequence. The dialogue, especially between Anne Bancroft and Dustin Hoffman, is hysterical, but even the throwaway line about plastics is funny. Even the suspicious boarding house operator, Mr. McCleery (Norman Fell), is perfect. Then, there is Paul Simon's music, which perfectly matches the story.Some say ""The Graduate"" has not aged well. That may be so, but it's a classic from the late 1960s that still warms my soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Love masterpiece,"Im no fan of love stories, in fact for me they are quite unbearable.  But this movie is a definitive classic.  Not only is it a great love story, it is an icon of American Culture.  The story is quite long and gripping with a very good climatic ending.  It demonstrates themes of adultery, over-protectiveness, temptation, and doing the right thing.  The soundtrack is wonderful.  Simon & Garfunkel did the entire soundtrack for the movie which is truly splendid (In case you didnt know, if you've seen the recent teen movie ""Old School"" the part where one of the frat guys falls into the pool and they play ""The sound of silence"" is a spoof on ""The Graduate""Well anyway, this a true masterpiece, a definite must-see.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of cinema's greatest coming of age tales,"What makes a movie great? Is it a timeless appeal, continued relevance year after year after year? Is it iconic performances, forever immortalized on screen? Or is it that feeling we get, a realization that we're watching something very special? 'The Graduate' falls under any one of these categories and much more. It was released in 1967 but could pass as a film made forty years later, eloquently tackling the troubles and frustration of young adulthood.There's a subtle and tactful atmosphere that surrounds 'The Graduate', a film not always ripe with words and talk but heavy and thick with emotion and unease. Dustin Hoffman so perfectly captures the 'what now?' feeling about the game of life, an undeniably intelligent young man but with no sense of direction, no sense of meaning. It's a state of mind many of us, if not all of us, can relate to strikingly well. His character is fascinatingly complex, standing alone at one of life's many crossroads with confusion, desperation, anger, and loneliness. The dreamlike sequence before Hoffman's first sexual encounter with Mrs. Robinson is absolutely stunning and powerful, a visionary moment that speaks profoundly.It's Anne Bancroft who steals the show with her enticingly sultry turn as Mrs. Robinson, Hoffman's seductress at least twice his age. Her sensuous elegance, the dangerous game of risk. She captures Hoffman in the palm of her hand, but beneath the surface, there's a lifetime of hurt and loneliness. A hole that can't be filled by physical pleasures, no matter how hard she tries. We feel for her, but at the same time, we hate her. Does all the blame rest squarely on her shoulders? No, it takes two to tango. But she plays her devilish hand with a shrewd nastiness that makes 'The Graduate' such a compelling picture.Mike Nichols created his masterpiece with 'The Graduate', a phenomenal effort riddled with comedy, drama, romance, heartbreak, and an ending that touches the perfect note. The film's execution is precise and genius, while Simon and Garfunkel's legendary soundtrack launches 'The Graduate' into cinematic immortality. It captures a feeling that resonated so well with younger audiences back in the 60s, and it's still working its magic to this day. Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. And thanks for a great film.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""The Graduate,"" with top honors!","Incredibly enough, the only reason I even had the slightest clue about this movie was due to an episode of ""The Simpsons"" a few years back. Now that I've seen ""The Graduate"" in its entirety, I now see where that famous episode got its inspiration. Of course being that I'm only 24, that is perhaps the reason why I never quite caught on to the connection between this movie and that particular ""Simpsons"" episode, and plus I have an entire century of movies to pick up the references from!On the serious side, though, ""The Graduate"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies ever made. Directed by Mike Nichols (who won an Oscar for Best Director) and adapted from the novel of the same name by Charles Webb, 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock (a then-30-year-old Dustin Hoffman in real life, in his film debut) is constantly on the verge of panic within the film's first 20 minutes. He's just graduated from college (hence the film's title), and has no clue about what he wants to do with his life. His upper-crust parents mistakenly think that he'll probably go to graduate school, after some much-needed rest & relaxation, of course. Instead, Ben just spends his days floating about aimlessly decked out in full scuba gear at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool.Ben does get some direction - or is it misdirection? - when Mrs. Robinson (the late Anne Bancroft), the wife of his father's business partner, tries to seduce him, and he eventually lets her, in private liaisons at an upscale downtown hotel. Ben's own youthful, post-college confusion and Mrs. Robinson's marital unhappiness is a match made in the hellish depths of suburban affluence. The affair continues on for a while with little problems, that is, until, Elaine Robinson (Katharine Ross), the Robinson's college-bound daughter, comes home from Berkeley and Ben suddenly finds some direction in his life because for the first in his life since he came home from college, he now knows what he wants because suddenly he's in love! This of course, causes all sorts of problems because he can't date Elaine while still carrying on a sordid affair with her mother!I've found yet another screen hero in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Benjamin Braddock. He's the character that defined a generation; not just for college kids circa-1967, but for college kids 43 years later in 2010! Any kid who goes to college for four years (in my case 5 1/2) and comes out without a single clue as to their future, will instantly find something to like about Ben. (I know sometimes that I feel that I'm Ben; I'm out of college three months and working full-time and still questioning whether or not I made the right decision in my college career.) Ben is confused, desperate, alienated, and clueless. The world as he knows it is big, bad, and scary (hence why he finds solace at the bottom of his parents' swimming pool). His parents expect that he's going to go and make something big of himself, but one of the film's themes regards the cross-generational shift in values, and so some (if not all) of the norms & values of his parents' age may not fit in within the norms & values of his generation.And of course, Ben's generation's norms & values are perhaps quite radically different from mine. In my age- and sex-obsessed generation of 2010, you can bet that Ben's generation of baby boomers would have coronaries due to 2010 standards of right and wrong, what's cool and uncool. And it just seems to me, at least, that people in my generation only just seem to really want instant gratification without really having the will to work for it (which could be blamed on the older generations, each previous one working hard so that the next one has it a little bit easier - but my generation seems to me, to get bored pretty easily, lacks any real moral/ethical foundations, and overall just seems to be pretty lazy); but again, this could be blamed on previous generations.At the end of the day, ""The Graduate"" is really all just about Ben, and his lack of direction. Only when he makes the mistake of falling for Elaine Robinson does his future become clear: it's to marry her, with little pondering of what goes on after that, as demonstrated by this film's hilarious albeit appropriately awkward ending at a church. Anne Bancroft creates a sexy and fearsome, but ultimately tragic and sympathetic Mrs. Robinson. She's not a monster who really forces herself upon Our Poor Hero (a ""cougar"" as today's modern slang terminology would call her), but she's someone who has a chance to make herself happy for once while stuck in a loveless marriage and it seems that she will do anything to keep Ben all to herself, much to his kicking & screaming (heart's dismay). We were all saddened by her passing in 2005, but if she is remembered for any of her many iconic screen roles, it should be the beautiful and seductive, not-so-ordinary suburban housewife Mrs. Robinson.""The Graduate"" is obviously dated by its '60s-era Simon & Garfunkel-performed soundtrack. And even if the dated soundtrack is a musical vocalization of Ben's (and to a greater extent, '60s-era college graduates) frustrations and anxieties, the movie itself still has great relevance today, and for that reason alone, ""The Graduate"" will never grow old, and will always receive top honors from movie-lovers everywhere, no matter what decade.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The fluidity between the frames and the long takes. Memorable scenes. I really liked this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Contrary to popular belief, love can be funny too.","The most interesting feature about The Graduate is the allusion to the protagonist being perpetually underwater. In one of the initial scenes of the movie, Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is shown talking to his father resting against a fishtank in his room, his voice interspersed with the bubbling in the background. As the film proceeds, Ben walks into a swimming pool, oblivious to what everyone is excitedly screaming around him and remains there, still as the cadaver, as the camera retreats slowly, moving through water itself. Further more, there are several scenes that have him floating lazily on the pool, drifting away, both literally and metaphorically. The message in the bottle is clear - Ben is confused, dazed and drowning helplessly - and this forms the crux of his character.After returning home from college, Ben is worried about his future. He is smart (a recepient of the coveted Helpingham award), he is an athlete and is the son of rich, proud parents who just can't enough of their son. Yet he is worried; talk about first-world problems. He meets Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) at a party that his fiesty parents have arranged on the occasion of his homecoming. She asks him to drive her home and then invites him inside. One thing leads to another and before Ben can do anything about the events (though he does understand what's happening), a woman twice his age who is also the wife of his father's business partner, is standing naked in front of him, trying to seduce him. He makes a desperate dash for the exit but it isn't long before he calls Mrs. Robinson again, thus beginning a series of secret, cheap, hotel-room flings. However, things take a turn for the wilder side when the Robinsons' daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross), returns from Berkeley and Ben falls in love with her despite Mrs. Robinson's protestations, who is 'prepared to tell her everything' in order keep Benjamin away from Elaine.The neurotic Benjamin Braddock has been played superbly by Dustin Hoffman. The vacant expression on his face as he stares into nothingness, the trace-like quality to his gait, along with the underwater metaphor tell a lot about him. There is a distinct Woody Allen-esque feeling to him. He is an innocent, curious twenty year-old with a clean conscience, but is merely lost and doesn't know where his life is heading. The acts his commits - sleeping with Mrs. Robinson, being rude to Elain initially, seeming brash and arrogant to people at the party - though intentional, are often a result of being in this mental state. Though many actors could have pulled this role off, hardly anyone would have done it as beautifully as Dustin Hoffman.The film has been made in a really intelligent manner, and you don't get to hear that very often for rom-coms. By not attempting to drag the movie very far from the realms of reality, it presents a kind of humour that keeps the laughter trickling, without overwhelming you.The film doesn't overdo the jokes; they are simple things that grab your attention and make tickle your funny bone - like Mr. Robinson repeatedly giving Ben a scotch even though he insists on having a bourbon, Ben's accidentally driving onto the pavement when Elaine mentions the Taft Hotel (the place where he had the flings) or Ben's encounter with a hotel clerk at the Taft. Along with Ben, the humour does break loose entirely in the head, which appears like a gradual crescendo and does have you gasping for breath through all the laughing, even though it seems slightly amateurishly done.The cinematography, occasionally, really stands out from the rest the of the film. Parts of the movie that interlace the night Ben and Mrs. Robinson spend together with Ben's stay at home, merging the two in a confusing yet clever manner is really well done. It shows that despite his initial refusals, Ben actually enjoyed the time they spent together and thinks about it in his waking dreams, perhaps even without guilt. It does come as a nasty turn to see Ben lying on Mrs. Robinson and hearing Ben's father ask him the background 'Ben, what are you doing?'By maintaining the right balance between the romance and the comedy, The Graduate, made in 1967, does set a precedent for generations of future romantic-comedies to come. It even has the iconic two-forbidden-lovers- run-to-their-freedom-while-evil-folks-try-to-catch-them scene among plenitudes of others that other films have shamelessly ripped off. Having Simon and Garfunkel do the music was a particularly intelligent thing to do. Listening to them croon 'Hello darkness my friend,' not only holds true for Ben, but also makes the film a soothing experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson","This is one of the defining films of my generation, and of course I saw it when it came out in 1967. Seeing it again after all these years I was struck by both how funny it is and by the brittle, cynical and brilliant performance by Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. She really is flawless in a part that might easily lend itself to overacting. Instead she is subtle, controlled, focused, and authentic in a way that is both sexy and chilling with just a hint of ironic humor. The maternal manner with which she treats virginal Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in a breakout role) emphasizes the creepy, almost incestuous nature of their sterile affair.Mike Nichols has directed a number of sexual/relationship comedies, including Carnal Knowledge (1971), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), Nora Ephron's Heartburn (1986) and Carrie Fisher's Postcards from the Edge (1990). Nichols's films typically feature talented and charismatic actors and actresses who explore in a deceptively humorous manner the dark side of our human nature. The humor usually has an edgy quality while the taboo elements are somehow resolved into happy endings as in a musical comedy. Nichols likes to work with material from another medium and make it his own.Typically, The Graduate is adapted from the novel by Charles Webb. Nichols also likes to feature cutting edge popular music in the score. What we hear in the background and played over the opening credits is Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence."" Of course Paul Simon wrote the song ""Mrs. Robinson"" for this movie, but what I didn't realized until now is his ""It's all happening at the zoo"" was probably inspired in part by the zoo scene in this film.Dustin Hoffman's confused and drifting Benjamin, worried about his future and suffocated by his parents' generation, knocked everybody out in those days with his dead-panned, literal delivery of one-liners, some of which were written by Buck Henry, who plays the desk clerk at the rendezvous hotel. I especially loved Ben's answer when his father, enquiring about his Quixotic plan to marry Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), asks, ""Isn't this a half-baked idea?"" In dead seriousness, Benjamin says, ""No, sir. It's completely baked.""Memorable is Norman Fell (whom most of us recall from TV's long-running comedy, Three's Company) in a small part as the landlord of the Berkeley rooming house. He is of course a past master at dead-panning one-liners; in fact, he is a master at mute dead-panning. One of the funniest bits in the movie is when the camera catches his face as Elaine's father comes out of Ben's room spewing obscenities and insults at Ben.What we loved about this movie was the youthful point of view; the wonderful chase scene at the end, a Hollywood staple made fresh; the sympathetic character of Benjamin with whom we could readily identify; the clich√©-ridden and shallow parents being slyly made fun of; and the sense of getting what we want out of life and doing it our own way. This is a coming-of-ager and a romance and a social satire rolled into one, and a classic Hollywood movie that no aficionado would want to miss.But see this for Anne Bancroft, a brilliant and perhaps underrated actress in one of her most memorable roles.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Boring Movie,This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen It's filled with boring scenes and bad acting skills. There's one scene where Hoffman's character talks in the dark to Mrs. Robinson.

I Can't Believe I waited This Long,"I had picked up The Graduate and carried it around the video store several times over the years, but I always chose something else to take home with me. The Graduate was just something I ought to see. After finally taking it home, I had to watch it twice to soak it in.The Graduate is an unusually quiet movie - not nearly as talky as movies made today. A great deal of activity goes on with no words spoken, just the sound of Simon and Garfunkel. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant as always, playing Benjamin with quiet intensity. Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson is not very likeable throughout most of the film, but there are moments when we learn more about her (as when she and Benjamin talk about her marriage), and we understand better why she is who she is. The ending is brilliant, but we do not know if it is really for the best.  The final moments are somber.  Just beautiful!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly one of the most overlooked masterpieces of this century.,"One of the few films to ever utilize the main character as both the antagonist and protagonist.  The young Dustin Hoffman was made to star as Benjamin, a college graduate who finds himself with too much time on his hands.  He finds himself seduced by Mrs. Robinson--a family friend--stunningly portrayed by Anne Bancroft.  Conflict erupts when Benjamin falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter despite the elder Robinson's words to stay away. I found myself mesmerized both by Hoffman's superb acting as an innocent young man but Bancroft steals the show as the sly, wicked seductress who must keep him away from her daughter at all cost. Viewers will remember the often-spoofed ending, the First Presbyterian Church of Santa Barbara and the wonderful music of Simon & Garfunkel which appears throughout the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,"First, I would like to tell everybody is reading my comment that my English isn't very good because I'm Spanish and all I know has been learned by classes. Second, if someone disagrees to my comments I'd like him to send me a message to discuss the film. Third, I'd like to say that I saw this film some days ago and even now I can't forget some of those impressive scenes. The Graduate isn't a work of art at all, but it has magic in it. I think that Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft give it all that magic, it's an actor's work first of all, then it's an interesting view of ""high"" society in seventies; and finally it's a love story, the worst side of the film, although not disposable at all. In conclusion, this film has two interesting sides to watch it for, it's motive enough to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Incredibly complex, yet funny and moving","I don't see why anyone would not like this movie.  Maybe they just weren't looking deep enough.  It perfectly portrays the pressures of finally ""growing up"", and cutting all ties with your former life.  Hoffman's character experiences a rebirth (often symbolised by his swimming in the pool (or womb)) into ""manhood"", although he can't figure out what that's supposed to be.  The incredible directing and camera work alone makes this movie a must, and even if one isn't looking for any deeper, artsy meaning they should find it incredibly entertaining.  The humor also, is ingenious. It is a movie where each time you watch it, you realize something new about it.  An incredible picture, I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Graduate (1967) - Mrs. Robinson, You're Trying to Seduce Me!","""The Graduate"" tells the story of Benjamin Braddock, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, who recently graduated college, with no idea for his future. He then ends up hooking up with the neighbor's mother, Mrs. Robinson, portrayed by Anne Bancroft, after seducing Benjamin at his graduation party. He then ends up crushing for Elaine, Mrs. Benjamin's daughter, portrayed by Katharine Ross, while having the affair with a heartless Mrs. Robinson, who doesn't want Benjamin to see Elaine, at the same time. ""The Graduate"" is one of the more better romantic comedies by split decision. This film is masterfully casted, well-written, beautifully filmed, and expertly directed. Director Mike Nichols rounds up a movie that brings in everything you'd expect to see. Dustin Hoffman brings one of the best performances of his career as the shy, and confused Benjamin. Anne Bancroft delivers a perfect performance as Mrs. Robinson, the character you just love to hate. Katharine Ross and Murray Hamilton also deliver some great performances in the movie as Elaine and her father. ""The Graduate"" is one of the best movies ever made for many reasons. It's so entertaining, you'd want to watch it over and over again. The soundtrack is perfect, the cast is golden, the directing is masterful, and the humor is perfect. ""The Graduate"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I would like to end my review by saying this: ""This movie is awkward and uncomfortable, just the way I love it"". The Graduate, in my review, ""a perfectly entertaining romantic comedy"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate,"How can you make a movie any better than this? This is the movie that made Dustin Hoffman a great star. Director Mike Nichols always seems to bring out the best in female characters as he certainly did with Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson,a bored socialite who has an affair with her daughter's boyfriend. And who can not love the wonderful Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack.This film is about a young man fresh out of college and trying to find his way in the world. It pushed the envelope in 1967 and is one of those classic films that is just as good to watch now as it was when it was new. It is a definite must see for anyone's list.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Taboo themes contribute to its popularity,"'The Graduate' owes some of the popularity down to its portrayal of taboo events surrounding an older, married woman and a young graduate. In summary, the movie is about their relationship and about the young graduate uncertain of his future. The ending scene is classic and memorable, and it's one of those scenes that has probably achieved high, unforgettable status in the film world.The music by Simon and Garfunkel is probably one of the best elements of the film. Definitely, give this film a watch. It has several good scenes, but don't expect too much because its so often mentioned. Personal rating: Average.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
GREAT 60s MOVIE,"I have nothing but praises for this movie. I liked this movie so much that after my Film class I bought it for my own private collection. When I first heard about The Graduate, I had no interest in seeing it(I was young). It didnt appeal to me at all. So, when my Film teacher said we would be watching it, I wasnt that excited. However as the movie started to progress and the sexual tension between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson grew, I started to love it. Dustin Hoffmans portrayal as a young graduate who doesnt have a clue what to do in life was impeccable. Anne Bancroft's portrayal of a cradle robbin' wife also was great. Everything about this movie, I loved. The cinematography, the acting and the great symbolic use of water add to the great charismatic feel of the overall product of this gem of a film.",,Anonymous,Romance

The Graduate,"The sequence where Hoffman asks Buck Henry for a room is still one of the funniest scenes ever. It's been said that Nichols' direction to Hoffman was that he should look as if he's asking for condoms. It's wonderful! Hoffman filling out the register, messing up and crumbling a piece of paper into his pocket and starting over is right on the money. It's a perfectly timed sequence with no one playing it too heavily. That's how the entire film is. The film is funny because it seems to me that no one really takes themselves too seriously. Maybe it's the rich and wealthy who feel that way. In any case, the performances are outstanding.  Bancroft is shocking and seductive as the mischievous Mrs. Robinson. Katherine Ross is still one of the most beautiful women ever. The sequence in the bar when she's crying is a perfect shot of her beauty. Hoffman is damn near perfect as Benjamin, even though the original idea for the character was someone resembling a Redford or George Segal. Hoffman's Benjamin is a loner in need of something. Direction. Love. Guts. All of those things.  I'm not so sure that Ben can truly love anything. It looked as if he had a lot of growing up to do. Who knows if we'll met Ben and Elaine again. What about Mrs. Robinson? It sure would be nice. Who knows?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hello darkness my old friend,"All-time best.The melancholy music by Simon and Garfunkel is wonderful. The scenes of Ben being submerged underwater, flying cars, and crashing at Elaine's college are wonderful. The sick and depressed emotions of Ben and Mrs. Robinson are wonderful. The final scene where Ben becomes a ""graduate"" in name and reality is wonderful.I especially love the emotionless eyes of the passengers after they get on the bus with Elaine and the faces of the two young people as they slowly sink into it, and I have watched it many times. In the last scene of Ango Sakaguchi's ""Hakuchi"" (The Idiot), there is a scene in which the woman he loved no longer looks like a pig, and I feel it is similar to that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

But the best parts are . . .,"I must have seen this movie three dozen times, and every time I find something new in it. While the script is wonderful, the acting first-rate, and the soundtrack evocative and beautiful, I still have to say that the best parts of The Graduate are the cinematography and editing. During the long musical interlude halfway through, we watch Benjamin drift aimlessly from one assignation with Mrs. Robinson to another, lying to himself, lying to his parents, just plain lying . . . around. He walks through a door in the hotel room to find himself in his parent's den. Then he walks from the den into the hotel room--and so on. I don't think a director has ever evoked the pointlessness of a character's life better than Mike Nichols does in this one scene.Also, when Benjamin finally tells Elaine who the married woman is, the camera slowly pulls her face into focus as she realizes the impact of his words. It just doesn't get any better than this.Two tidbits: (1) I don't think the movie is dated at all; and (2) isn't it more than cool that we never find out Mrs. Robinson's first name?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Masterpiece of Direction,"I had never seen The Graduate all the way through until yesterday, ashamed of being a movie buff who'd never seen it before. I loved it. It isn't the zany comedy I thought it would be, however it's something much more urbane and cerebral. Really, it's just a demonstration of some of the greatest film direction I've ever seen.Mike Nichols brings a quiet intensity to the movement and rate of the film, almost like a suspense film. Relative to Scorsese, his insinuation of time lapse is done with a mixture of hard cutting, closing in and closing out of tight shots, and a jukebox-like switch from one piece of music playing over the soundtrack to another. His camera-work altogether is an intense, very fixated series of extended shots, some of them taking us through long-lasting periods of action beginning with the profile shot of Dustin Hoffman on the automatic walking belt at the airport during the opening credits and his sustained closeup as he walks through his parents' party and is constantly stopped with several people invading the frame, creating the feeling of his space being violated. The film is in essence of series of shots like these, and it has a tremendous effect on the style, atmosphere, and pace of the film, especially during its scenes of wry humor, as does the recurring soundtrack integrated with Simon and Garfunkel and David Grusin.The early performance by Hoffman is very entertaining, a much-imitated comically shy young man who opens up only to inadvertently reveal himself as a force to be reckoned with, and Bancroft's performance is one for the books, riveting in her screen time as one of the great femmes fatale, both performances sharply contrasting in charisma to the less memorable Ross.The Graduate is one of the milestones of the 1960s, one of the greatest decades for cinema, and it carries on its lingering influence.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
* I Get A Different Meaning!,"When this movie premiered in 1967 critics claimed it was about the generation gap, a popular catch-phrase of that era. I never saw it that way. For one thing Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock was in no way typical or resembling a late 1960's kind of young guy that viewers of the movie could identify with. Also I tend to see a timeless quality of the movie and its story that is not necessarily stuck in the late 1960's mind-set. To me in my opinion rather than being about the late 1960's so-called ""generation gap"" what I see instead is a common fantasy of every young single guy of winning back that gal who rejected him with a kind of ""Can we just be friends?"" break-up.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely Baked,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's the 45th anniversary of this film's release and it was awarded a limited theatrical re-release, which I took advantage of last evening. Unlike so many films, the big screen doesn't really bring anything special here, but then, it really doesn't require any assistance. I fall into the category of those who consider this one of the all-time best films. Not only is it off-the-charts entertaining, the dialogue is brilliant, the performances are pitch perfect, and the camera work and soundtrack are highly complimentary.As my number of viewings have increased over the years, I have become a true admirer of the performance of Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson. It is heart-breaking and emotional. The first glimpse of her always makes me smile ... she is in the background as Ben (Dustin Hoffman) pinballs through the party trying to avoid the clutches of his parents' friends. Her scene in bed when she tells Ben about her college background in art and how her dreams came crashing down, her voice and facial features are filled with pain. Watch the movie from Mrs. Robinson's point of view and my guess is you too will have a renewed understanding.Of course, the age differences of the lead actors breaks all of my ""movie pet peeve"" rules. Dustin Hoffman was 30 at the time and he is playing a soon to turn 21 year old Ben. Anne Bancroft has a line to Ben where she says she is ""twice your age"". Actually, she was only 36 at the time, and Katharine Ross (Elaine) was 27. Also, William Daniels who plays Ben's dad, was only 10 years older than Hoffman.The movie is based on the Charles Webb novel and the screenplay was written by Buck Henry, who also plays the hotel clerk with whom Ben has an ongoing dialogue. Calder Willingham is also credited thanks to a lawsuit brought after the fact. The director, Mike Nichols has had a terrific career, and was also a co-founder of Chicago's Second City Improv. He is also one of only 12 EGOT's: winners of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. One of Mr. Nichols' most famous collaborators is Elaine May, who plays the roommate who delivers the note to Ben ... and is the target of a most interesting camera angle.There are so many iconic moments and shots from the film. Everyone is aware of Mr. McGuire's ""Plastics"" advice to Ben, and we see Norman Fell as Ben's landlord who has no appreciation for ""agitators"". It's also fun to note that we see a glimpse of a young Richard Dreyfuss who says he'll ""get the cops"", and Mike Farrell (from MASH) makes his film debut as a bellhop at the hotel. It's also the final screen performance for Alice Ghostley, who many know from ""Bewitched"". One of the most famous film posters in history shows Dustin Hoffman photographed through the leg of Mrs. Robinson. Actually, that leg belongs to Linda Gray, who went on to fame as Sue Ellen Ewing in the ""Dallas"" TV series. It should also be noted that the pivotal Taft Hotel in the film is actually the very famous Ambassador Hotel, which of course, is where Presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. The hotel was later demolished in 2005.On a personal note, some of my favorite moments in the film include the shot of Mr Robinson reflected in the glass top table as she arrives for her first night with Ben. Also, director Nichols allows the camera to linger on a furious and disgusted Bancroft as Hoffman shows up for his date with Elaine. And yes, it should be mentioned that Katharine Ross became the ""dream girl"" of the 1960's thanks to this role and her role in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. As for the Simon and Garfunkel music, the most interesting piece is the unfinished ""Mrs. Robinson"" song that Nichols selected, even though Paul Simon presented it to him as ""Mrs. Roosevelt"" (as in Eleanor). Singing only the chorus and relying on acoustic guitar and an endless supply of Di-di-di's, the unfinished version is a perfect fit for Ben's pursuit of Elaine. One of my guilty pleasures from the film is courtesy of Murray Hamilton who seems to just choke on his lines as he spits them out to Ben - in both of their key scenes together. Hamilton went on to be Mayor of Amity in Jaws, but his career peak was in not shaking hands with Ben.Though it's not technically the final shot, the faces of Elaine and Ben on the bus is one of the most memorable endings in movie history ... the cherry on top for one of my absolute favorite films.

"Still a Funny, Perceptive Classic Forty Years Later and in a DVD Package Worthy of Its Reputation","If there is one film deserving of a full-blown renaissance, it is this seminal 1967 social alienation comedy, and this 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD presents an especially pristine print, as well as several extras that will please die-hard fans. Based on the wry 1963 Charles Webb novel, the film itself holds a special affection among its original audience even now, the aging Vietnam War-era population who championed anarchy and the people who revise their personal histories, so they can think they were members of the now-fashionable counter-cultural movement. At the same time, it has a timeless quality for new generations simply because it's a consistently witty, observant piece of cinema targeted to anyone who has experienced that sense of post-academic confusion when the responsibilities of real life inevitably intrude.This is an accomplished film for someone directing only his second film. But then again, judging from his subsequent work all the way to Angels in America and Closer, Mike Nichols seems to have come into film-making fully understanding the frailties of the human condition and knowing how to convey them in a way that audiences could empathize. It is a testament to Nichols and screenwriters Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that the social comedy aspects of this film do not seem at all dated. In fact, despite its provocative veneer, it's really old-fashioned in key ways from the protagonist's moralistic tendencies to his romantically compulsive motivations toward the end. Dustin Hoffman was pulled out of complete obscurity to play Benjamin, the alienated, recent college graduate drifting amid his parents' Southern California upper-middle class, swimming pool-centered ennui.As Benjamin figures out what to do with his life and faces unwanted advice from his parents' friends, enter Mrs. Robinson, a bored, restless wife, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and about as sympathetic as Lady Macbeth. It's hard to imagine what the original choice, Doris Day, would have done with this role, as it takes Anne Bancroft's formidable arsenal of skills to bring this vituperative woman to life. She gives a masterful performance. The hotel sequence where Benjamin awkwardly asks Mrs. Robinson for a drink is shrewdly observed and downright hilarious - the suspicious hotel clerk (Henry, the film's co-screenwriter) eyeing Benjamin's every move; the reception line which Benjamin pretends to know (TV veterans Alice Ghostley and Marion Lorne, Esmeralda and Aunt Clara from Bewitched, make indelible marks here); and the predatory Mrs. Robinson's business-like approach to seduction.Complicating matters exorbitantly is Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, played with relative nonchalance by Katharine Ross. The film then turns into a revenge comedy with Mrs. Robinson trying to prevent the inevitable coupling of Benjamin and Elaine. She almost succeeds but not before a series of revelations and dramatic encounters that lead to the classic ending aboard the public bus. Some of the comedy and characterizations seem a bit extreme, for example, Hoffman seems to amplify his character's nebbishness a few too many times, and Elaine's fianc√©e appears like a textbook 1960's TV stereotype. There are also a few forgivable geographic gaffes - most of the campus scenes are not filmed at Berkeley as portrayed in the film but at USC, and Benjamin crosses the Bay Bridge in the wrong direction to hunt for Elaine.The 2007 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD contains two separate commentary tracks, both insightful but for different reasons - the first is an anecdotal remembrance with Hoffman and Ross quite engaged with details of the filming (Hoffman apparently had quite a crush on Ross and still does), and the second has Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh discussing all aspects of the production from casting to camera set-ups within specific scenes. The main featurette is the new 25-minute ""Students of 'The Graduate'"", which amounts to an extended appreciation of the film from Henry; producer Lawrence Turman; two film scholars; various directors (Harold Ramis, Marc Forster, Valerie Faris & Jonathan Dayton, David O. Russell); and film critics (Newsweek's David Ansen, Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman). The second new short, ""The Seduction"", is a nine-minute retrospective look at the famous scene where Mrs. Robinson nonchalantly pounces on Benjamin. The participants from the first featurette are involved here as well, and it provides a good dissection of not only the scene but the sexual mores prevalent at the time of filming.There are two holdovers from the 1999 DVD release. The first is the 22-minute ""'The Graduate' at 25"" produced in 1992 for the laserdisc release. It has the advantage of participation from Hoffman and Ross but otherwise echoes the information presented in the newer retrospective featurette. The second is a 22-minute interview with Hoffman done in quick takes. He lends invaluable and often amusing insight into his selection for the role and the film-making experience. He also talks about the proposed sequel which one can assume eventually turned into 2005's execrable Rumor Has It.... Beyond the original theatrical trailer, the DVD contains a print of the film that makes it look as good as it did in its original release. There is a bonus soundtrack sampler CD with four of the distinctive Simon and Garfunkel songs featured in the movie - ""The Sound of Silence"", ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"", ""April Come She Will"", and of course, ""Mrs. Robinson"". Lastly, there is a helpful six-page booklet that fills in the rest of the blanks on the production. This is a great package for a classic film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Landmark Late 60s Film,"Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin appears in closeup in the opening shot of the first scene. He continues to be in every scene till the end. It reminded me of Audrey Hepburn's Princess in ""Roman Holiday"" and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett in ""GWTW."" The device is, get the viewer involved in the main character and follow him/her through the drama.In this case, it certainly worked. Even though Ben isn't the nice, straight-laced lad we might have thought in the beginning, he's there occupying our attention from start to finish. During the course, he's seen doing some morally dubious things. At one point Mr. Robinson calls him ""filth, scum,"" and ""a degenerate."" That's a pretty strong indictment for a hero, and in fact he becomes an instant anti-hero, once his character is given verbal definition.While the film can't quite make up its mind whether it's a drama, satire, social commentary or comedy, it gives the impression it knows what it's about. Ben's sulking matches the wistfulness of the Simon-Garfunkel songs, and the whole enterprise is kept alive by brilliant acting, directing, photography, and editing.Anne Bancroft made Mrs. Robinson her own; Hoffman became an instant star; Katherine Ross was in fine form as well. Mike Nichols' work was constantly inventive and striking.Viewed today after many years, the film remains engaging; still, to me it seems to rather lack a heart and soul. It's neither negative nor positive, just sort of neutral, not amounting to much in the total scheme of things, yet an engrossing diversion of times past.Though ""plastics"" are still very much with us.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
You're trying to seduce me.... aren't you?,"Although The Graduate starts out and continues at a slow pace, the ending makes up for it all.  The coolest scene is Ben racing his Aston Martin out of a tunnel, as Simon & Garfunkel's ""Mrs. Robinson"" begins to play.  It's really a thrilling scene.  The soundtrack to the movie is great, and helps integrate Ben's  dream sequences.  I identify with Ben, in that nothing excites him in life, despite his outstanding parent-driven accomplishments and college degree.  The one thing he finally finds that thrills him, Elaine Robinson, he is not allowed to have.  It's so ironic, it's great!.  And what's more ironic, is that when he  finally gets what he wants, he's truly happy for less time than it takes for the bus to pull away from the corner. He and Elaine have nowhere to go, no money, and no future together.  If they were to stay together, they could never return to eithers' parents ever again, and even if Ben could be happy with Elaine, she's carrying the make-out king's child.  It's a bitter ending and a bitter lesson, but I think true to life, not so much in  reality, but in emotion.  This is a great movie to see at least once, even if you're not that crazy about Dustin Hoffman... one of my all-time favs.",,Anonymous,Romance
Greatest Movie in the History of Film,"I have seen many movies and I like many different types of stories but over the years after many viewings I have come to the conclusion that this is possibly the best film ever made.I saw the movie when I was a young teenager - I thought it was entertaining at best but I really didn't have an appreciation for it. When I saw it as an adult I walked away from it realizing that it was brilliant.Dustin Hoffman's performance is hilarious but nuanced and genius at the same time. The direction style was unprecedented at the time and it change cinema forever - there have been many copycats since. It also was a sort of generational groundbreaker.The soundtrack is classic - simply great - by the then relatively unknown Simon and Garfunkel.All of the performances are really funny yet amazingly nuanced and done with such care and scrutiny.There is nothing sappy about the movie and it's not a typical feel good movie - people often rate movies on how good the movie makes them feel.Ben - the main character - who is being led through life by his parents plans - breaks away from his mundane existence to fight for real feelings and real passion in a real way.I don't think the balance between comedy, drama, great performances, and great writing has ever been done as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The ""Generation Gap"" movie of its time","The trying times of youths, stuck between the innocent and promising teen years & the oncoming reality of adulthood is adroitly portrayed in this movie.  Benjamin Braddock, who has just graduated college with honors, is undecided about how he is going to spend the rest of his life.  Instead of finding answers, he is confronted with questions that he cannot respond to. So, he begins a sordid affair with Mrs. Robinson that leaves him bored, uncaring,& in his own words, ""just drifting"".  When he meets Elaine, he begins to see that his life has taken a purposeful turn, only to be stymied in his quest for her love by the jaded Mrs. Robinson.  How Ben emerges from a scenario that is ""completely baked"" is both a hilarious and poignant trip for movie watchers.  Perhaps my favorite scene in the movie is when Ben is attempting to get a room at the hotel & feels as though a plethora of suspecting eyes is upon him. While this is to be Dustin Hoffman's breakout film, it is also to me by far the pinnacle of Anne Bancroft's distinguished career.  She is both sexy and pitiful. I am also, in retrospect, surprised that Katherine Ross' film career went nowhere after this (although she was in Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid a few years later).  Simon & Garfunkel's music permeates throughout the entire movie, &  the theme of alienation that is so prevalent in Mr. Simon's words seem to have been indeed written for the movie (even though, in reality, songs like Sound of Silence & April Come She Will preceeded it by a few years). What's also interesting is how fresh & undated The Graduate remains today, over 30 years after its release. One funny note: After having seen The Graduate in the theater for the 1st time (I saw it 18 times in the theater!), I told my parents to see it, & advised them to listen carefully to the words in the songs, for they were meaningful to the storyline.  After they did see it, my mother remarked to me that what she got out of it was that Mrs. Robinson's first name was ""Rosemary"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An innovative and well-acted movie,"This movie is a defining one for Dustin Hoffman's impressive career, and a fantastic movie in its own right with phenomenal acting.Anne Bancroft is, besides Hoffman, the big standout, bur the rest of the cast is very impressive as well.The writing is great as well, and besides a good coming-of-age story, it's a very funny movie with lots of clever lines of dialogue.The score is of course very memorable as well, Simon & Gardunkel stands as one of the great bands of the 60s, and all time, and every song feels very appropiate in the context of the film.The cinematography is very fluid as well, and you can easily see why this movie is so acclaimed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Biting Commentary on Upper-Mid-Class America Disguised as a Romantic Comedy,"""The Graduate"" was originally billed as a comedy. But is it? It's sort of like saying ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is a Western. Both films have some of the traditional elements of their respective genres. However, at crucial moments they do u-turns away from the traditional story-lines which push their movies into new territory quite removed from their traditional forebears. They are almost in their own sub-genres.Romantic comedies before ""The Graduate"" were lighthearted escapist affairs, often with Doris Day pouting and saying ""Oooo!"" to her would be significant other, usually Cary Grant or James Garner. Or guys going gah-gah enamored with Marilyn Monroe. In Hepburn-Tracey romantic comedies of the 1940's, Spenser was always ultimately in charge and got the final say in the situation. If ""The Graduate"" is a romantic comedy, it's basically in reverse in which the initial ""significant other"" is someone the protagonist shouldn't be involved with and didn't initially pursue.""The Graduate"" is in fact the quintessential cougar-cub story. He becomes the prey and she is the predator, a role reversal that may have not been done in American cinema previously, or at least very rarely. Maybe the closest film with a similar ""bite"" to it with both comedy and serious sexual overtones prior to ""The Graudate"" is ""The Apartment"", directed by Billy Wilder. But even here, it's the males who are more or less in charge.When Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) arrives home in the Los Angeles area (possibly Beverly Hills or Bell Air but we never know) from a nameless university back east (probably an Ivy League), everything seems comedic but also a bit disturbing. The one ""word"" of advice from one of his parents' friends regarding his ""future"" has become one of several classic lines in the history of American cinema originating from this film. It certainly drew laughs from the first audiences but in retrospective it offers a caustic commentary on American life and goals of that time. The world, not just physically, but morally and culturally, is becoming synthetic at best and bankrupt at worst.The first sequence involves Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), wife of Mr. Robinson, Ben's father's business partner, trying to seduce young naive Ben only hours after he's disembarked off the plane. The scene in which Ben tries to get a room from the concierge at the Taft Hotel is one of the funniest scenes of the late 1960's. (Buck Henry who plays the concierge is one of the screenwriters.) But very quickly it becomes understood it's an affair for sexual satisfaction but not love.The stark undertones of the seduction and the eventual affair become less comedic as the film progresses. Water is a recurring presence throughout, and there are interesting interpretations of what the water means and represents. Ben's aquarium, the Braddock's swimming pool, even rain. The first time Mrs. Robinson asks Ben to drive her home she throws her car keys into his aquarium. Online Film Critics Society ranked Mrs Robinson 84th in the top 100 villains in cinematic history. (Biff from ""Back to the Future"" ranked 85th.)So the original question: Is ""The Graduate"" a romantic comedy? I would say not really. It sort of begins innocently enough but the loveless affair makes everything far darker and more disturbing. And when Ben begins dating Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, the tale takes a much darker turn. The wrath of the cougar comes to the fore, and it becomes a story involving high human drama.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
THE FIRST ROMCOM,"A gem of a movie. Crazed, amoral, intense and absorbing. I honestly feel that this forms the foundation of so many stupid romcoms churned out weekly/weakly by the Hollywood machine.Boy does something stupid. Girl hates him, boy pursues girl, girl decides to marry other boy, boy guess to great lengths to stop her at the altar/gate/clifftop etc. Girl changes mind and runs away with him. True love wins.This is the story but lacks the silly, infantile humour of today's romcoms. A very interesting foundational plot structure filled with some serious acting, great direction and superb soundtrack.A fun trip down memory lane!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very stupid.,"This movie was undeniably visually well produced and has a nice soundtrack.Anne Bancroft performed brilliantly and William Daniels did a good job too.But it simply doesn't have any substance, the plot is terrible and not remotely believable.It's totally maniac such as the main character, it keeps rushing to nowhere and can't even be a little funny.It's for sure an antiquated and sexist portrayal of society even for the time it was released, it entirely insults intelligence.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Absolute Classic.,"Being a college student in the late 60's certainly impacted my reaction to this movie.  The first time I saw it I was in love.  Certainly with Elaine Robinson - that's a given.  But also with bumbling Benjamin, who personified the out of control life so many were facing.  Add an astonishing performance from Anne Bancroft.  The Academy robbed her for sure.But the key is a miraculous job by director Mike Nichols.  His Oscar could not have been more appropriate.An absolute must see.  I own the letter-box (also a must).",,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely one of the best movies made,"At the risk of continuing the 'whether this is a great movie' debate, few movies have captured the essence of a time period as well as The Graduate. I feel that anyone who thinks that it is stupid, overrated or the characters are clueless is totally taking the wrong tack.The film is brilliantly made and directed and it has a wonderful soundtrack. These two things alone make it deserve its spot in the top movies of all time.  While the characters are not 'realistic' particularly for today's values, they are representatives of something (as has been eloquently put in other comments).  Thus their actions per se are not terribly important; it is the reasons behind them that are.It is a film of dreams, and about rejecting the staus quo, not a realistic character based story.  Its message is one of doing what you feel is right in the circumstances.  It seems to me to epitomise all the new ideas of the sixties that have been washed away in cynicism and rationalism since.  It is a monument to youth, and to the youth of the sixties in particular.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Milestone...,"The novel = A Masterpiece. The film = A Milestone.Charles Webb brought us the novel, Mike Nichols made the celluloid version. A film like 'The Graduate' leaves you awe-struck. 1967, made a film like this... 42 freaking years back... damn, even today such neat/organized and awe-inspiring cinema seems to be missing.Mrs. Robinson, be it her character or the song, both stroke a chord then and remains a cult till today. Mrs. Robinson played by late Anne Bancroft was one of the finest performances of her time. Hoffman played the nerd, confused, lustful Benjamin Braddock amazingly. Katharine Ross did a lovely job.April Come She Will remains to be my all-time favorite song. Simon & Garfunkel, made one of the finest soundtracks then, and in a landmark film like, it sounds much, much more better.'The Graduate' is a Masterpiece in all respects. My favorite film from the 60's. Take a bow, the entire team of this film.Two Big Thumbs Up!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I thought this was real funny.....,"I thought this movie was going to be quite a serious film to watch, but a few minutes into the film, I discovered the ironic humourous side to it. I think perhaps when this film first came out perhaps people didn't find it funny (I could be wrong though). Dustin Hoffman plays a character so naive as to be painful to watch - bordering on the Alan Partridge scale of things. There are several moments in this film where he puts his foot in it big time, and the poor guy really doesn't endear himself to the film's other characters. This movie has some really good direction and the music went quite well with it. The ending just has to be seen though - it has been lifted a hundred times over for use in other movies, but I thought this is still the best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Benjamin is really me (and you),"""The Graduate"" is a timeless classic about the perils of growing up as experienced by one Benjamin Braddock, an accomplished graduate (a letter athlete AND newspaper editor) from a college back east stuck about what to do with the rest of his life. About the only things he manages to do is have assignations with the wife of his father's business partner and float around the pool at his parents' upper-middle class estate. ""I'm just drifting in the pool,"" he assures his father, when the old man asks what's up. ""It's comfortable just to drift.""We never really get an idea of what Benjamin's childhood was like, which might account for his reluctance to move on. We see glimpses of his bedroom, an aquarium, and some model planes tethered to the ceiling, but not much. Dustin Hoffman plays him for the most part as a cipher. This feels at first like a bit of a mistake. Who is he? Why should we care? But then it dawns on you, as it did on me the first time I saw it, just after I graduated from college: The guy is me! By making him a blank, Hoffman and director Mike Nichols invite the viewer to pour his (or her) own suppositions into this affable but conflicted character.The supporting actors are also terrific, especially Anne Bancroft, who on repeat viewings is more the heart of the film than Hoffman in her heartless way. Every scene with her in it commands your attention, and it's a sign of advancing age when you watch more for her reactions than his. Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson has a couple of great scenes, and his last confrontation with Benjamin in his Berkeley apartment is right up there with Hamilton's final scene as Amity's mayor in ""Jaws."" Wish they made more use of him in Hollywood. I love William Daniels, too, who is both honestly affectionate and facile as Mr. Braddock, especially when he coaxes his son outdoors in his scuba suit for the film's ultimate ""lost-in-a-big-world"" metaphor, featuring Hoffman standing lonely in the center of a suburban swimming pool. It's a key image in explaining the crisis behind Ben's inertia, that he doesn't only NOT know what he's supposed to be doing with his life, but more importantly, why he should care. [""Knight Rider"" fans should know upfront that Daniels didn't do double-duty as the voice of Benjamin's Alfa-Romeo.]The whole feeling of late 1960s suburban culture is pretty immersive here, and put to fantastic use. As a child of the '70s, I can pick up on a lot of residue references. ""The Newlywed Game"" plays in the background TV as Benjamin appears to pick up Elaine Robinson for the first time, and Simon and Garfunkel are effectively sprinkled throughout. The cocktail music not by S&G that accompanies the famous ""Are you trying to seduce me"" scene is pretty great, too, an effective jaunty counterpoint to the tension between Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson that helps underscore the humor and render the moment a true cinematic classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Existential Quandary,"Back before existentialism was cool, we had The Graduate.Dustin Hoffman's breakout role is perfectly backed up by the story of a young, 21 year old man who falls in love with a young girl after having an affair with her mother. It sounds typical soap but really goes in directions still unexpected after all these years.The performances are powerful and affecting, even Mike Nichols'. As the actors brace their characters against one uncomfortable scene after another, Nichols keeps the camera usually very close to Benjamin, which causes an almost subjective and first person narrative while also making the screen very claustrophobic. And when the camera is far away from Benjamin (and he's looking at himself), he's usually blocked in by something, be it water or Anne Bancroft's (Mrs. Robinson's) legs.Very existential, it's a film that presents a hero who finds himself constantly alone in the world, and even his convictions seem unable to pull him together. It's not a happy movie, as the final shot of his face shows when he's riding off into the sunset that is definitely not of his dreams.Okay.Now that I'm done with the review proper, I thought I'd point out something interesting I discovered during my recent reviewing of this film.Modern day ""Indie"" music is like this throwback to the acoustic folksy rock of the 60s, so of course sounds a lot like our friends Mssrs Simon and Garfunkel, who of course play the music for this wonderful movie. Also, Hoffman's hair and dress, along with his painful awkwardness and his conflict with the people who surround him (""people of society"", so to speak), means that if this film was made today, it would be the Ultimate Indie Hipster Film. Hell, it's practically a Garden State, only without the cheesy happy ending and even better performances.I don't know exactly what that means, or even if it means anything at all. It's just something really interesting about how this film looks considering contemporary culture. It's not dated, per se, it's just that a lot of its motifs are weirdly similar to a cheesier and cheaper social subculture, even if it was made almost 40 years earlier.Crazy how things like that work out, huh? --PolarisDiB",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could this kind of movie be done again?,"Mike Nichols directs and Dustin Hoffman stars in this film that is now considered by many to be a classic(I would be one to concur).The performances in this film are unforced and not overstated,in particular Dustin Hoffman(in only his second movie role at the time and his first featured part)and Anne Bancroft(rest her soul!) as Ben Braddock and the bored,sexy and controlling Mrs.Robinson. Katharine Ross' Elaine Robinson is,for the most part,playing ""straight-man"" to the proceedings but she,too,is winsome and likable here. Buck Henry's script isn't so much hilarious as it is sharp,clever and amusing. Mike Nichols' direction seems to be almost ""hands off"" as the long camera shots and gradual pacing of dialogue is meant to accent the awkwardness and anticipation of the movie's characters.I imagine that many young men(I for one)have imagined having a sexual relationship with an older,more sophisticated woman. This movie,based on a book that I was not,I confess,fully aware of,examines the reality of a relationship like this. From time to time,movies have been made to explore this theme since,ranging from thoughtful and sweet(Harold and Maude) to crass and exploitive(My Tutor,anyone?). I wonder if any movie about an unusual and possibly wrong MAy/December relationship could be made again like this film. Granted,it works against the perfect backdrop:WASPy,wealthy,post-Kennedy America. But I feel like the themes here could be explored again,if done like this.In summary, a good ""theme"" movie with classic performances and lines. By no means a ""howler"" of a comedy,but worth a look for film connoisseurs anywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just a few thoughts...,"The movie stays very close to the book...if you like the movie, you'll like the book and vice-versa. The music adds a whole new dimension to the movie. In so many cases, the timing is incredible. The songs fit in thematically and time-wise.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Graduate mystifies me,"This movie is my personal favorite movie of all time. The first time I viewed it, I knew about the infamous 'Mrs. Robinson' but I never imagined the brilliant camera work or the symbolic archetypes in this movie.The symbolism, which range from the adults being called Mrs. and Mr and the youth being called by their first names showing the generation gaps to the time when Mrs. Robinson throws her keys and 'kills' the scuba diver and later Ben dresses up as a scuba diver. (Wow, can you say run-on.)Not only the symbols, but the zoom ins and outs of the camera and distortions are so existential and original to the time that it is just amazing to watch.Lastly, Simon and Garfunkel's soundtrack to this movie is mesmorizing. The first song, ""Sound of Silence"" is one of my favorite. ""Mrs. Robinson"" is also a good song although you don't get the full song (Only four lines).Again, this is one of my favorite; no, my favorite film ever made because of all the elements to a film. Character development, shot angles, symbolism, plot conflicts, etc.---Grant",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
to the point,"What makes this movie incredible is its to the point, theres no hidden symbolism, no irony that is there to point out some inadequicy in our lives (which these types of movies i do love) it just is what it is. All its about is a guys life right out of college who is just hanging around and ends up falling in love and goes to the extreme toget back that love against all adversity. There is nothing much better than this which is why this movie will always be a classic. In a way its like shakespere, it is dealing w/ human emotions, back stabbing, love and all that good stuff that is timeless. sure there are alot of instances to the time it was made, such as the famous plastics scene but in 50 years this movie will still be great to its auidience where as other classics such as Godfather may not. Another aspect that also makes this piece timeless is its use of someone doing something we all wish we would do but never would. In other words, a man laying it all on the line for something he believes is right. Deep inside us all we always want to do that, but rarely we do. Those who have seen it know what i am talking about, those who havent go see it then you will understand. Finally, this movie is so well directed and acted it has the ability to transcend time barriers. I am a 16 year old and when i first say Elain she looked hot, that can not be said for many actresses in that time period, but her look and dress could still be perfectly acceptable in todays world. Dustin Hoffman is incredible, hes the classic underdog kid, like Rudy, except the game is replaced with his life and he beautifully portrays it. He plays the perfect alienated youth. The directing is awesome, the camera angles, the scenes in the hotel room where it switches from the house to the room are so well done and so thought provoking. When you get right down to it, this is just a great movie, even to a cynical 16 year old. I loved it, i know in 50 years kids my age will love it.

Pointless and flawed,"The character of Dustin Hoffman is not interesting. He is a slightly autistic person that seems completely empty and has no motivation to do anything. He doesn't even enjoy his love affair. Moreover, his character is inconsistent, and this is in part due to the fact that the writers wanted to make him so awkward that they could put him in endless funny situations. But the problem arises: at times he is very perceptive and shows good intuition and social skills, yet at times he acts like he is not merely autistic, but outright dumb. I never bought or liked his character, and since the whole film is told from that character's perspective, it spoils all the fun.

It isn't until Mrs. Robinson's daughter played by the beautiful Katharine Ross comes into the picture and Ben falls for her just as she had for him. Sadly, Mrs. Robinson is not amused with the romance and losing Ben to her own daughter.
