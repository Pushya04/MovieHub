A visual masterpiece.,"This movie set the bar at a new level for animation. This is a great companion piece to ""March of the Penguins"". (In fact, you should see ""March of the Penguins"" before seeing this one.) While the stock animated movie script still seems be 'cute-yet-quirky animals on quest', this one pulls it off better than most.Arguably, the film makers tried to cram too many songs into the soundtrack. And the story didn't need to be as long as it was but the overall environmental message was good.In the end, you'll look how the choices of our 'modern' lifestyles affect the rest of the world.This movie is definitely worth the watch -- and a discussion with your kids afterward.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A well-translated 'individual vs. society' romp,"Animated comedies have become what Mike Tyson was to the boxing scene in the 1980's: a safe bet. This begs an upsurge in quality for the market and the otherwise forgettable family fluff films have begun to interweave deeper, more salient issues in their stories. Political messages about environmental problems was perhaps the last thing I expected to find rotating around in a happy, tappy romp like 'Happy Feet' but the fact is they are there, and they are superbly handled, as is much of the film.Advertising the film as a propaganda vehicle would have been grossly unwise, which is why the simple template story rings true to most people. All that has been put forward in trailers and synopses is the lonely journey of the Emperor Penguin Mumble (Elijah Wood), who is an outcast owing to his poor singing voice and tapalicious feet. The rest of the tight-knit, conformist community all rely on special heartsongs to appeal to mates, and not being able to carry a tune is a fatal misstep for Mumble. When he finally finds friends in Ramon's (Robin Williams) foreign group of Adelie penguins, it becomes clear that there are more things threatening the penguin society on Antarctica  the most prominent of which being human overfishing.One third into 'Happy Feet', I found myself drifting ever so slightly into indifference as the sprawling surge of R'n'B on the ice wore off. The emperor penguins all sing tunes you have heard before and it is not until Mumble encounters the eccentric party group of Adelies that Happy Feet receives a well-deserved kickstart and starts tapping into good fun. Thankfully, and admirably, it manages to avoid pratfalls, slapstick, pee- and fart jokes and instead the finely-tuned humour rests on the wealth of meticulous animation, juxtaposition, absurdist situations and snaptastic one-liners from Ramon's crew as they take Mumble in and introduce him to their kooky, fun-loving society and social guru, ""Lovelace"". This is seen in stark contrast from the emperor penguins' community on the humour side of the tapestry, and the funniest gag in the latter is Kidman returning from the long fishing journey and telling her baby Mumble lovingly that she ""has got something for him"", and proceeds to vomit into his mouth. Priceless.Happy Feet is an ambitious animated comedy. It's ambitious in its scope; there are epic aerial shots of the vast icy glacier, even from outer spaces, it treats salient issues like the effects of overfishing, it takes well-deserved jabs at organized religion, in which the elder emperor penguins represent the archaic values and traditions that they mindlessly adhere to. It features a star-studded cast, it sees seamless intercutting of live action footage and stars (I spotted an uncredited Ewan McGregor cameo, look out), and it is dedicated to Steve Irwin. Certainly 'Happy Feet' carries all of its ambitions quite well, some becoming accolades like the effective punch at conformity in which all the penguins literally look identical except for the fuzzy, fluffy Mumble, while others fall flat thanks to its shortcoming cast.It should only be so hard to provide voicework for an animated character, and Elijah Wood does it effortlessly as the fumbling, bumbling toddler-like misfit Mumble, who even looks like him with bright baby blue eyes. Nicole Kidman stars as Mumble's mother, with a ridiculously over-the-top voice, and she tips over into overacting at a few points. In the beginning we are given the well-condensed introductory story of how she met Mumble's father Memphis (Hugh Jackman) with a heartfelt heartsong, and she gets to reprise her romantic duet singing of Moulin Rouge opposite fellow Aussie. All of the aforementioned actors, as well as Robin Williams and Hugo Weaving, perform well in their respective supporting roles  all except the unforgivably redundant Brittany Murhpy as Mumble's perpetual love-interest (who is a bad singer to boot), a plain annoying and unlikeable character backed by an equally unlikable actress.Owing to its mindblowing animation (which has been absolutely honed in the past few years) and treatment of salient issues, 'Happy Feet' could not have been made five or even four years ago. The former is translated into unspeakably beautiful sequences of underwater chases and ice slides while the latter manifests itself in apt environmental warnings. Although I was mostly entertained, there were a few too many purposely ""aww"" moments crammed in and certainly it does not quite dethrone the majestic 'Ice Age' (2002) as the best sub-zero comedy ever made. There, I've now said so little in so many words.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Film,"Tap-dancing penguins could never have been pitched if the mega-hit doc Marching Penguins (2005) had not caught the imagination of every breathing human. Only this time around Happy Feet is not a doc but a high-class animation (from the director of the very humane Babe) and much more anthropomorphic than Marching Penguins because these are tap-dancing penguins.Besides the themes of individualism and environmental destruction, Happy Feet's special effects take animation as close to 3-D as could be possible in a 2-D medium. One scene with frolicking penguins careening down a mountain has the sight and sound of rapid descent so authentic as to make me cringe at each turn for fear of flying off the snow into the sky. The colors are luminous and the long and helicopter-like shots stunning enough to make you feel you're watching IMAX.Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) has no singing voice, so he can't sing a ""heart-song,"" the signature croon of a male to attract a female for life. But as Nature frequently compensates, that boy can dance. A hard-to-accept-it dad (Hugh Jackman) laments, ""It just ain't penguin."" The adventures of this hippity-hop outcast bring him to a band of diminutive Latinos headed by a savvy Ramon (Robin Williams), who helps him to find his inner heart-song in his feet and eventually the source of fish depletion (the ""aliens"" are a familiar race of buccaneersus).Along the way Mumble finds soulful love with Gloria (Brittney Murphy), a young lady strong in song and belief in Mumble. Speaking of song, much of the score, while replete with pop standards from the likes of the Beach Boys and Sinatra, adapts several gospel tunes to accentuate the theme of a savior being rejected by his own kind.Happy Feet is a happy film that features cutting-edge CG while it teaches young and old about tolerance and talent. This is the season for the tuxedo crowdshaken and stirred.",,Anonymous,Animation
One-Line Review: Happy Feet (7 Stars),"Other than the flippity-flappity of the lead lovable character it is the subtle references to the ignorant human intervention in nature's food cycle that elevates George Miller's Happy Feet into a superior film, way above the other similar films in its genre, ultimately making you tear up regardless of your eating/entertainment choices.

First half is much better than the second,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie and don't regret having gone to see it. I feel like the animators, actors doing voices and Savion Glover (hope I spelled that right!) wasted some of their efforts on an inferior-quality script.I admire the environmental theme, but felt like it was being shoved down our throats .. with no real solutions suggested, either. Some portions of the script were not explained well .. like how on earth Mumbles got back from the zoo to his family. Okay .. and why can't Mumble molt correctly, and why does his face look different from all of the other adult penguins? That's never explained, either.I laughed and smiled my way through the first half of the movie, and it felt like the second half dragged on endlessly and made little sense. :-< I was expecting to love this movie a lot more than I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a movie I expected, contains no spoilers.","The previews did not prepare me for this movie what so ever. I expected a cute animated cartoon about some dancing penguins instead I got some deep philosophical story line. Don't get me wrong, the movie was well made, there were some terrific scenes that you can tell that the designers put their heart and soul into, but the plot was a little out of whack. A kid watching this movie, would probably fall asleep; it started off really cute and funny-ish but then the writers went off on a completely irrelevant curb that made the movie super long and super pointless for any kid under 10. An adult may have found this movie insightful and thought provoking, but also a little confusing and overwhelming. It's a good movie but there were too many messages and meanings that were left undone and left me wanting more for a person that just wanted to see a cute animated cartoon about some dancing penguins.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Baby uh-huh, it DOES work","I am 44 years old, and I am actually looking forward to this film's upcoming DVD release more than my children. As a victim of childhood taunts due to birth defects, I side with Mumble and his pain as the other young birds mock his differences. When Gloria's heart song Boogie Wonderland is finally answered by Mumble's feet song, the rest of his young Emperor sisters and brothers break into dance with him, embracing him, chanting his name in joyful unison--simply stirring. To anyone who has been ridiculed or spat upon, it is a moment of sheer triumph. I can't remember feeling this good about any other film in recent years. Beautifully animated and acted, this is a joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly Moving Picture,"I saw this film on October 2nd, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.It's not easy being a young penguin when you can't sing and singing well is how you find your one true soul mate. The mating happens when young couples are attracted to each other's own rendition of their heart song. And to make matters even worse, the young penguin, Mumble, is a natural tap dancer, which is not appreciated by his parents or his teachers or the penguin colony. And to top it all off, there is a shortage of fish and no one knows why.The unhappy young Mumble runs into 5 small Latino penguins from another penguin colony and the adventure takes off. The story line cuts back and forth between the fish shortage environmental mystery and Mumble's attempt to be attractive to Gloria, his love interest. Along the way he runs into penguin eating birds and penguin eating mammals and almost alien-like man made machines.This is a musical comedy animation and the songs are classic rock and the dance routines are Broadway-theater clever and these songs and dances never stop throughout the film.Mumble is a loser in the eyes of his peers, and feels a lot of pain. But he is also heroic and brave and optimistic and he never gives up. Those traits do not let him down. Mumble can pass on an important message to young people. It's your attitude that can carry you through successfully in life. It is not always about physical attributes and physical beauty.Robin Williams voices Ramon, one of the small Latino penguins, and also Lovelace, the film-flam psychic of the Latino penguin colony. Robin Williams' two characters are over the top which is perfect for the normally over the top Robin Williams. This comedic element keeps the film from taking its adult themes too seriously.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sappy Feet,"George Miller, the director of the Mad Max films, directed this film. What a sharp contrast these films have. This film has a crazy star-studded cast. Go ahead and scroll up and see all the big-name actors they got to voice in this movie. The motion capture technology they used for the film was revolutionary for the time. Not all of it holds up as looking real, but it all still looks good.Although the technology and context of the film may be impressive, the actual story is far from it. Mumble is a penguin who likes to dance. The other penguins don't like to dance, they only like to sing. Seems odd to have those two very similar hobbies create such a sharp divide. It would be like a group of people who like to eat potato chips, but they despise the people who like to eat chips with dip. But due largely to Mumble's dancing, he is seen as an outcast to the rest of the penguins. Then the same ""just be yourself"" message shines through and everyone learns to accept him for who he is.At about an hour 20 minutes into this hour 48-minute movie, a big reveal happens that completely changes the focus of the movie. I remember when this first came out, this shift really upset a lot of people. I mean, looking back the fact that it was leading there should have been obvious. But given the flow and focus of the narrative, the change seems to come out of nowhere.I think the movie is now remembered more as the dancing penguin movie. But at the time, it was seen as a bait and switch for audience members.A lot of the movie feels like filler, especially when you look back and think about what the movie was trying to teach. The jukebox musical style doesn't work for me in this film. The ending feels like it is a parody of these types of stories, but it is doing it 100% sincere. The voice acting is fine, but it is clear that the casting was interested first in getting a big name, and second on who would fit the role.In the end, this movie does not make me very happy.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Wonderful Film That Can Open Eyes.,"If you just thought this film was about dancing penguins, you're wrong. This film is a great family film that has complex messages. It is in musical form.When it begins we learn what happened to Mumble, that makes him tap dance and not sing. His father is ashamed of him, but his mother is not. As he grows, he looks different from the other penguins. Later, he mets Spanish - like penguins that are a hight light to the film because they add to the humor. As the story goes on, we learn there are less fish and the water is filled with garbage. Because of us humans, penguins are in danger.The characters are all great and the animation is wonderful and very detailed. It is funny and it even has messages. It teaches us to accept who we are. It also tells us that the environment is in danger, but in a fun and entertaining way. This film beats Monster House and Cars as the best animated film of the year.",,Anonymous,Animation
Difficult to rate.,"I disapprove of too much of mating topic, some songs are not appropriate for kids but hey, we can hear them on the radio, in the shops etc. Sad but true. What I liked in this film is that it raises awareness of our actions on this planet, and maybe kids who have watched this, when they grow up, will think of the planet and creatures on it a bit more than we do. How they solved the problem was too fast and unbelievable but for kids this optimism could be OK. So, difficult to rate. Could have been done much better. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tappy Feet,"To run the list of propaganda-related issues in the new flick ""Happy Feet"" would take as long as the movie itself, so allow me simply to say that the film is politically oriented towards the far left. Of course, this is to be expected on some degree; most hero-journeys have some liberal affiliation towards tolerance, understanding, and acceptance. Here, however, these messages are not a means to convey a moral but an interference into the otherwise charming tale.So what's to like? Don't worry, a lot. As we have come to expect by the sudden upsurge in animation quality, the penguins and their environment are becoming more and more realistic, and here in particular the attention to detail shines. Some nice examples are long, mobile shots of penguins swimming, sliding, and falling around the icy Antarctic landscapes while completely ignoring the laws of physics. As long as we have an omniscient camera, these wild rides through computer imagery are a treat.But there is a trick to it, which was meant to be a sly stylistic move but instead cheapens the film's climax, of all things: humans, who do make appearances, are shown in live action. At first, I believed them just to be a superb example of the already stellar CGI, but no, says IMDb.com, they are real people, and they don't belong here.Thankfully, the live-action humans are not shown with the penguins, but in the segments most packed with the aforementioned propaganda. Here, the range of narration shifts away from the penguins, so rather than following the struggles of our protagonists, who are designed to appeal to children for their rebellious and individualistic natures, we get grown- ups in authority dealing with grown-up issues. This shift is so abrupt and unexpected that I fear some may be confused as to what happened to the penguins. Well, at least for that segment, they're gone.I haven't discussed plot very much in this review, probably because it has all been done before. Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) dances instead of singing and thus deserves exile from the colony, as in ""Footloose,"" finds acceptance with a gang of outsiders led by Robin Williams, as in ""Robots,"" and must combat indifferent humans to save his family, bring unity to his community, and get the the girl, Gloria (Voice of Brittany Murphy, who does her own impressive singing), as in every Joseph Campbell story. Even the characters are familiar, at least to anyone who has seen ""March of the Penguins."" Thankfully, plot comparisons to the latter movie are limited.Again, don't worry; ""Happy Feet"" borrows the best points from every movie mentioned in the previous paragraph and combines them into an okay family film. It may not be original, but it does shine for its adherence to its roots as a traditionally entertaining animated feature with a few adult-oriented jokes thrown in. My advice? Forget political affiliation or age-appropriation and see the film, if only to watch thousands of penguins doing the wave. Sweet.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Amazing animation, but a disappointment otherwise","In the never-ending quest to appease all the filmgoers by throttling them with the same beloved idea over and over again, we have Happy Feet, another movie involving penguins as main characters. Despite not being too hyped to see the film, I was intrigued by all of the praise it was getting. But after seeing it, I really beg to ask why.The film begins much the same as the entirety of March of the Penguins, with the Emperor penguins mating rituals. Only these penguins can talk, and can make the audience actually understand their mating calls - singing. After a particularly interesting opening musical sequence, we meet Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman). They fall in love, and they conceive a baby. After Norma Jean leaves to retrieve food, Memphis is left with the egg. Not so long after just barely saving the egg from a fatal accident, it hatches, and Mumble (Elizabeth Daily as a youngster, and Elijah Wood when older) is born. For some reason, Mumble has issues singing. But he does not have any problems dancing, which only brings trouble from the rest of the penguins, including his parents. The rest of the film chronicles Mumble's ups-and-downs, and how he confronts his ""problem"".Despite its cuteness, I just thought the movie was way too silly for its own good. The singing and dancing was alright for the first little bit, but just did not work nearly as well as the film went on. It wants to be the focus of the film, but feels way too awkwardly placed in between intervals with the actual plot. Even worse is the fact that the plot randomly deviates about halfway through the film, and brings in points that barely any child would be able to understand. To me, it felt out of place in the film, and just felt like it was thrown in as an after thought to make the film even longer than it should have been. I knew the trailers really left a lot to the imagination (as does the actual concept for the film), but I am fairly certain they could have pulled off something much better than they did. I do not want to reveal just what it is that happens, but despite the good intentions with the message, it just does not work.The voices are all fairly well done all around. Robin Williams is zany as always in his three roles, but of course, he pulls them off with such excellence that you can barely tell that he is voicing more than one (if any at all). Wood is great as Mumbles, and Brittany Murphy does an adequate job as the love interest Gloria. Kidman does alright for herself (if you can even tell its her voice), but I was really stunned by Jackman. His Elvis impersonation is gold, and he just rocks the screen anytime his character says anything. For such a busy actor, you really can tell his commitment to pictures like this, and it only helps to show the good things he has coming for him in the future.The real standout of the film however, are the CGI effects. These penguins look amazingly real, and their backgrounds look even better. Just looking at the penguins, you can barely tell whether they are digitally fabricated or if they are real. They walk and move like penguins, and they look pitch perfect in comparison with March. Mumble's body is particularly awestriking, as it shows off individual strands of fur in every shot. When he jumps in and out of water, it is very noticeable, and never falters once. It reminded me a lot of how excellent the original Toy Story film looked back in the '90s, and how things have improved even more since then. The snowy landscapes are also particularly good and realistic to boot. I was amazed by just how wonderful this film looked, and even more impressed by its realism. The other animals, from seals to whales, also look amazingly realistic. I felt like I was watching the real thing, not just an animated film.If anything, the film fumbles when it attempts to mix in some live-action footage late in the game. It may look like it was digitally created at first, but soon after you can see how blatantly obvious it is that it is not. It just looks weird, and it takes away from the excellent work done throughout the rest of the film. Why the filmmakers would insist on ruining a perfectly well animated film, I am still unsure. But as it goes along with the random misplaced subplot, I really begin to wonder why it was thrown in at all.To me, Happy Feet is a movie made with good intentions, but just does not end up fulfilling them. It ups the stakes too high for itself, and it just really builds up to nothing. I was disappointed heavily by it, and am still puzzled by just what the critics were thinking. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe I am just seeing through the shoddy job done on the film? Obviously it will go unknown, but just do note that there are far better animated films that have been released this year. Feet just feels subpar and inadequate in comparison to them.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This was a great film for all ages,"Finally saw this on Sunday when it previewed in the UK (out on full release Friday). The cinema was packed with kids ranging from babies to teenagers. Our group had kids from 3-15 in it as well as the parents. We all absolutely loved it; what I thought was so good was that the kids in the party all reacted according to their ages. The little ones just thought the penguins were cute and the chase scenes etc were thrilling. But the older ones thought the film had a deeper message and really enjoyed it.I would normally be fairly bored at a kids' film and have just gone to take the kids - but all the adults were fascinated the whole time. We all agreed that it was easily the best animated movie of the year. I would recommend it for any age of kid. The audience in general obviously loved it judging by the laughter but by the enthralled silence at the dramatic parts.Most families obviously consist of children of different ages - so it is not easy to find a film that appeals to teenagers as well as 3 year olds. This one did - an had the adults enthralled as well. I am not surprised that it beat Casino Royale at the Box Office in US 2 week ends running.The green message was great - I think it is really important that children should be aware of not littering etc, respecting the planet, from a young age. Having said that, I'm not sure the kids really got that message but it might have had some effect on the older ones.Have read some stuff on here saying kids should not be taught liberal values or not be made aware of them. Liberal values like tolerance and fairness etc. The film didn't promote those values more than a lot of kids' movies but even if it had I can't imagine why anyone would be worried about that so I'm not going to give it serious consideration.The film I went to see was basically a really exciting adventure story with excellent acting - you really felt for Mumble - he wasn't just a stock character. I thought Elijah Wood did an excellent job in that role. Quite a few people on the internet are asking - why use such famous actors for Happy Feet - why not have an unknown voice cast? Obviously having a very big name cast of A listers costs far more and so reduces the profits - at least that might appear to be the case. Here is one reply I found - ""some of the famous actors out there are famous (and expensive) for a reason- they're good at what they do. Elijah Wood really is pretty amazing at playing a sympathetic lead; Nicole Kidman has a fantastic singing voice to go along with a sweet stage presence...."" The visual effects were really breath-taking, probably the best animation I've ever seen. But the film also had an intriguing story with some depth - it wasn't just a bland cutesy film.I strongly recommend it for children, especially when you think of all the predictable rubbish that Hollywood often serves up for family films.Up-date - I am very pleased that it won the Oscar for Best Animated; I thought that it was clearly the best animated film of the year - and also I was pleased to see the Academy award originality and depth as opposed to a pleasant but rather bland, mix-as-before Pixar product.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Feet,"I recently got to watch this movie. I've been counting down to see it for about 80 days or so, I was extremely excited for it, so I came into the movie with high expectations. Did the movie reach my expectations? No. Almost? No not really.First of all I would like to say I loved the cuteness of this movie. The way the penguins went along with their jokes and looks was adorable. That is the part of the movie I loved and just because of it I will go see it a few more times. Also the animation was beautiful except for in a few spots I could tell they didn't give it their best to make it look as great as they could, but no ones perfect are they?But now what I didn't like about this movie. The plot was kind of bad. I'm assuming what the producer was trying to do is put as many big names into the movie to try and make us forget about the plot. But if you do pay attention to it, it's not the greatest, it's actually a disappointment.Next I don't know why but I didn't really like their choices in music. Like in the trailers I thought I would have loved it, I thought it would have been amazing but it also disappointed me. Some of the songs are kind of rusty and not performed as well as I was expecting.Overall this movie really didn't live up to my expectations for it, but there were some parts I really did enjoy about this movie so I will see it maybe....2 or 3 more times.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feets don't fail me now!,"Happy Feet, directed by the man who gave us both Babe: Pig in the City and Mad Max, is just the kind of feel-good animated film that works on a few different levels; it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll inevitably, unquestionably, make you tap your toes or bounce your leg, right there in the theater. It's charming and exquisitely detailed, and it succeeds where it really counts: It makes you really feel for the lovable lead penguin, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood).Mumble is an unfortunate penguin, you see, because was born with no singing ability, and in his penguin tribe one attracts a mate through the use of song. The poor flightless bird can only look on helplessly as his fellow hatchlings croon their little hearts out. Amazingly, though, Mumble can tap dance, a big no-no in the penguin community. Soon, with no heart song to guide him, Mumble isn't permitted to graduate from school, to the chagrin of his Elvis-like dad (Hugh Jackman) and his songbird-like mom (Nicole Kidman).Mumble heart belongs to the best singer in his age group, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), but without the gift of song he can't hope to woo her. Worse, with the penguins' food supply running out, some of the other birds begin to blame Mumble's foot-tapping, that somehow he is angering the great god Guin. The sad-sack penguin is then drummed out of the penguin corps, shunned for his lack of song and strength of feet, and he runs into another penguin colony, one that uses pebbles to woo their females instead of song, and makes new friends - a Latino-sounding quartet that's high on life, full of zest and pizazz and charisma, everything that Mumble's old group isn't.Then Mumble hears from some predator birds of mysterious ""aliens"" who probe and attach tags to their victims. Mumble thinks these aliens might have something to do with the lack of fishies for everyone to munch on, so he and his new pals head off on a Quest to find these aliens and ask them to stop stealing all the fish.Some of the scenes are beautifully imagined, including attacks by sea lions (quite harrowing, actually, until its denouement), vultures, and killer whales, not to mention every time Mumble and/or his posse leap off a cliff and slide down the side like avian sleds. Or through ice tunnels. Or through the water itself, shooting like streaming jetliners with mile-long contrails. Gorgeous animation.At its heart, the movie is about how it's okay to Be Different. It's about how older folks sometimes hold prejudices that are as illogical as they are insulting, and how they'll often pass along those prejudices to their children, sometimes through direct actions and sometimes by dint of their inaction when wrongs are being perpetuated.Robin Williams takes on four roles in this movie: the Narrator (where he's excellent and not at all hammy), Ramon and Cletus (two of the feisty new penguins), and Lovelace, a self-professed penguin guru to whom penguins go to have their problems solved. On the one hand, Williams is delightful doing what he does best, improvising rapid-fire comic patter to get laughs; on the other hand, he's Robin Williams, and although there are differences between his voice characterizations, they all bear a strong resemblance to one another. As with most animated films, the movie is well-cast; Jackman is particular has an appealing Southern drawl (ironically, he and Kidman are Aussies playing penguins with southern accents).In the wake of the phenomenal, surprise success of March of the Penguins, Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. It'll be very difficult not to shed a tear at the mistreatment of Mumble by his peers and his elders, and it'll be near impossible to thoroughly enjoy this dazzling animated offering.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Playful premise marred by some unnecessary content,"Happy Feet starts out good natured and upbeat. The characters are very well defined, and likable. The storyline breezes along with lots of fun action at the outset, but the movie stumbles badly in the latter stages.It's a typical story about a misfit, who, through good will, resourcefulness, and perseverance, endeavors to prove himself and win acceptance. In a community of a species of penguins who select mates through singing, the hero of the story, appropriately named Mumbles, has about as much singing talent as William Hung, although he dances like Fred Astaire. Unfortunately, dancing is verboten to these penguins. The food supply of fish is diminishing mysteriously, and our hero hears legends of aliens who may be responsible for the problem. He embarks on a mission to learn the truth, and encounters a variety of oddball characters and adventures on his quest.The obligatory comic relief characters turn out to be a bunch of small penguins with East L.A. accents who are very funny and amiable; their leader is voiced by Robin Williams, who voices this and two other roles very well. Best strengths of the movie are the wide variety of music styles, and superior animation technique.The results of what Mumbles learns involves some adult political issues that will go right over children's heads, and possibly bore them. Cheap shots are taken at various religious and political beliefs. The collision between the story's exaggerated and silly fun with a sudden diversion to overly stark matters is awkward and unnerving for the audience.In summary, the first half of the film sticks to the kind of amusing fun you'd expect from the title, the latter part of the movie delves into serious matters that don't fit here. OK for a one time family viewing, but not on a level with similarly toned movies like Finding Nemo.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining Despite It's Flaws,"2006 has turned out to be the year for digital animation. From talking cars to suburban turned forest animals it seems like we've almost seen it allor so we thought. The fresh and upbeat penguin-filled musical 'Happy Feet' is the thirteenth digitally animated film to be released this year. And as expected, people are eating it up. Some have gone as far to say it's the year's best. There was better this year, but 'Happy Feet' is okay.In 'Happy Feet' we are given front row seats to the birth and growth of a penguin by the name of Mumble who is voiced by Elijah Wood. He's different from all the other penguins. In a world where finding your ""heartsong"" is crucial, poor Mumble isn't able to keep a tune at all. Interestingly enough though, he can dance up a storm. Unfortunately this is frowned upon and ends up causing him great distress. Eventually the elder penguin Noah, who is voiced by Hugo Weaving, accuses Mumble of bringing on the famine that is currently afflicting the penguins. Mumble attempts to explain that he believes ""aliens"" are the real cause. Noah doesn't take him seriously at all and banishes him, claiming that once he is gone, the famine will end. Mumbles then promises that he will return, and when he does he will bring proof that the alleged ""aliens"" are to blame. He then embarks on his journey where along the way he makes some new friends and learns the world outside his own is much different than he could have ever thought possible.Visually, 'Happy Feet' is amazing. Almost every landscape down to the smallest icicle look so very real. Even the penguins themselves are highly detailed, but obviously aren't real. Aside from that and the direction from Greg Miller, everything presented in 'Happy Feet' is just okay. Nothing in it evokes a wholehearted wow. The plot itself takes what seems forever to be revealed. There's a forty five minute wait before anything about a famine is even mentioned. Watching the film is a lot like riding a roller coaster. No, I don't mean its a thrill ride. The way the story is set up, it goes up and down. Each time it begins to drag, something comes along to get it going again. And when the ending finally comes, it appears forced. The whole addition of an environmental issue still has me wondering. I guess because without it there would be nothing for Mumble to do on his journey of discovery.The main issue I have with 'Happy Feet' though revolves around the music. Yes, I know it's a musical, but he music seemed to really exceed the film itself. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. The reason being is because the films suggests that there actually is a real story behind it all. Either way, it doesn't really matter because it's the singing and dancing that will have people returning to see it all again. So despite having some assuredly bad qualities 'Happy Feet' does indeed have its moments. It does what it was supposed to, and that's entertain.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sneaky - This is an animated file for ADULTS,"In the words of the nine year old I took with me 'It was thumbs sideways'.Happy Feet, like The Incredibles, is a cartoon with nuances that play to adults. This is an adults cartoon. Using many catchy tunes that adults grew up with, and most kids never heard, this story is cute but ultimately not targeted towards kids. The movie is a bit long with a number of scenes that could be shortened or cut out.The MPAA should mark not only the recommended age range in the PG ratings but also require the producers to say who the target audience is. I know many children will not be excited after this movie from the combination of adult themes and the long running time.As a cartoon for adults, I also have to say it is 'thumbs sideways'.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visually stunning film with some fun thrown in,"This is the first time I have seen live action added to enhance the CGI. But it is, in the end, the CGI that makes this film work. The influence of March of the Penguins is obvious, and the underwater scenes are so impressive you could easily forget this is a cartoon.Unfortunately, the film tries to make up for its less than original story with several cutesy song and dance routines. Don't get me wrong. The song and dance routines were fun to watch. I will probably never forget Memphis' impersonation of Elvis.But it seemed after a while the music was there to ensure this is a full length movie. While the characters are very likable, the story could have used more development. Mumble's short life with humans was pretty disjointed and not very believable. Better, methinks, it might have been if Mumble could have bonded with one at arms length than through a piece of glass. On reflection, its almost as if the music was more important than the script.Still in all it is a visually stunning film with some great fun thrown in.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Joyful Masterpiece,"George Miller's Happy Feet is an exuberant, beautifully animated film and, by a wide margin, the best CG film ever made. The photo-realistic characters and Antarctic landscapes provide the backdrop for a story of brilliant originality. The film's plot is somewhat based in reality - but with a surreal twist. The movie is a spectacular jukebox musical in which Emperor penguins serenade each other with songs from some of the royalty of music (Queen, Prince, ""The King"" Elvis Presley) in order to find a mate. One penguin, Mumble, cannot sing but expresses himself through tap-dancing. For this abnormality, he is ostracized by his fellows, blamed for the misfortune of famine and eventually banished from his home. He then goes on a perilous quest to find answers that are not otherwise forthcoming.In addition to the music and spectacle, the greatness of Happy Feet is found in its ideas. Miller (producer of Babe) has made another great film for children (though certainly not only for children) because he knows that the great children's stories do not merely pander to and occupy them but attempt to convey something about the nature of the world, something that is not necessarily pleasant. The themes of Happy Feet are as timeless as they are important. Tolerance and respect for those different from you, compassion, respect for the environment and for the dignity of all its inhabitants; these are not political issues but ones of the greatest moral importance and essential to the survival of the human spirit. In a world that sometimes seems to be becoming increasing intolerant, in a world that may be standing on the precipice of environmental disaster if something is not done, I find a great deal of hope in this story. These animated penguins, who show more humanity than most human actors do on celluloid, may just have what it takes to bring out the basic goodness in the people who see them, to ""appeal to our better nature,"" if you will.On another level, I see Happy Feet as a great parable about the generation gap, with Mumble and his friends as the children of the world. Their differences and uniqueness frighten their elders, who may be falsely pious or else just set in their ways. Yet Mumble does not hold a grudge against them. In the end, Mumble not only makes the world better than it was when it was given to him, but actively draws those same elders into this new world, redeeming them and allowing them to help in its creation. All with the power of song and dance!Overall, Happy Feet is a joyous spectacle for the eyes and ears. It was so good that I had to see it a second time in the theater, something I had never done before. It even makes tap-dancing seem incredibly cool. This is a film that cannot be ignored and will not be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Impressive, Expressive and Delightful for all ages","Rarely do I enjoy animated films these days: I find the animation (mostly computer generated) to be colorful but banal, and the action angles are selected by the programmer's eye, not the way a natural observer would have seen the shot (like we saw in classic cell animation of years past). ""Happy Feet"" is different. The combination of rotoscoping (now advanced motion capture), intense attention to detail and organic POV make this film extraordinarily enjoyable to watch. The sound quality was top-notch, and the music loads of fun for anyone with a pulse. The character voices from Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, and others was perfectly matched to their characterizations. Savion Glover's performance as Mumble's ecstatic feet was not only good as a an animated fanciful Emperor Penguin, but also valid as a fine, skilled tap dancer; one of the finest. The continuity was good, impressive editing, and the message clear: celebrate our differences, adapt to change when necessary, and don't be afraid to take on challenges, even when they seems insurmountable. That's a great message for anyone at any age.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Total Junk,"I saw this with my 5 ear old son, and we walked out about 3/4 way into it. I tried so hard to give it a chance, but the lack of any meaningful story, chaotic music, and substance did me in. I am not saying that children's movies need to have a lot of substance, but how about some kind of story that our children can make sense of, instead of meaningless dancing scenes. I don't understand how anyone (with half a brain) can think this movie is good. There are also so many racial stereotypes - the physically small hispanic flock that the main character visits. This flock evidentially doesn't care about education, as they are content in trying to get in each other's pants. This is a product of marketing, hype, and Hollywood junk. It would be wise not to buy this DVD and rot your child's brain.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bad Vocals But Happy Feet,"Happy Feet' is a delightfully cheerful little movie about an emperor penguin who has an unappreciated gift of tap dancing and his inability to sing causes others to look down upon him. While the penguins suffer from food shortage, he aims to rescue the fish that serves as their daily meal. The animation is excellent. Very few such CGI animated films have looked so real to me but in 'Happy Feet' it is almost hard to tell. The characters are fun (though a little out of place and unnecessary at times). The voice-casting is great with Robin Williams and the Hispanic adelaides stealing the show. Nicole Kidman lends her beautiful voice as the loving mother while Hugh Jackman's dad character is a little clichéd. Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy are annoying but you get used to it. The story could have been better developed as there are a few plot holes now and then and the ending is a little too optimistic, too unrealistic and too abrupt. 'Happy Feet' is meant to be a family film but it could have been a stronger movie and at the same time remains enjoyable to the family had the story been given a little more focus. There are a range of songs, most of which are popular numbers. Even though the visualizations were fun to watch, they were at times distracting and deviating from the main plot. Yet, 'Happy Feet' was still an entertaining flick and it had that adventurous feel. There was not one boring moment and the viewers wonder how Mumble will rescue the fish from being stolen (I just wished that the conclusion was done differently).",,Anonymous,Animation
A Little Confused But Still Entertaining,"It took me along time to get around to this film despite the fact it had won the Oscar for Best Animated Film, and I think it was because I was unclear about what kind of film it was.After watching I'm still not entirely sure how to classify it: musical, adventure, comedy, environmental message, coming of age, romance - with some very strong references to 'Footloose'.That being said the animation, the songs and the cast were all very impressive and if i think it tried to put in a few too many messages into one film - I think it was still mostly successful.Maybe if it was a little more focused it could have been better - but it still worked and I can't really say what aspects I would have removed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good,"Passable fun. Into the world of the Emperor Penguins, who find their soul mates through song, a penguin is born who cannot sing. But he can tap dance something fierce! I never laughed so hard in my life. After reading some of the negative reviews on here, I just have to say that some people really don't get it. It is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. My girlfriends and I were so excited to see this movie, thinking it was going to be a fun movie. The main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted.

Then the movie revealed themes I never thought they would accomplish such as Religious fanaticism and Human's destruction of the environment.It reminded me of 6th Sense because it was so twisted yet taught a very important moral lesson.Robin Williams is the highlight of the movie, his 2 characters are both well portrayed and well voiced.Highly recommended.

Incredibly Boring,"My husband & I watched this recently with our 6-year-old son, and my brother-in-law. All three adults were nearly put to sleep by this endless, pointless, plot less film. My son laughed out loud at one joke (involving flatulence -- he *is* six, after all), and seemed to like the movie overall, but he hasn't referred to it since. He certainly hasn't asked if he could watch it again, which is typical for him.At first, I thought that it might be simply the visual monotony of so much ice & snow that was putting me to sleep.

Mad Maximum Motion,"You can parse this into three bits I think.The first is what people normally see, the story. Miller and many of the Oz New Wave don't pay much attention to this. They put something there of course, otherwise we would get distracted. Here it is an amazingly clever fold, referencing another movie ""Flight of the Penguins."" Now as it happens, I really disliked that movie. It was cast as a documentary, but was really an exercise in making these animals ""human."" Its a bit disgusting and something of the ultimate in human-centrism. We turn these birds into performers for us.Miller grabs this and turns it on itself. The story has penguins in crisis because of human- caused environmental damage. They are saved because we think them cute. Literally at the end, we have the makers of that earlier film arriving at the end and capturing their cute human mannerisms. Our environmentalist urges are largely just refactored racial superiority.If we just had that one component this would be worthwhile, but he goes a step further by making these birds yet more human in the way they perform for us. Like a million Judy Garlands on speed, they get their whole identity from performance. This provides an opportunity for a narrative complication: the priests of one performance religion holding against another. Its a pretty sweet and intelligent notion.We literally have humans as birds. We have the voices as usual. By an accident of technology, we accept this readily. The relatively new idea is the motion. Cinematic grammar is primarily about motion, presence and absence of light, motion and environment.Miller's cool idea has us working with novel motion in two ways.The first is in motion of the objects. We see birds, but they move as humans. Its all human motion, both in normal and performance mode. We used to call this rotoscoping and it involved tracing a film. Now we do it with digital rigging and captured kinematics, but it is the same idea we had with Betty Boop's dreamfolk whose movements are Cab Calloway's. Its nice enough for us to fall into the trap Miller sets up because we like these performances.The second is the motion of the camera. 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" was a major step forward in how the camera dances. That obviously was the inspiration for this not only in the even more radical camera sweeps but how they tighten for the underwater chase scenes.I wish he had decided to innovate instead of exploit. But still, with all this focus, on watching and dancing, its a rare treat.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
A cosy watch.,"Happy Feet made a big splash back in 2006 taking home the Animated Academy Award. For what it is, it's pretty delightful. I quite liked the initial story and it's semi-musical style, taking time out to sing a song or dance a dance. It's efficiently cute. Kind of strange for the first song to be a Prince song though it fits the context. The detail in the animation is terrific and they make the colour-less landscape really work. However, the film kind of feels surreal when humans get involved, known in the film as aliens, and it ends up quite heavy handed with its environmentalist themes. Granted, that kind of bigger picture message is inevitable in a kids film like this, especially when the big love story isn't really compelling and the outcast having an adventure is much more interesting. I do love the irony at the end where the film itself is now responsible for passing along its message. I wonder if it worked.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Time is not on this film's side (at least for me),"Ever have one of those moments when you see a movie that's been getting a lot of attention and you're overwhelmed by it, only to revisit it on video and realize it's not all that great? Well, Happy Feet is one of those movies. When I saw it in theaters three weeks after it opened, I loved it. I thought the inclusion of the environmental stuff was as genius as the music and dancing.I just finished watching the movie in its entirety for the first time since then, and time hasn't been kind to it. Not that I'm saying it's dated, since we're still dealing with global warming and stuff. I'm saying that this film could have used less of the environmentalism and more of the fairy tale whimsy that was prevalent during the first third. Hell, as I was watching the damn thing, I was imagining this story done in the style of Leo Lionni and his brilliant, albeit sadly overlooked, book Tico and the Golden Wings. (Maybe they should have had a wishingpenguin?) Don't get me completely wrong, it still has great music and terrific dancing, but George (Mad Max) Miller really missed the mark here. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic visual but fatuously overwrought in expositionary dialogue & dizzying visuals at times,"I love the Mad Max franchise -- The Road Warrior the best action movie ever produced next to Terminator 2. I loved Lorenzo's Oil, a genuine epic of a medical drama that, like Zodiac, is rarely or never repeated in the sense of ""engaging epicness"" tackling a complex subject in strict dramatic work. I loved Babe: Pig in the City as a flawed masterwork.The latter bombed at the box office so bad I thought George Miller have been sent to the proverbial ""movie jail,"" recollecting Elaine May's last directorial effort in Ishtar that was one of the biggest commercial flops in cinema history 20 years ago.No, Mr Miller have returned in full form, and his massively immense directing talent is evident throughout the film, with astonishing photorealistic visuals and often silly humor to boot.But there are a few scenes that I thought are so overscripted it borders on annoying. Particularly Adélie Penguins as the Spanish amigos (however amusing the group of five amigo characters are in their way, which is one of the highlights of the film in entertaining storytelling) talking incessantly & commenting on the main characters' interaction in love and needing space, as if small children in the audience should know the nuances translated aloud. And the visual gets quite excessive with the continuously revolving camera movements that literally fly all over. There are some amazing FX shots, but there are dizzying and rapidly confusing shots that serve almost nothing but resemble an elaborately designed Six Flags roller coaster ride. And the environmental message as well as commentary on religious matter, while pointed, come off fairly contrived but saved by Miller's near impeccable directing style without beating the heads over a lil' too much.Overall, Happy Feet is a good film that makes the viewer tap his or her feet in intuitive response to the film's music and visuals featuring singing & dancing penguins, albeit with minor flaws. I think consistently entertaining story and dazzling visuals by Animal Logic & other FX houses contributed to Miller receiving a Best Animated Feature Oscar, which may be deserved. I haven't seen Cars & Monster House but will be sure to catch up with these, despite my reservation about the movies. It's about time Pixar lose the monopoly on Best Animated Feature Oscars (with the exception of The Incredibles).Happy Feet is a fine achievement in CG animation and visual aesthetics to date, because there are a few times when I was momentarily stunned by the splendid creative vision while watching the movie without influence of unnecessary real-world cynicism. George Miller and the production crew at Animal Logic did a fantastic job realizing their vision that pass for photorealism in near-perfection. Story, however, remains a tad maudlin for my taste, but humor - especially the amigos - help to overcome the saccharine element.Be forewarned, Happy Feet is properly rated PG for scary scenes of peril, rude humor and mild language with brief underlying sexual innuendos that children may or may not catch. May be offensive to devoutly religious conservative viewers (parents & individuals) whose faith is questioned by the movie (I know, typical unsubtle Hollywood imposing values). Still a good picture for the family to enjoy on a relaxing night.*** 1/2 (close to 3)",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A beautifully charming, yet also surprisingly smart animated entertainment.","My Take: Stunning animation and terrific musical numbers worthy of Gene Wilder make for a great time at the movies.After MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, a movie/documentary about real-life penguins and their Antarctic perilous journeys, which was released just previously, audiences might have already seen enough penguins, even just for this year. But another penguin fairytale is just at hand, with its trailer already out at the time. HAPPY FEET, by the looks of the trailer, may just be a corny animated movie which relies heavily on the cutesy than a proper story and more elaborate creativity. I missed HAPPY FEET on the big-screen, but I was sound surrounded by the fact that it was a hit. Of course, the appeal of famous actors like Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy and a soundtrack of famous pop songs (old and new) performed by the best of computer-animated penguins. If you think as much I did back then, well wrong are we.I didn't think I was going to hate HAPPY FEET back then, but I didn't expect much from it. But, when I finally saw, the surprise was sudden. Armed with the usually reused charms of talking animals, HAPPY FEET takes some of the things much further, turning it into an actually clever musical adventure, where there are a lot of singing, dancing, but doesn't lack the importance of good characters and a somewhat charming storyline. Sure, the story gets quite corny and silly, sure too much of the singing and dancing will get some of the viewers bogged down. But the penguins never get boring. In fact, viewers might find themselves forgetting that the characters are penguins, due to their much diverse personalities that almost makes them human. Pity on the humans of course, since most of them are reduced to blue-eyed, motion capture drones, but no matter, HAPPY FEET has a place for them just as well.The success of its genius come from the fact that, on the helm, is director George Miller who, as you might remember produced the highly-acclaimed talking animal movie BABE then directed the sequel called BABE: PIG IN THE CITY, which were the smartest in this somewhat popular sub-genre. Miller, unlike some others who might get the job, gives his ""kid's movie"" characters with much maturity, giving them more appeal to the old as much to the young. Although the preachy message might have been more improved, there couldn't be much more of a thing to be done with it, so let's leave well enough alone. The voice actors all do well, blending in with their characters and do quite well with a specially hilarious and yet cohesive script.Does HAPPY FEET change to world, as it might have been described in the movie? Definitely not. But it doesn't have to. It does what it was intended to do, and transforms it into a more remarkable result. For its success (and its penguins), I'm grading this ""happy feat"" a *****.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation, so-so story","As an animated picture, it's one of the best I've seen, but as far as the story goes, I wish they would have focused on the 4-year old mumble who is much cuter than the teen-aged forever molting ""Mumble"". I've watched a dozen or so nature documentaries on penguins and while this movie was fun to watch, real ""Emperor"" penguins just stand around in a huddle most of the time trying to stay warm, making this film just ""cute"". Anyway, I didn't mind the environmental message so much but they could have told the story in a less depressing more humorous way. After all, in reality every animal eats every other animal. The penguins eat fish, seals eat penguins, sharks eats seals and humans eat fish that those animals eat and no fish, none of those animals survive either.

Terrible move - inappropriate and politically charged,"What should have been a fun little movie for the kids turned out to be a long, often inappropriate, political statement about saving the environment. I thought at any minute Greenpeace and ACLU representatives were going to start walking down the aisles handing out brochures.For starters, the penguins sing a lot of ""heart songs"" based on modern pop music. While this should have been a fun way to make the penguins sing - the producers chose songs that you would never let your small kids listen to.For instance, at one point in the movie, the penguins start singing ""Let's talk about X baby, let's talk about you and me..."" They sang this parody of Salt N Peppa's ""Lets talk about sex"" while doing some type of suggestive mating dance! It was an uncomfortable moment for me while my 5 year old stared wide-eyed at the screen.There are a lot of sexually charged themes in the movie including the ""guru"" that sounds like Barry White and mates the females like Tommy Lee. The entire reason for the penguins singing is so they can mate. That's fun to explain to kids, huh?! Then there is the religious aspect of the movie where the producers make it seem like any type of faith-based religion is silly, stuffy and a waste of time. The ""bad"" penguins in the movie are the religious ones and not loving or accepting of anyone but ""their"" kind. If you are a believer in any kind of faith-based religion  especially Christianity  you will be very uncomfortable during these parts.Finally there is the environmental protection aspect of the movie. While I am all for protecting the environment - the movie was forced to end abruptly with argument between nations (like you would see at the UN) where folks are arguing to make changes that will help the penguins. The message was deep and hard for kids to understand. There was no explanation really why or how the environment was being harmed other than a 30 second shot of a barge over fishing an area. This theme seemed forced and overbearing.In the end my 5 year old took away that the guru got caught in a plastic beverage holder which made him crazy, the ""religious"" penguins made the boys parents not love him anymore, and that the humans were coming to get all of the tap dancing penguins to take them to the zoo. Wow  it was a fun ride home for us while I explained what really was happening.In any case -- I would stay far away from the movie.

Spectacular visuals makes up for a so-so movie,"After hand-drawn animation was declared dead by most of the Hollywood studios because it wasn't hip enough, CGI features were churn out and they all, more or less, felt as the same movie. Elements as adult-in-jokes, pop references and gags to kids made the audience stand in line to see them theatrically, but in my opinion, few of the features really distinguished themselves. I'm not sure which category I should place Happy Feet. It's a cute and entertaining flick, but yet a schizophrenic one at the same time.From a visual standpoint, this movie is one of the most gorgeous-looking CGI features to date. The animals have a very authentic and realistic look and some of the background looks almost real. The design of the humans are less detailed, though, but they look far from cartoony as the humans in the Pixar film does. This is certainly one of the most jaw-dropping animated features ever made.But there's a component which is called a story. To be honest, I never became fond of the plot. For the first, it was a about an outcast. Several animated films (both CGI and hand-drawn) has been about an outsider, so the theme has unfortunately been worn out and feels nothing special or fresh in this film. I also felt the story was overall a little weird, including singing and dancing penguins. But on the positive side, though, while the characters aren't memorable, they're still likable, especially the Adelie Pinguins.I'm not claiming that this is a overall bad movie, but it has so many balls in the air; there's drama, there's comedy, there's action and there's music numbers. The latter component actually works. And this is a nice family film, with a serious tone in some sequences which will appeal to adults. But in a jungle of CGI animated films, ""Happy Feet"" doesn't distinguish it self from the rest. The sweet moments are too sugary and the grave moments are... well, grave. Of course there's some humor, but nothing that made me laugh hysterically. And there's the cheesy components. All of these elements are combined into a mixture that seems overall schizophrenic instead of telling a coherent story. But of course there are far worse movies than this. At least the characters and the music makes the movie watchable.But the visuals is undoubtedly the biggest strength here and the film should be recommended mostly for the visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's almost like they couldn't get enough people to buy tickets for ""An Inconvenient Truth"" so they had to trick people into seeing it by dressing it up as a kid's penguin movie. If you want a cute movie that doesn't strive to make itself political, avoid this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let me tell joo something!,"Happy Feet follows a young penguin, Mumble, who cannot sing like all the other penguins, but can dance up a storm! As Mumble grows into his personality, he helps the others around him realize what is important.I was only slightly annoyed at Nicole Kidman's voice because it was practically impossible to understand what she was saying half the time. All the other characters were fantastic, and Robin Williams as Ramon was priceless!My boyfriend & I took his two kids (ages 7 and 10) to see this movie and we had an amazing time. The story was funny, interesting, and heartfelt. It definitely appeals to both children and adults-I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so that I can watch it whenever I want.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great CGI - Mediocre Story,"The CGI was some of the best I've ever seen. The natural beauty of Antarctica and the animal life there was truly spectacular. At times it was hard to tell that this was not live-action photography. For this reason alone, Happy Feet is worth seeing.Unfortunately, this is about the only reason for an adult to see the film. The story and characters are tepid; even Robin Williams can only muster occasional excitement with his two wacky characters. Once again, a big budget animation feature falls flat with celebrity voices instead of professional voice talent. The story, such as it is, doesn't really start to take off until the second half of the movie. The first half is seemingly endless vignettes of exposition and set up. The dancing sequences, particularly the one featured in the year-old teaser trailer, liven things up but don't move the plot along. I was annoyed at the inconsistent juxtaposition of musical styles; one moment it was hip hop, the next blues, the next rock, with few, if any, lasting through an entire song. One of the story problems I had was a lack of a consistent villain. Mumbles is attacked early in the film by a vicious seal. I kept expecting this scary bad guy to reappear to get his comeuppance, but he just disappears. There was not even a hint of what turned out to be the real antagonists until halfway through the film. Finally, I felt the ecological disaster moralizing was just too preachy. Maybe you have to be that blatant for children, but as an adult I felt like the film was talking down to me.Happy Feet tries to be a nature film, a musical, a love story, and a sitcom, but fails to effectively deliver any of those. I really came away thinking that Happy Feet was little more than a glorified Afternoon Special. It makes me appreciate all the more how films like Shrek and Flushed Away can successfully combine action, romance, comedy, and drama on levels that both children and adults can enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Existential post-apocalyptic angst-fest with Moulin Rouge musical numbers,"Bambi is sad. Dumbo is sad. This movie is messed up. It's not that it's bad, it's that it's an animated movie about singing penguins directed by the same guy who directed Mad Max, being marketed as if it's another installment of Toy Story. Narratively the film bites off a great deal more than it can chew. Is it a story about how a person who is different can have a valued role in a community? Environmental cautionary tale?

Well done!,"Excellent and well done. This movie has humor in it ranging from crude, adult humor to entertaining slapstick and kids humor, making the film very funny at times and melancholy at others. Hard to accomplish, but the Warner Brothers found a way to pull all of it together in ""Happy Feet"". The comic relief being neither to extraneous nor too single-audience oriented was very well scripted, and the talents of robin Williams shine once again.The plot throughout the movie seemed to be rather unclear until one specific scene came along, though - twenty minutes or so into the movie. After the plot was introduced, it seemed to be no more than an irrelevant curiosity of a small number of the characters, ergo the plot was rather equivocal during much of the film and until the main character blatantly states his standing on the seemingly unimportant fact, turning the audience's attention in the general direction of the film. As the film turns to a conclusion, the last few scenes are rather ridiculous and unnecessary, and it seems as if the director and scriptwriters forgot to remember to construct and script a sufficient and / or montage resolution.The ideas, characters, and music were superbly developed, thought out, and intertwined throughout the entire movie, and the musical-like scenes were very well done and perfectly animated as well. A very original and entertaining movie, just work out a few scenes and ""unrealistic"" patches and it'd be a nine out of ten; work a few scenes in and work out a few scenes and it'd be a ten out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Then when goes to penguin school, Gloria lets out her beautiful heart song. Then when its Mumble's turn he blows it and everyone starts laughing except Gloria. Then when they tell him to look deep in his soul he starts dancing. I'm not going to tell anymore if you want t find what happens then go watch the movie. I'll just say its a touching movie.

Once I finally came across a trailer for it, and watched the trailer, I was even more excited. So some friends and I decided to go see it.The first half of the movie is well done. The script is funny, the characters are well developed, and the imagery is extraordinary. My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it.When the movie goes into the second half, it gets a lot more serious and there is an overplayed attempt to get a message across. The characters' quest is a little cheesy, and I was very disappointed by the end of the film.The animation is amazing throughout the entire movie, but the end sort of kills it.

Visually stunning and downright adorable,"As you leave the theater, ""Happy Feet"" gives you exactly what its title offers. This movie is clearly intended to be nothing but fun and it delivers exactly that.Probably the most enjoyable part of the film is its uniqueness. It breaks much of the mold that every CGI film in the last few years has stuck to unflinchingly through song and dance that while not presented in a musical movie style still make the film incredibly fun. While the plot is ultimately insignificant to most of the movie, it is still engaging through the action and especially the characters. While some of the action sequences feel straight out of ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ice Age,"" the characters--namely the amigos, or a band of small penguins led by Robin Williams--are what saves this film. In fact, the film is nothing but cute until the amigos come along and add some personality and humor.The most impressive aspect, however, are the visual effects. The penguin fur is remarkable and one can only sit in awe at the realism of the penguins' breathing. The non-animal elements were also incredibly realistic, like the settings, as well as the incorporation of live action footage which was a much better choice than making the humans CGI. The visual choice here was a much better choice compared to some of the more cartoon-like computer animated films like ""Madagascar.""While the film is not better than those computer-animated films that have the formula down to a tee, its unique style makes it much better than the films that have merely tried to imitate with mediocrity rather than innovate, which ""Happy Feet"" truly does.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"March of the Penguins, err... PIXELS","Happy Feet, the newest in the CGI rendered films, features the voice talents of Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Robin Williams. (Seems Williams is in every other animated fare thats released) Billed talent aside, it's the music that makes Happy Feet a visually stunning/tap your feet spectacle.Since Penguins communicate through their voices (what's referred to in the film as a ""Heart-Song"" the music in Happy Feet is top notch. Covering tracks from Hip-Hop, to classic rock, to Opera. It's not just the catchy tunes that make Happy Feet dance, it's the way they integrate the heart pounding choreography with mash-up style song numbers.The films several plots are your same song & dance, however one side plot tends to get a little preachy. (Al Gore would give this film a seal of approval). The one feature that sets Happy Feet apart from other CGI Counterparts (Barnyard/Chicken Little/Over the Hedge) is its mix of Live Action and CGI. It's almost difficult to tell whats real and what isn't.So if your in the mood to chill out at the local cineplex: Happy Feet offers a cool time for all.

Happy Fluff - Nothing New,"It is clear that the idea of this movie came from the ""March of the Penguins"" documentary. I expected more...The movie attempts to capitalize on the cuteness of the penguin and on amazing life cycle of the Emporer Penguins. This film doesn't even really give lip service to the almost unbelievable feats performed by the Emporer Penguin in the harshest environment on earth. Then again, the story was not intended to retell the story of the penguin... This is where the film fails - the only thing original here is the penguins themselves. The animation and CG effects are top-rate but the story is unoriginal and predictable. Even the musical selections are unoriginal, although it was interesting to hear a revival of the 1980's ""The Message"" by Grandmaster Flash - how that song relates the life of the Emporer Penguin is anybody's guess.This film is ""Happy Fluff"". The shallow attempts at dealing with real messages such as pollution and overfishing are just that - shallow. Even still the movie does attempt to make us aware of these issues and on how they affect our animal neighbors which is more than I can say about other recent animated features.The film does have its moments and is better than some other recent animated flicks such as ""Shark Tale"". It was not a waste of time or money but it just did not live up to the hype.

tap your flippers for this penguin piece of fun,"'Happy Feet' is a bit of a one joke short stretched out to feature length, but you can't really complain when it is done so well. Fun, cute, and full of music (Elvis, Prince, Aretha, you name it), this tale of a penguin who doesn't fit in because he can't sing his heart song (but can tap a tune with his feet like nobody) has a fit of the cutes and almost comes to a halt until the appearance of some funky boogie-ing birds and a sojourn away from the land of ice.It's minor, but it has some lovely animation, high production values, and a few memorable characters (Memphis, the dad penguin, Mumble, the tap dancer, and Lovelace, the guru). And I really laughed at the appearance of Mumble, who bore more than a passing resemblance to LOTR's Frodo (and of course, Mumble is voiced by Frodo himself, Elijah Wood).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Joyous,"HAPPY FEET is a joyous, largely musical cartoon involving the search for a dwindling fish supply by a brave young emperor penguin. The gag is that this penguin was born with a bad singing voice in a society defined by its singing agility. But man, can he dance! The irony for the adults in the audience is that when this kid tries to sing, he sounds exactly like a real penguin. But to penguin ears, he brays like a donkey. The movie is filled with great pop tunes of the last 50 years. The animation and artistry are first rate, and it looks a lot like ICE AGE. The movie does bog down in the second half as this Fred Astaire of penguins goes in search of the ""aliens"" who have disrupted his land. We lose the music and the film's rhythm during this extended sequence. But it comes around again at the very end for a big, toe-tapping finale.

Boy can that penguin tap!,"Ever since I was a little girl I had an obsession with penguins. I couldn't help it, I thought they were so fascinating and cute. And you know what, I still do. Happy Feet was a film I really wanted to see, and after finally seeing it, I really liked it. It is a shame though that the plot is as thin as a block of ice and the ending is too abrupt and preachy. Other than that, contrary to some of the negative comments, it is a good film. The animation is dazzling; the backgrounds are colourful and the character movements are excellent. The music by John Powell was memorable and fun. Sometimes it brought a sense of fun, sometimes it even enhanced the drama. The characters are endearing. Mumble when he was a child was adorable, and Gloria is a beautiful penguin with a lovely voice. The dancing is a wonder, boy can Mumble tap. I didn't care that Mumble was different from the others, he had a talent of his own and made good use of it. The voice acting is impressive. I don't care for Elijah Wood but he does a good job as Mumble, and Robin Williams is especially funny as Ramon and Lovelace. Brittany Murphy is sweet as Gloria, but I was shocked that Nicole Kidman voiced Norma Jean. All in all, good film, nice premise, lovely animation and music. Shame it crashes down in the final twenty minutes. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappoints immensely,"While the animation in this movie is, at times, outstanding, the whole shebang simply falls incredibly flat due to the lack of any sensible storyline and genuine emotional involvement. It is animation by numbers and has no heart.Miller, no doubt lulled by the success of Babe and similar tales, seems to equate animals per se with cuteness regardless of how moronic and unlovable they may be. Sadly, however, simply whacking a couple of big human-like eyes in the middle of a penguin's head does not make it cute. From the moment the film starts, I was cringing internally.The film is schizophrenic too, almost like two badly-conceived movies shredded and stitched back together again. The result is a hideous Frankenstein of a movie; part musical, part drama, part low-level stand-up comedy (anyone in this day and age who thinks funny-talking Mexicans/Latinos are still humorous - even if done by the redoubtable Robin Williams - should think again). Unfortunately Happy Feet fails to hit any of its genre targets.From the opening scene where we are told (not shown or explained to) that these penguins wander about singing until another penguin recognises their 'heart song' and then they fall in love, until the oddly-forced 'adventure' at the end. Dancing, which is what the hero Mumble does instead of sing, is anathema to penguins apparently even though they ALL dance when they sing anyway. Obviously it is only tap-dancing which is 'banned'. Happy Feet is a dismal drudge to watch - aside from the occasional wonderful animation sequence or two. When I asked my eight-year-old daughter what she thought when we came out of the theatre she said, simply: ""It was a bit long"". Miller would have done well to test it on kids first instead of the literati who, one feels, still somehow apparently feel obligated to think that this tired old Robin Williams patter (think Aladin etc etc) is actually funny. It's not.In short, the penguins are not cute. They are unlovable. The scenery is bland and an animation cheat. The story-line is so forced it almost bursts in places and the music is corny and, on the whole, inappropriate too. To make matters worse, what looks, at the end, like it is going to be mind-blowingly brilliant twist, the animation of humans, turns out to be live-action footage instead. What a let-down.'Long-winded, tired and self-indulgent'. That actuate describes the movie and, sadly, it might also apply to Miller too these days. There is none of the freshness of Babe in this re-hashed mess that owes more to Hollywood vanity than it does to any real desire on the film-maker's part to genuinely touch the viewer's emotions.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The ideal family film of 2006.,"If ""Ice Age"" and ""The March of the Penguins"" conceived a child, it would be probably be something along the lines of ""Happy Feet"", the latest addition to the abyss of personified animal cartoons. Although Happy Feet doesn't bring anything new to the world of animated cinema, it does happen to carry the warmest of hearts as we're stuck in the middle of a season that's full of movies that are as cold and languid as the arctic itself.The film opens with a panorama of the South Pole, loaded with exotically vibrant shades of blue that are fueled by some of the most beautiful animation you've ever seen. And if that isn't enough to indulge your eyes, then those cute dancing penguins are sure to unlock a smile upon your face.Don't let the fact that Happy Feet contains a slew of singing penguins make you think that it's a pure-bred musical. The harmony of music just plays as a sort of crux of the film, as the penguins utilize singing as a sort of strict social code. To penguin society, each penguin is destined to have a ""love song"", or a song that will help them find their true love and happiness. This harmonic tactic works radically for the penguins, yet, is obsolete to the film's protagonist, Mumble (the ever so youthful voice of Elijah Wood). As an egg, Mumble was accidentally dropped by his father, Memphis, and as a result, was born incapable of singing and instead developed feet with a magnetic energy towards rhythm, pouncing to any beat imaginable. Mumble's disability acts crucially towards his social status among the community, making him an outcast amongst his peers. In a way, Mumble is proud of his difference and takes accepts it as his own, personally joyful and unique talent. Yet, when it comes to winning the heart of his life-long love Gloria (Brittney Murphy) and her harmonic crescendo of a voice, his vibrant feet just won't do, leading him to embark on an adventurous journey of self discovery.The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accicents and sessions of improvisation. The animation is nothing shorter than awe-inspiring, bringing not only a lush collection of colors but also a rather large sense of realism.Happy Feet carries the essential, heart-warming elements a good family film should carry. There's the underdog hero and his struggle to win his true love, the tale of morality, the comedic spine, and those impeccably cute penguins that will have you smiling long after the film has reached its conclusion. Although it does have its flaws, particularly its rather extensive running time that is built by its collection of subplots, Happy Feet is an overall congenial film for the holiday season.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the BEST Films Ever!,"Plot: Every penguin is born to sing to attract a soul mate, except Mumble, due to Memphis, his father, dropping Mumbles when he was still in his egg.

A really odd movie...that could've done better,"When I saw ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" on November 19, 2005, I remember seeing the trailer to ""Happy Feet,"" one of the many trailers where people had been showing emotions. They gave that ""aww"" emotion where even one girl almost broke out in tears before the crowd got wild at the feature presentation (Goblet of Fire).Somehow the trailer is better than the actual feature...""Happy Feet"" tells the story about a penguin name Mumble who doesn't stand out like other penguins in their waddles while all he does is give out little tap dances where everybody sees him as very different. It's just like watching the Rudolph Christmas special where once the reindeer shines his red nose, he's considered a freak of nature. Mumble still does the things like penguins, he even chases fish until realizing that they aren't enough for the other penguins to eat. The first part of the story works like an average story about a penguin searching for answers until the second half falls to pieces where our hero discovers that maybe ""aliens"" are taking the fish with no other way but to check it out and seeing that he's at a zoo where humans can't understand what he's saying.Elijah Wood provides the voice of Mumble where he's a charmer even though this film is not. The rest of the cast includes an all-star cast from Brittany Murphy as his love interest, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman as his parents; Robin Williams provides too many voices from Spanish ethnic penguins to a fat preachy penguin where sometimes it's either really hard to tell what he's on or why he's trying hard to bring the Genie from Aladdin out of his shell.This film won the Academy Award for best animated feature where either Cars or Monster House deserved the award.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie for both adults and kids.,"Just as some films can take a wrong turn early on and lose an audience, with only a miracle able to prompt a recovery, so some can grab you from the start and never let go. After about three minutes on screen, I was hopelessly in love with Happy Feet and it would have taken a disastrous collapse to change that. Thankfully, that collapse never comes and the film only gets better the longer it goes on. Without even accounting for the fact that it's been a pretty weak year for animated fare, Happy Feet is a balls-out masterpiece, easily and instantly one of the best non-Disney/Pixar American animated films ever made. It's Planet Earth narrated by way of Moulin Rouge instead of David Attenborough.The theory goes that each penguin has its own individual ""heartsong"" which it needs to find a mate. Young Mumble (voiced by Daily when he's tickle and oh so cute, then Wood when he gets a bit older) is born with the worst singing voice in the penguin world, which can make for a pretty tough ride when your parents sound like Marilyn Monroe and Elvis. Compensation for this comes in the form of his love of dancing via his nonstop ""happy feet"". His mother (Kidman) is supportive but his dad (Jackman) is embarrassed by the whole affair (""It just ain't penguin son""). Marked as a disruptive influence by the elders (including Weaving doing a pretty damn good Scottish accent) and even blamed for the dwindling fish stocks, he's ostracised from the community and takes up with a group of Hispanic penguins on a quest to discover why the fish are disappearing.There's nothing about Happy Feet that doesn't work, with every element just another layer of delicious icing on the cake. At its heart it's one of the most glorious celebrations of individuality, diversification and acceptance ever committed to film. But then it gets wrapped in a blanket of breathtaking visuals and a level of artistry that's almost photo-real in its beauty. The voice work is exemplary (Robin Williams does three different characters and doesn't annoy) and it will either have you laughing or on the verge of tears throughout. Then, just when you think it can't fit anything else in, we get a sharp eco-message. And if that's all a little too preachy and worthy for you, then just revel in the sight of tens of thousands of penguins bursting into pop and soul classics every five minutes.

Environmentalist  propaganda,"This movie was advertised as being a cute little animated story. Instead, it was an anti-religion environmentalist propaganda film made to target young audiences. The authority figures were purposely made to sound like fundamentalist Christians who believe in strange supernatural beings are completely inept, out of touch with reality, and are out to spoil everyone's fun. As a result, the young characters reject all advice that the older generations may have and go their own way at all costs. Humans are made out to be thoughtless destroyers of the environment lower in intelligence than birds. Though the behavior of the main character is innocent enough, it is obvious they are attempting to equate it with some of the serious moral problems of society today.

When an Environmental Message Steals the Show,"Happy is a penguin born without an essential gift each of his tribe members has - the voice. Instead he has another gift, the one for dancing. In his quest for winning the love of his life and shortage of fish necessary for his tribe to survive he embarks on a journey.I should have liked Happy Feet but I didn't. And here are the reasons behind it and why it might bug you too.First, penguins as characters are chosen for environmental story reasons. They're clumsy and you basically watch them on the belly all the time. They also have small eyes and poor face expression. That's why actors and animations had to go far for performance and over-expressions. Sometimes so far it feels like constant hype without payoff.If penguins are famous for their singing, I wasn't aware of it. I suspect most people as well. How they are familiar with a billboard top 100 hits although it's clearly stated they never saw humans also beats me. Of course you could say it's just a ""cartoon"", but after Pixar's masterpieces we are accustomed to have this in line as well.Bottom line: why the heck penguins? For environmental reasons.Second, the story is subordinated to environmental causes. It's the screenwriter's allegiance to the story broken down here.Instead of cause and effect leading Happy he seems like the hero on an activist mission. It could be cute as a short film but for a feature is just not enough.Fingerprints of a skilled director are here. Miller masterfully directs action scenes and mise en scene. He's brave in a way in which he intermingled life action with animation. Even in 2021 from the technical part this animated film looks good.But all this doesn't help the fact everything revolves around...You probably guessed it - environmental message.Happy Feet won an Oscar and I couldn't help looking at runners up for best animation film that year.The same year another animated film hit the box office, but much more hearts of most kids and a couple of parents. It continues to do that today.It's just an old school story about a cocky race car that finds himself in a small town, heading into an adventure of discovering what is truly valuable.Ironically, the main characters of Cars are race car machines swallowing tons of gasoline. It's not much of an environmental message.And yet, in terms of story, in its simplicity, it goes deep to the core. And beyond the world of Cars. That message will make one want to do more for others, including the environment, not an idea that replaces good storytelling.If you don't believe me, look at all Lightning Mcqueen's backpacks on kids' backs. Not many penguins out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Perfection,"Compelling story and characters, superb animation, toe-tapping soundtrack. Good clean fun. The only flaw I can call out would be Nicole Kidman doing an imitation of Jennifer Tilly as Mumble's mom Norma Jean. I also wanted Mumble to lose more feathers as his character matured. I understand that his character was unique and needed to look different from the other penguins. And I appreciate that he lost most of his newborn feathers by the end of the movie. But I think he matured beyond his peers and the remaining feathers didn't seem in keeping with that. Otherwise, an animated delight that should stand as a classic. At least it will in my book. Impressive work from Animal Logic on all counts -- especially the elephant seals and interaction with non-animated human characters. It's not hard to imagine that the March of the Penguins documentary inspired the screenplay, or certainly assisted in supporting the script with regard to the winter migration of the empire penguins. Both tied to Warner Bros. so not that unlikely.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

One cannot help but think of Busby Berkeley, Riverdance, or Chorus Line, in the precision and joyful abandon that are rendered by all the penguins, young and old. For anyone not liking this technically brilliant, funny, and beautiful movie, there must be a mental disconnect. If you're expecting a childish cartoon with no depth, or don't understand/like advanced animation technology, then stay home and watch simpler fare on Saturday morning television.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Stunning Choreography, Robin Williams, Dynamite Songs and Haunting Moments equal Happy Feet","The film looks cute at first glance, but once you see what these penguins can do, you'll be blown away and say: ""Hey, this isn't just a kid's movie..."" Who knew Brittany Murphy could sing so well? The basic plot: Mumble (Young: E.G Daily, older: Elijah Wood)is raised in a world where penguins find their soulmate through song, like his mother (Nicole Kidman) and father (Hugh Jackman, also in Flushed Away). Well, he can't sing, that's for sure...but he can dance something fierce. This leads to rejection of his peers, like the lovely Gloria (Britanny Murphy), and the elder penguins. He finds friends in a gang of Rockhopper Penguins (One played by Robin Williams). They persuade him to look to the so-called ""Penguin Guru,"" an emperor penguin called Lovelace (Robin Williams). He doesn't get his answer right away and is blamed for the shortage of fish just because of his ""Happy feet."" But is it...or is it something else...This film has very funny yet sad quality to it. Robin Williams handles dual roles very well. Britanny Murphy, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman sing very well and the dance numbers are well choreographed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animated Film Tackles Serious Issues,"Went with my 7 yr old daughter to watch this film last night. Animation quality was cute and adorable, especially the baby penguins. It was actually the appearance of the lead character Mumble as an young adult that was left unexplained, since he never matured in appearance even towards the end. I personally loved the song and dance numbers, which was what this film is expected to deliver and does not fail.For smaller kids, there are very scary scenes with the violent leopard seal, who looks like a swimming T-Rex! The Orca scenes are also scary for kids, but better executed.The point of view of the animals from inside the oceanarium was very touching. Those scenes regarding the fishing industry and pollution of the oceans was admittedly heavy, adult and unexpected in a film like this one. But truth be told, it was quite eye-opening and could serve to be the springboard for discussion with older kids. I did not really get the connection between the penguins' dancing and the decision of the United Nations at the end, but then it goes back to the fact that this IS as children's film to begin with.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining...,"""Happy Feet"" is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we follow Mumble, a penguin who can't sing but has an extraordinary talent for tap dancing.I enjoyed this animation movie because it combined funny moments with vibrant visuals and catchy songs. In addition, its animation was truly impressive, with the icy landscapes and adorable penguin characters brought to life in stunning detail. The musical numbers were energetic and enjoyable, particularly the lively dance scenes. Despite that the movie excels in its visuals and entertainment, its story felt a bit disjointed in some moments while the themes of individuality and environmental conservation are important, sometimes came across as heavy-handed. It also struggled to find the right balance between its charming moments and the more serious themes. Lastly, I have to say that ""Happy Feet"" is a colorful and entertaining movie for younger audiences, but it's not for everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Any Reason Some Penguins Were Latino?,OK think about this there are penguins of all different kinds and its a KIDS movie. why shouldn't there be Latino penguins? it just ands to the fact that there are all types of penguins. i personally liked it i like the thought of penguins talking singing and dancing. its cute. and for some older people who have seen it did ne1 else think that there was a ... moral to the story? just a thought. but hey I'm no critic. i went to see it with my mom and she thinks the whole thing with Latino penguins was cute smart and some word i cant remember but yeah. i think it was a good movie and i want the sound track and the movie but then u have to remember that I'm a penguin fanatic. i just think their SO cute. i like the ethnicity of the penguin and think its smart.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Feet - Strong Messages,"I have just returned from watching Happy Feet and found it an exhilarating and moving experience. There has been a plethora of animated movies recently and few have really appealed to me, but Happy Feet should please even the least interested in ""cute"" animated creatures. A review by the Chicago Tribune suggested that the movie was not really suitable for children younger than 7 or 8 and I would certainly agree for the most part. There is one part where an attack by a Leopard Seal is maybe more than young eyes should witness! There are underlying messages in the movie and most would focus on the obvious one that even when you are different you can succeed. The other message that I particularly focused on was that ""man"" is depleting the food source of these adorable penguins. Having traveled to the Antarctic area I can certainly testify that huge factory ships are scooping up the squid that penguins rely on. I only hope that this message is received by those that might make a difference. The choreography is wonderful and my feet never stopped tapping the whole time. With the arrival of Mumbles ""Latino"" friends the films laughter factor raised by an enormous degree. One could almost describe Happy Feet as a ""Musical"" and certainly the songs flow fairly frequently, but they are well chosen and only add to the magic. I would recommend this movie to all ages but suggest that my comment in paragraph two be heeded by parents of young children. On a side note, I noticed that the scenes depicting the Whaling station are based on the disused whaling station of Grytviken on the island of South Georgia. The images of the church and disused buildings are clearly taken from that location.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I loved the premise and the first half of the movie, however I really expected the second half to just be about how the penguins learn to love Mumble despite the fact he can't sing. Instead, it really felt like two different movies.The actual direction it took felt completely contrived and went way over the heads of most of the kids in our showing.

Extremely good - and not too preachy at all.,"I've read a number of negative comments out there about HF being too preachy. For those yet to see the film - don't let this put you off. HF is fast, funny, clever, witty (musically) and visually stunning.Yes - there are a few messages about over-fishing, and how this is a bad thing - and that (,this just in...,) it's humans who are the perpetrators ! Im not sure that this is a theme you could possibly over-fish myself - and it was as palatably presented here as anywhere else I've seen. My 8 and 10 year old girls were not patronised, and as adults, my wife and I did not feel we were back in church.Anyway back to the real themes of the movie. The power of both music and dance to cross cultural and language divides - and the importance of being different. When so much of world culture is being watered down to a brown mush - and the pressure to conform is so strong in some countries that children commit suicide rather than suffer being different - HF raises some excellent points. The main character's 'difference' is what saves the entire colony. HF says diversity is important - and having the courage to be different in the face of massive peer pressure is the real message of this movie.A few points about the music. From the opening strains (taken from Abbey road) - to the last, HF has a thumping good score with plenty of cleverness. The scenes of penguins musically trying to find a partner with an empathetic theme are extremely well done. A lot of melodies were placed in counterpoint (inter-twined with another), with sometimes four or five ideas going on at the same time. Ill be getting the DVD for this alone I think. This scene happens twice - but the second time we have the melody being counterpoint to the tap dance rhythm from Mumble. Superb.The last idea I took from HF was the power of both dance and music to communicate across the divides. Rather than the inexplicably negative conclusion that some have come to in reviews here - I took great optimism from the fact that humans were in the end able to relate to the penguins, and decide to stop their bad old ways.A fine movie - one that both adults and children will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Could have been amazing, ends up being ""just good.","Happy Feet is a weird movie. No one can accuse director George Miller and his co-writers of playing it safe, but there are some genres - such as family-friendly animation - where adherence to conventions can be viewed as a positive trait. 75 minutes into the 105-minute movie, I thought I was watching the first great animated film since The Incredibles. The final half-hour disabused me of that notion. Taken in total, Happy Feet contains enough solid entertainment to be worth the price of admission, but the production's last act self-inflicted wounds do irreparable damage to what is an otherwise fine motion picture.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not a just-for-kids,"Just in points my views on this film: 1) It is not a true children film. I was fooled by the cover and the fact of ""dancing and singing animated penguins"" as well. No, this movie is far more. Kids might enjoy the cute animation and all sorts of flashy-stuff, but be prepared, that not necessarily.2) If you see propaganda and conspiracy everywhere, this movie will set you off. If you can take things more lightly, do watch.3) I loved this film. I take points down to 7, because so many - me too - are fooled by the covers and presentation of the film, that we wait to see something Ice Age or Madagascar - like, but no. This film is much more, something different.4) If you like to see movies with a moral message, something that is more than just screaming and shouting, than this movie is a must.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
My opinion,"Happy Feet, was all in all a good movie, especially for kids of all ages. There's a lot of singing and dancing involved in this movie, at certain points you want to sing along, and you can't help it. It's not your average kid movie either. It's a little educational though you learn many things about penguins that you may not have known before. It's worth watching, but maybe not going to the theater to see.

Good enough to watch once,"(2006) Happy Feet
COMPUTER ANIMATION/ FAMILY/ SOCIAL COMMENTARYCo-written and directed by George Miller, which if viewers can go through the first 50 minutes of singing, one can actually be surprised that the idea can be similar to the more superior ""Ratatooie"", since it involves communicating with humans without 'speaking' to them. Young penguin Mumble (Elijah Wood) born not like the other penguins, since they all have the ability to sing as opposed to him who have can tap dance is being nicknamed 'Happy Feet', eventually goes on an adventure after discovering theirs a lack of fish in the ocean. Voices also include Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving. Winner of an Oscar for Best Animation Film. As aforementioned, the first 50 minutes or so is overwhelmed with a heck of a lot of singing from familiar tunes from such artists as Prince to Steve Miller to The Beach Boys to name a few. And the central character Mumble whose slightly a deformed penguin who cannot sing nor speak with humans actually put his tap dancing to good use is not really explored very well but is still not to a cringing effect to not like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fantastic animation, but the story is a mess","Talk about misleading advertising. If you've seen the trailer you'd think, like I did, that you were going to watch a cute light-hearted animated musical about dancing penguins, with the familiar-but-winning story of an outsider finding acceptance at its core.Well, there's music - although not anywhere as much as the trailers would let you believe. There are definitely penguins, cute and superbly animated, with amazing intricacy of detail and every single feather fluttering delicately in the breeze. However, a few minutes into the movie something about the penguins' appearance started to bug me and soon I realised what it was: it was their eyes. There's a good reason why you so often see absurdly exaggerated eyes in animation. I thought that, in attempting to keep the penguins as close to the realistic creatures as possible, the animators robbed their ""faces"" of much expressiveness and emotion - their eyes often look nothing more than dead dull pellets.The characters themselves are a mixed bag. The main hero, Mumble (voiced unmemorably by Elijah Wood), is fluffy and adorable but kinda short on personality. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are equally unmemorable as Mumble's parents. Brittany Murphy fares much better as the sassy and bright Gloria, Mumble's love interest and a singer extraordinaire; her character also has one of the best musical interludes in the film. The Latino-sounding group of little penguins who befriend Mumble are a hilarious bunch, with Robin Williams' Ramon a highlight. Williams also provides a voice for Lovelace, an eccentric prophet-like figure who is not anywhere as entertaining as he should be. My favourite moments probably involved the random ""baddies"" - a group of bad-tempered vultures and a scary leopard seal who is not anywhere as nimble on the ice as he is in the water.The story... well the story is a problem. I got the feeling that the film never manages to make up its mind on what exactly it is about. It starts off as a quiet, personal story of a misfit struggling against the prejudice and conformity but then it abruptly switches gears and whacks you over the head with a heavy-handed environmental ""message"" and an ending that's way too cutesy and unrealistic even for an animated children's movie. Plus there're plot holes galore - how exactly did Mumble get back home?? Overall, I thought that the movie was beautifully done, often amusing and diverting, but ultimately not the one to remember.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, thought provoking, dark, but not as dark as Grimm","First of all, the soundtrack is wonderful. Animated musicals can be fun, but sometimes the soundtrack is so-so without the animation.

Adults may feel it's too filled with agenda, but kids are going to enjoy the film regardless. My take? If you can't handle films with an obvious agenda, this might not be for you, but your kids are probably still going to like it so send them with friends. I know I'm going to be taking my brothers sometime this month because this film is exactly the type my step-dad doesn't like.

There are better animated movies out there,"Since 90% of the recent animated films I've seen in the past six years or so have been overall good, if not great, I thought that Happy Feet could not be a let down. Overall I found the movie a struggle to watch and all the contemporary pop music which you find penguins singing and mimicking so uninteresting that I'd rather be watching Youtube videos than this film.Happy Feet puts up little competition against the Disney/Pixar behemoth. I found the story uninteresting and somewhat crude to be presenting to children. The multiple sex-based themes in the film I found offensive and not appropriate to be showing. The scene alone with Robin Williams playing the wise penguin and leaving with a dozen female penguins and asking ""who will be first"" was shocking to me.Overall I would quickly recommend other animated films before this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Gorgeous animation, but the movie could have been stronger in more than one way","After finally watching ""Surf's Up"" earlier this week, I decided I would soon watch ""Happy Feet"" after that. Both are computer-animated family movies about penguins, and I heard of both of them long before finally seeing them. This one was the first of the two, and shortly before I watched it, I knew that George Miller, a filmmaker who was behind the ""Mad Max"" trilogy and ""Babe"", was also heavily involved in the making of this CGI effort. This is not one of the most popular films of its type from recent years, but it clearly does have a following, and knowing that, I wasn't expecting it to be great, but probably still pretty good. There are things I can praise the movie for, but to me, it could have turned out slightly better than it did.In Antarctica, all Emperor Penguins must come up with a heartsong in order to get a mate. Norma Jean and Memphis attract each other with their heartsongs and soon have themselves an egg. While the female penguins are out fishing, leaving the males with the eggs for the winter, Memphis accidentally drops his egg during a harsh Antarctic storm! When the time comes for the eggs to hatch, it doesn't look like Memphis and Norma Jean's egg will at first, but it does. The two penguins now have a son named Mumble, but unlike the other penguins, he can't sing, which means it would be difficult for him to find a heartsong! He is a very talented tap dancer, something no penguin has seen before, but others do not find this acceptable, so Mumble is widely looked down on by the other penguins. When he grows up, he still has a horrible singing voice and is still stuck with his down feathers from birth, unlike everybody else. He still has a hard time trying to fit in with his peers. Can his tap dancing talent ever make a difference?The animation in this particular CGI film is absolutely amazing! The penguins look very realistic, and the backgrounds are gorgeous with the snow and blue sky! However, apart from the animation, I don't think there's anything about ""Happy Feet"" which I could describe as amazing. I didn't care much for the musical numbers in general, and the film may not have the most outstanding characters, even if some of them are likable, including the protagonist. Also, the film is supposed to be partially a comedy, and some parts made me laugh a little, but nothing here made me laugh that hard. The story is not a bad one, but some of it certainly could be better. It features at least some mild excitement, and certainly didn't make me want to turn of the film before it was over, but for some reason, I found a lot of it to be maybe just a LITTLE dull. Some parts certainly could have been better written, including the way Mumble's relationship with Gloria begins, and the two of them talking to each other underwater.I know this particular CGI penguin movie came before ""Surf's Up"", but now that I've seen them both, I have to admit that I think the latter is far superior. I noticed that the animation in the 2007 Sony Pictures Animation effort isn't always perfect, but I still thought that it was mostly great, and the film has a lot more than the animation to keep it entertaining. ""Happy Feet"" may have slightly superior animation (I couldn't find ANY flaws in this movie's animation), but ""Surf's Up"" is basically better in every other department. I may have expected the two of them to be about equal in quality before I watched them, but it didn't quite turn out that way. I certainly didn't find this 2006 release bad enough for me to be confused by its popularity, but overall, I would say it's only just above average, even if most of those who have seen it would disagree.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining Despite Its Flaws,"2006 has turned out to be the year for digital animation. From talking cars to suburban turned forest animals it seems like we've almost seen it allor so we thought. The fresh and upbeat penguin-filled musical 'Happy Feet' is the thirteenth digitally animated film to be released this year. And as expected, people are eating it up. Some have gone as far to say it's the year's best. There was better this year, but 'Happy Feet' is okay.In 'Happy Feet' we are given front row seats to the birth and growth of a penguin by the name of Mumble who is voiced by Elijah Wood. He's different from all the other penguins. In a world where finding your ""heartsong"" is crucial, poor Mumble isn't able to keep a tune at all. Interestingly enough though, he can dance up a storm. Unfortunately this is frowned upon and ends up causing him great distress. Eventually the elder penguin Noah, who is voiced by Hugo Weaving, accuses Mumble of bringing on the famine that is currently afflicting the penguins. Mumble attempts to explain that he believes ""aliens"" are the real cause. Noah doesn't take him seriously at all and banishes him, claiming that once he is gone, the famine will end. Mumbles then promises that he will return, and when he does he will bring proof that the alleged ""aliens"" are to blame. He then embarks on his journey where along the way he makes some new friends and learns the world outside his own is much different than he could have ever thought possible.Visually, 'Happy Feet' is amazing. Almost every landscape down to the smallest icicle look so very real. Even the penguins themselves are highly detailed, but obviously aren't real. Aside from that and the direction from Greg Miller, everything presented in 'Happy Feet' is just okay. Nothing in it evokes a wholehearted wow. The plot itself takes what seems forever to be revealed. There's a forty five minute wait before anything about a famine is even mentioned. Watching the film is a lot like riding a roller coaster. No, I don't mean its a thrill ride. The way the story is set up, it goes up and down. Each time it begins to drag, something comes along to get it going again. And when the ending finally comes, it appears forced. The whole addition of an environmental issue still has me wondering. I guess because without it there would be nothing for Mumble to do on his journey of discovery.The main issue I have with 'Happy Feet' though revolves around the music. Yes, I know it's a musical, but the music seemed to really exceed the film itself. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. The reason being is because the film suggests that there actually is a real story behind it all. Either way, it doesn't really matter because it's the singing and dancing that will have people returning to see it all again. So despite having some assuredly bad qualities 'Happy Feet' does indeed have its moments. It does what it was supposed to, and that's entertain.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"7 and a 1/2 out of ten, beautiful, but weirdly sad.","When I first saw the advert of this, I thought it was going to be a happy film, with a few baddies and the plot it had. Unfortunately, I didn't know it was going to be this sad. I felt extremely sorry for Mumble, who was unloved and teased by thousands of penguins just because he couldn't sing! The Adelie penguins are MUCH more sensible about the whole mating thing (not just in this film). They just give their girlfriend a pebble and - voila! They can now mate! Mumble seems a little aspie (asperger's syndrome is a form of autism and autism is a difference in people), which made things interesting, but it also made things sadder and meaner because Mumble was teased.The animated film is about a little penguin chick called Mumble, who loves to dance. His parents hope he'll grow out of it. Unfortunately, he can't, but what makes things worse for him and for his parents, is that he can't sing - and that means he isn't a proper emperor penguin...I like this film for its animation, ROBIN WILLAMS (!! :) ), most of its characters and some of its excitement. Enjoy!P.S If you thought this was going to be a happy film, then I suggest you think a while before watching this. This isn't all the title says.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dance of the Penguins,"Spectacular animation in both macro (multitudes of penguins arrayed on frozen landscapes, zippy underwater action) and micro (the nuances of motion--even down to the flutter of tongues as the birds speak) details make it a must to see this on a large screen. If you have an IMAX theater handy, so much the better. But while the visual splendor is one of the primary attractions here, it's the story, with some unexpected twists and turns, that provides the main interest.Yes, the basic premise is familiar--an ""ugly duckling"" (in this case, a penguin named Mumble who dances far better than he sings--in a community where singing is all-important) who rises above his misfit status. And yes, there are plot developments that are never fully explained, and even a moviegoer who has environmentalist leanings (as I do) may find some of the message mongering a little heavy-handed (as I did--but more on that later). Yet the movie has more on its mind than giving us yet another parade of wisecracking animals, and manages to speak its mind within the context of Mumble's journey. Younger moviegoers (and, perhaps, their parents) who have been conditioned by ""Ice Age,"" ""Over the Hedge,"" et al. may find the going a little slow here, but it's possible that like ""Shrek,"" this is a kids' movie that adults can better appreciate. There's plenty of comedy, but with serious underpinnings.It's interesting that the commentators on this site who seem to be most uncomfortable with the environmental subtext of ""Happy Feet"" are more likely to pan the movie as a whole. As I said, I found the integration of the ecological theme a little clunky and obvious, but at the same time I thought the movie was a perfectly appropriate vehicle for sending this message, so the disparaging comments may be a matter of shooting the messenger. Those who don't want a little environmentalism mixed in with their singing and dancing penguins may not want to see it anywhere else, either.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Maybe I've mellowed with age because I was actually entertained by animated dancing arctic birds who cannot fly.One bird sings heart break hotel and another is a super tap dancer. I know it sounds ridiculous but the creators of Happy Feet make it all work.An environmental message is delivered as a scientific expedition discovers that over fishing is decimating the animal population.

Children's film with last minute dose of political correctness,"All in all, the film was technically well done. The characters were cute. The music was superb. The dialog between characters was good.I was not that impressed by the ""happy feet"" dancing. Animated figures dancing...haven't seen that since Mickey Mouse in ""Steamboat Willey (1928)"" or classic Bugs Bunny cartoons (30's & 40's).What was disappointing was the overall plot of this movie. There were so many ways to go to make this an excellent children's movie based on the interaction of the characters, e.g. ""Babe"", ""Toys"" or ""Ice Age"". Instead dark ""aliens"" were created. While I won't give away the ending, the film's conclusion was wrapped up in a flash forward mode with a heavy dose of political correctness that made it feel bolted on. It was obvious that the makers were searching for a story conclusion when there was none.All in all, the first 2/3 of the movie were good entertainment. I would take any child to it. The last 1/3 needs to be totally reworked into an ending that matches the rest of the movie. I would have reservations about taking a child to the last 1/3 of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

How far has animation come in the fastest possible time. I worry for live human actors. I remember when realistic hair was a great achievement. Fluffy feathers that look totally real, penguins with bona fide personalities. Hugh Jackman's talent knows no bounds. The trick is to look beyond the penguins, and at the scenery beyond. This is Art. I would buy those sunsets to put on my walls. The story is boy meets girl on the road of trails, and with double edged ending. Yes, the 'alternate' ending is rushed, but think about it...would it happen? Maybe. We would be as enthralled by the reality more than the animation.

Really dumbing animation movie. Profit over story.,"Basically this movie is a shameless money grabbing American extravaganza.

A lot of clichés, really pathetic attempt at cheap emotions.Short story, the ""hero"" of the story is a penguin shunned by his peers for failing to sing, however he knows how to step dance, therefore he is immediately accepted by a few smaller penguins with Latino accents. And Robin Williams does the Latino accents. His father is an Elvis penguin while his mother is called Norma-Jean.Oh come on! Just ignore this movie!

Inventive and fun until overwhelmed by the message like a blizzard,"This environmental, non-conformist, message-heavy kids film follows a group of Emperor penguins as they mate (done by singing one's heartsong) and hunt. They are ruled by a grizzled, controlling penguin who enforces a conformist code of conduct. Mumble however, cannot sing, but he can tap like Gregory Hines. This causes shame in his father and ridicule from the others. He gets fed up, leaves the tribe and runs into a happy go lucky group of Hispanic penguins led by Ramon (Robin Williams). He then learns of aliens who have tagged birds, left equipment and taken all the fish. He sets out to find them after being rejected again by his tribe. Yes, he saves the day, makes things better and the whole tribe embraces tap as the saviour of their world.This movie is like Honey-Nut Cheerios. They are tasty, crunchy, sweet and nutritious. However, in the late 80s/early 90s, when oats were the newest cure-all for heart disease, Cheerios went a little overboard declaring the redemption that Cheerios could bring to your heart. It almost overwhelmed the enjoyment of the cereal, the message was so pervasive. Underneath it all though, the cereal was still just as good and delicious as ever. 8/10 in the first three-quarters, 5/10 for the last quarter.http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing CG,"The story about a little penguin who can't sing but can tap dance is pretty good up to the last half hour. And normal. The little penguin Mumble is sooo cute. And the tap dancing is just so cute I don't know why the other penguins don't get it. The ending is a bit weird but..But the graphics! The whole thing is just crazy! The snow, the rocks, the fur, the wet fur, the melting ice, the wind, the snowflakes, the sunlight, the setting-sunlight, the water, the ice, the snow on the ice, and the snow the penguins tap on! Crazy!! Crazy!!!! And I'm saying this from a CG animator's point of view.The final half hour was like a dream (in a good and bad way). They actually have real humans in it! The direction of the story about Mumble going into the human world was weird in a way, but I think they did it just because they could! A lot of parts I seriously lost track of which human shots were real and which were computer animated. If the reason why they lead the story to human world is because they could do great mixing of CG and real live action, well.. they did a wonderful job.Definitely worth watching on the big screen.

fine animated fare for the kids,"Mumble (Elijah Wood) is an emperor penguin who's born a little late and a little odd. He can't sing which he needs to have a Heartsong to find his true love.

The thing is I didn't find all that much funny about this movie. It's definitely more cute than funny. The 'latino' Adélie penguins just doesn't strike me as funny.

"Story is a bit of a jumble, but it's still quite charming","Even though the story is a little jumbled and the message is a little too obvious, the animation quality and incredible voice cast make this a treat for kids and their parents. The story is about Mumble, born into a colony of penguins that woo each other through song, but unable to sing himself. Instead, he knows how to tap dance, which makes him somewhat of an outcast. At the same time, the fish supply is dwindling. After being banished, he goes on an adventure to figure out why the fish are disappearing. If that description makes it seem like the plot is a little confused at times, that's because it is. The movie felt like a mash-up of two movies instead of one. The first half is about Mumble's attempts to fit in, while the second half goes into an almost preachy mode about humanity's impact on the environment. Still, the penguins are so charming that the kids probably won't mind and their are a wealth of singing and dancing sequences that are sure to put a smile on your face. Overall, while the story isn't the tightest and the environmental message might be a little heavy-handed, everything else about the movie screams quality entertainment, for kids and parents alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wished it had stuck with ONE agenda,"IN my summary,when I say ""agenda"",I'm not just speaking in political terms(though that does apply),I'm talking about agenda in the very ""theatrical"" sense: in other words,agenda as in what the plot wants to do,where it wants to go,how it wants to go about it and at what speed it will get there. In those regards,this movie,while quite charming and technologically eye-popping,seems to have too much ambition that and a half.The ordinary origins of an Emperor Penguin named Mumble(voiced as an adult by Elijah Wood)wouldn't seem to be a harbinger for his uniqueness. It seems that he cannot do what most of his species can of,namely sing ""Heart Songs"" to attract a mate. He can,however,dance,very well in face. It's the polar(no pun intended)opposite of a stat-kept secret that Mumble's talent makes him an oddity and a pariah,and he ends up becoming an outcast,finding solace with a group of smaller penguins(two of whom,including their mystical leader,are voiced by Robin Williams,who appears to be everything lately) on a neighboring ice floe. Away from his own kind,he encounters various dangers as well(starving carnivorous terns,a fearsome leopard seal come to mind),and along the way discovers that a fish problem(i.e.shortage)and the question of aliens/extraterrestrials(which,of course,are actually humans to these species on this corner of the world).With added voice support of Brittany Murphy(probably the best here,as Mumble's would-be love Gloria),Hugh JAckman(as Mumble's father,Memphis),Nicole KIdman(unrecognizable as Mumble's mother Norma Jean),Carlos Alozraqui,Elizabeth DAily(As the baby Mumble),Hugo Weaving and Anthony LaPaglia among others,this movie is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The message--or rather,messages--here are thus:tolerance of differences is good,superstition/blind faith is no substitute for scientific knowledge,bravery to be individuality yields the best rewards,and human usage of the oceans(in this case,over-fishing)threatens to endanger those who need its resources.Co-dir4ected by George Miller and co-written and co-directed by Warren Coleman,this movie has BIG ambitions and I think that's what hurt it. If it was MERELY a story about a penguin struggling to find his identity and purpose,that would be enough. If this film wanted to be PURELY an environmental message film that would be fine(though maybe a little less marketable to greater audiences.Maybe not),too.But to make this film as broadly ""message""-based(yet,always marketable as possible,don't forget!),I feel like HAppy Feet turns itself into a polarizing movie when it really shouldn't be. As for my personal opinion,it's pretty basic:I overall enjoyed it,but had reservations. I know(from reading many previous reviews)that I am not alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty Good...,"I just saw the movie today... all in all, it was pretty good as an animated film. Yes, it did have a little bit of innuendo (my best friend and I both just laughed off Mumble's and Gloria's ""mating dance""), but it seriously lacked truly funny jokes. The funniest part was when Robin Williams' character told Mumble, ""I once heard an animal make that noise.. But when they turned him over, he was dead."" after he heard his singing. But the movie sent a good message-- I was with two teenagers at the time-- my siblings-- and they thought it was great. I thought it was very good, as did my friend. Maybe not worth buying a ticket, but definitely a rent-worthy option thats good with kids and adults, too.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not for young children,"When I got the March of the Penguins DVD last year, before watching the film I was treated to a short, computer-animated sequence showing a fuzzy penguin chick dancing, and having a heck of a good time at it. I showed it to my family, who all thought it was hilarious, and looked forward to the film that it advertised, Happy Feet, due out in ""Novembrrrr 2006."" As the film's release date came, I saw more trailers, and heard about a review on Good Morning, America which said that kids wouldn't get the film's ending. Nonetheless, I decided to go see the movie for myself, just for the sake of the dancing penguins. In this regard, I was disappointed.The penguins sing. They dance. They have lots of fun, and their musical numbers have top-notch production values and superb choreography. At the film's best it was like watching a Stomp act performed by penguins, and that was hilarious.From the very start of the film, though, I realized that most of the song selections were not meant for the young children who'd come to see the film. The penguins are singing to find a mate, and this is not the fluffy saccharine singing of ""The Pebble and the Penguin,"" but rather the sort of provocative fare that you'd find at a teenage dance party. The filmmakers may have intended a comic effect, in that these are penguins trying to entice each other. But their humorous intent is probably lost on small children, many of whom are already trying to become the next Brittany Spears.What's not likely to be lost on small children is that the ""aliens"" are overfishing the Antarctic waters, causing the penguins to starve, and that only their withdrawal can make the food shortage abate. Some viewers will find the environmentalist message preachy, while others might disagree with a scene which portrays the UN as noble and able to act decisively. Personally, I thought the ""alien"" subplot was the most interesting part of the movie, as it really brought out the hero in the main character. And, I was pleased that it ended on an upbeat note.The film was entertaining, but I won't be buying the DVD, and I suggest that parents review it themselves before taking their kids to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Singing and dancing penguins,"This is a good animated movie, just not a great one. So the premise is this, each penguin has a heart song in order to find a spouse and to fit into penguin society. But the penguin named Mumble doesn't have a singing voice but backs it up with tap dancing and his funk. With the penguin society finds to be blasphemy. But Mumble uses his talents to try and help the penguin society while falling in love. The dialogue and direction is also very corny even for a family movie though but after a while it doesn't seem that bad. The animation is fluid and cool to watch as well, which is the highlight of this movie. What I found funny though was how for a kids movie it has a lot of sexual or slightly provocative lines even when it came to the music sometimes but the audiences just seemed to let it slide because it goes in a very cute direction. To sum it up this is like a animated musical with penguins. Some aspects of the story I found to be laughable how the older generation of penguins look down on younger generations of penguins for getting into a bit of modern style of dancing. Cause it comes off a bit cliché and found it funny they put the same thing for a animated movie with penguins. And how having fun is looked down upon by older the older penguins and thought of as a bad thing for penguin society. This animated movie seems a bit drawn out and a bit dull but when it's finished overall it's a good movie that is worth seeing. And you could tell a lot of effort has been put into this animated movie. It would have been great if the movie amount to the effort put into it.7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

More like tappy feet.,"'Happy Feet (2006)' is a weird movie. I mean, sexualised penguins? That's got to be a new one. It tells the story of a community of penguins who sing in order to find a life partner, as well as to appease the 'great wind' which they believe controls the harshness of winter and the amount of fish in their region. When our protagonist is born, he soon discovers a propensity for tap dancing, much to the dismay of his father. Even worse, he cannot sing like the other penguins, leading his community to treat him as an outsider and, eventually, a sort of heretic. The picture plays with the typical themes of finding your own voice, as it were, and being true to yourself despite what those around you may think. It also features a rather heavy dose of pro-environmentalism, which is a nice element to include here. Sadly, though, the film in general is just rather boring. It isn't all that engaging and it's also rather messy, to boot. It feels unsure of what it wants to be, leading its narrative to feel unfocused (some of its plot points seem totally out of left field). It's also somewhat strange when it comes to tone. There are several inappropriate jokes and Robin Williams somehow manages to star in not one, but two racially stereotypical roles. The thing does have some well-achieved chase sequences and hits a few resonant thematic notes. However, this isn't enough to make it feel worth your time. It just isn't very good. 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poor story development and weak plot,"This film is about a penguin who cannot sing like the other penguins. He instead knows how to dance, and spreads the fun of dancing to the other penguins.I had high hopes when I watched this, as I have heard so many positive word of mouth. I was disappointed by this film. The plot is rather non existent. Am I really supposed to believe that the non dancing penguins suddenly know how to dance in choreographed ways in groups when they haven't even seen the entire dance? The plot was to make excuses for them to play songs, so that the studio can release a soundtrack. I felt I was watching an extended music video. The plot was so weak that the film could have been at least an hour shorter. Another problem was the lack of change of scenery. The entire story happened on ice, and watching penguin sing and dance for 2 hours became highly repetitive and boring.As of all recent animations, some moral enlightenment was thrown in to appeal to the adults. In this film, the moral was about ""fishing destroyed the natural habitat for penguins"". However, the message did not appear until the final 10 minutes of the film, meaning it was poorly developed. It felt more like an in your face propaganda that was not connected from the rest of the film.However, there were good things about this film, such as the excellent animation. Making hundreds of penguins dance must have been a painstaking task.I am disappointed by this film. It simply does not measure up to the other recent animations.",,Anonymous,Animation
IMAX failure.,"Saw this movie today at our local IMAX theater. What a mistake. I was rather nauseous most of the time. There is way too much swinging around from the camera's point of view. Much more than is possible in live action films. I've nearly ralphed at other live action IMAX films and it often seems they do that on purpose. This is a real problem in an Imax setting where you are right there in the middle of the action. Also, it wasn't formated very well for the Imax, the corners were cut off, the top and bottom of the screen weren't filled either and it seems characters on the sides were stretched and looked fatter. I'm sure it would have been much better on a normal flat screen. Yes, it's a toe tapper for sure. Big lessons are: 1: don't eat fish, the sea life we take for our own consumption is depriving another part of the food chain. 2: humans are screwing the planet even in really remote locations. 3: there is racism, bigotry and anti foreigner sentiment in the animal world ? What? No it's fiction. But those do carry over in to real life. There were some pretty scary chase scenes too that were rather intense for kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let's preserve penguins' food chain OK?,"Some of these anthropomorphic animal animated cartoons are good some are bad. This movie belongs to the former category. Although we know that these movies are no more handmade like the first Disney ones for instance and that the images are computerized, this doesn't invalidate them as forms of art since computers cannot do anything by themselves i. e. without human intervention. And this movie has got admirable and beautiful antarctic landscape images some of them breathtaking. The feelings and emotions of these humanized penguins are extremely well shown by the expressions on their faces. And the most remarkable feature of this movie in my opinion is made by the beautiful music and singing and the choreography of the tap dancing. The story is not particularly out of the ordinary in terms of plot, intrinsically pointing to the ecologic need of preserving the natural food chain so often broken by Man. This is a movie that can be equally enjoyed by adults and children.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One to watch & to remember & to follow up upon ...,"Before I saw a couple of clips of this movie.

Still, I took the risk and it actually was a chance; a chance to enjoy beautiful scenery and an excellent script that is funny & lovely and very serious at the same time ... and ... overall positive.

There is something very wrong with me.,"There is obviously something very wrong with me. I did not appreciate or like the animation process for ""Happy Feet"". It seems to me that the animators took one of the more adorable creatures in real life and made them bland. The adult emperor penguins have a kind of creepy quality about them as they talk and dance.Don't get me started on the music which was abysmal in every possible way.As a progressive, I am not against the idea of a movie having something to say, but I believe the first rule of movie-making with a message would be make it entertaining. Nobody likes to get hit over the head with a movie's message. If they were trying to simplify it for kids, I think it goes without saying that the message of this movie would be lost on anyone but the most observant children under the age of 10.This is the most dismal movie I have seen in quite some time, but as the movie ended (I even hated the way the did the end credits), my mouth agape at what I just saw, the vast majority of the audience was cheering, so, as stated before, there must be something wrong with me.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

An outcast is isolated from his group and seeks an answer to his problems by taking the journey to Jove his resilience and worthiness.

UN-Happy Feet Falling Fast Asleep,"With all of the media hype and heavy marketing of this movie, it is not a surprise that Happy Feet is a severe let down to audience members of all ages. While marketed as a sweet, fun, family oriented, toe tapping movie, the previews actually make the selected scenes look better than they are in the real movie. There is very little plot line and what ideas are conveyed are definitely not geared for younger children. There are several instances of adult-themed dialog and the fun dancing scenes you came to expect from the previews never extend beyond what you saw in the previews. I would not recommend this movie, but if you do still decide to go, be sure to engage the babysitter for the younger children. They will find the 2 hours you'll be spending in the theatre the longest in their little lives and you won't be finding the movie any shorter without them either.

Brilliant animation and great characters make Happy Feet a sure-fire hit.,"Happy Feet has taken the box office by storm - and it's easy to see why. The animation is absolutely top-hole (and the budget isn't astronomical either), the characters are all vivid, enjoyable and the kids quickly identify with them, and the film carries an important environmental message - we are slowly destroying the penguins' world and must recognise them for their true beauty before it is too late. From the very start of the film, you know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins ostracise him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realises that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death. The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. Though the humans seem a bit surreal and strange, the way live action is mixed with animation is pretty well-done, and should be seen to be believed. Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story are brilliant, and we have a Christmas smash hit in Happy Feet. I thought it was absolutely riveting. If it receives a worthy DVD release, this film could well be as successful as things like Ice Age (though maybe not so as Shrek or Finding Nemo). Happy Feet makes for a truly great cinematic experience and you will never see penguins in the same way again. Spiffing! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funky little fella!,"For this animated adventure we go to Antarctica, and we're about to meet interesting characters in the form of comical penguins.Every penguin has a song, apparently. If a penguin doesn't have a song, then he can't mate. Mumble - or Happy Feet - can't sing and therefore has no song, but he sure as hell can (tap) dance! And that's even better than singing, right? This little fella is just adorable, and might come across as an unlikely hero - which brings me to the very appropriate saying ""Never judge a book by its cover.""Mumble constantly finds himself in life-threating situations, but this optimistic - and curious - penguin wasn't going to let anything get him down. And so, after a series of events, he goes on a mission to find out the truth about why the fish in their area seems to be disappearing.

My pastor said stuff was inappropriate...so I sent my brother to see it...,"You asked if I would scout out ""Happy Feet,"" because your pastor had some misgivings about the film. The movie has some innuendo in it (it's about a penguin who can't develop a mating song because he sings badly . . . BUT BOY CAN THIS KID DANCE, so it's about finding a mate)...So, there's that... lyrics in the songs are suggestive...There's also an anti-conformity message in the film. The antagonists in the movie are mean-spirited and moralistic old penguins who are concerned all this joyful dancing will displease the Great Penguin in the sky.So... there's that as well...Anyway if a person is inclined to dislike this this movie I'm sure you can find something offensive in it.

Had the writer/director/producer stuck to the basics of the misfit-integrating-into-society part, and had accentuated this issue going a little deeper into it rather than trying to squeeze in an inappropriate environmentalist message which totally messes up the ending and leaves a sour taste in the spectators mouth, it would have been a great movie rather than just a good one.On the positive side, the cinematography and sound are phenomenal (the Academy should have taken notice here) and the computer animations too. The human acting (voices) where also excellent, especially Robin Williams and Brittany Murphy, who is also responsible for the vocals in a large number of awesome singing numbers. This girl might be a good actress, but I think she should have been a singer!All in all, very good entertainment but also a movie left with a lot of unrealized potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Real content,"The animation is great -- penguins were extremely cute, but at the same time the film is educational and informative. I liked it that the story is somewhat true to species -- the Emperor penguin fathers sitting on the eggs while the mothers go to feed, for example, and different behavior for the smaller Adelie penguins.The movie has a good message about the effect of humans on other species.It makes me want to see March of the Penguins again.

get over it!,"Its a children's movie, with morals behind it. It gets they're attention and teaches a lesson using cause and effect. Look at our society today, with everyone either going to far on holding back or holding nothing back. I've read posts that said there was ""explicit sexual positions""... omg. View it from a child perspective... it was nothing but two penguins playing. We as adults are able to turn it into something more because we are able to understand what it looks like. We need to educate our children about things such as saving wildlife. We teach them manners, respect etc, at very young ages, y not about animal preservation. And that taking to much from our resources can be harmful. Showing it like this is a way to show them in a way that they'll pay attention and understand.It was a good movie. Showed that people are different yet everyone has something special to offer. I went with my 3 yr old niece, and she loved it. Asked questions and it was explained to her that he was different etc. I wish people would get over the stupid little things and be happy that others are trying to make our children see things around them that will help them grow up to be better people, in a way they'll understand instead of life is full of butterflies and fairies. It was cute, and had a lesson. Good enough for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Made me Happy and Think at the same time!,"The day following Thanksgiving was movie Friday for us. Incidentally we went to watch The Fountain, which hit us hard! Not that it was depressing beyond simple understanding, but it just was not right for my holiday mood. So we went ahead to make ourselves HAPPY and watched HAPPY FEET! Must say, we truly enjoyed ourselves and learnt a couple of happy lessons from the cute penguin in the movie. Be brave and be smart. Be relentless and follow your love. A fully entertaining movie, with fun and wit conveyed a simple message of being eco-cycle friendly! A good idea was to quickly show how an animal can loose his/her mind if put in a cage straight from wilderness....something which I believe is always kept in mind in most zoos and man-made parks! And not to waste time in showing how Mumble could actually communicate to the humans.Good job...an icy cozy movie full of all emotions...love, hate, bitterness, parental worries,competition, self-realization, conquer!!",,Anonymous,Animation
Good enough but hardly the best the genre has currently to offer.,"This is a good looking and also rather cute movie. However the story is lacking and I just can't help seeing this movie as a missed opportunity.Like often is the case with animated movies, there is a morale to find in the movie as well. They did not only tried to put one moralistic message into the movie but more than a couple of them. The story suffers from this, especially toward the ending of the movie. It also has as a result that not all of the messages work out well enough in the movie, because the one is more obvious and prominently featured than the other. Perhaps the movie should had stayed put more to its main story-line, instead of diverting so much with its side-plots and characters. It would had made the movie overall more consistent and the its morals and messages all the more powerful as well.The movie showed some more potential really with its songs. The movie uses some famous evergreens and combines several songs brilliantly (done by John Powell himself). The dancing routines from the penguins all add to this as well. As a purely musical orientated movie, this would had been a great movie to watch I'll bet. But like I said before, the movie chooses the divert constantly from its main-plot, in order to develop and create some overly present morals and messages.It's a good looking movie, so nothing wrong in the graphic department but it also isn't exactly anything new or spectacular looking. When computer animated movies were still new, they really put some time and effort in those movies, with as a result some visual spectacles. When the big studios realized some serious money was to make from those movies, dozens of movies got created each year, preferable for less money and done in less time, in order to raise the profits even more. ""Happy Feet"" is obviously one of those movies. Nothing wrong with this if the movie actually still entertains and knows to grab you.Overall this movie does entertaining but I also must say that the movie could had been made way more entertaining as well. The movie isn't filled with an awful lot of jokes and more leans on its cute looking- and odd characters. However when the movie makes some hits, it really hits and knows to entertain and make you laugh.Like most animated movies, this movie also has an impressive A-list voice cast, with people such as Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving and of course expert Robin Williams.It's an overall watchable and entertaining enough movie from George Miller but the story just didn't do it for me.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A happy and beautiful tale,"'Happy Feet' won the Oscar for best animated feature back in 2006 over the much more popular 'Cars'. While both were equally good, but I do the feel the strong message and catchy music of 'Happy Feet' gave it slight advantage. 'Happy Feet' is the tale of a dancing penguin 'Mumble' who gets rejected by the society which considers singing as penguin-thing and dancing as something horrid. Mumble's singing is quite pathetic and thus decides to leave the society. Well the story line may follow the typical ""odd-different guy finds his true potential and becomes hero"" path still the number of interesting characters and lively songs keep you hooked. The voice- cast is splendid with likes of Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams, etc. The screenplay later delivers a strong environmental message with the penguins not having any fish to eat due human interference. But I feel the film should have been about 10-15 minutes short as the pace tedious in the first 45 minutes.The animation is simply beautiful, watching thousands of penguins dance together in a wave was really a wow-moment. 'Happy Feet' finally with heart-warming story and beautiful animation is worth a shot!RATING: [3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Honorable...,"The last time Matias and I randomly voted for who we thought would win the Academy Awards, he chose ""Cars"" in the Best Animated Feature category; I chose ""Happy Feet"". The funny thing is that I hadn't even seen it but, coming from Pixar, ""Cars"" was a disappointment. Now I've seen ""Happy Feet"" and it's not great, but it is so much better than ""Cars"".I've got to say, though; there's something about penguins. Either they're really cute or they're beautifully simple, but for some reason the public has developed an affection for penguins. ""Happy Feet"" shows penguins living in their own icy world, speaking their own language ('penguin') and, as not seen in other animated films, actually unaware of the existence of human beings and speaking of them, as 'aliens'.It's probably these and other things that seem truly new (the movie looks gorgeous and the sea and the sky look 'live action') what differences ""Happy Feet"" from the other animated movies. I mean, when have you seen a penguin dancing like Mumble? Mumble is the film's main character who, unlike all of his friends, can't sing. Singing is the only way he could find his true love, but Mumble dances; and this may not give him love, but it will take him far.Yes, like in a classic animated film, our hero meets some friends along the way; he wins them over with his contagious dancing ways. I remember the hero in ""Cars"", who was pursuing a selfish dream and then realized that life was full of loveMumble knows it from the beginning and his crusade is utterly giving and noble; ironically turning everyone against him.The screenplay is a bag of fun, written by people who know about friendship (John Collee, ""Master and Commander"") and by George Miller and his co-directors. Director Miller has produced and written movies like ""Babe"", so it would be fair to say he knows the field. But this script is non-stop one-liners and non-stop jokes; and most of the time they work.The music is another main element that plays more importantly than in your usual animated movie. ""Happy Feet"" could also be a musical with fresh and original songs and very intelligent versions of old and new classics from every type of genre (we get Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Salsa, Mambo), courtesy of the masterful John Powell (the fantastic ""The Road to El Dorado"" and ""Antz"", among others), always backed by some nicely choreographed tap-dancing.However, the highest point of ""Happy Feet"" is its message. I won't say what the message is, but even when it is simple and not completely explored, it has the best intentions and, more importantly, shows that we can say something even in animated films. Honorable work!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
happy feet and appreciating difference,"Happy Feet may not please some fundamentalists. Its underlying message is to question orthodoxy, oppose the hierarchical paternalistic church and deity, and to embrace diversity. The message is delivered deftly and some of our more somnolent brethren may not pick up on the ""subversive"" message. Mumble is just not ""penguin"", and is shunned as a sinner, despite being born ""that way"". He tries to change but he can't. His mother wants to accept him the way he his, but his father sides with authority to shun his son. Sound like anything? What's another word for ""happy""?The film is visually stunning in IMAX and I highly recommend seeing it in that format. Robin Williams shines in all his roles. A great film for the whole,""accepting"" family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I just, didn't like it.","I went to see this movie in 2006 during Christmas break. Now, the animation was great, but the plot line is awful. A penguin dancing? Then his love won't love him because he can't sing? To me that was disturbing. The film was also to violent and had to much other adult stuff for it to be acceptable for the age target. Surf's Up was much better, in my opinion. This movie wasn't meant to be funny, but I laughed so much, because this movie is so ridiculous and stupid. Surf's Up was meant to be funny (and it is). This on the other hand, was an unacceptable excuse for an animated children's movie. To me, Elijah Wood, Robin Williams and Steve Irwin couldn't save the show. To me, this movie is best just left alone.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent movie!,"Fantastic movie with lots of synchronized dancing and blood-pumping music. It is heartwarming with lots of cute characters, a positive message and funny characters. I love that it's unique and addresses the fact that humans and animals can communicate successfully without words. The energy of the actors is inspiring. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The writers managed to use a theme, specifically the persevering outcast, in a unique and fresh way. The movie is a perfect outlet for Robin Williams, as his portrayal of Ramon is unprecedented. I was further impressed by the actors' singing and interaction; it was as if they were in the room together performing. The tap sequences were so well synched it seemed as if the editors spent hours in the editing booth perfecting the scenes. It is a joy to watch, adults and children alike.

"At last, a new animated classic","Like most people, I went to see Happy Feet for the cuteness factor. Not only were my demands met in that regard, but I was surprised to find a high quality film, that I think will become an animated classic alongside the likes of The Lion King, Bambi, and Snow White. The Bambi comparison is the most important one here. The film, as it turns out, has a strong environmental message, which makes it much more than a cute cuddle-fest. Like Bambi, it raises awareness about the negative impact that humans can have on wildlife. In both films, the main characters must live through some extremely perilous situations, in which humans are mainly to blame. Perhaps Happy feet will inspire a new generation of environmentalists? If the environmental theme doesn't entice you, see it for the gorgeous computer animation (probably the best i've seen in a mainstream film), the wonderful characters, and the awesome music (an original song by prince!)Also, Happy Feet doesn't make you gay, contrary to what some (crazy) people have said.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
By far the worst animated movie i've seen..,"There was hype alright - and way too much of it. I really didn't get the reason as to why this was made in the first place. It was a pure spectacle of bad dialogue and story telling, and the worthless use of A-grade actors. Nicole Kidman sounded like a Paris Hilton wannabe, and the rest of them babble out words to save themselves from boring the audience. The first 40 mins of the film just made me give up, cause there was no longer any reason to watch it.

Great Movie But..........,"We took our son to see this movie and it was wonderful movie. My son was dancing in his seat and waving his hands and signing of course. And the fact that more than one language/culture was in the movie made it more enjoyable and educational. Though the movie was a hit there is one subject or action that worried my husband, other parents who attended the same movie time as we did and myself. There was a scene in the movie where I am not going to say when but all the adults noticed and we looked at each other (it was a small theater) where some sexual positions between certain characters were displayed, not intentionally I hope. But as mentioned in the past and seen with Disney movies such as Lion King and Little Mermaid it is very sad to see that animators would draw that type of actions for a movie that is mostly for an audience of children. My son who is 6 , thank god that he does not know what it is, but its just the point they put it in. I suggest that the editors be more careful especially since children are watching this film. Now if its an adult film who cares but its not. THey should be more careful. Thank you for letting me comment.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A highly underrated film thanks to no appreciation for music or adult undertones.,"I'm horrified to see the score this film gets- where ever I go it's the same people: 'I don't get dancing penguins', 'This is too adult for a kids film', 'This opposes my personal beliefs'. All of these down-voters have forgotten the fundamentals of film reviewing- YOU REVIEW THE CONTENTS OF THE FILM. It doesn't matter that this film opposes religion- the penguins religions were false. It doesn't matter this was branded as a kiddy movie- that's not the production teams fault. It doesn't matter that penguins don't dance in real life- you all like 'Finding Nemo' (As did I) yet I don't recall fish holding conversations.This is a heart warming film (More towards the end) with many emotional struggles and interesting character development. The soundtrack is particularly impressive offering the hits from rock, rap and a particular emphasis on soul and disco.The only things that let the film down are the somewhat out of place humans which are basically integrated video clips that have been blended into the 3d environment, and the idea that the UN actually cares about penguins/the government will react to protesters enough to make a change.With only a small number of mistakes and many memorable scenes I can happily give this film a 10/10.Also, Elijah Woods has certainly improved his voice acting since LOTR.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Most Definitely the WORST animated film I have ever seen,"OK, I won't waste any time beating about the bush. I, along with 4 other adults took our gaggle of 5-8 year olds to watch this film. Big screen, great sound, popcorn, all ready for a visual feast.And before I launch into it, I absolutely loved Antz, Bug's Life, Toy Story I and II, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.From the very first minute I was appalled at the total lack of imagination they ""film-makers"" have shown in this complete howler of a movie.1. The Concept was STOLEN from march of the penguins = 0 imagination 2. The Soundtrack was STOLEN. Not a single ounce of imagination went into choosing disco tracks for the penguins to ""sing"", although I still don't know how they managed to sing using the original artist's voices and music on a freaking ICE FLOE!! = 0 ImaginationThe moral message is so cheap and tacky it positively made me choke!Penguins are super-cool and are worth saving through global bans on factory fishing IF THEY CAN TAP DANCE!!!!I don't know if the people who absolutely loved this film are just very easily pleased, but for the love of god, do not waste any of your time, money or dignity being subjected to this complete pile of crap.Oh yes, and exactly why did ""mumbles"" (called that presumably to reflect that he has a screeching voice - Ah the sheer wit of it) stay fluffy throughout the entire film, whilst all of the other penguins were fully fledged?

I loved loved LOVED this movie!,"I have to say that when you have an animated film where one of the voices is Robin Williams, you can't really go wrong. When he's the voice of one of the characters, you can usually tell it's an exceptional animated movie. It was true for ""Aladdin"", ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest"", and ""Robots"", and this movie is no exception.There aren't enough good things to say about this movie. The story line was intriguing, the animation was phenomenal, the music was excellent and fit the story surprisingly well, the vocal acting was tremendous, and the message of the movie was great. This movie is up there with ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"" as one of the best computer animated films ever made.I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies too. In fact, I know from seeing many recent animated films that just because a movie is computer animated and all-star celebrities voice the characters doesn't make it a great movie. It was true for ""Doogal"", which had a slew of A-List talent but wasn't very good otherwise.If there was one thing I'd change about the movie, though, it would be how the characters looked. I didn't like the fact that every penguin except Mumble looked exactly alike. That doesn't mean I'd bring my rating down from a 10 to a 9, because the realness of these penguins in image and movement compensated for this slight grievance.I was a little worried in the beginning, too, when Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman were singing ""Kiss"" by Prince. I thought this movie was going to be an animated ""Moulin Rouge"" with the same plot line. Although all of the music was taken from other sources, the music and the movement of the penguins made me want to get up and dance, or at least take tap dancing lessons somewhere in the near future. The song that fit especially well in this movie is ""Jump, Move"" by the Brand New Heavies, with ""I Wish"" by Stevie Wonder coming in a close second.In short, I would definitely recommend this film to everyone.

I didn't understand why exactly Mumble looks so different from the rest of his nation. The resolution of the plot is a bit too quick and easy. (Maybe those things will be solved in the DVD.)

"An audio-visual treat for adults and children, keeping in mind the film is PG not G rated","We saw the film in a small theater with stadium seating and a projection system that had all the bells and whistles, this of course heightened the scary scenes, enlarging the size of the monsters and raising their noises to truly fearsome levels; following one of these scenes a family with two youngsters in the four to eight year age range, were unable to control the children's crying and left the premises, never to return. However when it becomes available on DVD, the monsters won't be as large, and the scary bits can be skipped, so it would be suitable for younger children. The filmmakers are obviously in love with the musical genre, there are numerous touches that might be considered homages to the MGM musicals of the legendary ""Freed Unit"". However, my highest praise is for the artists who so seamlessly translated the distinctive footwork of Savion Glover from real life to animation, superb!

It had great animation, fun songs, and an adorable story that I'm sure anyone could enjoy.On the Emporer Penguins Island, they are known for singing, not only that, but they are terrific at it, but when Mumble is born, he's a bit different, instead of being a singer, he's more of a dancer. But no one is buying it, in fact he is even sent away from the island, but he meets several penguins who are also outcasts. But there is also a bigger problem, the fish population is winding down when humans keep taking them, the penguins are starving and Mumble will try to use his tap dancing skills to communicate and save the island that has isolated him away from his friends and family.Happy Feet is all in good fun, I think people really should give it another chance. Out of Cars and Monster House, I would pick this for the Oscar, but I guess I might be alone on that one. But like I said, everyone has a different opinion, but I think if you just give this movie a shot, you'll find yourself laughing and having a great time. It's a great family film, I loved the animations, the story, and the songs, they were just terrific.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"I saw the previews and it made me smile every time I saw it. I thought it was going to be very funny and extremely entertaining. Instead, it was just a visually appealing cartoon that bored my grandkids and was a disjointed waste of time and money. They would have preferred to see Cars (I never saw) or Nemo again. The movie took a long time to really get started and then had about 20 minutes that looked promising but never delivered. Perhaps I was expecting too much (I was hoping for a ""Nemo"") but my grandchildren, ages 5 and 6, happiest moments were just before the movie started when they were all excited about the dancing penguins and when the credits rolled up so they could go home. I know it's not working when the boys ask me if this is going to be over soon. In all honestly, I like it much better than they did. And I mainly liked part of it because I was impressed with the CG. Do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. That way you can pause it and it won't seem so painfully long.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie,"This movie was hilarious, witty, and very entertaining. While I was watching it I enjoyed it and laughed so many times and even wanted to tap my feet at the music. I did feel sorry for the penguin because he was different but it was very good. Children and adults will enjoy this movie and the picture was very good, the music is enjoyable, and the storyline is cute. The characters are all great and I have to admit that I do love this movie now. My friend now is obsessed with penguins after this movie and I can't wait for DVD any longer. As soon as it comes out you can bet I'll buy this movie. It'll make you laugh and it will entertain you...just hope you put on your tapping shoes.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie with a message!,"Great movie.Excellent storyline and technical wizardry.I can see why all the religious fundies, conservatives, and clueless soccer moms didn't like this movie.

Critical thinkers, most of them are not.That's fine.It is your children, the ones you try so hard to keep ignorant, that will be paying for our actions in the future.Fact: Overfishing is a problem.Fact: Global warming is a problem.I love it when people that have exactly zero (or less) expertise in a certain subject disagree with facts presented by subject matter experts.

Odd,"While most seem to like the surprising issues confronted in this movie, it mostly seemed to spoil it for me, seeing as all I knew about it beforehand was that there was a bunch of dancing penguins, which isn't just borderline silly. There was absolutely no way I could take it seriously. So when the darker story played out, It was as if someone had set up a knock-knock joke, in which the joke is that my mother had died. Of course, should you be interested in this movie, remember that it's not the silly penguiny dance-fest that the previews make it out to be. It was really expectations that ruined it for me, but if you go not expecting a lighthearted, purely silly anthropomorphism of the penguin species, then the film won't ruin your mood.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great imaginative feature from George Miller,"This is a great animated feature from George Miller, and displays the same energy and imagination as in his 2 BABE movies. I had read some comments about the 'environmentalist angle' and suitability for younger children, and completely disagree with these comments. My 5 year old daughter chose this movie over CHARLOTTE'S WEB, and I'm glad she did (and I'm glad I took her anyways despite the comments.) Wonderful story, first and foremost centered on Mumbles the dancing penguin (never thought I'd write that.) There's a pretty obvious story about following your heart, but it's done really well and doesn't feel by-the-numbers at all. Some have derided the environmentalist subplot, but I really don't agree. This is not about electric cars, global warming, or deforestation, it's about a dancing penguin that lives among singing penguins. It's a local story about what is happening to the penguin herd, and how the protagonist sets off to try to set things right after being unfairly blamed for the problem.The resolution of the story struck me as being very whimsical as in the BABE movies (I mean that in a good way.) With all the hoopla about environmental issues, I think there is a tendency to bring outside baggage into the movie. Pro-environmentalists might see the movie as not providing any 'answers' or not being strong enough, whereas as others might ironically see the movie as being overtly pro-environmental. I guess this is understandable, but I personally loved the story.What is more impressive than just the plot, is how everything is presented in the movie. George Miller and the other writers have taken many of the natural behaviors of the Emperor penguins (their breeding song, migratory behavior, caring for eggs) and dramatized them for the story. Yes, they are of course anthropomorphizing the penguins, but it is done in a particularly creative and inspired way that minimizes the Disney cuteness factor. There's a feeling of the harshness of the elements that is lacking in otherwise pretty good movies like BROTHER BEAR.Some people have commented on the suitability of the movie for younger children. There is nothing overtly sexual at all in the movie. The movie shows penguins singing their 'heartsongs' to try to attract a mate. I can perhaps see how some scenes might be construed as 'sexist', but the scenes worked for me because, well, that's what Emperor penguins do. And ultimately the movie's main message on this is about finding your soul-mate by finding your kindred heartsong. Anything else is really just played for laughs.Finally, the animation is absolutely top notch. Some scenes are very close to photo-realistic. More importantly, the art direction is great throughout. I loved the wide shots showing the entire penguin herd. And of course, great dance numbers. Music plays a large role in this movie, and they do a great job of characterizing the penguins that are otherwise not very physically expressive- the penguins are drawn pretty realistically, so they don't have too much in the way of facial expressions.Speaking of characterization, the voice characterizations are great as well (as was also the case in BABE PIG IN THE CITY). Very effective and entertaining, without getting too overly cute (Robin Williams is borderline but is otherwise very funny.)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I thought it was a pretty bad film,"I watched the movie today with a group of friends... and i thought it was a pretty bad film, which was geared towards adults more than kids. The film's advertising made it seem like it would be a fun movie with dancing & singing penguins, but I couldn't help but feel deceived when I the movie ended.The movie was visually appealing (at some points I wasn't able to distinguish whether it was CGI or real filming... except for the ending where you can clearly tell they pasted in the dancing men in red outfits.) But visually, I thought it was pretty good.The plot made sense in a way, but it did not need to be that long of a movie. And the ending seemed somewhat random and didn't flow to well with the whole movie. Too often it felt like the storyline was dragging and there were a lot underlying themes you wouldn't want your children to grow up on. For example there was a lot of racial humor I would not want my kid's to think was okay. The film uses skewed stereotype(which is sadly becoming more acceptable nowadays) to make a lot of their jokes.Here are just a few stereotypes that the movie uses:That Italians are oppressive and violent and viewed as typical Mobsters. (I don't even know why they put an Italian voice behind the hawks, they could have easily removed that.) That Hispanics/Chicanos are in large groups and act randomly, talk really fast etc.. That blacks (Lovelace) are religious and hypocritical at the same time That they also pick up a lot of women. That Christianity or religion in general is bad/old/supercritical/cause your parents not to love you if you were different.I did like the way the movie wanted you to think outside your own little bubble in life but if you notice the racism/stereotypical humor, sexual oriented (more than a few times) lines and bad flow of storyline thats behind the whole film then I don't recommend it(especially if your a parent with kids watching). My friends and I left the movie theater with a very bad feeling, reflecting over the fact that we wasted $7.50 and 2 hours of our life. Note: 1 of them is a grade school teacher and the another babysits kids, both thought the movie was very bad and they also thought it was too adult for the kids to enjoy. I thought it was a very bad film too and I've worked with hundreds of kids. (Another Note: The kids in the AMC theatre laughed less than the adults and the adults didn't laugh much)The best way I could describe the film is that it's kind of like reading a very very VERY bad version of Animal Farm (FYI I think A. Farm is a great book) to your kids. Just because there are a bunch of cute animals that do things like people, doesn't mean you should show it to them at such a young age. I don't recommend this film at all and quite honestly I don't think this movie should get a score higher than upper 5's.And also, I thought it was amusing that they would have Robin Williams do the Latino and Black impersonations. yea... it's pretty sad that they would do that.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding in every way,"Whether you have children or not, this is a treat. The makers use the latest technology to the full (and the results are stunning) but they never let visuals or a stunning soundtrack overwhelm a proper hero story, possibly the best pure example I've seen since the era of Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones. Most of the excellent characters have believable arcs and overall the pacing, twists and message are just right. I wanted to know what was going to happen next so much that I know I missed a lot that to savour in the unbelievably rich, credible (if tap-dancing penguins can be described as credible!) and detailed animation - and in the truly awe inspiring soundtrack, which was clearly created by a team of music-loving technical geniuses with a great sense of humour. I want to see it again immediately to appreciate all this properly.I intend to buy it as soon as it's on DVD - it's a must-have family film that for me beats every other CG animation bar Shrek and Toy Story into a cocked hat (even Finding Nemo, Ice Age and Monsters Inc, good though they are, are not in this league). Like Shrek and Toy Story it doesn't fall into the tedious trap of working painfully obviously on two levels to keep the adults happy - it is just so fabulous that it engages everyone completely, whatever their age.Oh, and my children (aged 8 and 12) loved it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Horrible movie for any age!,"This movie was horrible from start to finish. The penguins were awkward in character and in their actions. Deadpan songs with no warmth at all between the characters. I took kids from 6 to 15 and they were actually hoping the lion seal would end it all in a bloody slaughter by the end of the movie. It was boring, plot less, and just lacked a central story line that made us care about the Penguins. The commercials for this contain every single drop of cute that they could squeeze out of this bomb. This is the second kids movie in six months that just wasn't worth watching, even for free at home on my own television...much less for the cost of seeing it at the theater. I advise anyone to NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I saw it in a packed theater and all anyone could say as they were walking out was ""HORRIBLE"".",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"what Mad Max/The Road Warrior was to the action/exploitation picture, Happy Feet is to the animated family/comedy/musical: Miller's back!","Wow, was all I had to say after leaving this movie. I mention the director, George Miller, in the opening one line because it's of note, at least in my line of thinking, to notice where the bending-genre-conventions comes from for Happy Feet. We have seen this, to be sure, in the Babe pictures, where a pig went to great lengths to show that he was more than what his environment defined himself as. But there's even the sense of the outsider coming to save the day, against all odds, ala Mad Max in those crazy Australian films. And, like all of those previous works, Happy Feet actually works, very well, and not just for one set. Going into it maybe my expectations weren't too high, despite seeing Miller's name on the credits- his first directing a practically all-animated (computer no less, in a time where it's as common as bugs in a tree stump)- because seeing commercials I thought it would just be another cute kids movie. It also has penguins, which I thought would be sort of appealing, and the possibility that Robin Williams might finally get some good voice time in more than one role. Boy does he ever, but the film has much more for its whole audience, including even some political commentary amid the wild comedy and set pieces.What I ended up getting was some kind of bizarre, unique hybrid of the central concept of Dumbo (the loner cast-aside from his world, has to use his individuality, likely an influence of the Babe pictures), the jukebox mania of something akin to Moulin Rouge, the facts and environment of March of the Penguins (to be sure, as one can't separate one without the other), and even current events. We get the story of Mumble (Babe voice EG Daily, and Elijah Wood), who is born from an Elvis impresario (Hugh Jackman) and a supportive mother (Nicole Kidman), in a world where all the penguins sing, not just for mating but for some kind of right to live and hunt for fish. Mumble, however, can only dance, fantastically (in style via Savion Glover behind the scenes), but it doesn't sit well with Noah (Hugo Weaving), head of the elder penguins. He's first cast out by his fellow penguins for not fitting in, and being a terrible singer. He meets up with outsider penguins (headed by Ramon, voice by Williams, in one of the roles), and tries to appeal back to the group of penguins- knowing that aliens are involved somewhere. But when he's rejected again, even more harshly, his journey to find the aliens goes on, which leads to...Oh, what's the use. To go on about the plot would be fruitless, but you might get the idea from reading this how silly the movie sounds- at first. But I think Miller and his team are going for a smart ridiculous spirit, one that is actually successfully irreverent for all ages, which is one of the toughest things that any filmmaker can try for. Even tougher is to see Robin Williams tackle roles and actually succeed comically. But it's his best, most rip-roaringly hilarious (and I don't use the former term lightly) performance since Aladdin. He goes between a solemn narrator, Ramon the penguin, and Lovelace, the possible link to everything with the 'aliens'. The musical side of things could be a challenge too, as it is in the Moulin Rouge mode of not being at all original-songs, but done in an extreme, over-the-top manner with the visuals. Imagine dozens and dozens of penguins singing ""Somebody to Love"" by Queen, sounds risky, but it actually works, well. In fact, Happy Feet does what Moulin Rouge did better than that film actually went for- it's a pop-culture shake-up for characters who see humans as aliens, most especially due to a lack of food.But then there's even the touch of political commentary, which is most surprising. It would be one thing to have an over the top fantasy comedy with bits of romance thrown in (and there's even some genre-breaking with what ends up between Mumble and Gloria), but it's another to be making a kind of underlying point to it all that while lost on the kids won't be lost to some in the audience. This is even something that goes back to the Road Warrior, only here it's perhaps not as explicit- one could read into the 'leader' penguins who cast out Mumble with his 'outsider' friends who are not at all like the others, or the significance when Mumble finally comes back from his self-imposed mission, as being like the now- and the control over what the fish does to the group. But that's only a side-bar- however interesting- for what's really appealing about Happy Feet. It's unexpectedly, even outrageously in its silly way, funny, and it's based totally on the characters, and building on it how ridiculous- yet within the logic of the picture believable- how singing/dancing penguins can be in this world.Too often, especially in 2006, the slew of computer-animated movies for kids that just don't seem appealing. Granted, I'm not a tot anymore, but just on the level of anything in the subject matter being anything more than 'hey, they're animals, they make stupid jokes, its worth it' is lost on me. Happy Feet stands above all the other animated pictures of this year, including Pixar's work, by delivering truly successfully excitement and absurdity in equal measure, while not doing so to a lower common denominator. I can't wait to recommend this to most of the people I know, and they're not even kids. Miller- welcome to the 21st century!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Deep Breath,The political message in the middle of the movie was to heavy. I don't mind political and socially conscious movies...as long as they advertise themselves as such. This movie does not. All of the ads that are out show dancing and singing but nothing about how the environment needs to be saved. I wan't sure if I was watching a cartoon or a documentary. I wanted cute dancing and singing penguins. I got depressed. It just lead to confusion. There were a few adult moments that I thought would be tough for kids but since I am older some of them went past me without notice.All in all it had a lot of potential it just fell very short.

...Ugh,"No, this probably wasn't the worst film of 2006, but I'm quite sure that it claims the prize for ""worst animated film"" of the year. Of course, I still haven't seen BARNYARD or THE ANT BULLY. Granted, if I can say that FLUSHED AWAY and CARS were the two best cartoon films to hit theaters this year, that's saying something about the diminishing quality of animation these days. But I digress.There's no point in summarizing HAPPY FEET, as I'm sure you already know what's it's about. What you probably don't know, as most of the big time film critics haven't mentioned, is that this film is pretty boring and bland. Make no mistake, director George Miller wants his audience to know that he is more an artist than a filmmaker, and the first 15 minutes of HAPPY FEET will draw you in with some beautiful scenes and intriguing musical sequences. Unfortunately, the quality of pic loses momentum when it becomes evident that no real plot is being established. This film is just an endless string of characters, song-and-dance numbers, chase scenes, etc. While the computer animation is above average, there is much left to be desired in that there is virtually no variation in color, just different degrees of blacks and whites.I'm not really sure who the target audience of this film is, but I can safely say that it is not little children, as there were some intense and frightening scenes involving a leopard seal and two killer whales. It's important to note that the point of said scenes remains unclear, as they were simply temporary conflicts with no real purpose to the ""story"". I'm also unsure what the message of this film was. There were blatant racial overtones as well as those concerning religion, conformity, and environmental conservation. Um, a little too much for a film about a tap-dancing penguin, don't you think? If you're looking for quality film-making, look elsewhere. If you're looking for mindless matinée entertainment, I also advise you to look elsewhere. However, if you're hoping to find an hour and forty minutes of visually and emotionally unstimulated and incoherent scenes involving lots of indistinguishable penguins, HAPPY FEET may be for you.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Working title was probably Depressing Public Service Announcement,"I took my 7 year old to see this film. The seal sequence scared her with its violence and ferocious attack on the penguin. The movie wasn't funny, it wasn't happy, and just the opposite it was pretty depressing. I didn't like the sexual references that all the penguins kept making. I found the representation of the Hispanic penguins to be offensive (they all spoke like a cross between a bad Ricky Ricardo impersonator and working men on a job site with references to women). It was long and boring. My daughter didn't get where the movie was going, she didn't laugh at all throughout the movie and covered her eyes in several parts because it scared her. Then it goes into this long drawn out public service announcement about how the ""aliens"" are evil and gobbling up everything. Then the whole UN story, my daughter didn't understand any of that. She didn't understand the parts where the penguin in the zoo goes crazy either. Totally lost. I think the reason they called it happy feet was to mislead people into thinking it was a happy go lucky kids movie. As I remember, the only trailer I ever saw for it was the 5 penguins singing ""My Way""... Don't waste your money or your time. If you want to teach your kids about conservation then sit down with them and teach them...don't think this movie is going to trigger anything in them! Hollywood needs to go back to making REAL kids movies. If parents won't take their kids to a movie for the sole sake of spending time with their kids then parents are to blame...Hollywood should not be trying to put adult situations into kids movies to get more adults to take their kids to the movies and sell more tickets.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Deep and powerful!... more than just cute fluffy penguins,"I thought I was going to see a very well animated kids movie involving cute and funny characters, and a sympathetic heart warming story, such as Finding Nemo, Shrek, or Toy Story, but Happy Feet is that and much more. In fact, I think that none of the kids in the theater, including my 8 year old brother, liked it as much as I did, a 20 year old college student fond of movies such as The Matrix, Fight Club, and Kill Bill.If you look beyond the great animation, and the cutesy characters and storyline you will find a film with deep and powerful messages regarding the state of humanity. It's about our relationship with nature, art, the human spirit, and that which is beyond us (perhaps all films, or works of art can be, but this one does it well, and I happened to notice that). All in all, a great movie! Definitely one of my favorites, if not my favorite.

It was like a whole bunch of stories written on a piece of paper, stuck in a blender, and taped back together again. The story had no easy flow, and half the time, it was impossible to tell what was going on. Plus, the movie dragged on and on and on!! After an hour, I thought the movie would end soon, but then it kept going! Ugh!! The characters had no chemistry. The characters weren't lovable at all. The Hispanic Penguins were a bit funny, but they didn't help make the movie more enjoyable. The main character just didn't seem very smart. Also, his name was Mumbles. Could they have thought of a stupider name?? Also I thought it was absolutely evil how the other penguins treated him just because he couldn't sing.I don't like how they made humans look evil. We are referred to as ""aliens"". The penguins claim we were stealing their food supply. Nothing in the movie made it look like the penguins were starving or low on food! And at the end, the penguin do a dance. It was their way of saying ""Please stop stealing our food!"" The only thing is, how would we know that was what they were saying?? The humans suddenly realize that they're destroying the penguins habitat because they did a silly tap dance????? What the heck?! I wish I could give this movie negative seven million stars, but I gave it two stars because the animation was pretty good.Kids would not understand the story.

Glenn Beck and Michael Medved are idiots,"More proof conservatives are a joke.....its a dancing penguin movie guys....lighten up Conservatives attack animated penguin movie, Happy Feet, as global-warming propaganda Cultural conservatives, led by CNN's Glenn Beck, Fox News' Neil Cavuto, and syndicated talk-show host Michael Medved, have all criticized Happy Feet, the new Warner Bros. animated movie about Mumble, the tap-dancing penguin, because they say the movie is laced with liberal overtones and tries to ""indoctrinate"" children. Specifically, conservatives claim the movie is pushing a global-warming agenda. Yet the film makes no references to global warming. Instead, the movie's conservationist subplot revolves around Mumble's attempt to combat man-made pollution and overfishing in his quest to help his fellow penguins. The blockbuster movie, which has already earned more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales, is silent regarding the issue of global warming.Nonetheless, Cavuto and Beck, who referred to the film as ""propaganda,"" both complained that the movie amounts to ""an animated version of An Inconvenient Truth,"" a reference to former Vice President Al Gore's critically acclaimed documentary about the threats posed by global warming. Cavuto said that while viewing Happy Feet, he ""half-expected to see an animated version of Al Gore pop up."" Cavuto also stated that he found the movie ""offensive"" and asked whether it pushed ""a far-left message."" Medved, who is also a professional film critic, complained in a November 17 entry on his Townhall.com web log that ""the propagandistic theme suggests that the biggest menace for the lovable penguins is the human race -- stealing the fish on which the birds depend, or ruining planet earth through pollution and global warming."" Medved also claims the movie has a subtle gay theme as well.None of the commentators supplied any examples from the movie to support their allegation that Happy Feet pushes a liberal, global-warming agenda. In fact, no scenes from the movie mention the issue. Happy Feet is void of any global-warming references, there are no obvious allusions to it, and global warming is not one of the movie's themes. Global warming plays no part in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a good movie for kids.,"The movie Happy Feet, is a very political movie, touching on many subject that, in my opinion, do not belong in a ""children's' movie,"" (targeted to children under 12). Issues such as immigration, segregation, and religious influence in politics. Thou it is not a popular opinion with the group of friends I saw the movie with, I feel that children should not be exposed to such themes nor should they be exploited to push political issues. The movie starts out great but fast moves into a film that I feel is really awful.

Too Weird and Way Too Long,"I did not like this movie. My toddler cousin enjoyed the previews that played more than the actual movie we paid for. There were a few laughs, but just way too much going on while, at the same time, nothing really happened. Way too long; kids were crying and asking if it was over when it was only at the halfway mark. It seemed way too politically correct and ""socially acceptable"" for a children's movie; they don't worry about that stuff! I would have loved to have walked out if the tickets weren't so much. The mother (Norma Jean) cleverly bringing back a glimpse of Marilyn Monroe (the voice was obnoxious; I love Nicole Kidman, but do not like hearing Marilyn Monroe speak) was irritating and pointless.Might have been better if they focused more on the baby penguins; they were cute.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best animated films of 2006,"In animation, like in most arts, whenever a new technique is invented and succeeds, it doesn't really take too long until it becomes a widely used standard as everyone begins to explore it. That's exactly what happened to Computer Generated (CG) animation, to the point that now, 15 years after the release of ""Toy Story"" (first animated feature made entirely with CG), this kind of animation is not as exciting or thrilling as before as most of the recent animated movies begin to look the same. Fortunately, ""Happy Feet"", Warner Bros Studios attempt at CG animation plays definitely a whole different tune, as it uses CG imagery not only to animate its characters, but to create a vivid world attempting to use (or to mimic) elements of the art of cinematography. It may not be a huge step forward, but at least it's a step forward.""Happy Feet"" is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood), a young Emperor penguin with an uncanny natural ability for tap dancing, but unable to sing at all. The problem? Emperor penguins live in a society based on singing, where the use of the singing voice allows them to find friends and eventually a wife. As Mumble grows up, his inability to sing and his uncontrollable desire to dance make him almost a pariah, frowned upon by his friends, his father (Hugh Jackman) and the Elders of the community. Exiled, Mumble finds new friends in a different community of penguins (that sees dancing as another way to socialize), but also finds a mission: to discover who is causing the fish to disappear. To find it, he'll have to travel across Antarctica to find the mysterious ""Aliens"" that seem to be behind all.Mainly written by director George Miller and John Collee (although with the collaboration of Warren Coleman and Judy Morris), ""Happy Feet"" is an ambitious film that attempts to be funny and entertaining for the kids while at the same time being deep and intelligent enough for adults to enjoy as well. Not an easy task to accomplish, but for the most part Miller, Collee and their team of writers succeed almost flawlessly on their attempt. ""Happy Feet"" can be seen basically as the classic tale of a young character and his trip to find his place in the world and his purpose in life, as well as the many problems and allies he finds during his odyssey. However, it is also tackles important topics such as tolerance, self confidence, and mainly the disaster we mankind are doing to out environment.While the script is certainly a bit contrived (mainly because its over ambitious goals), the direction of the movie is almost flawless. Almost 30 years after his breakthrough with the now legendary ""Mad Max"", George Miller keeps being an effective and original director (despite the few number of movies he has directed) who doesn't seem afraid to try new and fresh things. Like a hybrid between his ""Babe: Pig in the City"" and ""Mad Max 2"", this movie is an adventure of epic proportions that while aimed to the kids, it's dark and meaningful, yet charming and very accessible at the same time. As I wrote at the beginning, ""Happy Feet""'s most amazing feature is the simply perfect use of CG animation to create gorgeous settings and landscapes. It's use of lighting sources and textures is really breathtaking, and this is probably the closest CG can get to real life cinematography.The use of the voice is one of the main themes of the movie, and the work done by the cast is for the most part excellent. A big surprise are the work of Hugh Jackman (Mumble's dad) and Brittany Murphy (Gloria, Mumble's best friend), who deliver not only great acting performances, but also offer remarkable singing when necessary. Murphy really being outstanding, and probably the best voice of the film right after Robin Williams, who lends his voice to two important and very different characters. Elijah Wood as Mumble and Hugo Weaving as the Elder are OK, but nothing really amazing or unexpected of their talents. The only slight disappointment is probably Nicole Kidman, and not because her performance is bad, but mainly because she doesn't really show the amazing vocals of previous singing efforts (""Moulin Rouge!"" for example).""Happy Feet"" has received a lot of criticisms due to the no-so-subtle way it presents its message, to the point of being called cheap propaganda; however, I find that kind of criticism unnecessary and out of place, as ""Happy Feet"" does offer a good chance to talk and discuss the movies's inherent message with the kids, who probably will find the movie visually attractive. True, ""Happy Feet"" is a bit heavy handed on the handling of its message, but one can't deny that it still is a good attempt of telling an animated epic story with a morale behind. As it stands, ""Happy Feet"" is a really good animated movie that not only will entertain, it will raise interesting questions and discussion with the younger ones, as it treats them intelligently.Since the beginning of time, fables and stories have been used to carry on messages, moral lessons, or parables; ""Happy Feet"" continues this tradition as an excellent movie that is both entertaining and intelligent, and surely will deliver good fun if seen with an open mind. The breathtaking animation and the gorgeous landscapes are really a big plus that makes this movie one of the best animated films of 2006. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Deceptive Advertising, may not be appropriate for children","I am in my twenties, and went and saw this movie with my girlfriend. After watching the film, we both agreed that we would never take a child to see this movie. Some of the imagery was so disturbing, that we are still talking about it. That might seem great to some people, but the movie was marketed as a happy movie for children, I fail to see how if it disturbs two well educated people well into adulthood, it would be appropriate to children.You might hear some people say it's great, and they might think it is. However, there are explicit sexual positions, depressing imagery, and a political message that weighs down the entire message. If you have a desire to see this, and think its OK for kids, then at least rent it first, and make sure you are comfortable with your kids viewing this content.I have perused these comments and I ask that you read BOTH sides of the spectrum before deciding. It was good from an animation standpoint, but the rest of the movie was just a political advertisement. I've read some people say their kids were in tears after this movie, genuinely upset and even depressed. Just because some people love this movie (and apparently militantly so), does not mean it is the greatest of all time. I have severe reservations about this movie being appropriate for the children it was marketed toward.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Men and women of all ages can enjoy this movie.,"This is one of the my favorite movie.Iｎ a country of the Antarctic, there are many imperial penguins who enshrine heart's song. Mumble is a boy who is terrible at singing ,but very good at dancing a tap. He is not able to stop his dancing ,so other penguins who treasure heart's song despise him. After a party of graduation ceremony, even though other penguins enjoy singing, Mumble is depressed because he sing a terrible song there and others boo at him. Then without notice, he arrives at other country. Then, he meets 5 penguins, Amigos. And, he surprised that they praise Mumble's dancing. Mumble and Amigos go back to imperial penguin's country, however the elders who enshrine tradition order Mumble to exile from a country because they think that Mumble's dancing has a bad influence(decreasing of foods) on penguin's country. From then on Mumble start to travel to find a cause of bad influence with Amigos. What's the cause and how mumble will be?First, I want to say about the soundtrack. Music is necessary for this movie. From music we can see various feelings of penguins, and we can enjoy not only from eyes but also from our ears. Moreover, computer graphics are surprisingly real.Before watching, I can not imagine that penguin dances tap, but after watching it, it becomes usual thing that penguins dance. In addition, of course I recommend children to watch this, but it's never childish movie. Men and women of all ages can enjoy this, so I recommend you to see this with your family.It looks like a light, entertaining movie,but at end you will notice it is thought-provoking movie. Happy feet is worthy to win an academy award.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tricked into paying for this movie,"I feel like the trailers for this movie ""tricked"" me and my family into seeing this movie. Per the previews, I thought it was going to be a cute, light-hearted movie. While it started out this way, it turned into nothing but a political statement about how bad we (aliens/humans) are. I go to many movies, and told my family this is the first movie I've been to in which I considered going to management and asking for my money back. I feel I was misled and used. The only reason I didn't rank this movie lower was because, as stated, it did start out as a fairly light-hearted movie. But again, the further we got into the movie, the more I felt this was just a set-up for the real ""point"" of the movie. I didn't go to the movie to get a point pushed down my throat, I went to the movie expecting to see the movie which was portrayed in the trailer. I have begun to see this more and more from Hollywood and have begun to look for other means of entertainment as a result. Until people speak up, the political nature of movies will continue. Again, I go to a movie to be entertained, not preached to.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A delightful,happy-go-lucky Animated feature that is wonderful to watch with a message attached with it.Amongst the best Animated films ever.","Happy Feet is a delightful,happy-go-lucky film that leaves you feeling happy and wanting to tap dance.It's a well conceived animated film with an ecological,environmental message for kids.Yes,it has themes that may not be suitable for kids,but it's also there for the mature audience to enjoy and think about it.It's a thinking person's animated film.As you know,it's about Penguins,and their empire.Mumble,a young penguin who can't sing has developed a very odd skill among his beings,who have a heart for singing.He tap dances,and he's a genius at that.But the Penguin community survive on their singing.As everyone else like him can do it and master it,Mumble feels isolated.He decides to leave and explore the world.He stumbles upon some new penguins who find him really cool.They get along well and all.Then Mumble meets Lovelace ,who has encountered the so called ""Aliens""(that is ,the humans),and Mumble wants to find out who has been stealing their fishes,which has made it hard to survive for the Penguins.He embarks on a journey to face the Aliens and request for fishes.But as he enters the world of humans,it becomes clear that destruction has already gone underway.Humans are taking away all the fishes and destroying the Antartic by polluting the seas and all that.Mumble's world is plagued by these events and he tries to confront them in the end and prove himself worth to his kind.The story takes many turns and sets it different from other animated features.It's unique in its animation and execution.George Miller tries to present a realistic film than the usually cartoonish animated flicks.He sets serious topics in the plot and allows both the young and mature audience think and start a debate about our actions and all.It's a smart move.But on the way,he kind of looses his message and mixes things up,it also becomes a mess.But Miller keeps thing afloat with the cute little penguins and the gleeful environment he creates.Adding musical numbers and dances to keep the kids entertained and love the film,while the grown up enjoy it along with thinking about what the film is trying to say.It sets new grounds,and for that,this film and its creators deserve all the praise and the award it got.But beware,some elements of the film may prompt your kid to question in the wrong way.The sexual references and some frightening scenes involving very cute,loving penguins may disturb the parents.But,I guess it was necessary.The CGI was breathtaking.The visuals and look of the film was flawless.It just keeps you bewildered for its technical genius.It's a pitch perfect animated feature.It ranks amongst the best Animated features ever made,topping Toy Story,Shrek and what not,except Incredibles.For me Incredibles and this film remain the favorite.But,you should watch this film for its different approach and clever execution.It's adorable and also somewhat thought provoking.And it leaves you with a smile.So,I would say it's classic animation.A technical and animated breakthrough,in a groundbreaking sense.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Feet makes Jamie sad,"I'd love to say this film lived up to the hype and apparent ""rave reviews"", but it most certainly failed to meet even the most modest of my expectations.From an adult perspective, the movie lacked the humour that made animated titles such as Finding Nemo and Shrek so enjoyable. Through a child's eyes, which I can also speak on behalf of quite confidentially, it lacked the colour and character diversity that brings a good children's story to life. There just isn't much entertaining about a bluish-gray landscape and a few hundred identical penguins.Visuals aside, the over-use of cheesy pop-songs near turn the film into a b-grade musical, and aren't always entirely appropriate for younger audiences. Disjointed and going no where fast, attempts are then made to fill the questionable direction and conclusion of the film with over-the-top and poorly delivered messages concerning environmental awareness.Happy Feet winds up being unamusingly long and emotionally void despite the efforts of some the most charismatic voice actors alive today. I wanted to believe it was good, I really did, however it falls short of both a children's favourite or enjoyable light entertainment for older generations.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Good Animated Film!,"Happy Feet is a pretty good film. I enjoyed this movie then I thought I would. I was skeptical at first about this film. Happy Feet basically tells the story of dancing/singing penguins during harsh times with little or no fish. The main character of the film is Mumble. We get to see him as a baby and an adult. He is the only penguin that can dance because his father dropped his egg. The acting was good for the most part. Robin Williams as the Latin penguins is absolutely hilarious. The music was good for the most part, but some songs could've been chosen better. Also I think that some of the actors need to take singing lessons. Overall, this is a great children film.

Awful,"The first half was so great! My daughter loved the previews and clapped/danced/smiled throughout the entire first half. It was a very cute flick about a little penguin that didn't quite fit in, but was special in his own way nonetheless...then all of a sudden there was this drastic change from a happy kids movie to a movie where the penguin is trapped in a zoo and goes insane (literally, not figuratively). From that point on there were exactly three lessons that the movie taught: 1) Religion = ignorance + stupidity + intolerance, 2) Everything humans do = evil, and 3) Seaworld and/or zoos = evil. If only they woulda kept the politics out it would have been a great movie. I'm all for environmentalist movies, like An Inconvenient Truth...just don't disguise them as movies for little kids.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

You're better off trying to make honey come out of a rodent's anus.,"Yeah, it seems like this is the third animated film about talking penguins in as many years. Why? They're freakin' penguins, they can't even survive in warm weather. If you're going to make a shitty animated film about antarctic animals with too many celebrity voices, make it about polar bears, that hover around with chainsaws.Nothing about this movie is funny at all, the witty one-liners fail at being witty, and can be seen from a mile away. Everything about this movie sucks, I mean why waste these actors/actresses talents when they can be used to make some uncredited re-make of a Japanese film that was actually good.I feel that animated animal movies NEED to come to an end. Either that, or make them suck a bit less. I really regret spending money on this when I could've been home watching hockey or ranting incoherently about other movies I hate on IMDb's poorly structured message boards.The fact that the commercial says ""Novembuuurrrr"" takes away all the limited credit this movie doesn't have. Seriously, if you're thinking of going to see this, pick up a video game controller or a shot gun and do something useful with your time.Overall Rating: 0/10, but since IMDb does not allow for this, I'd give it a 1/10.

George Miller brings back adrenaline and rapid shots,"In 2005, there was the Oscar-winning documentary feature March of the Penguins, and in 2006, there was the Oscar-worthy animated feature Happy Feet. There have been numerous films of the same genre since New Year's Day but a lot of them were as hailed as expected, but this year, Happy Feet is a film like none other than the same genre. Which, as it shows us a reasonable purpose for the film's PG rating.Animation is an alluration to younger audiences but the framework in Happy Feet is a spontaneous miracle that premature and mature audiences will be able to acknowledge. This is all thanks to none other than our Mr. George Miller, who is known for directing the Mad Max films that clues us in adrenaline. George Miller has been affiliated with several family-friendly films and tries to make it work here, but peril and mischief is included in this movie that should remain cautionary for the smaller viewers. Almost every background frame in this film is like a photo sample on a website for a certain cover for various occasions like on a computer or a slideshow presentation. Even though shots like these are not pervasive, they have sibling shots that do not disappoint either. The main shots in this movie are types that only director George Miller can have the guts to visualize and blissfully pushed his animators to the edge to prove it. Mumble appears in every scene that includes a pursuit and the way each shot shakes is like they match with each characters' performance.I do believe I have said enough about the quality of animation, now I shall talk about the film itself. A penguin empire has an ordinance of having a heartsong just to qualify residency in it. About 85% of the empire carry eggs that are imminently hatched and are to stick to the ingredient of making sure the infants are hatched properly, by holding it at all times. One of the penguin fathers drops his egg and affects the penguin sleeping in his egg, unveiling his son's moxy for tap-dancing and inept singing. The tap-dancing penguin goes by the name of Mumble and the way he executes his number one skill is catchy to all that watch the film, especially younger viewers. Mumble's fellow penguins dig his expertise for a while but later seek distance from it due sidetracking from their desired intents as well as the emperor of the penguin tribe. Alienated, Mumble seeks on an adventure to revitalize his conduct by retrieving the empire's fish from the humans. Embarking midway through his mission he comes to realize that the humans that Mumble witnesses are shown to be very opinionated and develop an interest in Mumble's tap dancing. This is as if an aquarium audience is integrated into a theater audience where they are totally captivated by Mumble's performance.I would also like to mention other cast members such as the quixotic Nicole Kidman who plays Mumble's empathetic mother, Hugh Jackman as her husband who is responsible for the entire feature, Brittany Murphy as a love interest for Mumble, and last but with the highest of enthusiasm, Robin Williams. Outcast Mumble is befriended by a clique of Hispanic penguins who are mostly voiced by Robin Williams who is like your number one pick-up liner and commiseration soul that no other actor can perfectly execute and is both a character and real-world guy who will never leave your shoulder. I will admit, this movie is surrounded by quirkiness and sly innuendos, but that does not mean it is bad, it just shows itself as a strict PG rating.Happy Feet is not a perfect movie, nor would be a movie that I would want to watch for the rest of my life, but it feels like a fair introduction to a younger audience (aside from Babe: Pig in the City) as if they would want to understand a technique that George Miller uses as a director, even though the film itself is not fully suitable for children.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Loving Families: Watch this now!,"Extremely adept animated musical-comedy continuing to ride the adorable penguin wave of popularity proved masterful when compared against it's obnoxious, tiresome, and relentless add campaign that had turned so many adults away merely from previews. Not surprisingly, the movie will still have it's share of nay-sayers ridiculing an excessive cutistry (yes I made that word up, as I sometimes deem appropriate!) whirling around the singing chorus of birds for lengthy periods of time in a barren Antarctica... but in that ignorant cynicism, will have missed so much more that the movie has to offer. A dazzling array of content breezes through in the 109 minute run time that, whenever feeling overlong in it's song and dance sequences, balances out splendidly with delightful humor (complete with superb back-chatter), sincere romance, spectacular action sequences, and quite the little adventure of a plot thrown in with all of it's understated social, moral and religious ramifications shining through in a very natural, unpretentious way.Obviously for a movie that sold itself on musical numbers, Happy Feet had to deliver, and throughout the celebratory routines the music stays at it's utmost crowd-pleasing best. The producers knew what kind of event they wanted to induce for parents and their children when selecting the infectious songs that often combine to form supremely entertaining medley's that wisely pay ode to pop radio in a way that will engage viewers. It is the constant emphasis on Fun that prevents these sequences from becoming stale, often animated in a completely complimentary manner to the upbeat rhythms. For all this talk of the main uniform locale keeping aesthetics to a minimal variance, the animation team does an outstanding job at diversifying and beautifying the icy tundra in ways that keep each scene sacred and varied in it's humble homage to Earth's pristine state. Conecentrating on one specific set of components has obviously let the animators refine the penguins themselves to a charming physicality, no greater exemplified then in our lead Mumble ""Happy Feet"" himself and his infectious tapping.Finally credit must me given to the man responsible for elevating a near-ridiculous concept into the year's best family animated feature. George Miller has truly come full circle in his quest as a director, having branched out through the Road Warrior trilogy starting in the late 70's only to find himself receiving an Oscar for best animated film of 2006 for an opus on singing and dancing penguins. That, is the mark of a diversified filmmaker.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Bambi's Mother dying , Old Yeller and rabies, BUT  Happy Feet is #1 worst","So what is Disney's deep message here?

Happy faces will greet your happy feet, so dance, dance, dance and be as cute a penguin can be. Certainly children should be taught to know that pleasing your captors is THE most important thing in life sends a great message. Captors rule. Remember that Disney taught you this, so it must be true. Can anyone come up with any other message--excepting the other obvious underlying sexual message?!

But this movie was not the antidote..It was so fluffy that I thought better of the intense dramas playing in the neighboring theaters...If you can envision MTV videos with penguins instead of people singing, than you know what Happy Feet is about. The plot was so one dimensional, there were no sub plots and if I knew there would be a plethora of birds breaking out in song and dance, I would have brought a rifle and saved the theater from one more sugarier scene.

One of the best animated musicals,"This film, I thought, was one of the best animated musicals I had seen. This film also explores creativity, which I appreciate. The film is based on the fact that emperor penguin couples court each other and recognize one another by their unique calls, known in the film as ""heartsongs.""Anyway, in an Emperor penguin colony, a female Norma Jean sings ""Kiss"" and a male Memphis sings ""Heartbreak Hotel."" They marry, and Norma Jean lays an egg. One night, while he was singing, Memphis dropped the egg, exposing it to freezing Antarctic temperatures, resulting in a poor singing voice. The colony's elders frown upon Mumble's astute talent for tap dancing. Throughout his childhood, others ostracized him. As an adult, Mumble grows up in a carefree Adelie penguin colony, where he befriends a small group of bachelors called the Amigos. The Amigos welcome Mumble's dance moves and accept him into their misfit group. So that's all I am telling you. You will have to see it for yourself.Overall, I love this movie. I've mentioned this before, but I don't have a favorite scene. However, the movie does have some fantastic musical numbers and plenty of toe-tapping fun.

Warmful and moving stories, nice developed characters, a fantastic use of songs are many aspects of why every person should watch animated films these days. And ""Happy Feet"" is one of those.A little penguin named Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) can't sing and singing is what makes a real penguin. But he can tap dancing just like Fred Astaire, something he does since he come out of the egg. His father (Hugh Jackman) disapproves, but his mother (Nicole Kidman) likes the dancing finding very cute. The problem is that penguins must sing his love song, because that's why they fall in love and eventually the specie evolutes. Mumble falls in love with Gloria (Brittany Murphy) a female penguin that has the most beautiful voice between the penguins. But a penguin couple can only exist if both penguins sings. Cast out of the group, Mumble found new friends, a group of friendly Latin penguins. But he can't give up Gloria because he's still in love with her and he's gonna fight with the elder penguins showing that he is also a penguin.This a moving film about love, prejudice, friendship, loyalty, and also about social preservation of the environment. Everyone will love it because it has funny moments, the animation is well made (it includes a very good segment with real actors) and there's many songs of artists like Prince, Queen and Earth Wind & Fire (sanged by the penguins). Here you can find action, adventure, romance, drama, musical, almost every cinematic genre in one movie. And, of course, a good message of what love can do to us (here in the form of penguins).

Who's the target audience?,"Saw this movie with my 6 year old and generally we liked it. The animation is great and the singing and dancing by the penguins was so much fun! Good message about being different but it kind of got lost in the shuffle (ha! pun intended).At 2 hours, this was too long. It would be very easy to lose the 30 min. ecological message that seemed to be thrown in -- it doesn't show up til the ending of the movie and it doesn't fit with the fun stuff at the beginning.I'm glad to have seen this and my 6 year old liked it -- she even said in the middle ""Is it done yet?"" I'd recommend seeing this at home where you can skip the stuff the kids don't understand and keep with the fun music and dancing.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Failure as an Animated Movie, as a Children's Movie, and as a Nature Film","""Happy Feet"" is more weird than endearing, and it fails at the true test of an animated flick for kids: it does not create its own world. It also fails the true test of a nature flick: ""Happy Feet"" does not honor the world it claims to depict.""Happy Feet"" claims to be about promoting man's respect for the natural world, and yet the movie treats the natural world with tremendous contempt. In that contempt, ""Happy Feet"" is a failure as an animated movie, and as a children's movie.A really good children's movie, a really good animated movie, and/or a really good movie about the natural world MUST do this one thing: it must create an alternate world that makes you forget other worlds you've ever been part of.Disney classics like ""Snow White,"" ""Bambi,"" and ""Pinocchio"" create their own worlds, their own aesthetic. They aren't imitations of other works of art; other works of art imitate *them.* These films, in creating their own worlds, become touchstones. We talk about deer as ""Bambi."" For example, when states try to cull deer populations, politicians say, ""Voters don't want us to shoot Bambi.""""Happy Feet"" does not create its own world. It is a cheap, plastic knock-off of grade B movies, television sitcoms, and commercials we've seen a zillion times before. How many times have you heard someone do a really bad Elvis Presley imitation, as Hugh Jackman does in his voicing of his character? How many times have you heard a woman do a bad Marilyn Monroe imitation, as Nicole Kidman does? And -- Robin Williams? Doing tacky ethnic schtick? Does the world really need more of that?""Happy Feet's"" humor is drawn from ethnic stereotyping. The ""bad"" penguins are white Southerners -- I guess -- thus Aussie Hugh Jackman's bogus Southern accent. The ""good"" penguins are barrio Hispanics. These Hispanic penguins are so stereotypical you expect them to be depicted costumed as Lou Diamond Philips in ""Stand and Deliver,"" or ""La Bamba"" and driving low-rider cars.The point - if this movie really loved and cared about nature, its humor and its interest would be drawn from real penguins' real lives. This shouldn't be so hard to do -- who hasn't laughed or been touched while observing penguins in a zoo? But the movie just slips penguin costumes over stereotypical urban Hispanic Americans. So much for nature.""March of the Penguins,"" 2005's brilliant documentary, transported viewers to a completely different world -- the world of penguins of Antarctica. For the moments that I was watching that film, I felt completely apart from modern America. That's because that movie was really about penguins, not ethnic stereotypes in penguin costumes.""Happy Feet"" drags penguins and Antarctica down to the level of a slum and uses rehashed ethnic humor to amuse its audience. The film has no faith that any authentic depiction of penguins or Antarctica would interest anyone.There are horror scenes that are much too intense for young children. The main character, a defenseless ball of penguin fluff named ""Mumble,"" is drawn practically in the mouths of predatory skua and seals. I'm an adult, and I found these scenes hard to watch.Grant the film this: the animation is superb. The film's beautiful images, though, can't rescue its desperate plot.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Seriously disappointed,"This one took the cake for me with a serious let down. Perhaps it was all the great marketing that had my expectations too high. Unfortunately, no delivery for me, my husband or my kids. The first 5 minutes of the film were indicative of what we were in for. The grand finale was great, but the writers tried to pack everything in at the end. It would have been better delivered from the beginning with a little more roundness. My children were entertained by the music at best. The marketing has been geared towards kids, and I honestly thought it would be a HOME RUN. WRONG. My vote, don't even waste money on the DVD. Anyone who has seen the Happy Feet toys in Target, take a clue, the movie is as bad as the toys. I should have known better.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't Waste your kids Precious time!!,"I have seen thousands of movies and I am thinking every Disney/ Pixar/ Warner Brothers movies that has ever been put out to this date!

"While it's not groundbreaking, Happy Feet still holds up on it's 10th anniversary","In 2006, Warner Bros and Animal Logic teamed up to make a CGI motion capture animated feature film known as Happy Feet, a story about a tap dancing penguin named Mumble (voiced by Frodo Baggins - I mean Elijah Wood) who, after being born from an egg, has an ability to tap dance everywhere he goes and embarks on a quest to make peace with the humans who took their food while learning to accept himself as he really is.Happy Feet is still as good as I remembered it. However, before I can get to the good stuff, there is one problem I do have. And that is the environmentalist message. The story is supposed to be about acceptance, but the whole ""humans stealing our food"" concept did get really preachy and the whole movie could've been stronger without it. I'm not angry about it. It's just that they didn't do anything new with it. Just a nitpick. Everything else still holds up.The voice acting is top notch with great performances from Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, and the late Robin Williams, who committed suicide in August 2014, stealing the show as both Ramon and Lovelace, two hilarious and entertaining characters since the Genie from Disney's Aladdin. The animation is gorgeous with a great scale on Antarctica and the penguins even though the human motion capture doesn't have the same level. The best part, however, is the musical numbers which consists of cover versions including the Boogie Wonderland sequence and with the help of John Powell's lush and beautiful musical score, it's still the most memorable scene.Overall, Happy Feet may not have anything groundbreaking to make it stand out from the likes of Pixar and DreamWorks, but with lush animation, endearing characters, and memorable musical cover songs, it still tap dances perfectly on it's 10th anniversary. Happy New Year, everybody! :)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A horrible mess.,"First off, I have to qualify this comment by saying that this film is probably critic-proof in the sense that parents will rent it for their young kids (of the 6 and under crowd), and that these kids will no doubt enjoy it for one reason or another.But as an adult watching this film, I couldn't help but find it uneven, patchy, tonally out-of-whack, and ultimately unfulfilling. And I'd probably dismiss it all the more if it wasn't for the fact that ""Happy Feet"" was directed by none other than George ""Mad Max"" Miller (and ""Babe,"" but I'm not holding that against him).A few flashes of brilliance aside, it's as if ""Happy Feet"" was made by a focus group. This is especially evident when you consider that this film was released just barely a year after the successful documentary ""March of the Penguins."" Okay, we've got our penguins, let's have them sing pop songs in a manner reminiscent of ""Moulin Rouge."" And to top it all off, let's make it relevant by tacking on a third act that deals with environmental responsibility (Miller's heart is in the right place here, but it just doesn't gel with the rest of the film).What you get is a hodge-podge of elements, which conflict with each other. A few humorous, entertaining scenes? Sure. But a compelling feature-length movie? Hardly.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Banshee Screams for Happy Feet (and other such ramblings),"This is one of the most stirring films I've seen in a while, and its no shock that its George bloody Miller directing, writer and director of the Mad Max series, the Babe films, and Lorenzo's Oil. It also shouldn't come as a shock that this movie bares a lot of similarities to ""The Road Warrior,"" either. But, we won't get into that here.Like most of Miller's films, this is a story about the 'underdog hero;' and again, like most of his films, its not afraid to mince around issues of the time. Like Mad Max and the oil situation, this film confronts matters about overfishing without pause. And, by all rights, it should. It's not just a 'Greenpeace' matter, anymore. This is important, the world over.The film's also one that takes its inspiration from many sources, some of the most noticeable being the Jesus/messiah story (don't believe what you've heard from most of the other 'this film is anti-Christian' reviewers. This film is essentially a Jesus/messiah parallel, right down to the Pharisee-like Elders and 'resurrection.') and 'Joseph Livingston Seagull,' among others. They're not 'ripped off,' though, so to speak, and this is good. I suppose you've all seen the film, so there ain't be no summary on this here review. I mean, come on. You can read a summary on any one of these other schmoes reviews! Cam'aaaan!Some people are labeling this film ""liberal propaganda."" I'm not even gonna get in to that, as I still wanna keep my IQ where it is. But, this quote from the man himself will suffice: ""Look,"" Miller says, dismissing low-brow criticism Happy Feet got as eco-propaganda, ""any story worth its salt has to have more to it than meets the eye. I mean, it's got to have a lot going on in the subtext.""This is a heartfelt and moving film, and a giant step for c.g. films both technically and storytelling-wise. Miller's made another masterpiece, and that's really all I can say.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worst Animation Film seen,"I have to admit I loved animation films madly till I had seen this. The film stumbles in most of the parts. The first thing is that the story itself is not good. Then we have this dancing all the time accompanied by some irritating songs. May be the songs were not that irritating but I think the sight of those penguins doing all kind of stuff was disgusting. The story became irritating in the end. Inclusion of humans in the film seemed a bad approach. In all, the film lacks the basic development of a story without which the charm and interest could be maintained.""Do not waste your time.""",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Were the producers and directors trying to get a ""two for one"" with the voice of Robin Willliams?","I watched ""Happy Feet"" last weekend (3/31/07) and I really liked it. My only critique was not that Robin Williams was used as a voice-over because he does great work but the fact that he was used for two ""ethnic"" voice overs. I am African-American and as the voice of ""Lovelace"" he sounded like a ""white person trying to sound black"" and the same with him doing the voice of ""Ramone"" and trying to sound Latino. In that respect I found it to be quite insulting and a mockery. Come on guys spend the money and try and get an Eddie Griffin, a Tommy Davidson, an Issac Hayes, a Ron Glass, or a James Avery (Uncle Phil on ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"". And as for ""Ramone"" I'll bet you Carlos Mencia, Paul Rodriguez, George Lopez, or maybe even Cheech Marin would have done a bang-up job.

Another cranked out cheesy animated flick.,"I saw this movie with my little brother, and although the sequel is far worse, (probably deserving of a negative score) this movie did not live up to any expectations that we had. the humour and wit was stale, the characters were shallow and predictable, and the plot was the same old repetitive sequence you've seen time and time again in these animated flicks. This movie could have been a hundred times better with puppets, something Jim Henson style, but they always go for the cheap and cheesy animation these days, and the product of that is a seemingly endless stream of easily forgotten movies that are saturating the film industry and turning the video game industry into a bad scene of movie games as well.

A Fully Imagined Alternate Civilization,"The various components of human biology and behavior structure the way we interact with other people, find mates, view the environment, and organize societies. The brilliance of this movie is that it develops a comprehensively new civilization for another species based on different biological characteristics. Happy Feet is not some superficially ""light"" movie made to distract kids for an hour and a half. Like early groups of humans, these penguins battle harsh living conditions and the constant threat of death against a backdrop of religious superstition, social ostracism, physical disability, ingroup/outgroup conflict, sexual pressures, and the possibility of destruction by another species. Its depiction of Antarctic wildlife and climate are phenomenally biologically realistic, with of course some dramatic liberties taken. This is a complete movie that will satisfy anyone willing to think about human society through the critique of a dancing penguin movie. Which you should. Besides, the plot is great, the characters are excellent, the animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is perfect. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's a good movie, but it collapses completely in the final 45 minutes.","Once upon a time there was a land in Antarctica where penguins knew how to sing wonderfully to mate... once upon a time there was a penguin who did not know how to sing but, instead, danced tap dancing wonderfully. Once upon a time, there was an animated film with penguins (another one) that wanted to tell an incredible story but didn't know how to finish it.In short, this is how the plot of this film comes down, another one that uses penguins to attract the children, which has a predilection for this cute and friendly animal. The film intelligently addresses group social behaviour, the creation of patterns, what is acceptable or unacceptable in a community, social exclusion and the acceptance of what is different, and the film is excellent at exploring all of this and gives rise to many interesting moral lessons for the minds of children and young people. But, if we exclude this more didactic and formative point, the script is very thin and hardly sustains an 100 minutes feature film. To make matters worse, the script was unable to decently complete the story: the main character's journey to the human world is something so unrealistic and unlikely that it completely destroys the film.The voice actors all did a good job, especially Elijah Wood, the veteran of the 1000 voices Robin Williams, and also Brittany Murphy. The visual quality of the animation is very good, but the use of digital resources, CGI and mass computing already made this to be expected, as it is the new standard of modern animated cinema. The film knows how to use light and color very well. The characters were designed to appeal to the little ones and look cute, making the film profitable and giving rise to a merchandising machine eager to make the children ask their parents for anything with a penguin on it. Strongly based on music, the film has a lot of rhythm and the soundtrack is probably one of the richest in the animated movies that decade, but it is a soundtrack heavily based on well-known songs and covers by artists like Elvis, Prince, Earth Wind & Fire etc. As far as I can tell, the film has few or no original songs. Still, it is a good soundtrack and an excellent film, good enough to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film, in that distant year of 2007.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best penguin animated film!,"The animation in this film has aged quite well. It's visually stunning and the detailing in the landscapes and the animals are flawless. The incorporation of the live action human beings in the animated world was definitely a unique concept.As for the story, it has a heartwarming tone to it that is fun to watch in a family setting. A story of morale with accepting differences, change, and exploration. The voice acting and diverse accents depending on the different species (and even variants of the same species) made it easy to follow who's exactly who and even added comedic value. The ending seemed slightly rushed and cheesy compared to the solid first two acts, but it was an enjoyable watch overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"No story, no fun, no point","Me and my girlfriend watched this for half an hour and then unanimously decided to give up on it, which doesn't happen often. In retrospect I found out that this even won an Academy Award for best animated movie of the year: wow, it must have been a very dire year for animated movies - - or otherwise this is further proof how worthless the Oscar really is as indicator for good movies.Basically this is March Of The Penguins as a computer-animated cartoon with a bit of humour thrown in. They tried to make this look relatively realistic and non-anthropomorphic rather than cute and cuddly. In consequence, the movie is still far too unrealistic to be educational or enlightening, and it isn't very entertaining either. The jokes are few and not that good, the dialogues not that witty, and the plot is pretty inane: a penguin couple hatches an ""odd"" chick which stumbles strangely. A little later we learn that every penguin has its ""heartsong"" (pass the sick bag, please), except for our little penguin, who prefers to dance (incidentally, the dancing isn't that impressive, probably because animated tapdancing rarely is). He is ostracised by his peers but starts to win the heart of this penguin girl. At this point I switched off. What probably would have followed is a story about inclusiveness (it's OK to be different) and to thy own self be true.Incidentally, we saw another but excellent animated movie about penguins immediately afterward, Surf's Up, which I can highly recommend. Just to show you that I'm not biased against penguin-themed cartoons per se.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

A masterpiece of animation and the third great work of George Miller,"Happy Feet is an excellent movie that for several reasons deserves to be considered one of the best animated movies ever. It is a movie created by the mind of George Miller, who brought us the Mad Max and Babe saga. Therefore, Happy Feet is his third great masterpiece. The film has a story that makes a very good combination of music, comedy, drama and an environmental message that suits it well. It takes real elements of the life cycle of penguins and human intervention in them. Many of his characters are quite endearing, whose voices have a talented cast. We have Mumble voiced by Elijah Wood in the adult version of him and by E. G. Daily (Buttercup from The Powerpuff Girls) as his younger version. Mumble is quite a character with whom it is easy to identify for being an outcast. His only love is Gloria, voiced by the late Brittany Murphy, who is quite a beauty. The film also has another character which is Norman Jean, voiced by Nicole Kidman. The best thing about Norman is her voice. Who would have imagined that Nicole Kidman had such a beautiful voice? It is also necessary to highlight Memphis, voiced by Hugh Jackman, who also has a very attractive voice. The curious thing here is that Hugh manages to perfectly imitate Elvis Presley's singing and that proves that there are actors who should definitely dedicate themselves to music too. Among the other characters we also have Ramon and Lovelace voiced by Robin Williams. It is curious that Robin voices two characters, but with somewhat different personalities. The only resemblance Ramon and Lovelace have is the charisma that Williams gives them. As for the rest, don't forget Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) as Noah and Fat Joe as Seymour. Adding all that, it should be noted that the songs in the film are wonderful. They give the film a lot of soul and John Powell's score is also included for his participation in several songs and also creating a very good atmosphere at various times in the film. What also makes this movie a masterpiece is its spectacular animation and CGI that gives a very good realism to the characters and settings. Animal Logic have managed to outdo themselves with the digital effects in this film and that can also be credited to the motion capture. In conclusion, Happy Feet is a masterpiece of animation that with its soundtrack, good plot and environmental message is destined to be a timeless film. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's movies like this that help make them like this. I know there's other things that cause this, other television shows and movies, but this is supposed to be for kids.

Toe-tapping inevitable,"'Happy Feet' is yet another addition to the fast-growing stable of animated ""kids"" movies that are unashamedly able to be enjoyed by those of all ages.

One earlier commenter mentioned that these types of films are a ""safe bet"". This is true, but nevertheless Happy Feet is good enough to be one of the best of an increasingly crowded bunch.Visually the film is a masterpiece, particularly the aerial shots the icy landscapes, and it's clear that the animation process has improved exponentially in these post-Shrek days.

Why tell this story with penguins?,"I can't deny that there is a charming quality to Happy Feet. It's a rather simple tale that suggests all penguins sing and that's how they connect with their mates, but one day a penguin is born who doesn't have a song, but rather has a dance. The songs that they sample for the film are delightful, but the entire idea of a tap-dancing penguin is just weird. They are a bit hampered by the actual physicality of penguins so it never looks all that impressive when young Mumble breaks into a dance. The other problem with using penguins to tell this story is that the visuals in most of this film are monochromatic, stark, and cold. They try to amp up the visual spectacle in some of the musical numbers but otherwise I found the movie looked about as compelling as a sheet of text.Now this next thing isn't really a complaint about Happy Feet, because many movies have used this same idea in the past, but it really stuck out to me this time that humans are the dumbest creatures. Every other animal can communicate with every other species, but humans cannot understand or be understood by the animal kingdom. It's just a strange trope that stands out to me a bit more in a film where the climax involves penguins trying to speak to humans. I appreciated some of the messaging in Happy Feet, when it wasn't blatantly mocking those who are religious. The musical numbers were entertaining, and I wish there were more of them. Obviously there were some other issues that I had with Happy Feet, but it's still a watchable movie with enough fun to entertain the whole family.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Austin Movie Show review -- spectacular!,"Neither the commercials nor the marketing do this film justice. ""Happy Feet"" is simply the greatest animated film since ""The Lion King"" (remember those Disney films that had such depth and complexity that they actually made you cry?).

Unfortunately, dancing is looked down upon in this society, and Mambo is mocked, scorned and eventually expelled from the tribe by the heads of the Established Penguin Church.""Happy Feet"" gets quite dark and somber when Mambo is captured and forced to live in a zoo where all the animals eventually drift into a glazed dementia. But I promise that most of the film is funny, beautiful, enchanting, and a total treat from start to finish.

Not what it could have been.,"Happy Feet was first described to me as a combination of March of the Penguins and Moulin Rouge. I have to agree, but not in the way he intended. It doesn't combine the creativity of those 2 films, it copies them. The story starts out replicating scenes from March of the Penguins, except with singing. It's very cute for about 3 minutes. Then you realize that the songs are uninventive ripoffs or just songs by the artists themselves. The story has too many elements shoved together, none of which really engage. It tries to be the story of the kid who doesn't fit in, the environmental story, the cross-cultural story. It's fine, but not nearly as original as it could and should have been.

"An amazing, and Inspiring film","First some background on me: I'm a 15 year old filmmaker form Vancouver, BC. (also featured on Cinematical on Nov.4th ;) )This film was AMAZING, and I don't care what others say. Everything, from the cinematography to the photorealistic-ness of it all was a real testament to what's possible with today's technology. Some parts were so effectively creepy, and the fact that this was made by a visual effects company was evident by the flawless water and environments. I really 'felt' like I was in Antarctica, away from all humans, and the water just 'felt' cold, something very rare in films; to actually be able to communicate environments and scale so well.I'm so happy that the ads didn't tell the whole story - that would have ruined it for me, I think - the last bit of the movie was so jarring an unexpected, in the best way possible! I was so happy that the filmmakers didn't shy away from showing kids some stuff that they did near the end there (I really don't want to ruin it for anyone), but I can honestly say that that was extremely inspiring and, as a teen filmmaker myself, just taught me what a big difference camera moves can make while communicating story and emotion.Overall, an excellent film, and definitely a recommended see! Should you take your kids to it? Be warned: If you do, all other animated films may seem too simplistic and boring. Elijah Wood + Robin Williams are great, and DANG can Brittany Murphy SING!

Political Propaganda,"This is the first time I have written a formal movie review, but I felt compelled after viewing Happy Feet with my 5-year old twins. While the movie had some endearing characters and several genuinely funny lines, the overt pro-environment, anti-Christian propaganda was shocking.For instance, the penguins are faced with a severe fish shortage, which we learn is (of course) caused by humans wanton destruction of the environment for their own monetary gains. Before this becomes evident, the penguin elders contend that they must appease the ""great wind"" to bring back the fish. It is clear by the context of the movie that they are meant to represent Chiristians appealing to God. The elders are depicted as narrow-minded, bigoted idiots. Regardless of your viewpoint, the characterization was extremely offensive.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but personally when I take my kids to a movie we are looking to be entertained, not slammed over the head with a partisan, mean-spirited political message. My recommendation is to go see Flushed Away instead. It may not be as dramatic, but it is good clean, non-political fun.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved the movie,"I saw the movie ""Happy Feet"" yesterday morning. This is a GREAT film with a GREAT message in it. The only bad thing is that my mom and I were watching the movie and about three or four times, three ladies came in and out. Other people besides my mom and I sat through the movie without moving from our seats. It was rude for these three ladies to go to the restroom etc. during the movie. When I see a movie, I don't expect people to leave their seats or walk by me without saying ""Please move"", and ""Thank You very much for moving"". It was not our fault that my mom and I were sitting there is it? I definitely want to see the movie again and again. I hope that it's up for Oscars next year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should have been rated PG-13,"This movie started out cute. The main plot seemed to be about a penguin who didn't have a heart song but could dance. Then they decided to make this movie into an environmental agenda.If that had kept to the story about the penguins having a heart song and the penguin not being accepted because he didn't have a heart song...it would have probably been fine. Even the environmental issues wouldn't have been so bad but they totally ruined this movie for children by having so much sexual content. Examples: The penguins at one point were slipping on the ice in various sexual positions. One male penguin had numerous female penguins around him. It was mating season and he asked ""okay, ladies...which one wants to go first?"" I think that is a little too much for a movie that is geared for children.If you have children under 13, I wouldn't recommend seeing it. Big disappointment and waste of money & time!",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
This film is not for young children,"To me, this film seems like it came together in 10 marketing meetings. All of the songs are of ""an older generation"" - if you're 40 you'll recognize them all. Making you want to buy a recycled sound track. By getting all the big names together they assure a big opening weekend too.I took a 5 and 7 year old and of course they loved it. The animation was SPECTACULAR. And Robin Williams (in his many roles) was very funny. And the ""overt"" story is good - be yourself, you don't have to fit in to be happy, don't give up when things get tough.But the entire sub-text is that finding a mate is the most important thing in life. Plus, the sexual innuendo was WAY to strong for me to feel comfortable with my young kids. Since when did Prince became acceptable for children? I love Prince, but I'm a 40 year old father of 2. The themes are just to ""adult."" I do think that if my kids were 11 or so, I wouldn't be writing this. But I use the comments on IMDb to help determine what movies might be OK for my kids before I take them. In this case it was spur of the moment and I didn't do my usual research. I admit that I tend to be overprotective when it comes to my kids and mass media. But if this review keeps someone from taking a 7 year old girl - then it's worth the time.And I don't even have time to get into the silly ending (with the real humans) that entirely simplifies what would be a complex debate. And the stereotypical portrait of Hispanics that gets painted.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
penguin costume anyone?,"I love penguins so much. I have since second grade when my teacher read us ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"". My friends all know i love penguins and every year I am flooded with pajamas, socks, toys...all penguins. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I nearly cried, I was so excited. I'm not sure if that's when i decided to get a penguin costume for Halloween or not but I did anyway. I wore it to school, and trick-or-treating and I won 'cutest costume' at a costume party.I decided a month before the movie came out I would go to Opening Day wearing my costume and bring as many friends as I could. Well, November 17th came around-Opening Day (and my anniversary) and I was walking around school wishing everyone a Happy Penguin Day and telling them all to go to the theater later that day. I waddled through the parking lot and up to the doors. My friends all shrieked with joy and took pictures of me. People in the parking lot turned, confused and amused. I took a picture in front of a Happy Feet movie poster, in the same pose as Mumble. Just to be funny I asked for a different ticket to throw off the man working in the window-""I'd like one for Saw 3 please....No, no just kidding I'm a penguin! I want to go see Happy Feet."" He chuckled and I, sadly, gave him my $6 for my ticket. ( I had hoped my costume might win me a free ticket, or at least a small popcorn) I walked through the lobby with my 8 friends behind me. One child asked, ""Did you lose a bet or something?"" that one i ignored. People looked and pointed and I smiled and waved.We got into the actual theater with my pop and goodies and i slowly ascended the stairs. One large step at a time. You should have heard the giggles from people eagerly awaiting the beginning of the movie. I sat down casually and waited too. It started and I smiled constantly. Not one part of the movie disappointed me. At the graduation party scene when one penguin tells everyone else to put their flippers in the air, I did as well. My friends looked at me and laughed. In another part, when Lovelace tells all the penguins to hug the penguin next to them, I hugged my boyfriend right next to me and encouraged everyone else to do it too.At the end of the movie, my friends told me to get up and dance like Mumble. I wanted to but i told them i couldn't. They told me to do something so i did a heel click off the stairs. Apparently, that wasn't enough for them. So i did the Cotton Eyed Joe right in front of the screen. Meanwhile the cleanup staff were trying to do their work but I saw them peeking. I finished my dance and did a little bow at the end. We all went to the bathroom and my boyfriend waited outside. When the staff came out they were talking about me, he said, and how cute I was when I danced and how funny it was for me to dress up. Then he said they went and talked to the food staff after that. I walked out into the lobby after that and everyone was just staring. I panicked a little and then just casually waved like there was nothing peculiar going on. Finally, we left the theater and I waddled out to the car and hopped on in, avoiding the puddle underneath the door to the best of my penguin abilities. Monday at school, everyone had heard about my courageous adventure and they said how funny it must have been to see me.But the moral of this comment is, this is a great movie and it brings families, friends, and complete strangers closer and gives them something they can all smile about, no matter what mood you're in or what age you are.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dull and duller the kids will be bored.,"This movie bored both the adults and the kids who went to it.The kids (8 and 6) wanted to leave repeatedly.The scenery was impressive but the story line was poor and the musical score was quite dull really, Anne Hathoway did a much better rendition of ""need somebody to love"" in Ella enchanted.Robin Wiilliams seemed to be doing a poor imitation of Sacha Baron Cohen from Madagascar.The environmental message could have been handled so much better. The over the top message would have weakened the stomach of the most ardent of environmentalists.It felt completely derivative and in the end with no empathy with the characters, we didn't really care if they survived.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sheer happiness!,"This movie really surprised me. I was expecting it to be good, but instead, I found it to be great.It incorporates so much music from several eras of popular music, and it features gorgeous animation. Top that off with a story and characters that are endearing without being buffoonish or sappy, and you have Happy Feet.I don't want to give away any plot elements, for the story is simple yet effective.The music element sort of reminded me of Shark Tale -- remember that animated movie with Will Smith as the voice of one of the fish? The differences, however, are many. I thought that the Shark Tale movie was a little ridiculous with characters that were not sympathetic or endearing in the least. The story was also a bit stupid, in my opinion.Happy Feet is a totally different kind of movie. Yes, the plot vehicle is not wholly original, but the execution is flawless, and the voices are perfectly suited to each character.This movie is ideal for any family member old enough to sit through a feature-length film. One of the best I've seen this entire year! Go see Happy Feet. You will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not what I was expecting, unfortunately...","In any cartoon with talking animals, one must suspend disbelief in order to be able to enjoy what they're watching.Unfortunately, with ""Happy Feet,"" that suspension of disbelief requires a quantum leap outside the bounds of logic. And that's before we get to issues with the script, the cast, the acting and a subplot that could be construed as offensive to people of faith.The crux of the plot -- that one penguin could basically affect the fishing habits of humans around the globe -- is unlikely at best and jaw-droppingly insipid at worst.If you can believe a penguin could swim to what looks like the U.S. Atlantic or Pacific coasts, you might have a good time watching this film. Otherwise, if you're looking for a cartoon -- even a cartoon that throws messages in with its entertainment -- spend your money elsewhere.The potentially offensive subplot in question involves a villainous penguin who represents a quasi-religious figure, and who comes to stand for backwards thinking and bigotry. Two other ""penguins of faith"" are portrayed as a hoaxser (Lovelace) and dim-witted (Memphis).The movie also fails in its casting; Robin Williams gets two roles and does neither very well, although his Lovelace James-Brown-meets-Jimmy-Swaggart is slightly better of the two. Hugh Jackman's Elvis schtick as Memphis is poorly done.One of the movie's best features, the realism of the animation, actually hinders its execution. The penguins are completely realistic, but in doing so, the animators robbed all but Mumble of readable facial expressions. Considering that small children will make up much of the audience for this film, that's a critical shortcoming.There are other issues, including the lack of character development for Anthony Lepaglia's character, and sea lions, seals and whales that show up just long enough to intrigue, then disappear.On the good side, the soundtrack is a winner, the melding of live action and animation was sharply done, and the movie carries a message of non-judgmentalness concerning Mumble's uniqueness.But the movie may go over the heads of many youngsters, and some scenes could be disturbing for some children -- hence, the PG rating.If you're looking for cartoon movies with messages, see the excellent ""Over The Hedge"" or ""Cars"" instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not for the shallow.,"Okay, I understand we all want to take our kids out to enjoy a cute animated film in the theater. This movie offers that. I think the greater strength is not its entertainment value, but its ability to illustrate and dramatize some truths about our society. The movie was obviously written to make some statements, and I liked those statements. Not to get too deep about this because it is entertaining --I left this movie saying, ""Wow. That was intense!""Our kids did enjoy the film. I wish the director had kept children in mind and used more discretion with regard to Lovelace and his ""women"". Even some of the dance moves crossed the line of what is appropriate for children up to age 12 --- the penguins are human enough that some of the dance moves are blatantly sexual in nature.Even with all of that, the fact that Mumble is true to himself, happy, socially conscious, good-natured (despite despicable treatment by so many of his own) and innocent gives this movie such a charming flair.Children should see this with parental guidance. Parents should watch this with the heart of a child.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nice animation, terrible implications","This is simply an anti-religion film. Think ""Religulous"" for kids. This is an attempt at social engineering, stealth-fully wrapped up like a harmless cartoon. A cute penguin that can dance... Don't be fooled. This is not a penguin, it is a Trojan horse with a very deliberate agenda. Over 90% of US population believes in God, so this is an attempt to get your kids to join the single digit crowd. The premise of the film is that adults are stupid and ignorant, kids know more than parents and prayer is for idiots. There is also a more overt anti-industrial slant (ecology replaces religion). The CG is pretty impressive at places (a LOT of work went into the CG). However, the dialog is not fit for kids(lots of sexual references and a few references to homosexual behavior) yet is too ridiculous for thinking adults. Typical liberal brainwashing.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very original and imaginative film!,"At first, it may be easy to pass ""Happy Feet"" off as just another random computer-animated offering from a year crowded by the genre. However, despite a familiar premise (outcast finds acceptance), ""Happy Feet"" is a surprisingly fresh, exuberant film, and among the cream of the massive 2006 animation crop. The only thing that stops ""Happy Feet"" from becoming an instant classic is a misstep in the third act. However, disappointing finale or not, ""Happy Feet"" is the kind of movie with such a large heart that it is all but impossible not to like.If there's one thing ""Happy Feet"" is in great supply of, it's ""liveliness."" With the exception of Pixar's ""Cars,"" ""Happy Feet"" is the most ambitious animated film of the year, and judging from the well-done story telling and impressive visuals, one might even mistake it for Pixar's latest offering, a testimony to how far the non-Pixar companies are coming in the quest to replicate the things that make Pixar great. The filmmakers set out to do a great deal of film deeds with ""Happy Feet,"" and succeed with a number of them.The visual effects in ""Happy Feet"" are also well worth mentioning. The Antarctic setting is breathtaking in its presentation. The choreography of the singing and dancing sequences is extraordinary to watch, as it is done so expertly one might mistake it for a live action sequence if not for the fact that it features penguins. There are also action scenes that are very impressive, such as that of a sea leopard chasing Mumble, Mumble and the amigos sliding down large mountains, and an escape from a killer whale. The visuals in ""Happy Feet"" have a wow factor ideal for the most prominent display possible (which, in the case of ""Happy Feet,"" is IMAX, where it is showing, but in 2-D, as opposed to the 3-D that other animation products ""The Ant Bully"" and ""Open Season"" showed in).For the most part, the voices work. Elijah Wood is appropriately cast as the brave, but unsure hero Mumble. Though it seems Wood was cast because of his role as Frodo Baggins in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, it ends up working well for the film. Robin Williams is entertaining and over-the-top as always in three voice roles (Lovelace, Ramon, and the Narrator, who may actually be Lovelace), showing viewers a sign of comedic life that has been lacking with his 2006 efforts, which included the laugh-free ""RV"" and serious-toned misfire ""The Night Listener."" Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, and Nicole Kidman all work in their roles, though they don't stand out as Wood and Williams do.However, as mentioned above, the third act of ""Happy Feet"" features quite a significant misstep that ends up souring what could have been instant classic status for the film. Instead of offering a real solution or continuing the uniqueness of the rest of the film, the writers opt to give an anti-climactic, uneventful ending that tries to dodge clichés, but ends up becoming one, indirectly. The ending seems just a tad bit incomplete, as if the filmmakers just threw something together, which is a stark contrast to the rest of the movie, which had planning, layout, and most importantly, execution that was nothing short of intricate. It should also be noted that though computer-animated human beings often tend to look clunky when done by computer, live action humans should not be the alternative in a movie that is otherwise completely computer-animated. In fact, real, live action settings have no place in computer animation. It doesn't show realism; it instead displays laziness.However, despite whatever misstep it may take, there's no denying that ""Happy Feet"" is a unique film full of life that is slowly being drained from the computer animation sub-genre that once displayed perhaps the most uniqueness. It's a film that is difficult not to like, and a fun film for viewers of wide age demographics (though it is advised for parents to heed the PG rating- as the film is a bit intense for moviegoers under the age of six or seven) that is as much fun for children as it is for older moviegoers. In the computer-animated battle that seemingly every studio has been in on in 2006, Warner Bros has made quite an improvement over maiden outing ""The Ant Bully"", and with ""Happy Feet,"" has crafted an enjoyable, irresistible film that ends up near the very head of the yearly animation pack.Review posted by W.

H a p p y    f e e t    f o r e v e r,"happy feet is one of the best animated movies ever. Here's why: not only it expresses lots of, very important and sensitive messages but also it does that in a really clever,funny, hilarious, humorous, fantastic way. At long last, all children and grown-ups should be aware of how important some things are like: a healthy family, following one's heart, being proud and not embarrassed of how someone's born and raised, environmental protection, the fact that every single creature on this planet is narrowly and indissolubly connected and attached to their environment and that's why we can't survive if our place and home is being damaged, destroyed, traded on and exterminated. Humans are the smartest beings in this world, and though they have the power to do great things they always get influenced by their insatiable tendency towards bad actions. Well, that was one of the messages the movie passes. All in all, Happy Feet is definitely worth watching more than once. Great direction, great plot, technically( I'm not an expert so I can't judge fairly) amazing. I loved the voices of all these fantastic actors( Wood, Jackman, Murphy) Especially Robbin Williams. Man, he's a piece of gold! My favorite was Nicole Kidman. She has a perfect voice, ideal for the role of the caring and loving mummy. H a p p y f e e t f o r e v e r",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Happy feet has some good treats for the family & children & people should love how Mumble find a way to the humans. I hate the fact that Shark Tale has become more of a drug user/weed smoker teens & losers who have no life ever. Ocar's become less funny and has become more childish.

Quality animation/Average movie - but not for kids under age 7,"We have two kids ages 6 & 4. I loved Shrek and all of the Pixar flicks and really wanted to like this one coming in. We left (early in fact) very disappointed.Quality CGI? Yes, of course. Some hip music? Yes. But the plot just didn't seem to click. I found myself never getting engaged in the story. It was as if the movie's creators said ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we animated March of the Penguins"", then another said ""Yes, and wouldn't it be really neat if we could show penguins dancing to pop music"". Then someone said - ""now let's try to wrap it all up in some ""coming of age/fish out of water"" story + ""pro-environment"" message. Sure, each individual element sounds OK on paper, but they were asking too much to bring all these elements together. It just didn't click for me.No doubt about it, the quality of the animation is superb. But beyond that, there wasn't much rewarding about this. The jokes were few and far between - and not that funny. The ""Latino"" penguins were too stereotypical for my tastes. But most of all, I'm disappointed that this film is mis-marketed as a sweet, cutesy picture about cute dancing penguins suitable for the Nemo audience. In reality, young kids won't get engaged in this plot like they did for the good Pixar flicks and the action sequences (particularly the seal chase) will leave them at risk for nightmares.

Best Movie I've seen all year!,"Now this is a movie....despite it just being a cartoon, I think The Simpsons taught us that cartoons may be animated but be more relatable then most nonanimated media!

I loved how it didn't just portray happy little penguins, the movie showed that penguins fight to survive in a world where they are both predator and prey. I also loved how the movie had a real soul, not just musically but you felt the penguins plight to get figure out why their main source of food (fish) had grown so scarce. Not only did the movie have a soul the animation was the best I have seen since Shrek and it even made the Shrek animation look like it was from the 1950s....this movie was by far superior on all levels.

Also for those religious folks out there, this may be the movie for you. I don't think the penguins have to sing, come on. I could watch The Incredibles and March of the Penguins over and over, but I had to walk out from the movie. But that's just me, check out other folks observations and comments.

The movie was realistic in how it showed the mindless masses turning to religion rather than thinking to solve their problems. The poke at blind following rather than leading was also a good one, especially given the current political climate in America.The animation was great and the big dance scenes resembling Riverdance were very cool.

A brilliant Peae ofArt,"I would very rarely rate a movie 10/10, but this was worth it.In short this film has it all, Comedy, drama, love, music, visual fx, action and most of all a brilliant story.The story is mainly about being different and being fine with it, different makes us unique. The story is not like some of the films handling the same topic, nor is it like any other animation. It stands out completely since it has more of a human touch to it. Human Touch? Although the movie is a bout Penguins a lot of the cultural and human problems we face daily is being addressed. The movie brings a message of hope and really opens once heart to these penguins.Yes its animation, but not all of it. A lot of the background scenes is photography and is brilliantly blended into the story.In life we get judged so easily when we are different, and when we face challenges, but when we are true to ourselves we really can be free.When a small penguin can make a difference, not give up and go to ends for his friends, So can we.This truly is a brilliant movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good to look at,"This is a very visually impressive movie. I saw it on the Imax and really thought the visuals were well done.Now going into the movie, I knew nothing about it other than that It was about Penquins and there was some dancing. That's it. After the first 5 minutes I was just totally unimpressed. While the movie is visually great, the story is what really suffers. It seems like the movie was really rushed out because of the current popularity of penguins.The story itself is unconventional, not necessarily in a bad way, but in a uninteresting way. The whole ""heart song"" aspect was particularly difficult for me to swallow. It made the movie seems like a large itunes commercial. The story's flow was also very inconsistent. They started at with one theme and tried to add too many others thus making everything underdeveloped. If you asked me 15 minutes in what the movie was about and 15 minutes before the movie ended, I would have had 2 totally different answers for you. The movie had a message to it, but it seemed like an after thought.All in all the movie was visually cute. If you go to see dancing penguins you won't be disappointed.

When I left the theater, I felt so excited and happy.

Quality Sacrificed for Message,"Sadly, as a Christian, I see this all too often. It is nice however to see a ""secular"" film make the same mistake as the majority of ""Christian Filmmakers."" I'm talking about sacrificing quality to get a message across.I said I'm a Christian. And yes, I am conservative. That being said, I've got nothing against preserving the Earth and its natural beauty. But when a movie is made with the express purpose of making humanity feel guilty about what we do to survive INSTEAD of trying to make a good movie, what's the point?The story was weak and was made weaker still by the fact that the story itself took up only about 45 minutes of the film. The rest of the movie was made up of action scenes and music videos that had virtually nothing to do with the plot.ON THE MUSIC VIDEOS...I felt that they tried to make an animated ""Moulin Rouge"" style musical starring Penguins and failed miserably. The song choices were pathetic. The only good choice was Queen's ""Somebody To Love"" and maybe the Stevie Wonder song. The rest of the songs were practically a Top Forty hodge-podge thrown into a blender and served with a side of cheese. It just didn't work.In conclusion, the filmmakers made a crucial mistake when they decided that they were going to send a message. In getting that message across (which they most certainly did) they sacrificed the quality of what could have been a good movie. If they had simply made a good, solid, cute musical starring Penguins, it would have worked. But instead they decided that the MESSAGE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN QUALITY. And that killed it.PS Some of the animation was absolutely beautiful. I wish they'd taken more creative liberty with the character modeling though.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Didn't work.The film was a vehicle for a very strong left wing environmental message about the evils of humans with our polluting and over harvesting of natural resources - we are the source of all the problems in the world.Saw this flick with my husband, 2 kids - aged 15 & 11, and our friends (one with a master's degree in Nature Science) and their two kids - aged 13 & 9. Not one of us enjoyed ourselves. Live and learn, I guess. The ""anti-religious"" themes were not specific at all, more a jab at tradition and generation vs. generation.So, unless you are a big PETA or GreenPeace supporter, I would avoid this movie. It is not a cute and funny movie about dancing penguins.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

Could have been fun,"The songs in the movie could have been a nice addition to an nice movie, but is instead the framework around which a patchwork that should be a movie arises. Then after somewhat more then an hour the creators are out of money and end the story without any logic between upcoming events in a few minutes. The watcher is left behind with the feeling he must eat somewhat more fish to be sure the penguins will starve and save the world from a prequel to this movie. Some characters are fun. This does, however, not include the main character and his beloved. Why she loves him isn't clear at all, but that can be said about many other things in the movie as well.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
From the Director of Mad Max...,"Into the world of the Emperor Penguins, who find their soul mates through song, a penguin is born who cannot sing. But he can tap dance something fierce!This is an awful attempt at a musical. Too many songs, many not very good, mixed together. If it were not for the fact people love penguins, this never would have succeeded. And somehow it won Best Picture? Something about that seems very wrong. Did Disney have no princesses? Did Pixar take the year off?The underlying story that has been told a thousand times -- be who you are even when you are different from everyone else -- and it is a good lesson.

Not good,"This film had a lot of potential, but ended up being a big disappointment. The plot is mediocre, the characters and voices are annoying, and it drags out for half an hour longer than it should and ends up being an honestly forgettable movie. The animation was good, and there were a few scenes I geniunely enjoyed, but there were a lot of uninteresting scenes that made me want to turn off the movie mid way. This movie would have been a lot better if there was some kind of build up or scenes that would put me on the edge of my seat, but it contains none of that.

Adorable!,"Happy Feet was just a pure joy to sit through. It had everything a movie should have- great music, lots of laughs, a little drama, great actors for the voices, action, cute animals...hello penguins?!, and lastly great messages to us. Kids will enjoy this movie because of the penguins and music, but more importantly it shows them that you can be different than all the other kids, but they are still special in their own way! Then for us adults, well you'll get the message at the end. To put it simple, this world wasn't made just for us humans who have a tendency to think we rule the earth and can do whatever we want.

The thing that saddened me the most...,"The thing that saddened me the most about the film, is that I did not care about any of the characters. I felt no warmth towards them, unlike other notable animations in recent years. It's sad but, I felt more concern for a big green, bigoted, farting ogre than these fluffy creatures. Also, as pointed out by many, many others, this is not really a suitable film for very young children, even though we where lead to believe otherwise. On a more positive note, some of the animation depicting the ice floes, space and sea where some of the best I've seen. However this does not make up for the fuzzy plot, lack of characterisation and warmth in this so called children's film.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Penguins are done,"I'm sure it would have been o.k. a couple years ago, but it turns out that most people have a penguin limit and most of us reached it before this movie came out. Bad luck, but there it is - any normal person (if normal people have seen at least two other penguin related movies in the last year) will take about 15 minutes of this - what with the singing and bathetic attempts at emotional involvement - before they have to turn it off or decapitate themselves just to make it stop. Whoever decided that penguins were easy enough to anthropomorphisize that we could just start telling whichever stories occurred to us using penguins in lieu of people was sadly mistaken. There was a similar run on dolphin stories when I was a kid, one with whales a few years later, and one that ended very poorly involving dinosaurs not long ago.

Bad remake of Footloose!,"I have never been so bored at a movie.Here are my reasons for not seeing this film: 1. The creators of this film never took into account how the 10 trailers before this film combined with how boring the film it was itself, might have viewers wanting to leave far before the end of the movie. 2. The ""values"" is this movie have been played out many, many, many, many times in ways easier to watch and learn from. Did I mention this movie drags? 3. March of the Penguins was breath taking and taught me more about life (penguins and humans) then this pile of penguin excrement and the trailers before it combined. 4. If you must see it, wait for it on video. The CGI (except for the seal part, which I didn't get) was amazing. This a movie does not make. :{ 5.

I am disgraced!,"Dear Sir,I have just come out of this piece of absolute rubbish called ""Happy Feet"" After seeing the trailer I thought it will be an educational film that will teach children to act more like young adults!But oh was I wrong. As I saw a grown up female penguin singing some sexual song and as these big strong penguins go goo goo over her. I was beginning to think I walked into the wrong movie. But unfortunately, I didn't.Deeper into the movie I then saw this baby penguin doing some dance. As his little feet moved around I could see that this wasn't what I expected at all. The dance was so sexual and disgusting I was almost sick.It get's worse. The way that male penguin landed on that female penguin was horrible! Just terribly horrible! I have never been so insulted in all my life! Then all the penguins were doing some kind of dance that looked a lot like streaking. I just couldn't watch anymore. I was thinking of leaving since this was obviously a waste of money! Then I saw the human begins reaction to this disgusting dance. I was so ashamed at how happy they were watching it. And worse letting there children see it. It brought me to tears and then I really was sick.This is NOT what you should be teaching your little ones! Please parents! This is a horrible movie, see something more educational like many of the Dora The Explorer short films. These will teach children and adults of all ages how to behave! As for the creators of this dribble. I expect an apology immidently for making me sit through such horrible and disgraceful pornography! Yours insincerely Sarah Fishington.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If this is what liberalism is really all about, just call me new conservative convert.","Aside from the awesome graphical content of this film, it's hard for me to think of much positive commentary that I could give this movie.

Sadly, as liberal as the movie was supposed to be, it went overboard with the anti-religion message.I found this to be VERY intolerant. I also don't understand the necessity for so many sexual innuendos and obtrusive political view points in a film marketed so heavily to children.

"Great animation and messages, but not a great movie.","I went into this film having seen the preview and loving the animation I had seen. On that point I was not disappointed. The film looked beautiful. I even agree with the environmental message of the film and thought that it was handled fairly well.Sadly, the film bothered me, not on visuals or message, but on the dissonance in the story line. It starts as a film about an outcast penguin and, about midway through the film, make a hard turn into an environmental film.As best I can tell, this film shows what happens when too many writers put words on the shooting script. Looking back, you can almost see that there was a smaller, more personal movie that was handed to a new writer, and was morphed into the environmental film. Sadly, the new writer(s) didn't really unify the first part of the film with the second part.I had much higher hopes for this film. And while my 5 year old daughter loved it (which may mean that it has done exactly what it intended to do, since it is a kid's film), as an adult I wouldn't watch it with for my own entertainment.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Then why has it been #1 for three weeks?,"Alright, having come from our third showing of this film, I still just have to laugh at the close minded conservatives who are aghast at this movie. But then these are the same ones who try to find fault in many other animated films for their sheer enjoyment of subjugating others and making themselves feel better about their position in life. Yes, Happy Feet has a heavy environmentalist undertone, yes, it has story, yes, it has dancing penguins.. all the necessary ingredients to make an excellent point to how we should or shouldn't treat the one and only world we live in. With rising concerns for environmental issues, it's refreshing to see that film makers take that extra step to try and keep ourselves grounded in reality rather than being wasteful of resources, disrespectful of the world around us, and sheltering the future leaders who can actually DO something about the situations that we've managed to create.I encourage EVERYone to take their children to see this!

All you see is animated penguins tapping for half an hour each time.It wasn't even funny! I thought it would be amusing but not in the least. I probably smiled 2 times in this movie and thats at Robin Williams little quips. But they weren't enough to laugh.Overall this movie is bland, drawn out, and unfunny.

Who knew an animated musical could be so good on so many levels?

zzzzzzzzzzzzz...oh its over? Sweet.,"So I let my girlfriend talk me into going to see this movie. First off, I don't mind animated movies, I mean, Madagascar and Over the Hedge were pretty good. But this, I don't know. Not my cup of tea.Story: I like the penguin thing, thats OK, but the singing and dancing just gets me. I was bored the whole movie. It's a cliché' ugly duckling story that they just couldn't get off the ground. And how many times are we going to show how awful humans are in these kid's movies and still not do a damn thing in reality to fix it? But thats another topic all together. (1 out of 10) Acting: The voice acting is just par with a children's movie. Nothing special here. (4 out of 10) Special Effects/Graphics: Its animated, so it's limited right off the bat, but because it is set in Antarcitca, there is nothing but white snow and blue sky and water textures. The scenery gets old real fast, I mean, how many little snow covered knolls can these penguins transverse before it becomes, well, BAD. But I guess a winter desert would be boring in real life too. (2 out of 10) Overall: Leave this movie for the kids. If you are unfortunate like myself and get dragged to it by your girlfriend, sit in the back and try and make out through as much of it as possible. (3 out of 10)",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nice graphs, fun movie but far from a great story.","This is a neat film. It has nice graphics. It has cute dolphins. It has singing, it has laughters and it has had almost six months commercials before actually entering the cinema (in Sweden). Anyway, what it does NOT have is a great story. To say the least, this film hadn't got a story, not a complete one. Not one at all. It seems to be scattered into small pieces and you're jumping between them without knowing how or why they've got to a special place. If this would have been done in any other film, I promise you that film would've been one of those movies with a score under two here on IMDb. But this isn't one of those movies. This movie has great graphics and funny penguins. If you relax, it won't annoy you that you don't have a clue on how they got to some of the places that they do go to, and you'll have a fun time and therefore it's worth watching.

Very Cute,"I thought this movie was excellent, and worth waiting to see. It was well organized, and the penguins in it were just adorable! If you have any interest in penguins, you should definitely go see this movie. It's about a penguin named Mumble (appropriatly named for his poor singing) who loves to dance, but can't sing like everyone else. The penguins in the colony think that he's the reason for all of their fish disappearing, but he knows it's not true, and sets out to find the real reason why.Although this movie is great overall, it does have a few things that should have been changed. The plot line changes throughout the movie, which may be a little confusing for younger kids. I found the voice of Mumble's mom, Norma Jean (voiced by Nicole Kidman), to be very annoying. I don't know, maybe it's just me... But anyways, this movie is still good, and even though it's targeted for littler kids, it's a great movie for everyone to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: Happy Feet,"There was a documentary last year which made waves both critically and at the box office. It was a celebration of nature, of life, danger, and death as seen through the eyes of Emperor Penguins in the Antarctica. If you had seen that documentary, then the first 10 minutes of Happy Feet will be familiar territory, as it probably summarized a whole lot of the mating game, into the introductory act.Happy Feet tells the story of an offspring Emperor Penguin of Norma Jean (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (Hugh Jackman). With that distinctive mole placement and swagger, it's actually Marilyn Monroe and Elvis done as animated feather friends, romanticizing each other and eventually have a son aptly named Mumble, born with a defect, save for those distinctively sky blue eyes of Elijah Wood. A heart song is what the Emperor Penguins use to attract their mates, but true to his namesake, Mumble can't sing for nuts and can only, surprise, tap dance, much to the chagrin of the conservative elders.It's perhaps a given that those cute baby penguins which melted the hearts of many in March of the Penguins, get featured so prominently here in Happy Feet. Milking them for what they're worth, this movie pours in a lot more crowd favourites like dance. So you have yet another animated movie in this year's glut of offerings, in yet another movie about dance, a dash of comedy fused with familiar songs weaved together in a medley, and voila! Instant formula for success!I must admit I was initially apprehensive that Happy Feet will be able to pull it off and had somewhat low expectations, given some mediocre Hollywood animated movies being produced. But true enough, I was sold after 10 minutes. The animation is photo-realistic, and probably is the next best thing of having being in the Antarctica, or watching the real one on screen. If the animals in the movie quit talking, you might just think that they're for real.The characters too manage to endear themselves to you, with Robin Williams staging a coup with his voice performance of two penguin characters, one a smooth talking leader of a pack of Adelie penguins with Latino accents (their antics reminiscent of those in Madagascar, only a lot more laid back), and of a know-it-all Guru who answers any questions in exchange for pebbles. Brittany Murphy can sing too, as she lends her voice to Mumble's love interest, and THE babe of the colony, Gloria. Hugo Weaving too is in the movie, and so is the late Steve Irwin. It's no wonder that at the helm of this movie is director George Miller, also an Australian (say, there's quite a number of Australian's lending their voices here)While it's generally a feel good movie, there's a good portion of the movie well hidden away from the trailers, in case you have the nagging misconception that there's nothing too interesting about watching a story of an underdog outcast working his way, cutting across discrimination to win the girl of his dreams. At one point, I thought the movie could have gone the way that Steven Spielberg's AI had gone, because it certainly felt that way. Also, there's a very rushed message on conservation, and in fact, the finale felt that it got truncated just to end the way it had.Christmas season's coming, and a tale rooted in family ties, friendship, and the return of the prodigal son, makes it satisfyingly enjoyable. Parents would probably check out if the toy stores carry baby penguin plush toys. Should be a hit with the kids, after the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
More than just a flipperful of fun,"Happy Feet could almost be described as a Top of the Pops animation of March of the Penguins. But it was nearly four years in the making - as long as the latter hit documentary that moved the hearts of millions in the story of penguins ready to make every sacrifice to give love. A family film rather than kids' entertainment, Happy Feet tells the story of a vocally challenged penguin who nevertheless has a gift for dance. Against all odds, he finds a way to encourage mankind to help penguins survive. The penguins are cute and cuddly, the landscapes are realistically rendered, and the subtexts are delivered with an accuracy to make non-green authoritarians wince.Investment in the film goes beyond the quickly recouped $85M. Research included sending expeditions to the Antarctic so visual effects and camera crews could capture the textures, light and landscapes. The result is a film that looks and feels realistic enough to be taken seriously - giving extra weight to its strong environmental message. But a film like this is only as good as the fun it generates. The humour is genuine and wholesome but the tap-dancing is addictive.Our blue-eyed penguin hero Mumble (or Mambo) has the voice of Elijah 'Frodo' Wood but the tap-dancing of dancer-choreographer Savion Glover. In the production notes to March of the Penguins, Luc Jacquet tild us that, in real life, a penguin walks through the crowd and occasionally stops, trumpeting a loud and violent song. This is repeated at intervals until a fellow penguin answers him, upon which ensues a succession of dancing duos. Happy Feet's hero has to fast forward to the dancing bit.Dance is one of the oldest means of communication, pre-dating language. As a key story element it is an ideal device for making the connection from animals to the audience but also as the pivotal ingredient of Mumble's lovableness that eventually gets him noticed by environmentalists.But Happy Feet is not preachy. There are moments of pure belly laugh, such as when mamma-penguin regurgitates fish for junior. Or the extended joke about 'alien abductions' (ie contact with people). Some of the humour is more sophisticated - the high priest sounded to me suspiciously like the Reverend Ian Paisley. The knocks on dogmatic, harmful, overbearing and out-of-touch religious dogma will be too close to comfort for some of the faithful. And the parallel moral fables in the story may be beyond younger audiences.Happy Feet easily crosses an ocean of feelgood and is both an ethically responsible film for children and addictive entertainment for adults. That alone is a remarkable achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Horribly inappropriate for children.,"I had heard Michael Medved's review for this movie and had purposely avoided the movie. On New Year's Eve, however, my family went to the drive-in and this was the second feature on the bill with Charlotte's Web (an excellent movie), so we stayed for the movie. What a huge mistake! The subject matter and song choice (songs about spending the night together, for example) are not appropriate for small children. Fortunately, this was over their heads (kids are 2, 5, 5, 5, and 11), but it made my wife and I very uncomfortable. The kids, on the other hand, found the movie very boring. About half way into the movie THEY asked to leave. I cannot stress too strongly that this is a movie to be avoided by young and old alike.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Cute"" just ain't the word.","To call Happy Feet ""cute"" would be an understatement. To fully describe it, you'd need a litany of adjectives, such as ""extroidinarily"", ""exceedingly"", ""intensely"", and ""tremendously"" set in front of the word ""cute"" in order for your description to be complete.If you have read the synopsis, you probably already know the story. It follows the life of ""Mumble"" (Elijah Wood), the penguin youngling of parents ""Norma Jean"" (Nicole Kidman) and ""Memphis"" (Hugh Jackman), who, because of certain circumstances, was born with the ability to dance instead of the ability to sing. When he attempts to sing, he creates a sound similar to that of a shrill, rusty horn- only about 10 times worst. It will make you laugh and wince all at once.The voice acting in the movie was colorful and diverse, with a variety of different accents to help express each character. Robin Williams was amazing as the narrator. Most of the songs sung in the movie are probably very familiar to most people, and they were done in the most fun, ""cute"" way possible.After an hour of giggling, though, I fell silent as the movie took a turn for the serious. It started to deal with such political issues as man's misuse of the environment, religious tolerance, and social acceptance. To be honest, I was a little taken back. I didn't expect such a heavy hit from what I thought was nothing but a cute little kid's film.I felt that at some points, the movie lost a little of it's flow and started trying too hard to make it's moral points. I felt that the ending was a bit rushed.All in all though, it was an incredible, original movie and I don't think that I will forget it soon.Oh, and it doesn't hurt that the animation is absolutely magnificent either.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very very long feet.......,"Went to see this on Thanksgiving night..... some of it was very cute..... some of the visuals stunning...... much of the music was entertaining......the message was typical: Hollywood wants to assure us that we humans are stupid and cruel and animals are all wonderfully loving and forgiving creatures that we shouldn't hurt or eat....I think my 9 year old daughter summed it up best when we left the theater and she said ""Dad....that movie was WAY tooooo long"".....it felt like a 3 hour movie"" My reply: It wasn't 3 hours?""I wouldn't pay again to see it but may watch it again on video.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"good,but no 'cars'","i was disappoint after watching 'happy feet' . no , it is a good movie but i though it will be like cars . In my opinion cars is better and should win the Oscar , the only things that i loved in happy feet is the songs and robin Williams (he was really funny) . the worst thing in happy feet is its end , it was really bad unlike the beginning which was good . 'happy feet' is really good and funny movie with good jokes but it's not like 'cars' or even not like 'the ant bully' . wait for the DVD . (cars is the bes animated film , you must see it) . right now I'm waiting for 'harry potter 5' 'ratatoulle' and 'pirates 3' is there going to be a movie for 'eldest'?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A movie to remember,"I really enjoyed this movie, this is the kind of movie I want my children to watch, with constructive messages. Funny, lovely, cute, exciting and adventurous... I felt like a child watching it crying and laughing all the time... and made me realize how real it is. I agree with almost all the comments of this movie (except for the negatives ones) so I don't got much to say only that I strongly recommend it for any ages. I do not think it was a long movie, I rather preferred it a little bit longer, because every bit of it kept your sight in the screen. Really the best animated movie I have ever seen. I got really impressed with the details and the face expressions of each penguin, not far away from a real one.

Who was this film made for? A real disappointment.,"Just watched this with my wife, my 5 yr old & my 4 yr old for our regular Saturday night film night. We didn't make it to the end ... we all disliked it.It's almost as if they couldn't decide who they were making the film for ... but one thing is for certain, it wasn't for children. Here's a few reasons for not watching it as a family film:1) Way too much sexual overtone ... not the occasional clever innuendo that they often put in for the benefit of the adults, just plain sexual insinuations in songs, behaviour and speech.2) The scary stuff was way too scary for little ones.3) The story line was way too complex. The religious allegories, the alien allegories ... just too incomprehensible for children but too patronising for adults.4) Full of the usual clichéd plot elements which seems more intent on making it's moral point than simply telling a story.5) Too long.Redeeming features that raise the score to 3 instead of 1 are the excellent graphics and excellent music ... but you can get those by buying a good music video compilation.There seems to be a mindset now in some studios that as long as something is animated, it's a children's/family film. It's not. The best family entertainment films are those that are made explicitly with younger children in mind ... and then you weave in a few more subtle ""adult"" elements for the benefit of the grown ups. Those that seem to try and please everyone from the outset fall between two stools and fail miserably. Happy Feet is one of those. If they'd made a more simplistic, child appropriate film from the outset then I'm sure they could have weaved in a couple of elements for the grown-ups. As it is, it pleases no-one. A real disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Feet Review,"Happy Feet is a heart-warming, fun for the family movie. It tells the story of Mumble, a ""unique"" penguin, who can't seem to find his penguin heart-song. Throughout the movie, we watch Mumble discover who he is and become proud of his difference.The movie is filled with wonderful music that audiences of all ages will enjoy including classics such as ""Kiss"" by Prince, ""Somebody to Love"" by Queen, and a Spanish version of Ol' Blue Eyes' ""My Way"". Along with a colorful and talented cast including Eljah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, and Robin William, Happy Feet is soon to be set in the heart of children across the nation.We meet an incredible variety of characters such as Gloria (Murphy) who befriends the ""unique"" Mumble (Wood) as well as an 'Elvis' singing penguin adequately named Memphis (Jackman) and his love interest Norma Jean (Kidman). This movie will soon be on every kid's shelf next to ""Toy Story"", ""The Lion King"", and ""Finding Nemo"". The movies graphics are spell-bounding. It holds themes and messages that are current and eternal. Audiences around the world are tapping their feet to the music of Happy Feet and I can't blame them.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing for anyone over the age of 6,"From seeing the trailers and looking at the impressive list of actors attached to this film, I thought I'd be seeing something entertaining. It wasn't. The movie relies too much on familiarity of the songs and cutesy animation. The story- actually, for the entire first hour, there is NO STORY. It seems like just a bunch of different scenes put together for no apparent reason. Only in the last half hour does the film finally seem to have a point- environmental issues.Admittedly, the message of them film is a very good one for children to hear. I think this film will work for very small children under the age of 6, and I highly recommend it for them. But for me and my friend (aged 18 and 19, respectively), it nearly bored us to pieces.One highlight: the first musical number was very cute, and the allusions to Elvis (the father, ""Memphis"") and Marilyn Monroe (the mother,""Norma Jean"") and being together was a great idea! But the film didn't do it for me. 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Happy Feet, Sad Message (*may contain spoilers*)","When I was asked to go see Happy Feet, I was not excited one bit. Seeing another cg children's film was not high on my things to do list. However, when I left the theater my opinion had changed quite a bit. This is truly one of the years best films.To begin the film is in my opinion the best computer animated film ever made. Not as in the best flick, just the most visually amazing. Sorry to all of those Final Fantasy people out there who disagree. The move is extremely viceral which is hard to achieve with animation. At times it feels like a roller coaster ride.That said underneath the beauty are some great voices. This has one of the finest voice acting cast that I can think of to date. Hugo Weaving and Robin Williams are the stand outs. Even with these great voices, the film manages to speak more loudly with the content of the story.The film is truly in every way an expose on some of the darker sides of humans. The film begins with an interesting take on our herd mentality. I like the use of penguins instead of cattle. Through out the film we are given examples of how one must conform to societies standards or become an outcast. We are also given examples of society using religion and fear to rule the masses. Then there is an a sub plot on a dysfunctional family. Finally, the obvious attack on the way we treat the world we live in. The film does a great job, of showing the true cruelty that pollution can cause to the natural world. The scene at the ice station is truly phenomenal. I think that this is where the problem lies.Without giving away the ending, it goes on too long. The film has a perfect chance to end on a more down note and force the audience to accept the truth of the film's message. This however wouldn't work extremely well in a film that is suppose to cater to the young and old. The main problem with the film is that it is a serious commentary on some serious problems in our world that pulls back at the crucial moments to not push away the younger audience members. This was a tough task I can imagine for the creators. However I applaud them for trying. It is admirable to try and get kids thinking instead of throwing gross out humor at them. This is a good film that could have been really great with a little more bite.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unengaging,"As a father of three young'uns I have developed (however unwillingly) quite a knowledge of movies aimed at children. It is a rare movie that can find the balance between entertaining kids and adults. Unfortunately, this movie does neither. The best, and most honest, critics are children, and my children tired of this movie very quickly.Of course, the Hollywood cognescenti were falling over themselves to elevate this movie in the eyes of the public and the reason why became blatantly obvious from the first few minutes. Personally I would rather sit through anti-PC Looney Tunes than bow to the Follywood elite.One extra line to get IMDb to accept this comment!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The movie passed the Justine test.,"The movie was well done and actually treats its younger audiences with intelligence-offering twists, the opportunity to think about the consequences of their actions as well as their governments, etc. The movie is close to the live-action March of the Penguins and therefore some parts give you the fell of déjà vu. I say that it passed the Justine test as my daughter is four and cannot stay put in a theatre for more than 20 minutes at a time. Movies like Garfield's were not interesting enough to keep her down for long. She even developed a case of Happy Feet walking out of the theatre. I would comment that the musical references are too difficult for some audience members to grasp as well as some musical numbers had to many singers singing at the same time, therefore making it hard for this age group to understand the words. Rather than coming out as well-tuned song, it turned into static sound.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nice Animation And Song, But Sometimes Unfocused And Often Manipulative","The first thing to note, and perhaps the most impressive thing about the entire movie, is that it features absolutely superb animation. The second impressive thing about the movie are the songs - a good selection of popular songs that, when they're being featured along with dancing penguins, adds a good deal of spark and fun to the movie. Unfortunately, those two big positives were really marred by two other things: a lack of any truly interesting storyline (I spent a good chunk of this movie wondering what in the world ti was trying to accomplish) and then also a sense that I was being preached at; that this was trying to use a fun sort of concept to push a very manipulative political message - or, actually, several messages. It's not so much that I disagreed with the messages. I just didn't like the way it was done.The first obvious political piece was around the whole idea of inclusiveness. Mumble is an out of the ordinary penguin. Most penguins have a song they use to attract a mate. Mumble couldn't sing - but he could dance. He was an outcast, different and looked down upon by everyone else and judged very harshly by the elder penguins, who came across as the stereotypical religious types - dour and mean-looking and unsmiling, determined to make sure that everybody else leads as miserable a life as they do. So we're to celebrate individualism and look down on those who try to enforce conformity. I get it. The second propaganda point was around the environment - and particularly overfishing, which was depleting the food supply of the penguins. I get that too. Both points were - for me at least - a little too in your face.There are certainly things about this movie that can be enjoyed. It's just that, overall, I didn't find this to be an especially enjoyable movie. (3/10)",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Like March of the Penguins...without all the death and Morgan Freeman.,"This is quite possibly one of the best computer animated movies around. It's not just for families. It's not just for kids. This movie is hilarious for anyone. The reason there are so many songs crammed in is because that's the point of the story!! Please, ignore the negative comments by cynics and pessimists and give penguins a chance. The only reason I give it a nine is due to a somewhat lackluster performance from Elijah Wood. It's still good, just maybe not right for this film as a whole.I'll admit the film is gimmicky. That's what's intended. It's a light-hearted romp through a wonderful land of singing penguins, but at the same time, don't just judge it on face value. It has so much real-life morality to it and can teach such a great lesson.This movie is not meant to be critiqued as a cinema classic. It's a children's movie withlife- lessons thrown in.

Heavy Message Bogs Down Story,"This weekend I had the opportunity to see Warner Bros. 'Happy Feet.' I had heard nothing but positive reviews about 'Happy Feet' with little sprinkles of 'has a strong message' thrown in. To say I was excited to see this film is an understatement. After viewing the film in its entirety, I must say that I did not like the movie that much.First, let's talk about the positive aspects of this movie. For starters, the visuals are stunning. The filmmakers obviously wanted a photo-realistic style to tell their story, and they no doubt achieved that effect. The penguins look real and the environments transport you right into Antarctica. Also, 'Happy Feet's is unlike any other animated movie I've ever seen- it's different. And that is definitely a great thing. There are too many cookie-cutter animated movies and paint by numbers story lines out there. The fact that this movie steered into new territory is definitely one of its strengths.However, in a nutshell I really disliked this film. Why? First, the story had many weaknesses. And secondly, I felt that I was duped and the movie was lacking in every category. The movie that I thought I was going to see was nothing like what I ended up seeing. I felt like I was watching 'March of the Penguins with a Conservation Message' rather than an animated film aimed at a targeted children's audience.The basic story is that there are penguins in Antarctica, and in order to mate they sing to each other. And by sing I mean sing. We're talking Elvis and Prince and large show-stopping numbers. So when two penguins have a son Mumbles (voiced by Elijah Wood) who is underdeveloped, looks different and is simply unable to sing at all, he is shunned by his community and sets out to prove himself to the world and to his parents. He journeys far away, makes some new friends, and discovers that he does in fact have talent- tap dancing. However, something dangerous is threatening the penguins, and it's up to Mumbles to discover what exactly is threatening them and stop it.If that was the storyline, and Mumbles uncovers the dangers and saves the day, and the audience learns about tolerance, then the film would be fabulous and I would be writing a very different review. However, that is not how the movie steers. Instead, it starts out in one direction, then takes a turn in the last half and gets preachy and heavy. Suddenly the movie is not about Mumbles, and instead the audience is bombarded with conservation and anti-zoo messages.Okay with the story out of the way, what about the animation? Well, in short the animation fell flat, and the characters were uninspiring. 70% of the animation was done by motion capture, causing it to feel fake and second rate. The story was largely told by music, in the spirit of the old Disney movies, however I just couldn't get into the tap dancing. And finally, it was hard to tell a difference between the penguins and for that matter I didn't care about any of the characters, besides the main character Mumbles.In conclusion, 'Happy Feet' would have been more enjoyable if it had been a worldly movie about conservation from the beginning, or alternatively remained a story about Mumbles and his journey. However, instead the movie escalated into something big, something that children probably will not understand, with a large message. And because the story was so disappointing, it made me completely overlook the stunning visuals, which is such a shame.:::www.animationchick.com:::",,Anonymous,Animation
"A powerful, layered experience","The movie begins by introducing an alternative world, one familiar to any who've seen march of the penguins or who's a nature fan. The cinematography takes leaps and bounds, going from shots of the earth spinning beneath the sun to stunning vistas of arctic glaciers, with superb transitions.The action sequences have a sort of random, edge of your seat thrill as if you were on a roller coaster or a sleigh ride off a glacier, with just the right amount of danger so as not to disturb too greatly the younger viewers. I was particularly pleased with the mish-mosh of the soundtrack, capturing the somewhat blatant references to various styles of music and using them to establish characters, to drive home the concept of a heartsong.The comic relief is led by no other than Robin Williams, and in the cast he plays a needed role. I was definitely surprised a great deal by the growth and change in the characters; they are far from two dimensional in more than one sense. I haven't enjoyed the layered aspects of the plot since The Incredibles; the self-conscious references to religious conservatism, various cultural norms and all sorts of goodies for those who've spent more than 12 years on this planet. The meaning settles in on you, leaving you with that sense of incompleteness that marks a truly great piece of work, even after the music ends.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tastes Like Chicken?,"For the indiscriminate goobers in the audience, there's Happy Feet, a one-note wonder of an animated feature, about a penguin condemned to suffer the fate of Oblio in The Point, only this time, the odd duck can't sing instead of having a round head. It took me about ten minutes to grow tired of this preachy mess, with George Miller and his crew pounding you about the head and neck with the blunt object of how awful humans are for fishing and putting wild animals in zoos.Puh-leeze!Happy Feet was released by Warner Brothers, but the only cliché missing was somebody warbling, crooning, or burping Disney's ""Follow your heart!"" command.

Great Movie--laughed all the way through it.,"Give me a break. This movie was one of the funniest I have seen in a while. I was laughing so hard at some parts that it was hard to breathe! Take this story for what it is. Every movie has something in it that not everyone is going to like. As for the ""Mating Dance"" I didn't even notice anything odd about what they were doing, let alone children don't recognize sexual innuendos until they're early teen years. I was completely fine with my 4 yr. old in this movie. It teaches the importance of cherishing who we are as a person and not conforming to everyone's views of being different means being weird.

Now in it's place, lay a message revealed in all its bleak 2001-esque nightmare reality. This film in all its amazing scope(totally Imax-worthy),truly realistic animation and groovy music leaves one a bit freaked out.

Disappointing,"Whenever Robin Williams does a film or a voice, I want to see it. So I wanted to see Happy Feet as well. I didn't know what the film was about apart from being about penguins. Which probably was bad, as I sort of expected a children's film (you know, it being an animated film). I was rather disappointed.What I watched was an animated film which, yes, was aimed at children, but that children probably can't understand. At least not young ones and in Germany everybody is allowed to see this film, even children under 6. There's lots of sex talk, never plainly outspoken but always there, very often underlined with gestures. I'm not prude, but what does it do in a film like this? It's not necessary for the story, is it? Has nothing to do with a story about a penguin which is different and who shows his people that being different is okay too.Well, if only that would have been all in the film. But no, of course there has to be a message, too. Don't forget, this was done for children, they have right to get a message, just a good story isn't enough. And yes, the message has to be hammered home instead of being subtle. The last ten minutes were almost unbearable. What, a little penguin dances? Oh my, let's stop fishing empty the seven seas!!! Please. Why is it that this happens so very often in American films? Can't they write a message into a film without clubbing the viewers to death with it? Only a few filmmakers seem to be able to do so, most of them doing independent films...The same kind of story (someone is different, leaves and comes back to help the community with his different ideas) you can find in the equally animated film A Bug's Life. The characters in this film are more lovable, although equally voiced by Americans you don't have the feeling they come from a 'hood in New York but they speak just normal American English, and the message is treated subtly here. You learn something without noticing, without being hammered into the ground. Which is very important. A far better film!",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Happy Feet should have been left out in the cold,"The story lacked development and direction, ultimately leaving me scratching my head to exactly how the conclusion, and many other details in the plot, came about. Most of the characters lacked development and depth, which led me to have little to no empathy for our protagonist and his cohorts. Instead, these staples for any good movie were replaced with a cute animated tap dancing penguin, a few cheap laughs courtesy of a washed up Robin Williams, and elaborate song and dance numbers that featured a wide variety of recognizable pop songs. And on top of that, the filmmakers had the audacity to shamelessly preach their politics as if that excuses it for its shortcomings. And that's not a slam against the liberal ideas of this movie that many have complained about because be they liberal or conservative, sloppily tacking on your ideas about pollution and the environment at the end of your already underdeveloped film doesn't qualify as a meaningful message, even if your target audience is ten and under.Pixar has made it abundantly clear that family films don't have to substitute style for substance. Their competitors need to learn this as well.",,Anonymous,Animation

It is almost like a tour through the history of pop music. The choice of songs makes it even better. Brings completeness to the story line. And change of singers and style in repeated songs keeps a sound track from being repetitive and boring. Actually the song (Kiss)at the beginning and its changed version at the end brings the whole sound track to completion in a kind of classical structure. I like it.

The penguins who show faith that their problems will be fixed are shown to be stupid. The music is all suggestive songs about physical relationships, not about emotional love.

When reality -and not a cute tap-dancing penguin- is disturbing,"When you see a number of messages in the discussion board asserting on that direction, you start wondering if being gay is the only way for an individual to differentiate from the rest. Each person is different on a simple basis and should be encouraged to follow the natural drives of his own.Happy Feet gets right on the money when it comes to tolerance -which is not to be disposed of for the sake of a single group in particular but for everyone's, whereas some threads on the Happy Feet's forum evince, in a nearly startling manner, how much we lack it- and the necessity of putting both melody and rhythm together to create music -this resulting, IMO, in harmonious co-existence instead of perversion-. Moreover, this movie stands for the ones whose parents -to name only a pattern we keep seeing all over the world- made a hardship of their struggle to gain a position in life as musicians, artists, or even ball players since kids -these kinds of parent would say- had better attend a School of Law: all the ones who had to put up with frustration over quite a few years due to whatever society may believe is best for us could have found themselves depicted or reflected in Happy Feet. Not everyone was born to join a firm but to take a different call instead, however admitting that it also might work the other way around.Anyway, Happy Feet has achieved its goal by bringing the tolerance topic on the spot. Trying to make up people's mind that Happy Feet is apologetic of homosexuality -as if a homosexual, or a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Negro, or a Latino, or anyone else who doesn't pace along with the mainstreaming majority were THE problem itself, as some may make us believe by means of an actually discriminatory and manipulative framework- is no less than an evil attempt to misleadingly simplify a yet deeper and still current issue.",,Anonymous,Animation

I have always anticipated a film that would break the slew of conventional children's entertainment.

It was intended as an aesthetic animal fable, another story of the accomplishments of one individual a la ""Babe"". The universal consensus of this film is that it has spectacular animation. Although I question if this is a ""triumph"" in animation. The Warner Brothers' ""The Polar Express"" sported similar realism last year give or take a few artistic appliances, and the animation in ""Happy Feet"", I believe, is over hyped due to what was being animated and how it was being animated. It still worked though and was beautiful to look at. The point of cgi isn't to create photo-realism though. Its' focus on realism would mean the story would have to compensate for the lack of creativity in the character designs, and wellthe story was weak. ""Toy Story"" succeeds with its clever writing and wit. ""Happy Feet"" does not (""I like big tails and I cannot lie""case closed). The main message itself is typical. The ""underlying messages"" are questionable. To Happy Feet's advantage, the cinematography is superb (George Miller can certainly direct).One can see the thought process involved with this movie. The creators formed the characters and said 'uh oh' when they realized that Mumble resembled all the other birds way too much, so they added a layer of baby down to his slick feathers incorporating that into the idea that his egg being temporarily unprotected altered his nature. This tiny touch, among other things, gave me the impression that this film was thrown together with the objective to create a penguin film using motion capture techniques. Different themes, religious, social, whatever, are thrown in at will and pop up in confusing areas.Any film that attempts to connect serious themes with singing penguins must do so delicately and with craftsmanship. Unfortunately this film suffers from bothersome transitions and tone shifts. There are questionable turns in the plot that don't seem to flow properly. You feel as though the writer smacks you down by luring you in with cute euphoria then changing the feel of the film into a grating preach fest about this and that. It is unpleasant and irksome, by technical film standards also. The last moments of the film are sloppily written and ill conceived.The constant push of making Mumble's ""amigos"" persuasively Latino was unnecessary and at times a tad bit racist. My concerns have nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with the blatant 'propaganda' in the film (I for the most part happen to agree); I just question why those themes needed to be there, or more, they were inserted inappropriately. The George Miller's earlier produced flick ""Babe"" could have been slanted toward promoting meat-consuming abstinence. It was however subtle enough so that you may not be bothered by it, as you enjoyed the terrific story. This isn't the case with ""Happy Feet"". I must empathize something. The film directly shoots itself in the foot when attempting to portray all zoos in a bad light. It's extremely ridiculous for a film trying to force a green message upon it's viewers when zoos do indeed aid in penguin conservation. It makes me wonder about the credibility of the creators. This may end up being one of the most destructive films for wildlife since ""Finding Nemo"". Oh the horrendous irony.This film is a sign that producers are trying new ideas, and I encourage that. They are on the right road to creating film that can entertain and be spectacular all the same. It's unfortunate that in this case, it didn't quite reach that mark and succeeds only as a film to marvel in regard to the animation. The film undoubtedly warrants discussion with young children.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wolf in sheep's clothing as a children's movie...,"I was excited to see Happy Feet because it was appeared to be just another joyous, cute, innocent children's movie. Little did I know that it was mis-advertised to disguise the overt political propaganda that was contained within the movie.The movie starts out with a courting ritual between a female penguin and several male penguins, with the female drawn with a shapely form, singing breathy, and dancing suggestively to Prince's ""Kiss"". I was a little taken aback at this start, but was pacified as the movie went on to simply be the joyous and cute movie I originally expected.I was at ease for awhile, until the movie took a serious turn for the worse and veered off course into a big ditch. Instead of just making a children's movies about cute penguins, the writers thought it would be appropriate to use this opportunity to indoctrinate young minds with their own political agendas.The movie got seriously dark for awhile, featuring penguin insanity in a zoo, scenes from arguing members of the United Nations, and penguin disfigurement from a tracking device implanted in it's back.The movie ends on a happy note, but let's suffice it to say that it is not like any sweet innocent children's movie I remember!",,Anonymous,Animation
We do what to the penguins?!,"A movie about dancing and singing penguins. Sounds pretty sweet, the trailer really lured me to the movie. ""I know, size can be daunting. But don't be afraid, I love you... I LOVE YOU."" Made me laugh over and over again.When I finally went to see it, it was fun. It wasn't laughing my ass off fun, but it was constant fun. Not mild parts combined with really loud laughs, just smiles all around. The singing was fun to watch, and this comes from a guy who hates singing in movies. The tap-dancing was fun as well, especially combined with the singing. All in all, a good movie.The best part was that you actually see what we do to penguins (If you donate money to some charity for penguins you can change we to I) since it's from their point of view. 1 thing was horrible though, the ending.

One of the most entertaining films of 2006,"Happy Feet is one of the best animations of the year. It is clever, funny, brilliantly made and has the most outstanding special effects a CGI animation has ever had. The film's animation is so realistic that even the penguins look real.The film is about penguins living in Antarctica in what they call Emperor Land. It is a tradition for the penguins to use their ""heart song"" to find their soul mate by singing.The film's protagonist, Mumble was born tone deaf and cannot sing but has a unique talent for tap dancing, which is looked down upon by the elders of Emperor Land. Mumble is an outcast for his entire childhood and things do not get any better when he becomes a young adult.He ventures across Antarctica, meeting new friends who accept him as he is. He and his ""amigos"" face death-defying obstacles. Soon Mumble discovers that there is a shortage of fish in Emperor Land and he and his friends go on a quest to find out what is really happening.Happy Feet has something for all age groups. It has the cutest penguins you will ever see for the young children, funny scenarios for the older ones, witty and funny one liners for the teenagers and music for the older generation.Happy Feet is one of the best films of the year and deserves a lot of praise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dancing and Singing on Thin Ice.,"From those who brought us ""Mad Max"" and ""Babe"" comes ""Happy Feet"", one of the more interesting but underwhelming accomplishments of the past cinematic campaign of 2006. A young penguin who seems out of place due to his inability to sing and blend in with his contemporaries becomes an outcast in spite of his gift to dance in unique tap motions. This is the set-up for a journey that does not only affect the primary character, but ultimately all others around him as it soon becomes clear (too blatantly) that ""Happy Feet"" has a lot deeper message than other computer-generated animated features of the type. Uneven and manipulative production is second-to-none in terms of the elements of story-telling and technical film-making, but it tries to do too much with what it has going for it and ultimately nearly falls through very thin ice. Still a good film, but not what I expected when I bought my ticket. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Animation
As Fuzzy Brained As Its Characters,"This film was greatly disappointing to me and my wife, and we are both HUGE fans of great animation. It seems like the story board had to have been created by committee, as though one of those faux pitch websites had been used.Most of the characters are stereotypes, with all but one of the main characters of strength being male. The film starts as an ugly duckling type story then turns into a pro-ecology one. It couldn't seem to make up its mind what it wanted to be. Ultimately, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I just thought it was a poor piece of storytelling, which, for me, is first and foremost in any film.The animation was certainly very good for CGI, with some stunning art direction. The film had been conceived originally as one to be released in 3D, and you can see by the framing of many shots the evidence for that. The studio ultimately decided it would be too expensive to release that way after all was said and done. Perhaps it will be released in that format to the theaters at some point in the future.Aside from some pop culture film references near the end, this is not a multi-layered film that adults will get into as well as kids the way even Disney, at its best, can do (think of ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" for recent vintage films.).This film is a failure in my eyes. Too bad.If you need to rent a family picture, stick with the ""Toy Story"" movies, the ""Princess Monanoke"" (sp?) or even the stunning (but for older kids and adults) ""Pan's Labyrinth"".",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny,Emotional&Charismatic","Those are the three words to sum this up.2006 was a big year for animations.We had Cars, Ice Age2, Monster House, Over The Hedge to name a few that stood out from the pack. Another animation joining this group is Happy Feet. With stellar casting voices such as Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams and Hugo Weaving, this was already an expected success.And they deliver.Packed with a story and some utterly mind blowing animations, Happy Feet has got it all for a hit. I wont be surprised if it gets an Academy Award nod. With a unique plot(penguins have heart songs) we venture into the world of the Antarctic residents. And so unfolds the story of Mumble, considered an outcast by his peers and the source of ill luck by the wise.Driven away by his fellow penguins, Mumble ventures out to find out the real cause of shortage of food, and finds out the reason.Aliens(as in humans).He is taken to captivity but somehow is able to communicate via his feet.The same reason for which he is driven away from his homeland.When he returns back, he brings with himself all glory and joys with unlimited food.Happy Feet in its essence turns out to be a musical.What do you expect, if penguins are supposed to have heart songs ?? But even through the musical story unfolds with the epic journey of Mumble Happy Feet. Nicole Kidman, Elijah Wood and Robin Williams are superb in their respective character voices. Comic relief of the ghettoized little penguins are a laugh.But all in all this is one movie which must not be missed. True it is a centrally focused movie. Only a few characters remain in focus, not much is available for the rest. But even then the characters play it out nicely for Elijah to punch it out.The animation is groundbreaking. Nothing like I've ever seen previously. The sliding sequences and the abandoned factory sequence is just unbelievable. The story as I said was good, actors were good, animation was good. So all in all 8/10 !!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Thanks, but no thanks.","Clearly the CG techniques are still improving. The particle animation is very nice, textures are great, procedural whatever is great too.Oh. Don't forget all the nice music. We all know the songs in this movie. Yes we do!The whole problem is technique doesn't make a movie and well known songs don't make a movie. If the story isn't interesting the movie just isn't interesting.Clearly we're well on the way to really realistic CG, but we're still on our way. There is a lot more to learn. In LOTR we've seen mass character animation (with a nice result) but mass penguin-scenes just aren't interesting.And Afro-American penguins and Latino penguins. Come on. A Ramon penguin? Ramon. I think WARM, I think palm trees. I don't think Antarctica. It doesn't work. It just doesn't.My conclusion: quite nice on one hand. A terrible failure on the other. The feeling of the failure remains. I'm sorry...Actually... I'm not.For CG: see Lord of the Rings. For dance: see Lord of the dance. Don't see this movie.

amazing tapping,"I have to comment on the incredible tapping in this movie. Finally a great movie with some tapping in it. Savion Glover choreographed this movie beautifully (he's a genius).

Great effects overall. Amazing music too.This movie has great effects and a wonderful story. Mumble is an extremely lovable character. Packed full of wonderful actors and actresses. Everybody does an amazing job. The movie is a real feel good film. Full of fun music, singing, and of course tapping. It makes you want to get up and dance along.There is also a religious and environmental undertone, but most importantly an acceptance of those who are different.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Didn't make my feet happy,Happy Feet the winner of the Academy award for best animated film didn't make my feet happy. It started cute but soon became very boring. I hope Savion Glover like dancing for the CGI animation but it didn't go over very well since you couldn't really see the penguin's feet. Robin Williams probably had a good time but the longer the movie went the less funny these characters became. Especially when the whole environmental theme kicked in. The movie tried to do too much. They should have stuck to a cute story about accepting each others differences and not veered off into the whole fishing fiasco. I would have like the film better if the dancing and gone on longer and the talking had been shorter. 3/10,3.0,Anonymous,Animation
its not THAT sexual,"Seriously, for all those people who think this movie is filled with sexual innuendo...look at every other Disney movie.

Shrek is a blast, and one of the funniest movies, but its all full of sex. i'm not saying its OK but this is the way movies are these days, I'm just saying that as far as Happy Feet goes, its better that kids get their sexual innuendos from a penguin who is singing songs and tap dancing than they do other places...which trust me..they will. i agree the ending was forced, no one goes to the movies to get preached to about the environment, but overall, it carried a good message, and it was a beautiful and HILARIOUS film.",,Anonymous,Animation

Lots of Penguins = 1 big Turkey,"This film didn't seem to know whether it was an 'Ugly Duckling' movie, a rant against religious doctrine, or an eco warning, and it ended up being a mess.

Even Robin Williams couldn't rescue this one.The animation I have to say was the best yet, but as George Lucas discovered the ability to render individual eyelashes does not a movie make.

Cute movie,"Great movie that the whole family can go see. Not only does it captivate the minds of children but it also amuses adults with the humor. The only detail parents may want to know for small children is that there are a couple parts with action that may scare them. Robin Williams is hilarious in this movie, especially since he plays three different characters throughout the whole thing. Even without the humor the movie has a great underlying message concerning the debris thrown into the oceans that endangers animals along with the depleting food supply of some animals due to human society. Kudos to all the actors/actresses starring in this movie.Definitely a must see movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Horrible!,"The best thing you can say about this is the penguins are cute.Now like most other movies for kids, this is telling kids basically to be environmentalists. It slips in it's totally liberal opinions on pollution, witch, being a conservative, I found painful to watch. And then it gives the message to kids that we should all save the world from pollution. The reason this disturbs me is because that should be a decision the child makes, not just what the media has programmed into their brain. And then, a child shouldn't even be involved politically because they are way too young to understand anything they are told. They just believe almost anything you tell them.The plot is very cheesy. But then, of course, this movie is aimed at younger audiences, so that's not a surprise..I'm giving this 2 stars because it's wicked cute, not because of the animation, plot, characters and moral.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

It dragged a little bit, sort of a rarity for an animated film, but for the most part you felt connected to the characters. I'm a sucker for films with messages and when the film finally arrived at its own, I felt it did a fine job with it.All that being said, it's a fun film...the music and dancing is not at all esoterically Fantasia-like.

Tap your way into happiness with 'Happy Feet': a visually stunning and inspiring animated film,"""Happy Feet"" is a heartwarming and visually stunning animated film that tells the story of Mumble, a penguin who can't sing but can tap dance like a pro.

The Agenda Got in the Way,"From the previews, this film looked adorable. As soon as I had a break from graduate work, I dragged my best friend to go see this. We anticipated a cute, possibly-sappy ""kids'"" film. What we saw on the screen shocked and even insulted us.To begin with, we were very surprised at how sexual some of the content was. For an adult film, this would be tame, but for a kids' film?! The song line about wanting someone's body was certainly not something I would want my niece hearing. Yes, many kids may not pick up on the sexual overtones, but some kids happen to be more observant. Why was it even necessary? It certainly didn't help the film any. I thought it looked rather trashy.The agenda of this film is what bothered both my friend and I the most. For one thing, we hated the cruel portrayal of Christians. You can bet that if the film unfairly portrayed people of a certain race, there would be theaters refusing to play it. Yet Christians are considered fair game. Making a point against prejudice is fine. I would in fact applaud a film making that point. Doing so by poking fun at a religion (any religion, not just Christianity) is tasteless and should not be tolerated.The second part of the agenda, the ""saving the environment"" part, was handled wrong. I have nothing against doing a film about the very real need to protect the environment. It's an excellent idea to motivate people while they're young. However, that theme interfered with the storyline and thus was far less effective than it could have been. It felt to me like the film was trying to accomplish far too much in a single film. This negatively affected the flow of the film.Overall, I would not recommend the film, especially for families with children. Save yourself the money and rent a good classic instead.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

For almost 80% of the movie nobody knows what is going on and where it should go. The conclusion is super artificial and being honest ruins completely the movie.

My faith in CGI animated films has been restored!,"I have to admit I didn't know what to expect before I saw this film. This year, the only other CGI-animated film I enjoyed was Flushed Away (which is partly because I grew up watching the Wallace and Gromit series and I love Chicken Run, but also because it was genuinely entertaining). As the older sister of a seven-year-old girl and a fan of CGI-animated films since Toy Story came out, I have seen my fair share of CGI-animated films... and this was not the year for CGI-animated movies until Happy Feet came out.Sure, Flushed Away was enjoyable and fun to watch, but what Happy Feet has that no other CGI-animated film released this year has is the classic formula for an enjoyable family film. The makers of Happy Feet even added the formula for an enjoyable animated musical, something long missing in animated films.Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy, Robin Williams, and Elijah Wood star in this animated gem, and Jackman, Kidman, Murphy, and Williams provide their own beautiful singing voices. The casting couldn't be more perfect, and the characters couldn't be more lovable. Who doesn't find an adelie penguin (voiced by Williams), belting at the top of his lungs, ""Lo hice myyyyyyyyyy wayyyyyyy!"" adorable and entertaining? Nine out of ten- go out and see it today. You won't be disappointed.P.S., Why are people saying my comment is not useful? I think I did a pretty good job explaining why this movie is worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
