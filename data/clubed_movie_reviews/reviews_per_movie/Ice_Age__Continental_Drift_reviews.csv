Sometimes hilarious yet disappointing ...,"For years I have been a huge fan of the Ice Age series and had been expecting this new movie for months! Needless to say I was counting the days until the release of the movie and the hilarious teasers were really making the waiting difficult ...I saw it tonight and have to admit that I feel really disappointed ... Was I expecting too much ? We were a group of young adults who grew up with the movies, or at least liked them a lot and we felt let down. The storyline feels a little weak, I thought there would be a lot of adventure and action, as in the 3 previous ones where you don't see how time flies ... This one, if not boring, is too simple, not to mention incredibly predictable. There is no twists and turns. When you think about the first episode, yes, you realize how poor the scenario is in this new one.I admit there's been a real effort to create an original story that might bring the characters in another world and make them live another adventure, different from the previous ones. I think this part is a total failure. Not to mention the ""song"" they put in the movie, it was nothing but ridiculous and irrelevant, especially for a movie series as famous as Ice Age. I thought it was unnecessary.But since I laughed a few times and feel really bad about writing such a ""negative"" review, I have to admit that some of the scenes were absolutely hilarious and the characters have been kept as funny as they used to be, especially Sid (and his incredible grandmother). It's just a pity that the funny parts are so negligible ... You smile a lot, you laugh sometimes, but certainly not during the whole movie.Maybe I am too old to appreciate this movie as I should have, as I'm sure the kids will love it and the movie will have a lot of success this summer. I don't wish it the contrary, I just watched it with my not-so-kid-anymore-but-very-nostalgic-eyes and went out of the theater with the feeling that something from before was clearly missing ...",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"it was fun, but not the best of the series","Ice Age: Continental Drift is funny, and i had fun watching it and looked forward to seeing what this weird herd is up to now.It is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series and the seventh CG production of Blue Sky Studios and the first sequel not to be directed by Carlos Saldanha who will be directing RIO part 2.What I love must about this flick is the introduction of a partner for Diego; a white tiger lady is added ladies and gentlemen. The movie also has the whole fun of the old clichés, which I seem not to be tired of seeing. It also showcases cool CG effect; I loved the water effect most.The plot was educational (as long as you know it is bogus) due to Scrat's (Squirrel) hunt for acorns he triggers the break-up of the world continent into the continents as we know them today, which cause Manny to lose his family.Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure to find his family, after their continent is set adrift. Using an iceberg as a ship, they encounter sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore a new world, and learn why it is good to be part of a family herd, than being part of a group where one person leads and other follow.Well, the new directors weren't that bad, as the movie did have some fun screenplays and events that you will be thrilled to see. As we watch this creatures move from the Ice Age to the present age the pictures tell stories that are kinda informative and entertaining.Hey! I must have missed that geography class when they taught that Scrat the squirrel created the whole world.Although this is not the best addition to the Ice Age series it was fun to watch. And the movie kinda opens doors to new additional sequels.But I hope Blue Sky won't bother making any more.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I enjoyed it,"Attended a packed preview screening yesterday (the film opens here next Thursday)with my wife and 6 year old daughter and must say that if you liked the previous Ice Ages then this one will not disappoint. Kids loved it and plenty there for the adults to relate to and enjoy as well. Animation quality(in 2D)was top notch and story line was good and with plenty of humour and action a plenty. A few of the subplots were educational as well as exploring the values of friendship,loyalty and the like which is probably standard fare for these types of films. As a 47 year old bloke I enjoyed it and would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone but especially for the target audience of young families you can't go wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun for the whole family.,"Although not regarded in the same league as the Pixar and Disney output, the initial three Ice Age instalments collected over $2bn at the worldwide box office. (Rather surprisingly, that's $100m more than the Toy Story trilogy earned.) Posting figures as huge as that means we get treated to another adventure with mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), sabre-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and silly sloth Sid (John Leguizamo); this time with pirates. Like each episode before it, Ice Age 4 prides itself in offering up goofy laughs and goofier characters, with the ragtag bunch of pirates – led by Peter Dinklage's droll Captain Gutt and assisted by Nick Frost's uproarious elephant seal Flynn – the source of much joy. The old gang don't dissatisfy either: Sid is the standout as usual but Diego gets more laughs than normal and Scrat's little journey is ever-amusing. The serious Manny is still, well, the serious Manny, but you can't win them all. The bucket load of action remains too, however nothing here tops the dinosaur rumbling in part three. Continental Drift is gratifying escapism for the whole family that, despite being the fourth outing for these prehistoric creatures, shows few signs of letting up.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
As Expected,"Ice Age: Continental Drift – CATCH IT (B+) What we can say about Ice Age, love it or hate it you will go and watch these crazy fun animals surviving the Ica Age. The first movie was excellent but after that we all know what to expect from Ice Age franchise. And let's be honest so far they have delivered their best. The story may not be that refreshing or something extraordinary but they do manage to make us laugh and involve in their adventures.The voices by Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Peter Dinklage, Wanda Sykes, Heather Morris, Drake and Nicki Minaj.In the end, I enjoyed Ice Age 4 but just like the previous installment in the end it was little too loud but hey it's a kid's movie so I think it OK.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I really like the pirate addition,"Scrat is at it again. He falls to the center of the earth. As he chase the acorn, he starts rotating the core setting the continents to drift. Manny is overprotective of Peaches as she falls for Ethan. Sid's family accidentally runs into him and dumps Granny with him. Manny, Sid, Diego and Granny get separated from Ellie, Peaches, and Louis when the continents separate. Manny and the gang get captured by pirate Captain Gutt and his crew on his iceberg ship.Sure it doesn't make sense but I love the addition of the pirates. This is not a franchise that needs to be scientifically correct. The pirates are a fun added bonus in what could have been just another Ice Age road trip. It's like the cast of Ice Age gets thrown into a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. It's silly. It's rip roaring fun for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Keeps the series going strong!,"Fantastic film! As a fan of the series, i was a bit skeptical that they were taking it too far however, if this film is any indication, the series is as strong as ever! You feel comfortable returning to the characters for another adventure and i don't see fans of the series being disappointed. The film is fast and fun and carries excellent messages of the importance of family and the importance of being yourself. A bunch of new characters freshen up the film, with a band of pirates, including a love interest for Diego and Sid is accompanied by his grandmother who is humorously oblivious to the dangerous situations the characters get into. Scrat also gets plenty of time chasing his elusive acorn, with the footage that was released as part of advertisements (Scrat's Continental Crack-Up)comprising in the film. However, there is also a hilarious scene at the end where he finally reaches the treasure island that the map on the acorn (seen in the advertisements) leads to.A great, fun, family film that boasts crisp and detailed animation that actually makes great use of 3D. Definitely recommended!*The short film that precedes the film, 'The Longest Daycare'- a Simpsons short, is a pleasant addition to the main film. It is a silent short that features Maggie Simpson and Baby Gerald, where Maggie tries to save a butterfly from the daycare from the clutches of the baby. It is clever and fun and it is great to see more films having original shorts like Pixar's fantastic ones.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age 4-A worthy sequel,"I loved Ice Age the first one to death when I first watched it. I own it and every once and awhile I go to my DVD cupboard and pick it up and watch it. I disliked the sequel, Ice Age: Meltdown. The second sequel i hated too. They added new characters and I missed the chemistry and the funny lines that happened between just Sid the sloth, Manny and Diego the sabre tooth tiger. They added new characters which were sometimes funny but I missed the same three from the first one. In this third sequel the team must have realized this by splitting Sid, Manny and Diego with Sid's funny, odd grandma sloth away from the others on a race to get back to the herd and to get rid of these pirates. The pirates are entertaining as ever and very funny, the monkey played by Peter Dinklage is really good and the main plot flies along at a terrific pace. The jokes are fresh (most of them) and funny and you can't help liking this film. The side plots can get a bit cliché but I ignored them.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Wonderful Adventure,"When Scrat accidentally provokes a continental cataclysm with storm, Manny is separated from Ellie and Peaches in an iceberg with Diego, Sid and Granny but he promises that he will find a way to return home.While crossing the ocean, they are captured by the cruel pirate Captain Gutt and his crew. However they escape and Manny plots a plan to steal Captain Gutt's ship and return to his homeland in a dangerous voyage through the sea. But the cruel pirates seek revenge against Manny and his family and friends.""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is another wonderful adventure of Manny, Diego and Sid and their family and friends. I love this franchise that support the funny plots in positive values such as love, family, friendship and loyalty that seem to be forgotten in the present days of worldwide intolerance, selfishness and corruption. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Era do Gelo 4"" (""The Ice Age 4"")",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good entry in the series, but not a terrific movie","Ice Age: Continental Drift is the fourth installment in the Ice Age series, which was started a decade ago by FOX when they tried their hand at animation again after Titan A.E. became a box office bomb. The series follows a group of quite different prehistoric animals and the plot that it follows has been so far a formulaic ""go from point A to B"" story.As the title suggests, Ice Age 4's plot revolves around the separation of continents. The herd is separated and while the original trio goes into an adventure overseas, the ""half opossum, half mammoth"" family tries to reach a rock bridge to meet up there. The film's animation is fantastic (you could hardly say a mainstream animated movie doesn't have terrific CGI) and backgrounds and water effects are beautiful, but the movie's storytelling is too fast paced and there are too many characters for them to develop while the movie lasts.If the series is too formulaic what is the appeal of this movie? For anyone who has seen the whole series, you'll be happy to know Diego meets a female saber-tooth on the way and Sid is reunited with his sloth family. Amongst the new characters are a crew of pirates that capture the trio while they explore the ocean and become the main antagonists of the film.The movie is overall quite worth it to watch with your family, but even the third one (which I didn't like a lot) had a better paced storytelling. New characters, in my opinion, don't really display a lot of personality traits other than Granny Sloth, but it is quite the enjoyable flick I would watch a few times on theaters.The 3D, by the way, is not really worth it and the movie doesn't make use of it correctly. There were some moments when the background looked it was over the characters and that almost gave me a head ache. If you're taking your family to watch the movie don't waste your money on 3D.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining, but not so much as before","I have always liked the Ice Age series up to the third one. In fact, this is the first time that I thought I would watch it in theater rather than getting a DVD later. The 3D was spectacular in terms of visual appearance, but I would not rate it as good as the previous Ice Age movies.The plot during this adventure is short and simple. There's no surprises, and everything is pretty much along the line of a typical friendship/family/hero type story. The whole story took place in 3, 4 ""in-movie"" days, much shorter than the previous ones which had a constant string of events. By the end of this movie, I couldn't believe the story's over. Not a lot happened before the villains are apprehended and the world returns to peace and harmony, as in any of the Ice Age movies. However, this probably means their target audience are younger than the ones before. I guess this is the biggest drag down for fans who have been watching since the first one.They also did a sub-par job in the music. Despite having no improvement in quality, they recycled music from the second movie in the series, ""the Meltdown"". I bought the soundtracks after watching that movie thinking it was spectacular. After listening to it for years now, I could virtually name the tracks as they come up in the Continental Drift. From the title sequence to the Ending, pretty much everything without a vocal voice was identical to something I've heard before. It feels like they just copied and pasted from before - The soundtracks are awesome, but when it's used once too many, it just doesn't have the same impact anymore.I still gave this movie a 6 because of, well, what Fox and Blue Sky has always been best at. The vivid colors and the ""just right"" graphical presentation is sure a feast on the eyes. And don't forget about Scrat, who's never involved but just somehow miraculously leads the story. This movie is definitely great for fun, there are many (supposedly deliberate) punch lines. Although some puns fail when I go ""huh? that's lame"", I can feel that they are trying to make it as funny as possible. I'd say that they are making this movie more like a feature-length, high quality TV cartoon special rather than a real theatrical movie. There's just not that much thrill to it.The addition of the new characters seems only to provide a villain to the storyline. There doesn't seem to be much careful consideration - from what I see, it's perfectly fine to replace any of them with another animal or personality and the story stays valid. The characters' specialties just do not come together and contribute to the story, another reason why it feels like the story was written without the context of the movie. Not even the prolonged characters like Manny, Diego, Sid and Peaches.Bottom line: This movie is mediocre. It could do as a really nice cartoon, but it lacks the punch in the planning.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Influence of the squirrel on the formation of continents,"""Two sloths, a mammoth and a saber... You guys are like a start of a bad joke.""I'm not sure if it is my current depression speaking, or maybe I'm just tired of this franchise, but it seems to me that it slowly recedes. Visually, the film is superbly done, it is interesting and cute and holds the attention, but every next sequel is less funny than the previous, and this time not once have I laughed out loud. Still, I can not point on any other flaws, so I'll rate it7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A flawed but fun addition to the series,"It has been ten years since we saw our Sub-Zero Heros for the first time, and as a long-term Ice Age fan, I have experienced some ups and downs with the series. The first two movies I have really adored, especially the second one for its relaxed story and beautiful animation. But by the time they jumped the shark with the dumb addition of dinosaurs in the third film and the incoherent Christmas special (in which Christmas didn't exist), this made me loose faith in the series. Despite low expectations for this latest addition, I did opt to attend a 3D screening and I was quite surprised about how much fun I had. While Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is quiet enjoyable, its heavily flawed too.This episode of the highly successful series see's Manny, Diego and Sid separated from the others on a sheet of ice after Scrat the saber-tooth squirrel accidentally causes Pangaea to break up with his acorn (which you've probably seen earlier in Scrat's Continental Crack-up). On the way, they find Sid's granny as a stowaway, discover a new land and come across a bunch of pirates in which Diego falls in love with one of them; a female saber-tooth called Shira. Meanwhile back at home Manny's teenage daughter Peaches finds herself in a relationship conflict with a mammoth named Ethan and a mole hog called Louis, while at the same time having to avoid the disaster caused by Scrat.Phew! At first impression, this seems like a lot of story to get through in a 94 minute movie. However, the storytelling is all played smoothly, if predictably, but also suffers from a number of unexplained story elements like where did the pirates come from and why they became pirates in the first place. The biggest plot hole has to be the fact that the Pangaea continent Scrat splits up is entirely out of continuity with the Ice Age period since this was meant to happen millions of years prior. Did they makers even do research on this? Couldn't it have just been an simpler approach instead? I found many parts of the film to feel borrowed or rehashed from other animated films, including previous Ice Age films, and with the large amount of story, a few elements aren't focused deep enough including Diego and Shira's relationship.Despite these issues however, here is a lot to like in this entry. As you would expect from Blue Sky, the animation is very colourful and fluid, the most impressive elements having to be the sea storms as they are well-detailed and thrilling to watch, but it has a been-there-done-that feeling since we are all familiar with the characters and setting. Plus the movie has good use of 3D which isn't too distracting or barely noticeable and I soon forgot that I was wearing the glasses. The humor in this one is pretty hit-and-miss, but when it hits, its quite funny. With the old characters retaining their personalities (which is faithful to them), there's a lot of new characters to freshen things up. While I found Sid's granny a bit annoying at times, I did particularly enjoy Peter Dinklage's evil performance as Captain Gutt as with the other pirates. However my two person favorites were Peaches and Louis because of their character development and nice (if slightly clichéd) friendship, which is something I could relate to, and I thought Josh Gad was a good choice for Louis' sweet and caring personality.So overall, I'd have to say that Ice Age 4 was a pretty fun ride for me and was much better than I expected despite its problems. Is it great? Well I can't say its as amazing as the first two, but at least its a bit better than the third. I'm glad that I saw it, but I think the series just doesn't feel the same as it was back in 2002. It seems to be missing the nostalgia and charm that the first movie had. And with that said, I suggest its best for Fox to end this saga here instead of continuing to milk and worsen the beloved series. A fifth film is just unnecessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation and some nice characters, but perhaps a sequel too far","I really liked the first Ice Age film, enjoyed the second but was mixed on the third. I loved Mammoth Christmas and Continental Crack-Up though. I do consider Ice Age: Continental Drift the weakest of the series with the sense that it was a sequel too far and that the franchise was flagging. However it is not a bad movie. The animation is absolutely great, the scenery is just gorgeous and the colours very vibrant. The characters are also modelled very well. The music score is beautiful and rousing on the whole, there are a couple of amusing moments- the beginning is a riot- and there are some nice characters. Scrat continues to steal every scene he's in and Sid and Granny are a real delight. Captain Gutt is a nice addition also. The voice actors do fine jobs, Peter Dinklage is deliciously evil, Ray Romano and Dennis Leary are just as strong and John Leguizamo is hilarious. Conversely, the story is weak on the whole, thin on the ground and sometimes drags, while the script lacks wit and freshness. Peaches I didn't care for as a character either, coming across as stereotypical and bratty. Last but not least, the musical number, not only was it awfully written with a rushed melody and unfunny lyrics but there was absolutely no need for it to be there in the first place. Overall, not bad but didn't wow me. I do think they should stop here before the standard gets worse. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Keeps getting better!,"Obviously, the original can never be touched. That being said, people tend to think that the sequels get worse. Nowadays, they aren't stopping at three and Ice Age is no exception. Granted, the released sequels aren't necessarily better, but they aren't bad! As long as you don't take them too seriously, like most people on here do, you can have fun with it and just enjoy the ride. Of the sequels, I enjoyed this one the most. I thought the plot was reasonably realistic and I enjoyed the characters, new and old. The thing that made me giddy with excitement was realizing the captain was played by Peter Dinklage! I am a huge fan of him, being a fan of Game of Thrones, and he played a fantastic villain. In contrast, I am not a fan of Jennifer Lopez by any means and I liked her character as well...that may or may not have anything to do with the fact that I really like white tigers.It's got laughs, great characters, warm moments, life lessons, and even some mythical creatures! And we get to see a bit more of Scrat...and who doesn't love that silly little squirrel thing? I think this sequel has topped 2 & 3 and is definitely worth watching!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very funny and entertaining.,"ICE AGE 4: CONTINENTAL DRIFTI was fully expecting this to get old now. I thought part 3 started to slip into the monotonous but this pulled it back. I thought it was very funny and really good.The story is about Manny and his friends. They get separated from Ellie and have to find their way back to his family as the planet goes through a complete meltdown.The original voice cast members return as their characters Ray Romano as Manny, John Leguizamo as Sid & Denis Leary as Diego.There were a few new characters too. I loved the pirates that kidnapped them all. They were really funny and they fit into the film really well. You also get to meet Sid's granny. She was hilarious. She has not teeth and watching her to try and eat some fruit is so funny.Other voices were provided by Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Peter Dinklage, Wanda Sykes, Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Nick Frost, Alan Tudyk & Nicki Minaj.As always though, the funniest character was Scrat. He is such a great character. I am surprised there is not a spin off movie yet just set on him. He is and always has been the star of the movies. Besides without Scrat, there would be no movie he causes all the mess in the first place.The film is full of action and adventure, which is what you want when watching a family film. The kids will love this. I watched it with a load of adults but I will put it on again for my daughter as she loved the other 3.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very entertaining and made the Ice Age films more appealing again but I still hope they don't make any more as I don't want it to get stale.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Drifting Further Away From The Charm Of The Original,"The Ice Age series is one of the more endearing animated franchise from the past decade. The first was a heartwarming and genuinely funny adventure taking place during the time of mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and clumsy sloths. The first sequel lost a lot of that magic, but Dawn of the Dinosaurs did do some fresh things with the series. However, generally, over time, the films have gained plenty of characters, but lost most of its charm. The fourth in the series, Continental Drift, is the least exciting, least funny, and cheapest of the bunch. That's not to say that Ice Age 4 doesn't have its moments: the main characters still have their appeal and there are a few good laughs, but it is clear that the Ice Age train is running out of steam here.Continental Drift kicks off with the lovable rodent Scrat causing the continents to drift apart. The trio of Manny, Diego, and Sid are soon embarking on an adventure adrift on the open sea. They meet up with pirates (and a whole collection of new characters) and try to find their way home. The plots of the Ice Age films have gotten simpler as they go, instead relying on introducing as many new characters as possible.The problem with Ice Age 4 is that none of the new characters are memorable, funny, or charming. The effort just seems to be down here. Ray Romano, Dennis Leary, and John Leguizamo, still manage to breath some life into the picture, but the passion is clearly not there like it was in 2002. The animation is also less-than-stellar. Ice Age Continental Drift could be a TV movie and I wouldn't know the difference. It's just cheap.There are some moments of wit and excitement in Ice Age 4, but on the whole, it is an exercise in diminishing returns. Most of the passion and effort of the series is gone, leading to a generic and, dare I say, boring animated adventure. Look elsewhere for family fun.42/100",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still Strong After All These Years!,"Since the first Ice Age debuted in 2002, there now have been three sequels with this film, Continental Drift being the third one. Despite the poor reviews, I enjoyed this film. I have been a fan of the series since it originally came out and while not having the magic of the first film, it still has the charms, zany characters, themes of friendship/family, good animation, and the comedy that we have come to love from Manny, Sid, and Diego.This film reunites our favorite heroes as the land they know begins to break up and create problems for everyone. Manny and the gang are separated from his wife and daughter and while trying to get back to them, they are captured by a group of pirates bent on making their lives miserable.This voice cast still boasts an impeccable voice cast led by our favorites: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo. Queen Latifah does solid voice work as well. On the other hand, Nicky Minaj was in this movie and all I can say is....ugh.Overall, Ice Age: Continental Drift is still an entertaining adventure even though I fear it may be losing some mojo. Children will definitely enjoy this and so will fans of the series. It has crisp animation, silly comedy, and also a few good songs such as that one called, ""We Are Family."" That is a perfect title for a film that relies on friendship and family bonding. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Chix Chat on Film Review: Ice Age with increased star power..,"Ice Age Continental Drift is the fourth film in this animated series that follows the migration of a group of unlikely friends across continents as their lives evolve. Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) now have to contend with a teenage Peaches (Keke Palmer) and just about everything surrounding that relationship and her growth was so cliché. Any and every teenage coming of age story ever written, acted out in a play or on screen was covered in one-liners like 'just be yourself', which we know isn't possible since teenagers typically don't know who they are. This story introduced a number of new characters which most of which we will likely see in the next installment. With the whole teenage scenario came Ethan (Drake) the object of Peaches affection. We finally get a glimpse into the sloth family and have a better understanding of the reason Sid's (John Leguizamo) a sloth apart, this story brought another new character his Granny (Wanda Sykes). As things get adventurous we encounter another group of unlikely companions led by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) a primate who is just mean for no apparent reason, but his crew included Shira (Jennifer Lopez), who comes with the best storyline. My favorite character of them all for whatever reason is and has always been Diego (Dennis Leary) so to see in the trailers that a female saber is now in the picture led me to hope that he would finally meet his match. As always the animation looks great, even though the stories are very elementary. I tried to stay interested by calling upon my inner child during the viewing but at one point almost dozed off. This could have something to do with just returning home from a Mississippi Gulf vacation that included late nights, but I digress. This film targets young children and during the screening the physical comedy garnered the desired reaction, laughter. There was an entire Ewok adventure that caused some ooos for cuteness, and there was a slightly frightening siren segment that caused some ahhs. The whole opening segment featuring Scrat chasing that nut was so absurd that I wanted to leave but figured that I should stay since those episodes would just be sprinkled throughout the film and are not the entirety of the story. I was not impressed by much of anything in this film, but as a summer release for kids and based on the sounds in the theater it clearly worked for them, for that reason I give it an amber light.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should have stopped at 3,"Question: How many top entertainers does it take to make an animated film? Answer: Apparently a whole slew of them. I guess the directors of this film thought that the more celebrities, the better the film would be. Not!! But I guess it did make for a pretty decent paycheck. Compared to other animated films of the summer, this one lacks in originality and freshness. I think the lessons that were trying to be conveyed in this film was a little too complicated for the very young crowd that was in the theater with me. The parts of the film that got the most laughs were every time the spotlight was put on Scrat (Chris Wedge). Even in the Ice Age predecessors, he was always the funniest. Maybe it is time for Scrat to get his own film. The young audience did not need dialog they just wanted to laugh. The other character that drew a lot of giggles was Sid (John Leguizamo). Sid along with Granny (Wanda Sykes) was a comedic match made in heaven. I saw an interview that Wanda did and initially she wanted to change her voice to sound older, but the director told her that her voice was perfect for the part. I think that she got a chuckle out of that. I do want to mention Peter Dinklage (Captain Gutt). He seems to be getting a lot of attention since he won a SAG and an Oscar for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones. I have to say that by the end of the film I grew a little weary of Captain Gutt. He was really starting to get on my last nerve. Peaches (Keke Palmer) was a typical teenager that had to deal with peer pressure, parental rules and misguided decision making. The hate/love relationship that built between Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) did manage to give the film a little extra punch, but not much. The film wasn't all bad. There were a few laughs; however this franchise has been saturated. I definitely think that it is time to put this one to bed. I think that very young viewers will appreciate the animation and maybe pre-teens will get the message, but this film was not designed to do both. All that being said, I am going to have to give this film a mammoth amber light.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly good!,"Took my little girl at the weekend, expecting to get a decent kip whilst lounging in the premier seats and couldn't have got it more wrong! A really good sequel and the Ice Age saga doesn't seem to have got complacent or boring as they've progressed when other sequels have a habit of getting quite dull and tedious by now! Really hope Ice Age now STOP at number 4, before they do become boring and lose their appeal! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone of any age and will definitely be buying this when its released on DVD and also revisiting the old ones before then, although i might have to also purchase a 3D TV to go with it!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The franchise's most action-packed instalment yet, this is a fast-paced adventure packed with thrills and laughs- and of course Scrat","You can't blame franchise newcomers Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier for sticking with formula- after all, the past three entries have grown increasingly successful on the back of a similar template. So fans of the prehistoric toon series will be comforted to know that once more, the unlikely trio of Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the tiger are forced to rely on each other as some cataclysmic event forces them to migrate from their homely habitats for safer territory. And oh yes, there's always Scrat's pursuit of his prized acorn thrown in for good measure.In fact, from the occasional diversion, Scrat's ceaseless quest now sets in motion the chain of events in the story- though keener audiences might recognise the familiarity of this sequence with that of 'Scrat's Continental Crack-up', a short which Fox attached to 'Gulliver's Travels' back in 2010. Nonetheless, it's amusing all the same, and culminates in the separation of Pangaea, the huge land mass from which the various continents originated from. No thanks to Scrat, Manny gets separated from his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), and spend the rest of the movie trying to get back to them.It's by far their most action-packed adventure yet- even more so than their previous encounter with the dinosaurs- and therefore fully poised to exploit the possibilities offered by 3D. Indeed those hesitant at shelling out the extra bucks for the additional dimension will find this a worthy investment, as directors Martino and Thurmeier are not shy to turn their adventure into a glorified roller-coaster ride- especially in the numerous POV shots when one character or another slides across the ice, glides down the glaciers and flies through the air. Scoff at the cheap thrills if you must, but there's no denying that it makes for great fun particularly for the kids.To get into action mode, recurrent series writer Michael Berg and his newbie partner Jason Fuchs (working from a story by Berg and Lori Forte) create an irascible villain in the form of mangy ape Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage)- the leader of a motley band of pirates including an elephant seal named Mr Flynn (Nick Frost) and a white sabre-toothed tiger named Shira (Jennifer Lopez). While Diego gets a love interest in Shira, Manny gets to show off his masculine side with a mano-a-mano fight against Gutt, whose paths he inadvertently cross when he destroys the latter's ship-berg (that's the best name we could come up with for their icebergs turned ships) and then makes off with the latter's replacement.Alongside the main act of Manny and Gutt, other characters also get their own stories- Sid is visited by his cantankerous granny (Wanda Sykes) similarly abandoned by his family; and Peaches distances herself from her best friend Louis (Josh Gad) in an attempt to keep up with the in-crowd (voiced in celebrity cameos by Drake, Nicki Minaj and Glee cheerleader Heather Morris) while going against the expressed wishes of her overprotective father Manny. It all comes to a neat closure of course, and even though none of these story arcs are inventive, they at least succeed in keeping the comic energy up throughout the movie.And certainly, both Martino and Thurmeier deserve credit for sustaining a brisk snappy pace all the way, avoiding the stretches of dull that plagued the first two 'Ice Age' films. More than any of the previous instalments, this fourth entry confidently rests on the charms of its lead characters Manny, Sid and Diego and less on the zaniness of Scrat. It's a surest sign yet that the franchise is truly coming into its own, further exemplified by the leaps and bounds by which Fox's Blue Sky Studios has improved its technical standards, and you can bet that as formulaic as it is, this franchise isn't quite going the way of the ice age anytime soon.www.moviexclusive.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Childishly Funny !,"In India it released on 27th July & I saw it on 31st July. But I was surprised to see only 15 people in theater (Though can understand it was weekday !)I was waiting for this movie since I first saw it's trailer. The 3 parts were amazing & each one better than the earlier one.Good: This movie is a bit childish, humor is less compare to other three parts. But surely this doesn't make you bore. 1. Story Story is nice but it is not that big you expect, specially when you see families getting apart. You expect a lot, but the story doesn't deliver that much, but delivers enough to keep you busy. 2. Comedy: Nice one, First part was stolen by Diego, second by Crash & Eddie, third by Buck & Now forth by Granny, yes, for her, it's a must watch film. 3. Action: OK.BAD: 1. About story: as I said above could have been better.Verdict:Go & watch, this is a good story. Total 7/10 !",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Definite Decline In The Series' Quality,"As with most sequels, the quality of the Ice Age movies is definitely regressing. I've enjoyed the others in the series (well, actually, I haven't seen The Meltdown, but I've seen the original and Dawn of the Dinosaurs) but I found Continental Drift to be disappointing in comparison. The animation is good as always, but there's too much in this that's too similar to what we've seen before (and, frankly, Scrat the sabre-toothed squirrel is getting tired and boring; same sub-plot every single time.)In Continental Drift the original content came across to me as silly and overdone. As the land begins to drift apart (quite suddenly) Manny, Sid and Diego are trapped on a floating block of ice, desperately trying to get back to their ""herd."" Then they spend basically the entire movie fighting a gang of pirates led by a primate named Captain Gutt. This battle goes on and on and on. It makes for a movie that's a little bit (well, a lot) more violent than the other Ice Age movies and while there are some humorous moments (largely revolving around Sid's grandma) it didn't seem to me to have the fun of the other movies in the series that I've seen.In fairness, my daughter's 8. She says she liked it. I can't disagree with that, so if the target audience is kids, then this is OK. It's just that the previous Ice Age movies seemed to have something for people of all ages to enjoy. This one was lacking that. (4/10)",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"The ""truth"" behind the continental drift","Not really of course, but still funny to see, how Scrat affected our landscape and Ice Age 4 of course. Scrat again bringing the whole thing full circle (no pun intended). There are new characters introduced into this, but none are as charismatic as our Simon Pegg character from Part 3 was.All in all it is a really good continuation, that really connects with the whole family. There might be a few things that are almost too on the nose (too PC), but the balance is good overall. The voice talent is fabulous and although some story strands are not entirely explored in the movie, it is another successful installment in the long running series.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Shame to the franchise,"Normally I watch the movies from the beginning to the end with very-very few exceptions. Ice Age: continental drift is one of the movies I have left after 40 minutes, but I consider this as a heroic since I wanted to leave even after the first 15 minutes. I just gave the movie a chance, which was a mistake.The characters are extremely boring and surprisingly annoying at the same time. The intro of the movie is really funny (1 minute), but then you should prepare yourself to enter the empire of boredom.The storyline is very predictable as well as the characters, even the kids remained silent in the first 40 minutes.While I simply LOVED the first part of the franchise and I was OK with the 2nd and 3rd, I would recommend the Continental Drift to my enemies only.Stay away, this cow is milked dry already.Not recommended at all.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best at pure slapstick but deadly dull when it tries to deal with family issues,"Ice Age: Continental Drift is a movie that is best at moments of pure slapstick and deadly dull and boring when it tries to deal with the personal problems of the characters. What do we care about the love affairs, friendships and family issues among tigers, sloths, possums and woolly mammoths? Weighing the inclusion of both the comic and the personal elements, finally the family issues take over and the movie upends. It isn't a terrible movie, just a flawed comedy with tiny gems mixed in.This is no less than the third sequel to the 2002 hit Ice Age which was successful by keeping its story and characters lean and funny. The sequels have mistakenly tried to give the three leads Manny the Mammoth, Diego the Sabertooth and Sid the Sloth comfortable family relations. But who cares? We're more interested in watching them be funny then be a family.The story this time is set off by the hapless Scrat the Squirrel whose never-ending pursuit of his elusive acorn causes a rift that splits up Pangaea which, if you'll recall from geography class, was the massive super-continent that split apart 200 million years ago and settled into the continents we have today. Meanwhile, Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) is having trouble being a strict father to his daughter Peaches (voiced by Keke Palmer) and finds himself separated from this family by an ice break and (rather predictably) after an argument.Set adrift on a large chunk of ice with pals Diego (voice by Denis Leary), Sid the Sloth (voice by John Leguizamo) and Sid's foul-smelling, toothless Granny (voiced by Wanda Sykes) the quartet try to find their way back to the continent so Manny can rejoin the family. Along the way, the rag-tag band is accosted by a pirate ship-shaped glacier captained by an obnoxious Pirate baboon called Gutt (voiced by Peter Dinklage) whose plan for our heroes, is . . . well, not really explained very well. Kill them, maybe? He'll do whatever a pirate does. He certainly can't rob them, they aren't carrying anything of value.Actually the baboon is quite a boring character. He's all menace and bad teeth and pirate jokes that don't really go anywhere. He's there to be your standard movie villain, show up to provide a problem and then get his comeuppance. Peter Dinklage, the Emmy winner from HBO's Game of Thrones does what he can with the voice, but he really has nothing to work with. Gutt's crew aren't that interesting either. They include a bloodthirsty rabbit, a dumb-witted Elephant Seal, a badger, a kangaroo and a white tiger with the voice of Jennifer Lopez.None of these characters have any real personality. They are merely a part of the set design. They come on screen, have their personality traits and then disappear from the film as quickly as they disappear from our memory. The one new character in the film that actually works is the character of Granny, Sid's seemingly senile old grandmother. As played by Wanda Sykes, she is a work of comic joy and is welcomed every time she comes on screen. A nice running gag about whether or not her often-mention pet Precious is dead (or real) gives the movie a nice payoff. Sykes, of course, is a wonderful comedienne who has the perfect voice for animation and a knack for raising dead movies like Over the Hedge, Monster-in-Law, and Evan Almighty out of the doldrums.The other gem of the film is the required role for Scrat the Squirrel who always appears around the edges of these movies, and whose role this time is set off by a treasure map carved inside a hollowed-out acorn that he finds at the bottom of the sea. What's waiting for him at the other end of the map is best left for you to discover. It provides the best moment in the movie, and proves once again that Scrat is one of the great cartoon characters. He deserves his own movie.The problem is that in order to get to Scrat's payoff, we have to sit through a dusty old plot involving Manny's family problems. There some nonsense about his daughter Peaches' friendship with a trustworthy possum and whether or not she will ditch him to go with the popular group. This subplot is as dull as it sounds. Who cares? This is a comedy, and it is best when it plays like a slapstick comedy. We perk up at the comic moments and we check our watches during the family drama. The movie is too stuffed with uninteresting characters. The better half of the cast is played by former stand-up comedians: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Wanda Sykes, and the least interesting characters are played by musicians: Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Keke Palmer, Nicki Minaj. Next time - and it may be inevitable that there will be a next time - maybe the cast needs some trimming and that might be a good place to start. Let the comedy lead the pack and let the rest just go extinct.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation, cute characters, charming....needs to push itself further!","This is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series. The first made a huge impact, it's heart warming story and characters won millions of hearts. Then came the Ice Age: The Meltdown, which to be quite honest I didn't enjoy that much, then came the third Ice Age : Dawn Of The Dinosaurs which I really enjoyed since it added new characters and I liked the new environment instead of always staying on ""Ice"" like the first two movies, it was a welcome change. Now we have the fourth movie in the series Ice Age: Continental Drift which retreats back to the first two movies, which by this point is ""been there, seen that"" scenario.By now you might have noticed that where do I think Ice Age's downfall is. The Story itself is pretty straight forward and the same scenario / story was already told in Ice Age 2: The Meltdown. Don't know why they decided to do it again instead of adding something new? The characters remain the same as we remember, cute and lovable. The animation looks extremely well done this time around.By no means is Ice Age : Continental Drift a terrible movie. Is it entertaining? Yes. Does it have a cast of cute characters? Yes. Is the story good? Yes, good enough to keep your attention, but by the end of the day you will realize that it's fairly similar to the first two movies which you have seen before. If there is going to be a fifth installment in the series, they really need to breath new life in the series in order to prevent it from becoming just another pretty looking all style and no substance animation movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This group of adults had a blast watching,"I watched this on a very slow day at work with 4 other adults, thanks to someone's Netflix account. Considering this is a ""kids"" movie its worth mentioning how much we all laughed, were super entertained and except for the occasional customer glued to the screen.I suppose they have recycled ideas from the previous films but I only ever saw the first movie years ago so this felt fresh and fun to me, jumping from action sequence to action sequence and filled with brilliant, even beautiful animation. Even our oldest and grumpiest staff member had a smile on his face.I think the thing that surprised me the most here was seeing Peter Dinklage's name attached in the credits,. He voiced Captain Gutt the bad Orangutan pirate captain, what a fantastic accent he put on, I never would have guessed it was him.I enjoyed the story here too following the gang as an earthquake sets an entire continent adrift. They use an iceberg as a makeshift ship, which launches them on an epic seafaring quest where they encounter sea creatures, battle ruthless pirates and explore a brave new world. There is romance and I loved seeing squirrel again who had even that ""odd customer"" stopping to watch with us.

Emotion makes a comeback to the series,"ice age 4 follows in the footsteps of the first movie of the series and emotion makes a comeback for the first time in the series since the original movie, may be it's because of the tried and tested father daughter relation formula.I watched it in 3d and it was amazing, especially scrat's nose really pops out of the screen and his hunger for the nut is not quenched. ice age 4 also features many new characters some are developed like Sid's granny and captain gutt and some are not. peaches gets lots of screen time. watch out for the opening sequence, like all the movies in the series it's awesome, i don't want to spoil it for you guys, see for your self. over all experience is pretty good and the villain really gets under your skin. watch it in 3d or not watch it all trust me 3d is worth it",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still a nice entry in the franchise,"I really loved the first ICE AGE, I liked very much the second and third one and I have to say it, I wasn't really sure to like the fourth installment since it had lots of mixed reviews. However I am on the side of those who loved it since the fifth was really the WORST in the franchise.When the movie begins Scrat continues to find a place to save his acorn. This time he causes a massive continent crack-up and all continents become separated from each other. In the meanwhile Manny becomes too over-protective towards her now adolescent daughter Peaches that wants to do all the things adult mammoths do. Sid's family briefly visits him but only for dumping his grandmother to him since they consider her a dead weight and soon trouble follows. After a discussion between Manny and Peaches the land on which they are separates and Manny, Sid and Diego become separated from all the other animals. They even end up against a pirate army lead by the ape Captain Gutt, only that with the help of a irax herd and a whale that is Sid's Granny's pet they defeat them all. And always with the help of this whale all the animals will find in a new place to live and Manny will come to terms with his now adult daughter.The animation is as always great and colourful, with very vivid colours and great settings. The voice cast is good as always: Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo are as strong as ever, Queen Latifah is good too despite having less time than in the previous entries, Peter Dinklage is deliciously evil as Captain Gutt and Jennifer Lopez makes for a nice addition as Shira, Diego's love interest. And towards the very end there is even a brief Patrick Stewart cameo!In substance, still a good sequel and probably the last best entry in the franchise. And honestly, I think this should have been the end of the franchise since they already added lots of new characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just plain irritating compared to first three,"This is in no way like the other three Ice Age movies. It is just plain irritating from beginning to end. The voices of Wanda Sykes, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and Nicki Minaj are like fingernails on a chalkboard from beginning to end, and every crowd scene is made to sound like a ghetto basketball game. I guess they're trying to appeal to ""minority"" audiences...Throw in a stupid take-off of Pirates of Penzance, a bored performance by the main characters (although they made Peter Dinklage into a manic monkey), and you get a stew of pain. I guess they decided it's time for minority voices to drown out the white males, and this is the stupidity they come up with. Blecch.The only good thing about the movie is Scrat, but even that comes out being relatively stupid. The animal goes to the core of the earth, runs back and forth and makes the earth crack up.

A very nicely done movie: You'll love this if you like animation ones..,"Fox Animation provides another brilliant addition to the sequel in the name of Ice Age 4 Continental Drift. For the previous viewers of the Ice Age, this movie offers you what all you can ask from it. There is the cuteness of a cartoon movie, the wit combined with a light sense of humour which is so lovely to keep the movie lively all along, the sweetness of the romanticism, the valour for the true sense of belongingness, the sensibility of a lovely herd. The saber – Deigo which was alone for a while now finds a partner. So I am imagining the next sequel they make, they may have something in it for Sid.The movie in itself is a brilliant watch. Cartoon lovers would love the animation in this, it keeps up all the promises it makes for the movie. The introductory scene itself is a brilliant move, the continental drift is shown is such a witty and a humorous way, that very scene got me hooked on to the movie. From then on it was a smooth sailing, the movie gives the witty punches in the right places and the times, the 3D view is brilliant. It certainly is worth watching a cartoon movie in 3D, it enhances the viewing experience to a whole new level, thanks to Tin Tin for introducing us to the 3D in animation..........The movie revolves around the plot of the continental drift, how the planets split and what happens to the ice. The mammoth Manny is separated from the family and the quest is about Manny getting back to his family. En route, the saber Deigo meets his love who later goes on to join the herd. A new villain is introduced and the concept of a pirate ship is brought out beautifully. The whole setting is brilliant, the screenplay, choreography, all come together to make the viewing experience a very enjoyable one. The movie holds us together for the whole two hours. The entertainment factor is definitely guaranteed. The theatre was almost full at about 2 in the noon on a weekday. So it does manage to draw the crowd consistently.The movie is cute, sweet and a delight : kids would love it and so would the romantics. It certainly is a good watch. I would rate it at least a 4 on 5. For the choice of movies this week, I would certainly say this one is a must watch.Vinay Nagaraju http://muktamanassu.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/ice-age-4-continental- drift-movie-review/",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another enjoyable action adventure.,"More new characters are being introduced in this installment. Manny's daughter is all grown up and the film now also effectively illustrates a lot of teenage issues teenagers can relate to. The age old desire to 'be cool' and 'fit in' is so well demonstrated.In the opening scene of the first 'Ice Age', Sid wakes up with his family having deserted him. We finally meet his family in this film, although only for a while, and clearly understands why they left without him in the first place. We also meet his Granny - a wonderful (ugly) character!! Granny is a completely different character to the rest of the gang and a fantastic addition to the franchise.The film is filled with lots of action, adventure and intrigue, and features a great antagonist - the first real antagonist in the series - the Pirate Captain Gutt. Diego also finally meets another Sabre Tiger.I really enjoyed this installment, as well. This was another great action adventure thrill ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not really enjoyable for ""mature""","I have watched all Ica age series and all I can tell you, that this last part is a huge disappontment. The movie did not move forward at all in describing the main character, there was no surprise element and nothing to the audience. It is basically a story as everyone would expect and the ending was not surprising at all. Kids around us(me and my girlfriend) were happy for seeing their characters and had a bit of fun at the beginning, but once the full story has been uncovered, no one spoke. I do hope they did not get bored as well? Graphics were nice and pleasant, in this way there was a slight improvement, but that is mainly all. There was only one element I did enjoy, it was new character of grandma, who brought a bit of fun for us.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
I've slept through a comet that killed the unicorns,"This is my first bath in decades - Sid's Granny.I already reviewed the first 3 movies of a popular franchise called ice age. And I loved them a lot. Not to mention that the previous one - Dawn of dinosaurs was the second highest grossing movie of all time next to Shrek 2 in 2009. Despite the fact that it was a great finale to the story of the prehistoric animals, Blue sky wanted more money and thus more ideas. But sadly, this is where the downfall began.Like other films, it begins with Scrat chasing his acorn, thus causing disasters for our characters. In this case, it's breaking continents. That's only one of the plots the movie tries to tell us. It has so many of them. First, the main trio being seperated from the herd, then the pirates wanting revenge from the protagonists for stealing the ship, then Peaches (Keke Palmer) dealing with teenage problems and conflicts with her dad, and it also features a subplot where Scrat looks for Atlantis. Now I have a question. What is this movie even about? Sadly, it becomes confusing, however, there are still elements that saved the plot from doom.First, the humour. It wasn't really the best of what the writers can do, but it did save the writing. I especially laughed at the ""we are very stupid"" joke and the quote about the comet that killed the unicorns. The best characters in the film are Scrat (obviously voiced by Chris Wedge), Granny (Wanda Sykes) and Louis (Josh Gad). Like I said before, our rodent causes a disaster and then goes to Atlantis. You may think that he's looking for a cure or a solution to the problem of breaking continents or vengeful pirates, right? Nope. He just wants acorns like always. And what disappoints me is that he doesn't appear as much as in the prequels. Which is really bad for people like me who are fans of him. But there's a new comic relief on the block and that's Sid's Granny. She was hilarious, especially when she tried to proof that her pet Precious isn't imaginary (whether she was right or not, it's better to watch the film, cause spoilers) and when she took her first bath in decades. She's one of my favorite characters in the film. Finally, Louis is just the cutest character in the film, next to baby Scrat in Scrat tales. It's just that he's a cute and innocent molehog, who's friends with Peaches. But only as friends, and that upsets him a lot. Also, as a small note, he's voiced by Josh Gad, the same guy who voiced Olaf in Frozen and Chuck in Angry birds movie. And considering the fact that I adore these two, I just couldn't dislike the molehog. He definitely has something in common with the two. But the rest of the cast is forgettable. Manny is the worrying father like Marlin in Finding Nemo, Sid is still dumb (which is weird, cause he got smart in the last 2 films), and Diego is just there to have a girlfriend named Shira. Despite the fact that her voice by Jennifer Lopez (yes, her) was beautiful and her design looked awesome, she wasn't really a good character. She was on the pirates side, but then was rescued by the trio and slowly falls in love with Diego. Also, why is there a tradition of giving each main character a love interest? First Manny, then Scrat, now Diego. What's next, Sid? (Actually that happened, but in Collision course). As for other new characters, captain Gutt is the leader of the pirates that wants revenge just because the characters wanted to go home with a stolen ship. He was a very generic villain that had some funny henchman like the already mentioned Shira, Bunny, sea elephant and the hamsters that went against the captain. The only way that I can describe him is that he saved the trio in the beginning, but doesn't want to let them go back and then seeks revenge on them. He wasn't a great as Soto or fast Tony or Rudy in the prequels. However, his performance by Peter Dincklage was great, in fact, I liked everyone's performance here! They still putted effort to sound like the characters are in peril, which means that they still care. I don't care or remember the rest of the characters. I'd like to mention Peaches, and she was average, but at least she wasn't hatable and she was cute sometimes. I also liked her chemistry with Louis, where the molehog had a crush on the mammoth, but she mostly treated him like a friend.As for other elements, the animation was beautiful. There were lots of ice, waves and nice backgrounds. Sadly, they weren't anything special, unlike 2 and 3, which looked great in comparison. The new designs of the animals looked weirder than before, but still fitting to the style of the franchise. Perhaps the best scene of the movie was the one with sirens. Where these creatures imitate someone the victim loves and trick them. And we see Scratte once again. But only for one short scene.Honestly, this film feels a lot weaker than the first 3. It had some funny scene, good characters and great animation, but it already feels like the writers are running out of steam. I must say that the title is misleading. It's barely about breaking continents, but rather pirates. So it's better to call it ""The Pirates' revenge"". I would honestly recommend fans to stick to the first 3, unless they want to know what happened next or if they are huge fans of them. It was nothing special, but at least it's not terrible. I thought it was ok, but it could've been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just as good as Ice Age 1 and 3 and better than Ice Age 2,"When I was waiting at the cinemas to see this, a lot of young kids and a couple of teachers from a school came in and they were going to see Ice Age 4 as well. Lucky I got my ticket, a box of popcorn and drink before going into see Ice Age 4 before they came in, otherwise the cinema would be packed and I'd have to come back another day. I knew this would be so much better than Ice Age 2 - The Meltdown with all the new characters being in the last Ice Age movie.I don't know if this is the last Ice Age movie or not, but they should stop on this one. 4 movies is enough. Even though this is rated slightly lower than Ice Age 2 and should deserve a 7, I still think it's better and funnier than number 2 and just as funny as 1 and 3. Some of you may agree with me, some of you may not.A lot of the new characters were very funny. I knew who did the voices of the main characters in the Ice Age collection. The people who I've heard of who do the voices of some of the characters in Ice Age 4 are Nick Frost, Kunal Nayyar, Nicki Minaj, Rebel Wilson, Peter Dinklage and Jennifer Lopez. They all did a very good job at voicing their characters, especially Nick Frost voicing Flynn.I thought it would have been longer than 87 minutes, but it was really worth my $13 to go and see it and I'm glad I did see it, otherwise if I didn't see it, I'd just download it or buy it. I highly recommend you to go and see this if you've enjoyed the previous Ice Age movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fun Fourth Entry Into the Franchise,"Coming off of Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Continental Drift can seem like a pretty big step down (especially if your binge watching the Ice Age franchise). With that being said however, to say that this is a ""bad"" entry or that it isn't fun just wouldn't be true. Alot of the humor seems a bit forced and the film itself seems a bit rushed but overall Continental Drift is a fun entry none the less. We meet a ton of fun new characters including Sids grandmother, Shira the sabertooth, captain Gut and his crew (the films antagonists), and even Manny's daughter Peaches as a teenager amongst many others!

Great fun for the entire family...,"Having seen the first two ""Ice Age"" movies and enjoyed them, I sat down to watch this one with the family. And I must say that I was thoroughly entertained.As with the prior movies, the animation in this one was great, and the CGI was really nice to look at and greatly detailed. And the characters in the movie were likable, funny and charismatic, just as in the prior movies.The story in ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is about our beloved group of friends who are sent out to see after their land is destroyed and broken apart by the forming of the continents. And on their journey to get back home they have a great adventure and meet a myriad of interesting creatures.The voice acting is great, just as in the prior movies, and they still have some really nice people on the cast list for the various roles, and a good amount of distinctive voices.For a family animated movie, then ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is a great movie for kids and adults alike, because there is something in this movie for just about anyone.

OK... but not the best so far.,"The trio is back with the fourth installment- or no? Ice Age 4 revisits Manny, Diego and Sid in an all new adventure with a geological flavour of event- the Continental Drift happening before their very eyes, comically caused by the ever-pursuing Scrat over the acorn. As years have passed, Peaches (Manny and Ellie's daughter mammoth) grows up into a young teen, Sid welcomes his family especially his grandma and Diego finds love in their quest. The Earth plates begin to move, resulting in the trio being separated from the rest of their community. Soon, they face pirates and must work together to survive and reunite with their loved ones. That's about it. Simple, direct and somewhat formulaic.That's what Ice Age has been doing and the third (Dawn of the Dinosaur) paid well of as it becomes my favourite of this franchise. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the movie- how the Earth or land splits and moves with the graphics a wonder to watch and the hilarious scenes like the trio going through a storm. The ending falls rather flat and short. Unlike the Dawn of the Dinosaur (yes, i'm comparing with the third but i shouldn't), i didn't get the suspense and thrill when watching the climax of events. No doubt, this movie has everything done neat and clean but i personally did not find it memorable.The characters remain an interesting herd to watch. Manny continues to be grumpy but apart from that, now he becomes a father figure. Sid's craziness and wackiness is one of the strongest points of the show, or franchise to be exact. He never stops to entertain with his awkwardness. And Diego, i guess every man would relate to him- being masculine and tough yet soft on the inside. Peaches and Louis cute friendship. Again, that's just it. I found this movie to lack characterization in the other characters. The granny introduced was a nice addition but sometimes, i find her to be a tad too annoying. The pirates were just pirates playing their roles as villains but nothing further.This movie is OK may be because i had a high expectation of this movie since the third installment. Hopefully this is not the last of the Ice Age franchise because i am not thoroughly satisfied with an ending as such. Much said, it is still a good watch for a family outing because apart from the comical scenes and adventure, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift does have some values to learn and reminds you that you have each other.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Another great adventure from the Ice Age crew,","Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a great movie with great humor,storyline and a fantastic cast.Its the fourth in this film series and although I don't think its as good as animated fhranchcises such as Shrek and Toy Story,it still is a good and entertaining series of films and doesn't look like its going anywhere anytime soon.The continental drift is occurring and the ice is breaking apart and Manny is separated from his wife and daughter.Along with Sid,Diego and Sids grandmother,they must find there way back home.On there journey they are kidnapped by pirates and Diego falls for a female white tiger.Meanwhile,Scrat is still searching for his nut.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) - Why is This Franchise Drifting?,"Set as a fourth sequel to the original three Ice Age films, ""Continental Drift"" reunites the memorable characters of Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), Diego the saber-toothed Tiger (voiced by Denis Leary), and of course, my favorite character, Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel whose adventures involve him trying to catch his acorn. In this movie, we learn about Pangaea, the continents drifting apart from each other, and we get a little satire, making fun of how Pangaea actually happened. That concept could have led to a fun animated movie that both kids and adults will enjoy. Sadly, I was half-right, it's only for kids! The ""Ice Age"" franchise is starting to lose their gas after releasing that ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" crap, and there was never no need to make a fourth installment. But, too bad, because Hollywood always loves to make money out of these movies. That just proves that the only reason why these movies keep being made is that they make tons of money. Although the first two movies were good, it was until the third movie's release when the series became a cash-obsessed series. I'm starting to feel bad for all those unlucky parents who spent their money, so they can take their kids to go see this. Because although it was trying to be a family film that everybody can enjoy, it just falls flat and becomes this stupid kid movie, filled with such juvenile humor. I understand that the general audience for these movies are young kids, but the least you could have done is to also make this movie fun for the adults, as well, so they won't have to kill themselves once they leave the theater. This is definitely not one of those times. Although there are some funny chuckles to be found in this movie, although doesn't help the movie for the most part, the rather hilarious scenes in the movie come from Scrat, the cute squirrel trying to find his acorns. The rest of the movie, just a chuckle! We also have a collection of celebrities who appear as the voices of new characters, from Nicki Minaj, Drake, Keke Palmer, Jennifer Lopez, Wanda Sykes, and Peter Dinklage. I just can't begin to think that all these celebrities thought this movie would be nothing but an easy paycheck. The plot was beyond ridiculous, most of the jokes were lame as hell, and the horrendously usual movie clichés were everywhere, from Manny as the over-protective father, the rebellious younger daughter wanting to hang out with the cool kids, the pirate villain wanting revenge on the protagonist for no particular reason, and thousands of love triangle story lines. Are you kidding me? This movie is just a forgettable experience that's not even worth talking about. If anybody has a child in their family, they might enjoy this movie, but this movie is strictly for kids, and if you think adults will like the juvenile humor this movie brings, you know it's going to be bad. It's not funny or entertaining, it just drags on for a couple of hours, goes through plenty of weak gags, one after another, until reaching it's predictable conclusion. This is probably one of the most forgettable movies, and one of the worst movies of the year. But it's not that awful, this is a kids' movie, you know! Yeah, I can be nice! ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"", in my review, ""a generic, mediocre, unfunny, and predictable 'kids-fest'"".",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not the best Ice Age movies,"I have watched this movie. If we compare it to the previous ice age movies, it is a little disappointed because this movie had a little humorous scenes but had a lot of serious scenes. Hmm, I think have many serious scenes was not suitable with ice age because ice age is a funny movies. I wished in this movie, the main character was not Manny's family again. But the fact was Manny's family again, although there were also Sid'family a little bit. If they add Diego scene with the girl, I thought its better, because Diego only has a few scenes. Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier must have another way to make these movies ""come back"" in box office.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A hilarious family fun-time,"I love this movie. It's honestly probably one of my favorite animated films ever as it's a blast to watch each and every time. Sure, it has some problems, namely relying too much on gross-out humor, but overall it's absolutely hilarious (also the Shira storyline isn't all that well developed). I think it gets close to being as funny as the first film. Granny is a hoot, and probably my favorite Ice Age character if I'm being honest. I love the Captain Gutt song and Louis is so adorable, I love him. He's such a great boyfriend for Peaches. Also, the Scrat scenes are actually pretty good again. They've sucked outside of the first film so far. Anyway, in my honest opinion, this is almost as good as the first film.",,Anonymous,Animation
An entertaining addition to the 'age'-ing series.,"To start with - the technical side of filmmaking. The Ice Age series has always excelled in providing amazing visuals and this one doesn't disappoint. The use of 3D is brilliant, almost enough to restore my faith in the dire format, with credit going to the blocking choices for the characters (if that exists in animation) - they are often propelled into situations where the camera angle would turn to have them move towards the camera, creating the intended three-dimensional 'pop out' illusion. To add to the enjoyment of the visual side of the film, the new animals have been pleasingly designed by the animators.And on an artistic level of filmmaking, the screenplay is unfortunately missing the wit and subtle humour that made the original film hilarious. The comedy is powered by visual gags instead. Some may find this disappointing but with the state of comedy films this modern day that manage to sell, it seems visual gags are what cater nicely to the target audience which is children. However, I give credit to one of the screenwriters, Jason Fuchs, who has helped script a feature film that does manage to entertain at only 24 years old. But when a film works with visual jokes rather than a script for comedy, it doesn't make one too excited about the prospects of the people behind the camera. Maybe the reception of Continental Drift can help Fuchs work on his next piece though.Satisfying voice acting is featured in the film, I was in fact surprised that Drake and Nicki Minaj performed decently. The show-stealer was Wanda Sykes who voiced Sid's granny - she was an exception to the aforementioned visual/verbal joke argument as her greater comedy asset was undoubtedly her voice. For the record, it was ironic how Peter Dinklage voiced one of the largest pirates.It's inevitable that the question ""Is it better than it's predecessor(s)?"" will be asked about Continental Drift. Well, whilst none of the sequels have been of the same quality of the original, I choose to only compare this one to the last one and the answer is yes, mainly due to the subtext of the story.It revolves around the animals getting captured by pirate animals and doing their best to turn the tables on them. This could be interpreted as a message about how us humans, represented here as the animals, are capturing animals for our own self interest without any real sympathy. I'm no animal activist but I can safely say this is a relative approach for the filmmakers to go for - also considering as number three was about dinosaurs which have no relevance this present day - because the amount of environmental groups wanting for us to save these animals is of a large amount and ever-growing animals are becoming abused, unwanted, and abandoned by some of us. So on the socio-political level of filmmaking, Ice Age 4 has a good reason to exist.All in all, Ice Age: Continental Drift is an entertaining addition to the series. Whilst it still proves that the series could have only gone downhill from the first one, it has a sufficient amount of reasons to be recommended to the target audience, children and fans of the series alike. Plus Scrat is still as entertaining a character as ever.I will not spoil the ending but can say that it could be looked at as sequel bait but arguably, the series has gone long enough and I predict that a fifth film will really take its toll on it but time shall tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Time for them to stop,"Today it was supposed to rain so my husband and I took the kids to a double feature. We saw Brave (our second time b/c it's SOOOO awesome!!!!) and Ice Age 4.Before the movie there was a Simpsons cartoon (trying to copy Pixar, I assume). It was probably the most absurd thing I've seen in awhile. First of all, clearly the person who created it was of very low intelligence because they called the daycare the Ayn Rand daycare but it ended up being really fascist in nature (scanning all the kids and having armed guards everywhere, etc). All it takes is 2 minutes of googling or reading 1 of her books (or 1 of her quotes if you're too stupid to get through a full book) to know that Ayn Rand was STRONGLY against things like that. In fact, things like that are what made her escape to America . So my husband and I were just really confused through that whole mess. Probably because we aren't morons...Then the movie started. It was fine for the kids (ours are 3, 5 and 7) esp if they like slapstick comedy stuff (as most kids do). Some things went over our kids heads but they got most of it. It was basically Pirates of the Carribbean meets 2012 (or any other apocalyptic movie). The kids laughed maybe 5-7 times and my husband and I laughed about 3-5 times. It was fine but really not worth going to the theater for it (and certainly not worth paying $5 more for 3D...which we didn't, thankfully). It honestly felt like a made for TV movie. So hopefully if they continue on with this series (Dear God I hope not) they just send it straight to TV. The first 2 were cute and funny, but the last 2...not so much.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age 4 is the best in the series!,"Ice Age: Continental Drift continues with the adventures of Manny(Ray Romano), Diego(Denis Leary), Sid(John Leguizamo), Scrat(Chris Wedge), Ellie(Queen Latifah), Crash(Seann William Scott), Eddie(Josh Peck) & Manny & Ellie's teenage daughter Peaches(Keke Palmer). After Scrat chases his beloved acorn around the core of the Earth, causing the continents to crack up, Manny, Diego & Sid are separated from their herd. The trio along with Sid's grandma(Wanda Sykes) come across a pirate ship led by Captain Gutt(Peter Dinklage). Now, it's up to Manny to defeat the pirates & return to his family.This movie is hilarious! All the new characters are funny. Ray Romano is spectacular as the voice of Manny. Denis Leary is brilliant as the voice of Diego. John Leguizamo is hysterical as the voice of Sid. Queen Latifah is great as the voice of Ellie. Keke Palmer is outstanding as the voice of Peaches. Wanda Sykes is hilarious as the voice of Sid's granny. Peter Dinklage has done a bang up job in altering his voice substantially for his voice over of Captain Gutt. All the supporting characters' voices are brilliant as well. This movie also teaches us a lot of important lessons about life. The 3D is mind blowing & makes the visuals even more beautiful. All in all, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a must watch. Watch it with your entire family.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Too Much, Too Soon","I brought the family to see this movie last weekend. We have watched, re watched, and practically memorized the previous three Ice Age movies. Although I enjoyed a few good laughs, the newest movie didn't quite meet the high bar set by the previous three movies. There was a boatload of new characters, and a complex plot. Between Peaches and her relationship issues between her dad and her friends, the return of Sid's family, the new threat of the pirates, Diego's new romance, and that increasingly annoying chipmunk... it was just too much. There was no time to think. No time to relax and really absorb everything. I know we will end up buying this movie when it comes out on DVD. It was funny enough, especially with Granny. It was decent, but just didn't compare to its predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

How the world truly split up into what we know today,"Ice Age: Continental Drift tells the story of...well... how the continents came apart into what we know today. As this is happening, Manny, Diego, and Sid are separated from Ellie and Peaches during this continental crack-up, and they must find a way back home. Unfortunately, they run into a few pirates along the way. While this is happening, Scrat finds a map to acorn paradise and is trying to find it.This is a worthy sequel to a great franchise. I don't know why the only one that got the best reviews on Rotten Tomatoes was the first one. To be honest, each movie keeps on getting bigger and bigger, with this one not only having a huge problem, but a bad guy along the way.The voices are all great, as well. We have Nicki Minaji, Drake, Jennifer Lopez, Peter Dinklage, and Wanda Sykes were all truly welcome to this franchise. However, it is the main voices that are the true stars here. Queen Latifah is great, as always. Sean William Scott and Josh Peck do a great job at Crash and Eddie, Ellie's possum brothers. And, of course, the main trio. Dennis Leary as Diego is great (Dennis is doing a great job this year; he's got ""The Amazing Spider-man"" under his belt, as well). John Leguizamo is always hilarious as Sid. And as for Ray Romano, let's just say that I'm a big fan of him and his old show ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" so anytime I get to hear him in a movie, I'm all up for it.Overall, it's a great movie. It might seem a little stupid, but it's the Ice Age series, so it's all good fun. An 8/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I did like Jennifer Lopez's character. She was a strong character. I think the monkey should have been funny. I loved the grandma. It was good for kids and I get it that's who it was made for but the others were good for kids and parents. This one was mostly made for kids. I do suggest taking the kids to see it and buying it for the kids. I'm not saying the movie was bad but it could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"No end in sight, I do reckon...","Things have changed a lot in four movies. We started off a mammoth, a sloth, a tiger and a baby, to virtually an entire zoo worth of creatures. This does mean the material is spread pretty thin as everyone competes for a speaking part, and the director's apparent insistence that almost every line must be a wisecrack. Still, the nucleus of the series remains strong, and it provides for yet another solid hour-and-a-bit worths of entertainment.The best character remains Scrat, that ever-lovable squirrel(?) on his non-stop quest to bury his nut. All the best scenes revolve around him, and its amazing how much comic mileage you can derive from such a simple premise. If he was a human, he could be the biggest silent star since Charlie Chaplin. But he's not. Oh well, guess he's stuck with sleeping all winter and being run over by careless drivers, then... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Horrible fourth entry that panders to the Disney/MTV audience,"So Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Denis Leary) et al return for yet another instalment of the hugely successful Ice Age franchise, to explore themes that have been re-cycled from previous films, and re-hash familiar plots. With the continents breaking up around them after a calamitous act by the returning Scrat, Manny is separated from Ellie (Queen Latifah) and his teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and washed out to sea. With the world seemingly becoming an ocean of floating glaciers, they are picked up by the maniacal pirate Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage), a gigantophithecus who wants to make them walk the plank. They escape, and must form a plan to seal Gutt's boat in order to meet up with Ellie, Peaches, and their wandering herd.Similar to the plot strand in The Meltdown (2006) involving Manny and Ellie, who was torn given that she thought she was a different animal, Diego meets one of his fellow species Shira (Jennifer Lopez) aboard Gutt's ship, who is dedicated to Gutt's tyrannical rule regardless of how he treats her. Again the writers seem unable to come up with something inventive for Diego so have lumbered him with a shockingly uninvolving love story. Shira is merely one of many new additions, and apart from Dinklage's impressive Gutt and Nick Frost's hilariously brain-dead Flynn, none hit the mark. The introduction of Peaches, who arrived in the third (and best by far) instalment Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009) merely causes the film to explore TV-movie themes of family and generation, played out like a middle-class suburban family. Peaches even says to Manny ""I wish you weren't my father,"" before they are separated - yawn!The creators seem to have lost all respect for themselves and the series after the hopeful third instalment, and have opted for an MTV/Disney Channel aesthetic, bringing in awful pop stars such as Lopez, Nicki Minaj, Drake and Heather Morris to satisfy the young generations' lust for these conveyor belt voices rather than some genuine voice talent. It's quite mystifying as to why they opted to leave out Simon Pegg's Buck (although he is glimpsed for a split second), who was the best thing about the previous film, and instead introduced this endless wave of forgetful characters. Even Scrat, usually a welcome diversion to the central action, is lacking any real ideas and fails to raise a laugh. And the film is wrapped up with an awful rendition of 'We Are Family' sang by the whole cast that caused me to instantly turn the volume down and stop the film as my body was uncontrollably cringing. Simply dreadful, and I doubt I'll continue with the series from now on.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best family movies of the summer!!!!!!!,"My entire family and I have enjoyed every single chapter in the ""Ice Age"" saga since the beginning.

When I saw this movie in the theater, there were definitely a lot of teenagers (aside from me) laughing at the action that occurs between Manny, Sid, Scrat, Diego and the others. Kids, teens and even adults will enjoy the fourth chapter in the trilogy. Kids will laugh at the characters, but teens may relate to Peaches even more because they go through the same effects that many face in real life (fitting in, getting a love interest). Adults will also like to say that there's some newcomers to the saga, including Canadian rapper, Drake (of Degrassi: TNG fame), Nicki Minaj, Wanda Sykes, Aziz Ansari (of NBC's Parks & Recreation), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: TNG), Kunal Nayyar (of the Big Bang theory), Heather Morris (of Glee) and Jennifer Lopez (if you watched American idol this season, Ice Age 4: Continetal Drift popped up quite a lot).

Ice Age: Continental Drift,"By now, we are all maybe all a bit too familiar with ""Scrat"" chasing his acorn and with his expanding group of friends' adventures in the frozen north. I certainly found this story to be entertaining enough, but running short on ideas and somewhat repetitive. When cast adrift on an ice floe, and heading to warmer climes, our wooly mammoth, sloth and sabre-toothed tiger have to figure out a way to tap the northerly sea currents and using an iceberg, get themselves back to the chill where ""Ellie"" and newborn ""Peaches"" await them. Along the way, ""Manny"", ""Sid"" and ""Diego"" meet some pirates - think ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" meets ""Jungle Book"" led by the whip-wielding ""Gutt"" and that's what gives ""Manny"" the germ of a cunning plan. Pinch his ice-ship and sail home! Pirates aren't so forgiving and what ensues proves quite perilous for our wanderers. It's fine, this film - the characters do what they have always done with a script that is adequate, but little better, and a story that I thought ran out of puff by the half way mark. It's quite a far cry from the busy, characterful and entertaining first film ten years earlier and to be honest, it all looks just a bit fatigued. It's still a watchable effort, though, but just bit too wordy and I reckon that this franchise is now ready for bed.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the Only Times I've Thought a Franchise is Best Off Ending With #4,"Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is the latest installment into Blue Sky Studio's big franchise. It's about how the continents of the Earth drift into their own directions, and all this affects our main characters. Is this movie as good as any of the previous movies, maybe even the first? Or does it fall into the typical third sequel-category?I had fun watching Ice Age 4. That's mainly because I have so many great memories from watching the first Ice Age movie. I did not watch the second movie until I was much older, and the third movie is obviously not old enough for me to have grown up with. But anyway, I really like the first movie, and I think it's definitely one of the best animated movies not done by Disney, Pixar or DreamWorks. The second movie was good, but not as great. Same goes for the third one, which did try something new with a brand new environment and story, which I liked. But this fourth goes back to the traditional Ice Age style.As I stated, the reason I really liked this one was because of the nostalgia. It was fun seeing some of my favorite animated characters back on the big screen again (the first movie is actually the first movie I saw in theaters). I enjoyed the humor (some of the jokes fell flat, but it was overall funny), and as I said, I enjoyed the characters. One of the things I didn't care about, however, was the story...The story is the same as Ice Age 2, only dumped down. It's the same ""the environment is becoming dangerous to live in, so we gotta move in packs to a safe location before the time is out""-concept that was used in Ice Age 2. The only differences is that the three main characters are separated from the pack, and that the movie would include some elements such as pirate villains and of course the continental drift concept.Another problem with the movie is that it had some terrible musical numbers. One is to introduce the main villain (which by the way, I didn't like at all), which is a cliché opera-style villain theme that's been used in multiple Disney movies. And then there's a credits song, that's just the worst thing ever. I have never heard something this embarrassing in the theatre all year!Overall, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is hugely flawed, but still enjoyable if you like the previous movies in the series, especially Ice Age 2. With the same memorable characters from the previous installments, some very nice-looking animation and scenery and funny moments, this is a movie that parent should consider taking their kid(s) to.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nutshell Review: Ice Age: Continental Drift,"It's been a decade since the release of the very first Ice Age, and thankfully this installment of the franchise managed to stay afloat by keeping things simple, even though it still kept within its constraints of setting in the prehistoric era, and still having to bounce around the usual theme of family. Competitors like Shrek did its franchise in by doing too much too soon in delivering lacklustre gags and spoofs of pop culture that can only get you so far, and Madagascar showed how it went from strength to strength, so unless Ice Age comes up with something new, I don't really suppose it can survive beyond this, although I am more than glad to be proved wrong.As with the teaser scenes released months back, Continental Drift opens with Scrat being directly responsible for the splitting up of the Earth's land mass into what would be the layout of today, no thanks to his continued pursuit of the acorn. And like the earlier installments, he's mostly left to do his own thing with minimal interaction with the rest of the crew, undoubtedly being one of the top draws of Ice Age. We reunite with the motley crew of Manny the mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary), who find themselves split from their main herd when the continents split apart, and have to find their way to get back from the high seas to dry land.That forms the crux of the main narrative, with the trio joined by Sid's grandmother (Wanda Sykes), whose presence again harks back to the theme of family, and lending themselves to be the central punching bag for gags. In finding their way back, they encounter the main antagonists of animal pirates led by a prehistoric monkey who calls itself Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and deputized by a white sabre-tooth tiger Shira (Jennifer Lopez), who are adamant in having Manny and gang join their crew to loot and plunder from more lands. The introduction of a pirate crew as voiced by the likes of Nick Frost, Aziz Ansari and Alain Chabat provide for an expanded cast and characters that Ice Age 4 is of no lack of, including bit roles for Seann William Scott and Patrick Stewart.Ice Age is clearly aimed at the younger demographics from Madagascar, and its simplicity reflects this rather clearly. Language is kept fairly simple, and almost all instances of action are kept firmly in PG, with the largest threat posed by Captain Gutt's razor sharp nails. The storyline doesn't toss up any surprises, since you'll come to expect how the story would develop, with wafer thin subplots such as the friendship gone sour between Manny and Ellie's daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and best pal Louis the molehog (Josh Gad) due to the former's supposed love interest, and her need to belong to her same mammoth kind, and a possible romance between Diego and Shira, which I suspect will be further developed should another follow up film be made. Queen Latifah got a reduced role here, moving aside for Peaches to step up as her character's daughter.As usual, the animation here is first class, and despite not having watched this in the 3D format, one can guess the moments where the format gets exploited in certain scenes, with extreme closeups, and opportunity in the form of various weapons being wielded and utilized by the pirate crew. Certain scenes do make themselves quite blatant in having characters and behaviour happening directly and up close on screen, while the hasty introduction of even smaller furry creatures probably had merchandising in mind. The pirate crew does deserve special mention for how varied they all are and caricatured for story efficiency, and they do warrant perhaps a short film or direct to video adventure of their own.Preceded by a Simpsons short entitled The Longest Daycare, do make sure you turn up early for that, as I was a bit more entertained with what Maggie Simpson had done as the sole, primary protagonist in this short film, than everything Ice Age 4 had thrown up. This is not to say that Ice Age 4 is a bad film, on the contrary it makes for a great family outing to the movies with its entertainment value, but unless it comes up with a stronger storyline should the franchise desires to be continued, it will soon run out of steam rehashing the same old themes, and be threatened with cinematic extinction despite growing in cast numbers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This Series Is Tired...Why Is There Another Sequel?,"I was a huge Ice Age fan growing up as a kid. The original had a great story, funny dialog, memorable characters, and stellar animation from Blue Sky Studios. Since then we've gotten two sequels, Ice Age: The Meltdown, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Meltdown had great animation, but overall felt like a poorly written sequel designed simply to suck money from our wallets. Dawn of the Dinosaurs was better; almost as good as the original. It had even better animation, and actually had a good story and some great jokes for both adults and kids. However, as soon as I saw the five-minute Scrat short at last year's Rio, I realized that the series had taken a turn for the worst.This is the worst Ice Age film yet. The story feels tired; the jokes are mostly bland; the inclusion of Wanda Sykes as Sid the Sloth's grandmother is a huge mistake; and this film commits the greatest of sins: it has an awful musical number in the middle of the movie. Ugh, it still makes me cringe. The story is about how Manny, Sid, and Diego are separated from their herd and family after the continent starts to break apart. Our heroic trio sail across the sea only to be captured by a band of pirates that sail an iceberg shaped like an old Spanish galleon. Diego gets a love interest, and Scrat continues to hunt for that blasted acorn.Sure, the animation is great, and the 3D actually works well, but everything about this film is just mediocre. From the bad story, to the uninspired voice acting, to the jaw-droppingly bad musical number, and Scrat's never-ending screams, this is a franchise that will probably see another sequel in three to four years, even though it should have stopped with the dinosaurs, and just feels like an excuse to grab more cash rather than create new, inventive animated films.Final Verdict: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good development,"""Ice Age 4: Continental Drift"" manages to improve upon the previous two films, bringing back some elements that make the franchise more engaging. This installment introduces a memorable villain, adding a sense of danger and tension that had been missing. The plot centers on a family drama that separates the main characters, creating emotional moments and placing them in situations that demand more from their personalities and resilience. There are action scenes and tense moments that give the story a better pace, providing more variety to the movie.Another positive aspect is the development of Diego's relationship with Shira, the female saber-tooth. This subplot adds a new layer to Diego's character, giving him a fresh motivation and allowing a deeper look into his role beyond his loyalty to the group. The moments between Diego and Shira are well-constructed, bringing an interesting dynamic to the film. The characters' personalities and interactions feel more genuine and fun, making the movie more enjoyable and engaging to watch. In summary, ""Ice Age 4"" strikes a good balance between action, drama, and character development, making it a standout in comparison to its immediate predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Epic Glacial Odyssey,"A pleasant and enjoyable addition to the well-loved animated series, Ice Age: Continental Drift takes Manny, Diego, Sid, and company on a maritime adventure as continents drift apart. With its bright characters and wintry surroundings, the visually appealing animation captivates viewers of all ages. Characters in Continental Drift encounter difficulties that put their friendships and fortitude to the test, giving the story more emotional depth while maintaining a sense of comedy. The plot is given additional life by the appearance of new characters, such as Peter Dinklage's voiced Captain Gutt. Continental Drift is an exceptional installment because, in spite of its recent release, it retains the warmth and charm of the Ice Age series.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Favorite Character,"Ice Age 4 is a good animated 20th Century Fox film that has its moments and jokes.My favorite character of this movie is Squint (the rabbit). Yes, the psychopathic, prehistoric rabbit. He's a great and awesome character and has a stellar voice actor.Even though he has a temper, but he's still really cool.My favorite quote from him is ""Your nine lives are over, kitty!"", because I thought it was funny.What I also like about him is that he hates being called cute, but HE IS CUTE! You can call him cute and/or adorable, as long as he doesn't try to kill you. :)Hope you guys agree with me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,I was really disappointed with this movie. I felt quite bored by this one. They had standards to meet but they did not meet them. The first three were great and original but this one just had 'the end of the world'theme to it. I felt like they didn't care about this movie as much as they did with the other ones. Kids will definitely like it because it's 'Ice Age' but I don't think that adult's will like it quite as much. It's not as original as the first one and not as funny as the third one. Manny seems quite tired with all these unfortunate events happening to him and his friends. I maybe had a few laughs but that was all. It's getting quite predictable about what might happen next. I recommend it if you have a child. If you want to watch this be prepared for disappointment.,4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A serviceable but unmemorable family film,"Blue Sky Studios has always been under the shadow of Pixar and DreamWorks, but the ""Ice Age"" series has been popular with families the world over, and so the fourth movie of this lucrative franchise has arrived in the form of Ice Age: Continental Drift After another misadventure with his nut, Scrat falls to the centre of the Earth (without the pressure and heat killing him) and accidentally breaks the world into the continents we know today, which ends up affecting our main protagonists. Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) is now an over-protective father to his teenage daughter, Peaches (Keke Palmer) who has fallen for a boy, Ethan (Drake). Sid's (John Leguizamo) family also returns just so they can dump his insane grandmother, Granny (Wanda Sykes) on him, and Diego the Sabre-toothed Cat (Denis Leary) is involved because, eh  because.When the continents split Manny, Sid, Diego and Granny are trapped on an iceberg and end up crossing the vicious pirate Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his motley crew. While at home, Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Peaches have to lead the animals to safety as Manny tries to make his way back.The ""Ice Age"" series has always been a safe series; it offers nothing groundbreaking, and ""Continental Drift"" continues down this route. ""Continental Drift"" is formulaic and predictable and you can see how plot points will play out from a mile off. But this film will not make children dumber and they are not talked down to. There are worse family movies and children are smart enough to know the ""Ice Age"" series is not a science or history lesson.The jokes throughout are hit and miss, some working better then others. Being kid friendly, the humour is mostly physical, namely slapstick, and occasionally there are witty lines, mainly from Leary and Romano. Scrat still provides a lot of silent humour and he is a lovable, old-fashioned cartoon character.There are plenty of new additions who would properly return for sequels such as Peaches, Shira (another sabre-toothed cat voiced by Jennifer Lopez) and Granny, but the main characters sometimes felt underused in the franchise they helped build. Diego is given a romantic sub-plot but generally does not do much in the proceedings. Sid too was overshadowed because of the huge amount of comic relief characters, and his material was not funny enough. Dinklage of Game of Thrones fame was a stand-out performer, playing a straight pirate with a lot menace, while Nick Frost was very funny as an extremely stupid elephant seal.""Continental Drift"" is a movie filled with an all star cast, which raises the questions, were they all needed? Was Heather Morris from Glee really offering anything as a teenage mammoth in a really tiny role, or Seann William Scott and Josh Peck used to their fullest? ""Continental Drift"" is also a movie overloaded with plots. There is Manny and co. trying to get back to their herd while being chased by Captain Gutt, Diego's love-hate relationship with Shira, and Ellie leading the herd as a awkward, geeky teenager trying to impress a boy and his ""cool"" friends in a clichéd story. And there is the overarching story of a father having to accept his daughter is growing up, a story we have all seen in many forms before. The combination of all these characters and story elements is too much for one movie when previous entries were much simpler.""Continental Drift"" is a unremarkable, non-memorable movie, but it is harmless enough and it does have some humorous moments. Without question, worse movies have been made for children.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nice,"Another fun movie in the franchise, which although it does not surpass its predecessors, has great moments, worthy of an animated film. Undoubtedly, the strongest point of the film is the introduction of new characters that captivate a lot, and one of these characters is Sid's amusing grandmother, whose one is very funny and unpredictable. Another captivating character is Amora who portrays adolescence well, which was interestingly attributed to a mammoth family. The weakness of the film is that it has nothing to overcome its predecessors (especially the first), besides having some very weak jokes.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age: Continental Drift was yet another in the series that I enjoyed enough to recommend,"You know, while I've seen the first two Ice Age movies, I hardly remember them though I do remember enjoying them. So it was that I also enjoyed this one as the continuing adventures of Manny, Sid, and Diego among familiar and new supporting characters managed to be both funny and heartwarming at the same time to my heart's desire. Oh, and seeing Scrat always going after that acorn, among many, in a separate subplot doesn't get old, still. Really, you can't go wrong with the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary along with that of Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and especially Wanda Sykes, among others, doing those characters. So all I'll say now is go ahead, watch Ice Age: Continental Drift, and once again be entertained by them!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Time to call it a day?...,"As is the fashion these days with these films there is a lot of moralising going on and a lot about the importance of family. I don't usually have a problem with this, but in this film it was so 'in your face' that I felt it got in the way of the story. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the other 'Ice Age' films, probably because it has lost all the charm the characters had in the earlier films. On the plus side, Peter Dinklage did make for a very intimidating and threatening advocacy. I guess it wasn't until about the last 20 minutes that I began to warm to any of the characters, but by then it was far too late. Time to put the franchise to rest guys. I've probably been a tad to generous with my score, it's because Sid does make me laugh!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)My score: 5.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It has the monkey in it,"Yeah, the franchise went on too long at this point. The monkey is in it which is epic and the grandmother sloth who is purple for some reason. Those made me LOL out loud. Other than that it's not very memorable, it's basically the plot of the second movie but with an extra cast member of Peaches with the teenage drama. Oh also the monkey is in it which is pretty epic! Otherwise it's perfectly fine, a kid would have enjoyed it. I was a bit too old when it came out to not have the childhood enjoyment and nostalgia for it, in contrast to the third movie which had literal dinosaurs but I was a kid so that made it epic, whereas now I recognise the plot as a bit weird. Oh also the monkey is in it.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious and great ending to the Ice Age Series,"I thought the movie was hilarious and a great ending to the Ice Age movies. It's nice to watch a movie that is just meant to be funny. Sometimes it gets tiring to go to the movies and continue to watch movie after movie that has some ""lesson"" or ""meaning"" that we are suppose to take away to apply in real life. The Ice Age movies from the very beginning have all had the same meaning of ""Sticking together and have each other's back and that a group of different people can come together to be a family or herd"".It's nice to sit there to just enjoy the movie, see how the characters have grown, new characters have come into play, have a lot of hilarious moments, and to see in the end they all end up together and happy even after all the obstacles they faced together. By far this is the best movie out of the Ice Age movies and I would definitely recommend families to go take their kids to watch it or if you have just simply been keeping up with the movies since they started.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

For kids only I guess.,"Man, I hadn't even realized that I am two movies behind in this series. As it turns out, I have only seen the first ""Ice Age"" movie and remember it being a simple but yet very warm and entertaining animated movie, that I truly liked watching. Guess a lot has happened in and to the series in between and I got a totally different vibe from this movie, which was not a very positive one, I should say.You could definitely say that this movie is mostly being orientated towards young children. So you see lots of jumping around and characters stumbling and falling from high cliffs and unfortunately the movie doesn't become any more creative or more clever than that. The written visuals jokes and dialog aren't being all that funny or clever and original. So really, while kids might still like watching this movie, the adults accompanying them most likely won't have the best time. But hey, it apparently is mostly being a kids movie, so I won't hold that against the movie too much. It still serves its purpose but it remains such a big shame that there really isn't being anything truly creative or original about this movie.One of the other things that annoyed me about the comedy of this movie was that it kept referencing modern stuff, while this clearly is a movie that is set in ice age. I know, I shouldn't take it all so seriously and I know it's just a movie and it's all for laughs and giggles but I just couldn't help but to be annoyed by it. Perhaps I have just seen too many animated movies that keep on doing this sort of stuff. Again, if only the movie was a bit more creative and original with some of its stuff, it would had made this such a better and far more pleasant watch.The movie definitely has far too many different characters in it. What the movie could had used was one good and clear main character but instead we now have a whole bunch of them, constantly competing for screen time. And the movie just keeps on introducing new characters! The movie never manages to find a right balance between all of its different characters and their separate story lines.And it also really doesn't have a very strong villain in it either. As great as Peter Dinklage is, he just isn't a very good villain, since he doesn't really seem to have a good motivation or a devious plan to let him take over the world or destroy it, or anything like that. He is just being evil for the sake of being evil.And of course there is being an obligatory love story, that really doesn't work out at all and simply should had been left out of the movie. That way we also wouldn't had had Jennifer Lopez in this movie! I don't know what it is but I'm completely fed up with hearing Jennifer Lopez' voice, that just isn't made for acting roles.Can't say many bad things about the animation. It's funny, I still mostly have the first movie in my mind, which most definitely wasn't the best looking animated movie. This movie however is just as good looking as any other modern computer animated movie. It's not better looking than any other modern genre movie but also most definitely not any worse.But really, the more I am thinking about this movie, the less I am liking it. I was actually at first going to rate it a 6 because I thought that it served it's purpose well enough, as a kids movie. However, there is just no excuse for the lack of true creativity and originality and we really shouldn't let these type of movies get away with that! Animated movies always need to keep pushing the envelope, not just animation-wise, or else it becomes just another genre that has reached its peak and is on its way down. This movie just feels like lazy filmmaking and just a way to cash in some more on a successful franchise and to sell even some more new toys and other merchandise. I say; no more! Unless they start coming up with something truly great, fun and original again.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is one of the many reasons why I have shied away from going to the movies very often this year","""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is one of the many reasons why I have shied away from going to the movies very often this year. It plants itself into the same realms as ""The Grey,"" becoming yet another 2012 release that I was eagerly looking forward to and ended up bitterly disappointed with. This film, the fourth in the popular animated series about talking prehistoric mammals, maintains the superficial elements that made the ""Ice Age"" series good in the beginning—the stellar animation—but does not even bother trying with the rest. I adored the original ""Ice Age"" and enjoyed the second film, ""Ice Age: the Meltdown"" just as much. The third movie, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"" was an uninspired bore, and the new film is just barely better. Just barely.One of my big objections to the third movie was the inclusion of a new character: a child for the two mammoths, Manny and Ellie. My objection was only expanded here. In this new film, their daughter, Peaches, has grown into an adolescent. And like the adolescents we would expect to see in a human-family drama, this character's only motives are disobeying rules, flirting with the boys, and turning on friends for the more 'hip' members of the crowd—or herd, I guess you could say. Anyway, the titular Continental Drift, is caused by none other than Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel, once again planting his acorn in all the wrong places. This time the crack he makes in the earth sends him straight down to the planet's core and causes the continents to split apart. Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the saber-toothed tiger are swept away on a piece of ice. And here is where the plot becomes insanely strident and uninteresting.They are captured by pirates.A group of rogue animals, led by a clawed ape—they break down into a song that stops the movie cold in its tracks—and seconded by a female saber-toothed tiger who Diego takes a mandatory, conventions-forced shine to. This is the second time in which Diego's inner-struggles have been boring and just the most recent of thousands of completely unneeded love interests to penetrate an ongoing film series. Giving Manny a love interest in the second film was almost essential, as it played off a key moment in the original film. But giving Diego, this feisty and hard-as-nails character, a love interest—and the sketchy ways in which they utilize it in the plot—just left me with my hands spread, mouth agape, wondering ""Why?"" However, these are just idiosyncratic gripes for me. What ultimately wrecks ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is its breakneck pace. This is a movie that seems all too eager to see itself end. Hence why not one plot element, not one gag, not one character, seems to fulfill its duty or purpose. The story leaps and bounds from one spot to another without even bothering to develop a single idea. A key example: at one point in the movie, the pirates and our heroes find themselves marooned on an island. Our heroes find a tribe of marmot-like critters and persuade them to join forces with them. But the dialogue and storytelling is so rushed that we almost don't realize that the only reason these critters are siding with Manny, Diego, and Sid is because some of their comrades have been taken captive. Why? Because the movie, in previous scenes, did not allow enough time for us to identify which strange animals are pirates. As far as I was concerned, those little animals being whipped and forced to carry loot were veteran members of the crew.The screenplay has ""desperate"" painted all over it. Popular characters from previous entries, such as the two overly adventurous possum brothers, are reduced to mere cameos, appearing only because it provides better box office appeal that way. There are utterly laugh-less gags such as Peaches the teenage-girl-mammoth snapping back at a friend, ""Ethan is not cute! He's hot!"" The laughs seem to be aimed for the very youngest of moviegoers. When Scrat the squirrel, who is seldom funny at all this time around, falls into the center of the earth, we get a cartoon-colored diagram of the earth to display it. The previous movies did not rely upon 21st century visual gimmicks (stuff a child would see in their homeroom at elementary school) so the audience could get the idea. Obviously because the filmmakers did not trust parents to come with their kids to the theater, thinking that they have grown tired of the series.Well, they may be right.I did like this movie a little more than ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" because, and perhaps this goes back to its faster pacing, it did seem to have a better sense of adventure and it did not plod all over the place. It just raced around too much. In spite of my negative review, I will admit that it is a harmless piece of kids-movie entertainment, helped by its 88-minute running time. I was not aggravated or in pain as I watched it, nor was I captivated. This will obviously not be the last of the franchise, and ""Ice Age 5"" or whatever it will be called, will probably be dimmer, shorter, and have less imagination than this one. Sooner or later, they'll be straight to DVD. Remind me next time to stay home when the next one comes out. And frankly, Scrat causing the continents to drift was done better in the ten-minute short ""No Time for Nuts"" and that short was more entertaining than the last two ""Ice Age"" movies combined.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"At the end of Ice Age 4, there is the feeling that the film has been seen before, due to the repetitive cycle that the franchise finds itself","The exact date of the extinction of the dinosaurs is unknown, but now it is possible to say that the continental drift originated when the squirrel Scrat tried to bury a nut. At least that's what Ice Age: Continental Drift, 2012 shows, a new chapter in the series that had Brazilian Carlos Saldanha directing it three times. With Saldanha taking a solo flight in Rio, Steve Martino (Horton Hears a Who!) And Michael Thurmeier (Ice Age 3) are now in charge of the animation. In the end, this new adventure of the most misfit bunch of animals in prehistory ends up serving only for the studio to continue exploring the franchise, presenting nothing new.Always in search of its coveted nut, the squirrel Scrat unintentionally causes the separation of the continents. The situation causes changes in the terrain of several places, among them where friends Manny (Ray Romano), Diego (Denis Leary) and Siid (John Leguizamo) are housed. An earthquake causes the trio to be trapped in an iceberg, while Ellie (Queen Latifah) and little Blackberry (Keke Palmer) remain on the continent. At sea, Manny promises that he will find them at any cost, but to do so he will have to face dangerous pirates and the sirens' song.""A Era do Gelo 4"", the first film in the series without the Brazilian Carlos Saldanha in charge, seems to reuse the scripts of those films where father and daughter fight for not seeing the other's point of view for the end (get ready for the shock) reconcile. Written by Michael Berg (one of the screenwriters for the original film) and newcomer Jason Fuchs, the script is a sloth worthy of Sid. There is nothing, absolutely nothing original in the conduct of the relationship between Manny and Peaches, which still has ""futile friends, an equally superficial love interest and a passionate passionate best friend, all in the exact same molds of teen films for TV that are produced by the dozens. Amid the saga of Manny to reunite the family, there are still novelties in the other vertices of the protagonist trio. Right from the start Sid's family makes a quick appearance, justifying his abandonment and bringing Grandma to the pack. Diego goes through the process of falling in love already known to Manny, indicating a possible path for the future of the series. Meanwhile, Scrat thankfully remains the same. Obsessed with the nut, he does everything to keep it in hand without measuring the risks involved. As a result, many clutter that yields some of the best moments in the film.The production's subplots involving Sid and his grandmother and the flirtation between Diego and Shira are tastier, not least because they don't need a little moral lesson at the end, with the tigress's story even echoing Diego's bow on the original tape. Scrat also gets a few laughs from his short appearances, which, thankfully, are not very closely linked to the main story.Despite bringing ideas already explored in dozens of other films, the new episode captivates by the good fit in the setting of the series as a whole and by the charisma of the new characters. One of them is Captain Entranha, the pirate baboon who sings delicious music in the best Disney style, with the participation of his entire crew. Another is Grandma, a relative of the troubled Sid who captivates by the confusion caused. These and other novelties in the fauna of the series manage to bring the necessary dynamism to a story already known, also giving a certain breath to the main characters, who are not always revolving around themselves.The script for Ice Age 4 is a thread of history, without consistency or depth. With a brief reading of the previous reviews, it is clear that since the second film the major problem of the franchise was to present more of the same, developing little that is really relevant or different. Although directors Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier are in charge of the project for the first time, they do not bring new ideas with them, on the contrary, the work has exactly the same defects and qualities of previous works, so what was good remains, but the defects also continue.Therefore, the already beaten family plot is again addressed, focusing on the relationship between father and children, highlighting how Manny does not understand that Peaches is growing up, while she blames her father for a sentimental failure, but once again the script, written by Michael Berg, Jason Fuchs and Mike Reiss, abandon this premise and do not develop it in favor of entertainment and the little that history shows about this relationship is stereotyped about adolescence. The novelty is in the group of pirates they encounter in the middle of the ocean and the threat they represent: a megalomaniacal monkey, a demented rabbit, a manic kangaroo, a retarded walrus and a saber-toothed tiger with adaptation problems. As anyone can predict from the trailer, it is obvious that tigers, if at first they are enemies and are on opposite sides of the fight, will soon unite, forming another romantic couple, similar to what happens with mammoths in The Era do Ice 2 (2006).While in the third film the fact that Sid was taken to the Jurassic world encourages other animals to go looking for him, here the engine of the plot is the division of the continents that separates Manny from his family, so he needs to go to her. But as in the long past, several obstacles are placed in the path of the protagonists, this time the dinosaurs and carnivorous plants leave to take the place of pirates and mermaids. All of these scenes entertain, but do not add weight to the narrative, it seems that everything there is just another obstacle, a recurring problem in all sequences of the franchise. One of the factors that were praised in previous works is the approaches on important themes, but instead of inciting different subjects, here the writers prefer to once again warn about the risks of global warming, which, although important, sounds repetitive.Ice Age 4 also calls attention for the quality of the animation, especially in the scene of the storm on the high seas. The scenarios are beautiful, this time, due to the division of the continents, with several glaciers loose by the ocean and islands, contrasting with the other films which highlights the drastic change that the planet has undergone. The design of the animals has progressed, since their features, hair and movements are even better defined, giving even more personality to each one. 3D, in turn, has some good moments, but it does not impress. Highlight for the nudge given to the plot without much logic in Ice Age 3 and also for the short film starring Maggie Simpson, shown before the film. A fun mix of innocence with the acid humor of the TV series.This fourth part is by far the most childlike of all the films in the series. And it is also, unfortunately, the one that least uses the character Scrat (a squirrel hallucinated by hazelnuts). After becoming almost a protagonist in Ice Age 3 (2009) - its sequences were some of the most inspired - the little rodent practically disappears, marking its presence only in fast and repetitive vignettes, without greater brightness. The focus of the action, however, goes back to the original idea presented in the original Ice Age (2002): how a mammoth, a saber-toothed tiger and a sloth manage to act in harmony and overcome, together, the adversities and dangers that come your way. Beautiful, colorful and very busy, it is a film that should fulfill its purpose of entertaining without major headaches. But it is far from obtaining greater recognition.Also counting on its core with a song as uninspired as everything else, this sequence only serves as one more appearance of these characters on the screens and to bring more members to their dysfunctional family, which means more merchandising money for 20th Century Fox Although not all bad, at the end of Ice Age 4 there is the feeling that the film has been seen before, due to the repetitive cycle that the franchise finds itself. As long as the producers treat their product as a mere means of raising money for the studio.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age 4 - Makes you Sleep and SNORE through an Ice Age,"This film is total garbage it is for little kids only.The worst film i have seen this year, after 20minutes of watching paint dry i was snoring loudly in the cinemaIt is so bad the director must be insane.There is no originality at all, the movie is just like all the othersThe acorn theme continues and is really starting to annoy me - its not funny any moreThe old characters talk the same old boring clichés and the story never really developsThis is just a money spinner to make millions for the Ice Age Brand - the problem is it is actually destroying what made the first two film good by over repeating the same jokesThere is nothing new in this film and it is an embarrassmentThe only way you can enjoy the film a little is if you have not seen any of the previous films, but it is still the worst.If you fall asleep in the film and wake up you have missed nothing because the plot is so simpleEven kids in the cinema didn't laugh at the jokes- a very bad movieToy story and Despicable me are ten times better and put this rubbish to shame.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Scrat Steals Again. Fuzzy. Funny. Crowded.,"I'm a huge fan of the Ice Age Series, thanks to it being consistently warm & fuzzy. My ratings so far have been Original(10), Meltdown(7) & Dinosaurs(9)This latest installment introduces a large amount of new characters, including Sid's grandma, a gang of pirates, a new rodent tribe & Lewis, best friend of Peaches. The film does seem rather crowded as a result, but there are less comments from the general, background animals. If you watch carefully you'll see cameos from Buck, Rudi & Scratte. The star of the film is of course Scrat, who is still on the eternal acorn quest. (With even funnier results, especially under water.)It has the feel of a grand finale, especially when it shows the actors over the end credits. I wouldn't object to more though. I just wonder what happened to all the humans.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as the others!,"The fourth installment in a film series usually end up being mediocre or just plain out bad films. Sadly this film falls into the mediocre category and ends up being the worst film in the series, but that doesn't mean it is a terrible film, it just wasn't the best.The 3D in this film was probably the best part of the film. The 3D really came out of the screen as well as the film had great depth. The 3D version is for sure the superior version to see.This film stars Ray Romano (Everybody Loves Raymond, Ice Age), Dennis Leary (Rescue Me, The Amazing Spider-Man), John Leguizamo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Ice Age), Aziz Ansari (Parks and Recreation, 30 Minutes or Less), Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones, Elf), Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham (Charlie Bartlett, Degrassi: The Next Generation), Queen Latifah (The Dilemma, Just Wright), Jennifer Lopez (What to Expect When You're Expecting, The Back-up Plan), Nicki Minaj (Ice Age: Continental Drift), Keke Palmer (True Jackson, VP, Akeelah and the Bee), Josh Peck (Drake & Josh, The Wackness), Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Paul), Seann William Scott (Road Trip, Role Models), Patrick Stewart (X-men, American Dad), and Wanda Sykes (Rio, Over the Hedge).Manny (Ray Romano), Diego (Dennis Leary), and Sid (John Leguizamo) get drifted into the sea due to the forming of all the continents on Earth. While they are separated from the heard, they run into some pirates who try to take them as prisoners. There main goal is to make it back home to help their friends and loved ones while trying to escape from the pirates.I enjoyed the film but it wasn't anything special. This is the worst out of the four films but its not a crappy movie, it just wasn't as funny nor did it feel that it needed to be made to add to the Ice Age story. Kids will probably have a fun time with this film but other than that its was just an alright film.Rating: 6/10Thank you for reading, any feedback is greatly appreciated!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
MY REVIEW: Drifting the Fun Away!!,"Ice Age 4 was obvious to arrive after Ice Age 3 was accepted universally as the funniest in the series. But that's where the problem starts. Ice Age 4 is adventurous like its predecessors but not funny like Ice Age 3 nor subtle like Ice Age 1. Most of the new characters fall flat and most of the situations are pretty predictable and pinch like clichés. It's not like everything was bad. Granny character was funny and complimented our adorable and crazy Sid. There are fun moments too but only here and there. It felt like the lead characters are getting tired of these adventures so is the loyal audience. Even the most liked character Scratte did not have enough fun this time. If they are thinking on Ice Age 5, I just hope they reinvent the series with some original idea.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great sequel,I had another great adventure and entertaining time with ICE AGE 4. Don't miss this.I liked it and my son too. We watched it in the theater where I experienced the best cinematography so far. There were many funny ideas and scenes I didn't see before in the previous Ice Age series. It was never boring and fast paced.Very clever staff of Pixar. You surprise me every time. Continue with this pace. Perhaps with Ice Age 5?I am curious to see Madagascar 3.Rating: 9/10. Too underrated on IMDb.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The ice is no longer cold,"Three years ago I believed the Ice Age trilogy had taken its final step and the results were not so compelling as the first two installments. Nevertheless, it was fun to see the characters back together for a possible closure.""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" seems to be forcing the story a bit too far, taking different directions that do not add much to what we were used to. This time we get stuck in the middle of the ocean while a crazy old monkey incarnates a mean pirate with lots of issues to resolve. The adventure, however, is a bit dull and in spite of the 3D effects, I couldn't feel the connection that I had with the two first installments. I was almost sure it should have stopped after the third part, but after seeing this one, I am now completely sure.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Don't bother, even if you liked the previous movies.","Having enjoyed the previous Ice Age movies, I found little to like about this movie. First of all, it looks great, as always. Problem is, the movie fails to generate the laughs of the previous films. Even Scrat has become hit and miss. The movie has a lot of energy, so much that it becomes annoying. It's not just obnoxious, it's boring. The movie is far too content to recycle ideas from the earlier movies. There seems to be no story, and yet too much story. There are way too many characters, and distractingly obvious voice overs without much passion (only Peter Dinklage sounds like he's having any fun). Thankfully, the movie is at least over quickly. Oh, and John Powell arranges the single most schizophrenic version of Beetovhen's ""Ode to Joy"" in existence.** out of *****",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is how to spend time with your family!,"The latest installment of the ""Ice Age"" story is probably one of the best in the series from a visual experience point of view. Even when watching the 2D version, you'll find yourself voluntarily pulled along by the great action sequence. The main story arc is, of course, family. Manny the Mammoth has to deal with issues with his teenage daughter, Deigo, the Sabre Tooth, has to deal with settling down with someone, and Sid the Sloth, has to deal with his cantankerous grandmother, who incidentally, isn't that really cuckoo or loopy as we think! The villains here are an absolute hilarious bunch of societal misfits. The funniest of them all must be the elephant seal. In the final scene where the animals find a new home, look out for a Statue of Liberty at the entrance of the harbour. This conjures up similarities of how the new immigrants must have felt when they sailed to America in the beginning of the last century as their respective homelands were torn apart. It's quite powerful stuff. And of course, if you were wondering how America got its deserts despite having one of most fertile places in the world, its all because of an acorn :)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Patchy series,"""Ice Age"" out of all the 3D animation franchises boasts the least intriguing characters. Where Madagascar is saved by the militant penguins and King Julien, or Shrek by a certain talking donkeys and a host of fairy tales freakoids, ""Ice Age"" has to fall back on Scrat, who unfortunately has grown stale and repetitive with every new outing. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" manages to recapture some spirit through Scrat's love affair and the introduction of the swash-buckling weasel Buck. Manny, Diego and co offer limited appeal, mostly functioning as dramatic outlets for plot development, leaving only Sid to be a somewhat colourful, if goofy character.This time around Scrat is back to his quest for the ever-elusive and ultra-destructive acorn, while Buck makes a blink-of-an-eye appearance. As Manny (Ray Romano) tries to control her hormonally challenged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), the earth starts another epic change when continents split. As a consequence Peaches and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are split from Manny, who finds himself adrift in full ocean with the sabretooth Diego (Denis Leary), Sid (John Leguizamo) and the latter's granny (Wanda Sykes). Manny will do anything to return to his family, but in order to do so he must first confront the first sea pirate on Earth: prehistoric ape Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his crew of sea-worn misfits.Despite some new quacky characters like Granny and the inclusion of extremely talented Dinklage, unfortunately the story didn't work for me and the excess of characters meant none were really focused on, as each of them compete for stage time. Overly contrived and lacking pace or charm this lazy instalment of ""Ice Age"" drifts along waiting for end credits, cold in delivery, despite best attempts to warm up the audience (mostly through pretty standard Laurel and Hardy type jokes). Ultimately a sequel too much for what was already a strained idea. By far the least successful of the series, showing that this franchise should be heading for meltdown. Hopefully no more global events await the ""Ice Age"", thus no further stories to be painfully churned out.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A guilty pleasure for sure,"Oddly my favorite of the franchise so far (and yes I know I said the last thing on my review of the third film), Ice Age Continental Drift manages to be fun and goofy in all the right places- with a surprising amount of fun action and charisma to overtake its smaller flaws. The biggest flaw with this film is the Peaches' storyline, which not only contributes almost nothing to the plot but feels far too cliche to gain any sympathy whatsoever. Besides that I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every minute of this film, it was surprisingly really funny- and far better than I remembered even seeing it at 9 years old. The animation is fantastic and lively, the jokes are goofier than ever, and the villains in the film are actually quite memorable for once- and honestly the best foes this franchise has ever had to offer. I guess I didn't notice quite until this one that the Ice Age films never really had a true antagonist or sense of conflict ahead of them except some plot that would eventually be realized in the end. Sure this one has that too, but it keeps the flow far more consistent throughout its runtime, and makes for a really solid and fun sequel despite its Mammoth teeen drama plot line. In the end, Ice Age Continental Drift is a solid end (or at least end of quality) to the iconic franchise ahead, and will always serve as a pleasant and memorable experience of my youth.My Rating: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
it's a great movie! i loved it!,"The ""Ice Age"" movies were all fantastic. The animation is great, the voice acting is hilarious and every movie got a great story. But, to me, the best movie in the franchise is ""Ice Age 4"". I really enjoyed this movie more than the others. The story involves around Manny, Sid and Diego on a new adventure after the Pangaea continent gets set adrift. In order to get back home, they use a small ice berg as their boat, but along the way, Sid gets reunited with his old family and Diego falls in love with a saber-toothed cat named Shira. Like i said, the franchise is great, but the fourth movie makes it even better. The story is even stronger, the animation is better and the voice acting was absolutely good. There are a lot of hilarious moments all through the movie and i really liked the movie's theme song ""Chasing the sun"" by The Wanted. Although, i gotta admit, it still looks kinda familiar with the other movies, nothing new happens. But i still think ""Ice Age 4"" is the greatest movie in the franchise.9/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't get it why so many people are rating it above 7/10,"The Ice age saga should have ended after the 3rd film but this film has lost me. It's devoid of the charm and details that made the first 3 hold up till today but Ice age 4 has so many steps down that I rate it 3 points lower than 3.The plot is far lazier and dumber then what came before. It recycles a lot of the gags and plot points of its predecessors quite literally, none of the new characters are really likeable plus the script takes a lot of shortcuts like by the time we come to that island that female sooth has already started liking Diego. Speaking of Diego, the writers pretty much ran out of things to do with him so they just gave him a love interest plus the world acts way to much like today instead of the ancient ice age timeline. Also there were noticeable fillers lurking in the filmEven if it has interesting messages and premises there were not particularly executed well even the Scrat sequences isn't interestingBut the CGI looks nice plus the final climactic duel is pretty awesome but Ice age had a big step down from it's predecessors but I did enjoy it in the end which is why I'm not full-on hating itI'm pretty nervous about 5 and Buck wild since the 4th film is already showing bad stuffRating: 4.6/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

There was just one more thing. Im not going to give anything away but some parts of this film i feel i have seen in every single ice age and that it has just repeated its self and nothing that new and so funny you may wet your self a little has come along.Saying that i would gladly watch this film again without any problems and still have the same enjoyment. I would recommend you watch it! I would not go to the cinema again and see this film but i will probably watch this film when it comes out on TV.Over all its well worth a watch and good fun for the family.

Continental Miss,"Can I just say that I'm tired of the squirrel already. He's worse than Wile E. Coyote trying to catch the roadrunner. Energizer even gave up on the Energizer Bunny idea after a while. Either eat the darn acorn or find a new food source because this joke has worn out its welcome.""Continental Drift"" is another step in the geological epochs of the world. There was ""Meltdown"" and ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" now we have the formation of the continents. Upon that backdrop Manny (Ray Romano) was separated from his family by the sudden splitting of a large land mass. The physical split was representative of the emotional drifting that was already occurring between him and his daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). Peaches was into boys now and had no time to listen to dad.When Manny, Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Dennis Leary), and Sid's grandmother (Wanda Sykes) got separated from the mainland they had a little adventure of their own which involved battling an ape pirate (Peter Dinklage) and his crew. It was exactly what I thought the franchise needed. That and more of the squirrel chasing an acorn.You know what else the ""Ice Age"" franchise didn't need? A musical number. But we got one. ""Ice Age"" is no longer fresh no matter how cold it is. I suppose Twentieth Century Fox Animations is only doing what any other animation studio does: make a hit movie and then ride it until the wheels fall off. I think the wheels fell off of this one with ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"" now I think the franchise is skidding on the undercarriage.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age: Continental Drift splits the continents for an all-new adventure,"It's hard to believe that the Ice Age series began 10 years ago and is still going this strong. While there have been some weak moments in the series, each installment has been entertaining on some level and clearly done well enough to spawn a fourth addition to the series with Ice Age: Continental Drift. All the original cast of Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Lequizamo are back as well as every new member that has joined up along the way and some new additions in this installment. Has this series finally dried up or could they possibly create yet another fun adventure for these characters? Ice Age: Continental Drift follows everyone's favorite prehistoric characters as they are forced on an all new adventure when the continent is split and set adrift at sea. Along the way they encounter new and interesting characters including a band of pirates sailing and iceberg ship exploring the new world. Not only is this another fun addition to the series, it may easily be the best yet. The story is pretty simple and fun keeping the same format that has been working, but returning to an adventure that focuses more on the original three than all the others, yet still giving them their time to play. The villainous pirates led by Gutt and voiced brilliantly by Peter Dinklage was the most entertaining character that has been introduced to this series so far. They even managed to keep the long running Scrat story fun where it should have run its course by now. All the voice actors maintain the good work they have done from the start keeping these characters from wavering their personalities. The animation this time around seemed to come off as some the best of all the films looking as though it had been cleaned up a bit more. The 3D worked well enough but never was just in your face and annoying.Anyone that has had fun with this series at all should check this one out as you are sure to have a great time. If it makes the money again there is no doubt that they will churn out another one, but this one is a good way to just let the series end on a high note. It kind of comes full circle finally giving everyone some sort of relationship of their own in a happily ever after way without being too mushy about it.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Speaking of family the last ending song/Credits of the movie are also a treat to listen to and watch along with the family.All in all this is an excellent movie.

Continental Drift Yourself Away from this Film,"Ice Age: Continental Drift once again takes the viewer on an adventure with Manny, Sid and Diego; this time around the trio finds themselves split up from the rest of the herd after shifts in the tectonic plates result in them drifting away from their home, where they encounter a band of pirates led by their Captain named Gutt. With the departure of long-time director of the series Carlos Saldanha, Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier undertook the fourth instalment in the Ice Age series, creating a film that pushes the story along even if the central narrative is rather mundane.The film opens some years after the events of Dawn of the Dinosaurs, with Many and Ellie's child Peaches entering her adolescence, with a cliché character dynamic of Manny acting as Peaches overbearing father. However the gang finds themselves quickly split up with Manny, Sid and Diego thrust away on a floating ice patch. Thus setting up two storylines, with Ellie and Peaches along with the rest of the animal community moving towards safety as an impeding wall slowly approaches, and the trio who are desperately trying to get back to their family. The former storey arch is one of life lessons, with Peaches wanting to hang with the ""cool"" kids even if that means turning her back on her best friend, and this felt like the most tiresome section of the film. Although the message of staying true to one's self is important, the film conveys this in a ham-fisted way that has been done countless times in other children's movies. Now the other plotline finds the audience on an adventure with the main cast of characters from the first and although it is more entertaining than the aforementioned story, I found the trios escapade with the pirates to be mostly underwhelming. The cast of pirates mostly serves to amuse the child audience, from the loud and crazy Squint to the fat and dumb Fynn, all of which play caricatures that have been seen before. The central antagonist Captain Gutt, voiced by Peter Dinklage, can be intimidating, however, I never quite viewed him as the threat he should have been, and children who are older than three would probably feel the same. All these storylines and new characters just come across as tired and lazily thrown together (and that's not to mention Sid's Granny who served as nothing more than a nuisance for our protagonists and was played for nothing more than cheap laughs). Nothing felt fresh in Ice Age: Continental Drift, even the Scrat segments felt lacklustre again - all this despite the three-year time gap between the third and fourth instalment.Not is all bad though, Continental Drift does feature some decent animation, the look of the fur and the bodies of water all looked great in the film. The dozens of animals featured on-screen at once also looked good and was not something the filmmakers would have been able to capture back in the day. Peter Dinklage also did a great job voicing his character, even if some of the other performances felt a little hokey particularly that of Queen Latifah, as I felt Ellie should have featured some more emotion in certain scenes.Outside of those couple highlights, Ice Age: Continental Drift is a mostly forgettable film that is comparable to the second. It tried nothing exciting and what it did go for felt stale and uninspired; the film rehashed story beats from the first two entries with all the animals having to relocate because of an immediate environmental threat. Although it is not a downright bad film, it certainly is not good and I have a hard time recommending it even if you are a fan of the series. It mostly serves as a film to throw on to entertain young children, and nothing more - and for that reason, I am giving Ice Age: Continental Drift a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age 4 Black Flag,"The cartoon ""Ice Age 4: Continental Drift"" is a continuation of the popular series of films about the adventures of mammoth Manny, sloth Sid, saber-toothed tiger Diego and other representatives of the ice Age. This film was a pleasant continuation of the original story and demonstrated the strengths of the previous parts.One of the most attractive features of the film is its humor. It is full of funny situations, funny dialogues and funny characters that will make the viewer smile and laugh. Not only physical humor and situational jokes were used, but also smart and kind jokes that are accessible to both children and adults.""Continental Drift"" also has excellent visual effects. The animation and design of the characters and terrain are very detailed and colorful. Sequences with action and adventures, including dizzying races on ice and exciting moments of rescue, are surprisingly executed and perfectly convey the tension and emotions of the characters.The relationship between the characters is also an important component of the film. There are a lot of new characters in Continental Drift, and we see how they develop and establish connections with each other. It was especially interesting to watch the development of the relationship between Manny and his daughter Pippi, as well as the exploration of new difficulties and challenges faced by the main characters.In general, ""Ice Age 4: Continental Drift"" is a worthy continuation of the series, offering the viewer plot twists, pleasant humor and visually appealing performance. This cartoon is perfect for watching with the whole family.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vidiot Reviews,"Ice Age: Continental DriftThe best thing about living during an ice age is you don't have to confine your perishables to the refrigerator.Unfortunately, this animated-adventure doesn't lionize luncheon meat in the living room, but instead glorifies family.When the earth's crust cracks, it separates Manny: the Woolly Mammoth (Ray Romano) from his wife (Queen Latifah) and daughter (Keke Palmer).Luckily, his friends Diego: the saber-toothed cat (Denis Leary) and Sid: the sloth (John Leguizamo) are there to help him find his way home.But before he can be reunited with his kin, Manny must outfox a prehistoric ape pirate (Peter Dinklage) and his anthropomorphic crew (Jennifer Lopez, Aziz Ansari).No greater nor worse than any of the franchises 3 sequels, Ice Age 4 continues the deleterious tradition of inane prattle spewed by annoying characters on asinine adventures.In fact, these creatures would be more interesting as fossilized skeletons with museum labels attached.

Going downhill,"I think this is the point where the Ice Age franchise jumps the shark. It doesn't find much else to do with its characters. Sure, there are new settings, scenarios and characters, but it seems to just introduce more gags. There is not much left for the protagonists to develop.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
disappointment,"I am a big fan of ice age but I'm sorry to say that this movie is a total disappointment for me, just like it second part. part 1 and 3 were so much better as they concentrated more on the fun activities rather than family matters. seeing the preview i had high hopes for the movie but it was not i thought it lacked a bit of punch lines compared to the previous parts and probably a bit too many new characters who hardly had much roles an ice age fan would like this movie and probably rate it higher than it deserve if we can erase the memory of previous part and rate it just as a movie...i don't think it will rate more than 5",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Over-crowded, dumbed down and uninspired. The franchise needs to end.","There is a scene at the very end of the first Ice Age film that shows a creature known as Scrat emerging from a block of ice thousands of years after the events of the film. I'm going to assume something similar happened to the rest of the cast; that they were frozen in time throughout the entire ice age, explaining their presence in the worsening sequels which are all set in a time when Sid, Diego and Manfred would logically be long dead.Even if this explanation was canon I would still question the existence of these sequels in general. Ice Age was a lovely film, but was it really so fantastic that it warranted another installment, let alone three? Apparently, because the next chapter, Continental Drift is now playing in theaters.As per tradition, little Scrat's storyline is what gets the film started. Still he tries to protect his little acorn from improbable mishaps and disasters which in one way or the other affects the main plot. In this one he sets in motion the Pangea break-up through what's easily his most over-the-top prologue to date! The main plot focuses, as usual, on woolly mammoth Manfred (Ray Romano), sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) and saber-tooth Diego (Denis Leary) as well as Manfred's wife Ellie (Queen Latifah), opossum twins Eddie & Crash (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) plus a newcomer, Manfred and Ellie's daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). The plot itself, the family is separated during a quake that just so happens to be the start of the forming of the continents, brought on by you-know-who.Manfred, Sid and Diego are separated from the others and eventually end up in the clutches of a pirate crew, lead by prehistoric monkey Gutt (Peter Dinklage), sailing the seas on a floating iceberg. They eventually escape however, bringing along another saber-tooth named Shira (Jennifer Lopez). A romance subplot between her and Diego is inevitable but sort of pointless. Another extra member of Manfred's crew is Sid's senile granny named, well, Granny (Wanda Sykes). You know all those family members Sid mentioned in the first film but we never saw? Well, in this film we do. Sort of.It provides lots of pirate-related adventure, spliced together with more slapstick from Scrat, a pointless Madagascar 2-esque love triangle between Peaches, another mammoth (Aubrey Drake Graham) and a damn mole (Josh Gad) and some comic relief bits involving Crash and Eddie, two of the more pointless characters, whom I honestly wish the third or even second film would've just killed off.Watching all this slapstick, all these jokes and all this 3D action, I longed for the first Ice Age film and its subtle moments built entirely on silence and atmosphere. After all these sequels, how many people actually remember that the first installment was so genuinely powerful? That film had Sid as the only comic relief type character. At the time of Continental Drift, it feels like every other character is a comic relief, but especially the blissfully clumsy Sid and the idiotic brothers O'Possum. No, there's no crazy-ass Simon Pegg-weasel this time. Ergo no fun!The saving grace of Ice Age 4, like in all the sequels, is the lovable Scrat, even if his first scene in the film is almost a little too over- the-top and insane even for him. But he remains a lovely character who is granted the more inventive slapstick comedy, which is made all the better from the lack of obnoxious dialogue. Everything else in the film is loud, full of pop culture references and scattered with celebrity voices, which proves how dumbed down and ""kiddified"" the franchise has become. I guess I also enjoyed some of the action, the bad guy and this one pirate voiced by Nick Frost, but that's about it.Ice Age 4 – Continental Drift is irritating, over-crowded and unnecessary. Way too many characters, pointlessly many plot lines, needlessly exaggerated slapstick scenes, an uninspired story, only the occasional funny scene and a rushed pacing brought on by the combination of a short runtime and an enormous cast of characters. If you're a die- hard fan of these films you'll probably like this one okay, in which case I must also admire your patience.Apparently one of the side characters was voiced by Nicki Minaj, which makes me appreciate the fact that I saw a half-assed Swedish dub a whole lot more.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pointless plot,"Based on where the characters stayed in the first one, the whole story doesn't make sense.Based on history, it doesn't make sense that Pangea broke apart after humans appeared, keeping that in mind, the entire plot doesn't make sense and is completely absurd, but despite that most of the things that happen are absurd, the story is convenient and without much emotion. The characters have poor development, especially the antagonist, the teen drama makes no sense and is too much, there are very few endearing and memorable moments, but still the film does not work and is not faithful to the previous ones.It is a terrible sequel that forces us to forget everything that they were told in the previous films and in the history of mankind, the decline of this saga is a shame.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A formula that already tired the public.,"This movie talks about the continental drift and is another sequel to ""Ice Age"". In this film, the animals will face the dangers of a changing planet, and try to hold together before splitting and drifting of the continents. Directed by Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier, has voice actors like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Queen Latifah and Denis Leary.After the disaster of ""Dawn of Dinosaurs"" it was difficult to do worse and, in fact, this film tries to return to a certain level of quality. The script has more solid, but still very fragile, mainly due to the introduction of a topic that has nothing to do with this film: piracy. Another problem is the lack of action, funny moments or something that makes the audience to pay attention to the screen. I fell asleep in the first two attempts to see the full movie, and this is very bad sign. The characters that, in the first two films, were nicer, now accuse wear, after ten years with almost nothing new to give to the public.Everything else remains virtually the same: the soundtrack is mediocre, the animation is regular but the quality of scenarios decreased noticeably. What remained at a good level was the work of the voice actors, but no one will see an animated film because of them.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
I wanted to see it but...,"I would have given the trailer a ten out of ten but honestly having Niki Minaj in the cast made me not want to see the film. otherwise I would love to see it because it looks funny and has some amazing cast, Including Kunal Nayyar who is in ""The Big Bang Theory"" which I love an Simon Pegg is a great actor too, most of the female cast look good as well , but like I said having Niki Minaj in it ruined it for me personally. The trailer is good because they have kept the original characters personalitiesand the new characters look good as well,I love that they've kept Scrat's original characteristics. I love Scrat. He's my favourite character",,Anonymous,Animation
It's getting tiring,"This film is about several Ice Age animals drifting in the ocean, when they get trapped on an iceberg as the continents drift apart.""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" follows the same formula as the previous films. The animals have an adventure, battle pirates (which do look hideous for a kids' film) and try to search for the way to go home. The adventures keep children interested, The family subplot and underlying themes of solidarity and friendship keep adults interested too. One thing I have to point out is that I am already getting very tired of the squirrel chasing after nuts. It's the same every time. Do they realise that the joke is already running thin?",,Anonymous,Animation
"Adventure, Comedy, Family and Friends All Wrapped In One Storyline","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Cheyenne Nguyen (age 8) shares her review with us: Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2HlKUQgiYThis movie is an adventure and comedy animation. Ice Age 4 picks up where Scrat still did not catch that acorn and the results of his chasing after the acorn that made the continent drift apart. The story is about Manny (Ray Romano), an over protective father who tries to keep his teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) from hanging out with the bad group of mammoths. Peaches is desperate to prove that she is cool so she can hang out with the cool kids. Manny and his daughter have a fight in front of her friends and the last thing Peaches says to her father is ""I wish you were not my father"". This is when the earth shakes; Manny, Diego and Sid are separated from the rest of the pack. They encounter ice pirates and many different sea creatures. They all are home sick and want to find a way home. However, the ice pirate wanted to capture them as prisoners. Manny and his gang have to come up with a plan to escape from the pirates and use his ice ship to go home. This movie has a lot of jokes that made me laugh throughout the movie. The love story between Diego and the white tiger Shira (voice by Jennifer Lopez) is so cute. The 3D is totally awesome. The message of this movie is about the importance of family and how we do not have a choice picking who is in our family. My favorite character in this movie is Granny. Everything about her is funny and unpredictable. One thing that I did not like is that there are too many new characters. Also, I would like to see more of Granny. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it's exciting, funny and all the characters are so strong and different. I recommend this movie for ages 3 to 18",,Anonymous,Animation
Ice Age is suffering from franchise fatigue,"Honestly, I was disappointed by Ice Age 4. It is such a shame, as I loved the first few films of this series when I was younger, but now I think it is suffering from franchise fatigue. The jokes aren't funny and the entire film just felt like an exhausted affair. I'm just glad that they still included Scrat. He is by far the best thing in the film. I just love the idea that he is responsible for Pangea breaking apart and for also the sinking of Scratlantis. Also I don't think that the villains were well-realised. I get that this is a kid's film, but the villains seemed like they were right out of a pantomime. They were two-dimensional and not very interesting.Read my full review for more: http://goo.gl/tkl2Nu",,Anonymous,Animation
Uninspiring. Uninvolving. Unnecessary.,"Far too juvenile to appeal to anyone other than kids, the fourth instalment in the Ice Age series is a clear evidence that the studio should've stopped after the last chapter instead of inflating the saga mindlessly for the bubble finally bursts with this latest entry that is as dull & lifeless as sequels get.The story of Ice Age: Continental Drift follows Manny who along with Sid & Diego is separated from his family following the breakup of their continent, inadvertently caused by Scrat during his pursuit of the prized acorn, and soon find themselves captured by sea pirates while trying to return home.Co-directed by Steve Martino & Mike Thurmeier, Continental Drift begins well but the story fizzles out of gas way sooner than expected and for the most part, it is a chore to sit through. The plot is just meh, the original characters feature no interesting arcs while the new additions are a tad too annoying.The animation still retains its crisp quality & sharpness but the camera is more focused on the 3D experience than the story or characters, Editing is lame, most of its attempts at humour fall apart, and the only thing that manages to stay consistent with its predecessors is Scrat's stroke of bad luck.On an overall scale, Ice Age: Continental Drift is an uninspiring, uninvolving & unnecessary entry in the saga that takes little elements from the first three films but fails to execute the winning formula this time. Exhibiting signs of weariness & massive downgrade in pretty much everything, it is an absolutely bland & empty experience that easily goes down as the weakest chapter of the series, thus far. Skip it.",,Anonymous,Animation
