This is an underrated gem that gets overshadowed by the greatness of Lord of the Rings,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) is a movie I originally saw in theaters, is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture involves our old friend, Bilbo Baggins, as a youth when Gandalf the wizard shows up at his door about an adventure. Bilbo says no but that night 12 dwarfs show up at his door and tells him a story about a dragon that stole their homeland and gold. They would like to return home, regain their kingdom and need Bilbo's help to make that happen. Bilbo will try to say no, but we all know he can't.This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Martin Freeman (Black Panther), Ian McKellen (X-Men), Andy Serkis (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Richard Armitage (Into the Storm), Graham McTavish (Rambo) and James Nesbitt (Match Point).The settings, cast, special effects, attire and props in this are absolutely out of this world. The introduction of the characters is hilarious and very well done. I adored how well the perception of the characters of each other is depicted and how that evolves over time. There's some war scenes in this that's awesome and every scene with the orcs riding the wolves is tremendous. The goblin king sequence in the cave is well executed and it's impossible not to love the riddle game with Gollum. The final battle at the cliff was perfect.Overall, this is an underrated gem that gets overshadowed by the greatness of Lord of the Rings. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
It keeps getting better every time I see it,"I've seen ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" quite a few times now. I like it a lot. The first few times I watched it I found it hit and miss. The movie still takes a couple of dips here and there but those parts don't bother me as much as they used to. Now the only demerit I give this movie has to do with its length. It's a about twenty minutes too long. Otherwise, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a very exciting and emotional ride. It's also a great looking movie with very good music. This movie is always a welcome visit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Unexpected Movie,"Let me start by saying that i have never watched any of the Lord of The Rings movies before.I was told to start with the hobbit. I was amazed at how cool this franchise must be as i loved every minute of it.I kinda feel ashamed for not giving this series a try earlier. 8/10 from me ,yeah that good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A visual feast but yet I wasn't gripped by the story or characters as much as I should have been,"When I heard that there was to be a film version of The Hobbit, I was quite looking forward to it as the big finish of Lord of the Rings was still in my mind and, unlike LotR, I had actually read The Hobbit several times many years ago. When I heard that it might be two films I wasn't surprised but the news that it was to be three did rather dampen my spirits as I don't know if I had the interest for this story to be concluded as 2016 rolls into town. Regardless I did of course watch the film because it is still a large blockbuster and, at a time of the year normally filled with overly earnest Oscar contenders, I did quite like the idea of returning to this world again.With this in mind I did wonder why I watched it with a surprisingly detached air and why I wasn't able to get into it like I should have done. I had some reservations with the first film in the LotR trilogy but this seemed different because it certainly wasn't a lack of action and forward motion that gave me a problem here. Quite the opposite actually because, once the first 45 minutes or so are out of the way then the action set-pieces come thick and fast and noisy. The opening hints at the power of the dragon to come before settling down for a gentle reintroduction to the Shire and then the characters we will follow; this section I found a little longer than it should have been and I could have done with a bit less noisy banter from the Dwarfs, since the film would provide much more from them. The majority of the film is the journey (or at least that bit of it that this film covers) and it produces plenty of action with great special effects really well integrated into the live action. So visually and technically there is plenty here. Problem is that little of it felt urgent or tense and actually the delivery of the constant action does rather detract from it.With Fellowship of the Ring, the group was smaller and the development of the plot better; additionally the action was more scaled down and comparatively simple. Here we have set-pieces where it feels like everything has been thrown at the screen and every inch of every frame has been filled with movement wherever possible. This tended to overwhelm me rather than draw me in though and in effect the noise prevented me really getting into it. Likewise by the time I had seen the characters survive impossible situations and defy gravity for the third or fourth time, the film sort of lost the ability to make me believe there was danger involved – which is a problem given I was already being pushed away by how busy and noisy it all was. Tellingly the scene that worked the best for me was with Gollum; this scene had tension, had uncertainity, had threat and did it all with small movements and dialogue; also worth noting that while Gollum is of course another special effect, you don't notice it in that scene because you are focused on the content instead of the visual.The cast sort of fit into this approach as well. While everyone is fine and does as required, at times they do tend to become part of the noise and effects rather than being characters. Freeman is a good Bilbo and his mannerisms work well (which helps negate his limited range) while of course McKellen is always welcome. The dwarfs didn't make much of an impression on me though, even if they all looked the part and delivered a few laughs. The rest of the cast are all fine but to be honest the effects are the main stars here and technically it is very impressive even if it is a bit overdone at times.I didn't dislike The Hobbit but at the same time I was disappointed in it. The action is noisy and busy but there isn't enough to draw me into the story or to make the action thrill me so much as it did overwhelm me. Hopefully the second film will see the characters and plots grow me on so that I am more emotionally bought into the films, but for this first one I must confess to being surprised by how much the film seemed content to have me watch from a distance rather than draw me in and engage me.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"A very good start to the series. Very sensitive for the rest of the process, even though the movie was slow for the first half hour, it didn't affect my experience that much. The story is fun and interesting. Most of the film's protagonists were fun and watching Gandalf bring back memories of The Lord of the Rings. Filming and directing dazzles you and makes you wish to live in the world of cinema, especially in the Elf area. Although the film is not at the level of The Lord of the Rings, it is still excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"""The world is not in your book and maps. It's out there!""","Ten years ago, I laid eyes on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and instantly fell in love. I realized pretty quickly that it was the perfect combination of style and substance: a film so loaded with story and detail, but also had enough style and action to make the experience truly epic. This experience would only be supplanted by The Two Towers and The Return of the King, the latter of which has taken its place as my personal number-one favorite movie.After so many years of legal battles and creative turmoil, The Hobbit is finally adapted for the big screen. If anything could displace the Lord of the Rings as my favorite film trilogy, I was certain that it would be The Hobbit; if for no other reason than I found Tolkien's The Hobbit is a far easier and funner read than LOTR, and I always knew that there would be moments that would make for excellent cinema.Despite the underwhelming reviews and reception, I found The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey satisfying; it met my expectations perfectly. I won't deny, however, that the film overall feels like a long-labored attempt to force lightning to strike twice. Not only because of all the story padding, connections to LOTR, returning stars, and the splitting of the story into three films, but also insomuch as trying to craft new iconic characters out of Bilbo and Thorin to mirror Frodo and Aragorn respectively. I think the thing that really gets on people's nerves is the sheer audacity in taking a single book (one that was previously adapted into a humble, bite-sized 79-minute cartoon) and exploding it into a 500-minute franchise. Thus follows the common complaints that the films are too long, too padded, too big for their own good.Personally, none of these factors really affected my enjoyment of the film. The only real drag I felt was in the opening act; the Shire scenes seemed to take a good while to wrap up. Once the party hit the road, the film explored the big plot points I remembered well from the novel's first third, complete with awesome rip-roaring action. The film's final act is pretty jam-packed with loads of orc-slaying mayhem. Above all, however, the film has a nice sprinkling of humor and character throughout, keeping things lightweight and even. I think the most memorable and satisfying of scenes, however, will be the major encounters that I remember fondly from the novel: outwitting the three trolls, for example, or the riddle scenes with Gollum, are all brought to life perfectly on the big screen.The story for The Hobbit is as quintessential of a fantasy adventure as, well, Lord of the Rings. The film not only does a fine job of packing in loads of events, characters, and fine details from The Hobbit's original narrative and story, but it also ties in some content from The Silmarillion and the appendices of Tolkien's books. A lot of this is incorporated to make tangible ties with LOTR, allowing the film to serve as a proper prequel, while digging up additional subplots, conflicts, and details to layer onto all of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films. Yes, the film could have all these extra scenes cut out, making the film trimmer. Frankly, I liked it the way it is. Some of the scenes helped me understand certain nuances of The Hobbit's politics and backstories. Some helped in the nuances of established characters and events (especially in regards to chronicling Gandalf's whereabouts, who would otherwise just pop in and out randomly, like in the book, but it would have probably alienated audiences further). Some is purely invented for the film series to streamline the continuity (purists might be outraged when they see Radagast on screen). It's a bit early to tell where The Hobbit is going with all the threads it has grabbed, but it does serve a purpose in the long run. If nothing else, it'll help average audiences connect and understand the Middle Earth on a deeper level, and set things up for later events in the next two films.As expected, the film looks splendid, with quality photography and editing. I'm especially pleased to see that the filmmakers dropped the shaky-cam effects that were dispensed in the fight scenes of LOTR; just about every shot in The Hobbit is solid and steady. Acting is pretty decent from the whole cast; aside from all the familiar faces, Martin Freeman plays Bilbo with the right amount of nuanced uptightness, while Richard Armitage plays it tough as Thorin, and every other dwarf actor does their best to make their characters stand out in their own neat ways. Writing is great; the script adapts as much as it can from the novel, while allowing the film to breathe on its own. This production is loaded with excellent sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is nice too.Perhaps I'm biased, because this is another film where I see nothing really wrong with it. If anything, it feels like more of the same as LOTR, with the same construction as Fellowship of the Ring. Even if it is a blatant cash-grab, drawing out the material across three movies to maximize the franchise, it is still a fair crowd-pleaser. Given that we still have the desolation of Smaug and the Battle of the Five Armies to witness on the big screen, I'm certain that An Unexpected Journey is but a small taste of greater things to come; things that may prove to be as epic, if not moreso, than LOTR! At the very least, the film does perfect justice to the original novel, while delivering a fine spectacle. I couldn't ask for a finer film.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Ring: Beginning,"I never came around to read the LotR books before watching the movies and I actually haven't done that until now (so maybe shame on me), but I did read 30-40 pages of the Hobbit. And it seems, like almost everyone of those pages turns out to be in the movie. It's a big scene and it feels like Peter Jackson put almost everything in it. He apparently also put other Tolkien related stuff in it.Which he must have done, because how could you make 3 movies/parts out of one book? That is smaller in size than the original Rings trilogy that is. But what about the movie? It feels fun and it looks good (once you get used to the HD framing, which makes a few props look very plastic). Also the very HD 3D (or should I say the extra FPS) we got served made the movie feel like it was on fast forward. I think your eyes have to get used to that (in comparison to normal frames per Second that every other movie uses).Apart from the technical point of view, this is a well made movie, but it never completely touched me. It is well played and it has the beginning of a great adventure, but it feels a bit over bloated. I will obviously watch the other parts too and I'm pretty sure they will up the anteEdit: rewatching it a decade later, I realize I may have been a bit too harsh on the rating. I guess I do that with big budget movies. I can attest that I reckon I got used to the Higher Frame Rate the movie uses. Not that many movies have adapted that style (I reckon Avatar 2 will), but it is what it is. Technically you can fault the movie and the extended version was quite nice to see (so I guess it wasn't a literal rewatch - no pun intended).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit turns out to be a rather unexpected delight,"Firstly, I have to make a statement- the LOTR movies, for me, have set an impossibly high bar both in this universe and within the movie world as a whole. Their cinematic beauty and value cannot be denied.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, however, is an entirely different movie. Sure, it's set in the world of Middle Earth, but that's really about all it holds in common with the aforementioned trilogy, alongside a few familiar faces. Many members of the audience I was in complained that the movie took a long time to get going, but it actually was paced rather well, with a suitably sized introduction with Ian Holm and Elijah Wood making way for the current storyline. The first thing you notice as a viewer is that this movie is notably funnier. Whilst the LOTR trilogy had it's lighter moments, The Hobbit revels in the lighter side of life, with lots of genuinely hilarious moments interspersing themselves with scenes of real peril.The visually stunning moments are still there, and whilst I saw this movie in 2D, some moments would have been absolutely perfect in 3D. At first, it's a little difficult to get into, especially when the light-hearted opening with the countless visiting dwarfs gets underway. However, if you can remind yourself as a viewer that The Hobbit was a book written for a much younger, impressionable audience, then you'll likely have a good time watching this. That said, it is far from childish, and although it is a lighter, more fun affair, there are still many parts within the story that an adult audience can relate to.Martin Freeman has been a firm favourite of mine since his humble beginnings on British terrestrial television, and seeing him here on the big screen is both a welcome and bizarre experience. That said, his demeanour and technique are perfect for the role of Bilbo Baggins, as he exudes the homely, simple manner of a Hobbit very effectively. Ian McKellen is perfect as everyone's favourite wizard, and Richard Armitage (another former British television star playing his trade to the silver screen)is a brilliant Thorin (son of Thrain!), mixing a toughened heart with a tortured soul. If anything, Thorin may turn out to be the true hero of the piece. The rest of the dwarfs are also brilliant, and many of them are the highlights of the movie.The special effects are once again spectacular, with the eye wateringly stunning rock giant battle a particularly memorable moment. The makeup effects are up to the job, too, and the attention to detail is ridiculous, right down to the individual scratches and weathered look of the weapons the characters wield. If you enjoyed the LOTR trilogy, then Peter Jackson will have you in awe again, although The Hobbit trilogy looks set to be a much more relaxed and 'fun' adventure. At the end of the day, the only complain to be made about the movie is that it simply isn't LOTR. Those movies set such a high level that even Peter Jackson himself can't seem to top them with this effort, but that's a minor complain for what is otherwise I very well made movie.Cinematic, adventurous, enjoyable and epic- The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey knows its audience and caters to them very well indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I feel both love and respect towards this story!,"Beautiful cinematography, beautiful design, make-up, special effects. Everything is perfect. The cast is a joy to watch. Martin Freeman is great as Bilbo Baggins, Ian Mackellen can't be described in words, he is perfect as Gandalf as always. I actually thought he was even better here than in ""The Lord of the Rings"". He captured the atmosphere more. I loved that Elijah Wood reprized his role as Frodo even for a short period of time. He broke my heart in ""Return of the King"" with his powerful performance. He nails the character and I hope he will make an appearance in the next two movies as well. Oh, and the famous Gollum! How could I have missed him from my review? It's great to have Andy Serkis back.Please people don't listen to the critics, they are the ones who influence the public, but they are not always right. It has the same magic. Maybe in a less darker tone than the previous movies had been, but in a way, that's why I really liked it. It's like a deep breath from all the stressful situation the hobbits had been in ""The Lord of the Rings"". It's been a though year with a lot of good movies, but in the end, this still is among the best ones.Worth watching!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Why Does it Fail?,"With nearly the same creative team behind the masterfully made Lord of the Rings trilogy, why did The Hobbit trilogy fall so flat for most viewers? Was it merely that the bar had been set too high by LOTR? Here are the most plausible reasons I can come up with.1) They Tried to Remake LOTRThis is the single biggest problem with The Hobbit movies, the kernel of their woes. If not for this, they might have let del Toro remain as director. If not for this, they might have had good original score instead of derivative music with not a single memorable track. If not for this, they might have kept it as one or maybe two movies instead of stretching it into a trilogy. The money people wanted another generation-defining hit and, in their greed, they ruined any hope for The Hobbit to be good. The tone of the films does not at all match the tone of the source material. They used the source material as a plot guide while overlaying the tone and epic scale of LOTR - it just doesn't work. The Hobbit was a wonky children's story but the investors wanted another mature, adventure fantasy epic. The whole adaptation process was confused by this contradictory creative impulse.2) Poor Source MaterialThe Hobbit is an inherently challenging book to adapt to the screen. For one thing, there are too many Dwarves in Thorin's company. I consider myself a hard-core Tolkien fan but I can hardly remember more than half of their names. I certainly can't connect names to the faces of actors and it doesn't help that, unlike the Fellowship, their names all sound alike, all derived in some form from the Poetic Edda. The Dwarves in the company don't really do anything in the story either. They're just sort of there because 13 is an auspicious number. The only real characters in the company are Thorin, Bilbo, and Gandalf (Balin's role in the expedition to reclaim Moria having been retconned later on). The Battle of Five Armies isn't the climax of the story either, it's more like a dessert, a bit of action for the kiddies. It's described in all of like two pages but in the movie they tried to portray it like the Battle of Minas Tirith. The Hobbit simply does not exist in the same universe as LOTR or the Silmarillion or etc. - the lore links were penciled in later by Tolkien for those other works. The episode with Galadriel, Saruman, and the Necromancer doesn't even show up in The Hobbit.3) Over-Reliance on CGIThe LOTR trilogy was already suffering from this before it was through. In Viggo's words, The Hobbit was at least 10x worse. Characters feel weightless, their movements lacking the subtle imperfections of real people. The CG orcs look too clean, too crisp and the fact that there is not a single practical effects orc in the trilogy subconciously tells us there is no real antagonist - our heroes are just fighting a render (or worse, a dude in a suit with little balls all over it). There is no synchronization between action and audio. Weta Workshop's concepts are still just as good as the first trilogy, maybe a little high-fantasy by comparison, but their realization mostly or exclusively in CGI is extremely disappointing.4) Creative Exhaustion with the Source MaterialThey should have let del Toro direct. We would have gotten an original take on Tolkien's work which is exactly what was needed because, as previously mentioned, The Hobbit and LOTR don't exist in the same universe. PJ poured his soul into the original trilogy and he didn't have any gas left in the tank for The Hobbit - the money people brought him in because they thought it would make the investment safer. As it turns out, lightning doesn't strike twice even when you reassemble the same cast and crew. I think this is probably the least important of the reasons why The Hobbit failed, the financial pressures of the studios and the political situation in New Zealand might even have been more important factors, but I won't get into that.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit,"It's definitely no LOTR...But it's still a pretty cool movie. Sure, it took it's time to try to tell the story and dragged on for a little too long, but other than that, the special effects were great, and it was entertaining as hell. It's a good introduction to The Hobbit franchise.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Let the Magic Begin...,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" simultaneously takes director Peter Jackson in two different directions. While at first glance it may seem that he is travelling over familiar ground, again tackling the fantastical world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth after his vast and Academy Award wining ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001 – 2003), he is actually experimenting with cinema itself.Of all the art forms of the world, film is the one most invested in technology; created by scientists, not artists at the end of the nineteenth century. It was only at the dawn of the last century that people like Georges Méliès realised the potential of this medium. So it is appropriate that Jackson is here breaking new ground with the very way we watch films. Instead of shooting at the normal speeds of twenty four frames per second, he has doubled it to forty eight frames a second so when viewed you have an astonishing clarity of detail as well as smoothness in camera movement with no motion stutter or blurry jerkiness when shown in 3D.However, this raises a problem for the filmmaker. For a film set in a mythical fantasy land, any poor special effects or sub-standard computer generated imagery will stand out glaringly. So the effects work from Weta Digital is all the more impressive and astounding; from skin textures to the manifold buildings of Rivendell, it's sometimes hard to believe it's not all real.The acting, from Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen to Christopher Lee as Saruman and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, leader of the dwarfs, are all very good, inhabiting their roles with conviction and passion. Stand out though is Andy Serkis as Gollum, the famous riddle scene from the novel imported virtually word for word, and is all the better for it. Serkis has an uncanny ability to play these none too human characters with an enormous amount of vicissitude, a feat he pulls of here again with aplomb.This is primarily a visual motion picture, but the characters are not ignored and the extensive opening sequence set in Bilbo's house serves as an introduction of sorts to not just the people but the themes as well.Jackson directs with huge scope and a true feeling for the vast land he is creating, shot on location in New Zealand. The sweeping cinematography from Andrew Lesnie is suitably epic, making the landscape another character in the film.The film does have its flaws, mainly due to the fact that this is an introduction to a trilogy and not a self-contained movie; people might also find Radagast the Brown, a wizard, as played by Sylvester McCoy, to fall on perhaps the wrong side of immaturity. Still, this is a fantastic piece of entertainment and it's hard to imagine a better Christmas film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Tremendous Introduction,"The Lord of the Rings has been a timeless epic classic that is hard for other fantasy, Tolkien wannabe movies to capture its magic and so far, director Peter Jackson is probably the only one who can capture it. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of a split trilogy of its prequel. Though, J.R.R. Tolkien's book is not really that long for a split and the film is even a lot longer as the story's introduction. The result of the movie is it's rather too long and a bit slow but the experience is still worth it. With its spectacular visuals and grand scale, it's all pretty exciting. Despite of its stretch, the film's genuinely unique enjoyment made this easily one of the best blockbusters of the year.As it is said, it's too long for an introduction of the shortest Lord of the Rings story, but no matter what you think about the runtime you'll still get to enjoy it. The magic of the last series is still there. The only difference is the pacing and it has a lot of flashbacks but there's no denying that every scene of the film is entertaining. The film has some goofy moments with the dwarfs that are quite delightful and amusing. When it comes to the action, it's has the thrills and excitement that we don't usually get in most blockbusters these days. The performances are remarkable as always. Martin Freeman makes a charming young Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and still got it. Richard Armitage is filled with vulnerability and gravity as Thorin. Ken Stott and James Nesbitt gave their characters some wonderful personalities.Peter Jackson returns giving this the same epic tone and heart of the original trilogy. It's best when there's a genuine fortitude in the large suspenseful sequences. The visuals just got more stunning and eye candy. The CGI effects are exceptionally gorgeous. Same goes to the cinematography that made every landscape in Middle Earth look so magnificent. It's always been like that but with higher quality(and High Frame Rate) it's never been this marvelous. The music score is quite excellent, seems like it's going to be a new classic theme music.The ending of the film would definitely excite many for the next part. The film's scale made this such a satisfying cinematic experience. Fans of the series will definitely love it if they didn't bother about the runtime. Even newcomers might get fascinated. The trilogy split is still unnecessary. Ending up making this introduction pretty humongous, but that's what's awesome about this film. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey may be too long but it's still worth it by its amazing filmmaking and fun adventures.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great start to a new Trilogy!,"First off I have never read The Hobbit, but from what I gather the book isn't all that long, so the fact that this film is the first of three, suggests they may be milking it a little. That being said however I was very excited to return to Middle Earth for a new story..and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.This is the Prequel story to LOTR following the adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Frodo's Uncle played by Ian Holm previously) and how he came to be in possession on the ring.Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. .is quite simply a BEAUTIFUL film! I saw the movie in 3D and at the 48fps that Jackson intended and I was blown away by how it looked. It's a stunning film that left me with the same 'WOW' factor that the original trilogy did a decade ago. Set 60 years earlier than Lord of The Rings, We are introduced to a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). He is a content Hobbit, not concerned with adventure of any sort. Until Gandalf (Ian McKellan) suddenly appears, along with a group of unruly Dwarfs and offers Bilbo the chance to be part of a great adventure. The dwarfs wish to reclaim their homeland, which has been taken over by a huge dragon named Smaug, It's a simple concept and one that probably shouldn't be stretched over 3 movies but as with any 'first in a trilogy' film, it sets the stage perfectly. The movie has some great scenes.. meeting the Dwarfs in Bilbo's house, the run in with fighting stone giants and the escape from deep within the goblins' mountain are particular highlights. I loved the scene in which Bilbo runs into a familiar face (for LOTR fans) in the caves: Gollum (who looks amazing with todays MOCAP technology). Much of the movie, is the journey of the troupe back to the mountain, but also the journey of Bilbo himself.. mild and timid at the start of the film, our hero finds his courage, several times over, through the course of this film.Overall I loved this film, I thought it looked fantastic and the care of attention not just aesthetically but also in terms of continuity were obvious. These are Peter Jacksons films, no doubt. Much like he did with the previous trilogy, bringing us into a world full of heroes and villains, orcs and wizards this film literally (thanks to the 3D and FPS rate) literally transports you into Middle Earth.I am already excited to see the next instalment but to keep me satisfied until then..i may go and watch my LOTR boxset again . And them maybe this film again!Great stuff!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best movies (of any kind) I've ever seen,"The movie is amazing. It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a cinema. The vividness of the colors and light and movement is something to behold. And then the 3D takes it all to another level. It was a little unnerving at times. Almost as if I was watching a hybrid of a movie and a live action performance.The scenery is, of course, gorgeous. The acting is light, fun, playful while also managing to stay true to the original story. There is a little too much of the side stores for my liking. And it could well have been cut by a half hour or so and still not lost any of it impact and appeal.Martin Freeman is a revelation. Knowing him from The Office (I lived in the UK for a while) it hardly seemed plausible that he could carry off such a role, but he is very believable. The merry band of dwarfs are well played and you somehow get to know each of them by the end of the film. The special effects are, well, special. We were ducking as rocks and boulders came flying out at us and I swear there was a bird floating over our heads at one point. The surround sound was rich and evocative of the caves and the music is lush and emotional.As for the main story, well, apart from doing a prelude that reprises the role of Frodo and older Bilbo Baggins, it pretty much stays true to the text - with some audience members anticipating what the characters were going to say next.A word of warning - some of the battle scenes are very intense, made more so by the 3D and high definition used along with the sound effects. You may want to think long and hard about taking young kids to it.But for everyone else, particularly the young at heart, this first installment of The Hobbit is a gem.(note: I was very fortunate to see The Hobbit in Wellington last week. I was there on business and through a friend of a friend I landed a ticket. I was in in Cinema 1 of the Reading Cinemas - one of the two cinemas that premiered the film last Wednesday.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Expectations weren't high ENOUGH,"I was a mere child when I watched LOTR franchise and I still liked it. Ever since, year by year, I grew fonder and fonder of the movies and they remain, and probably forever will, one of my favorite movies of all time. I've read all the books countless times (including Hobit) and when I saw that Hobbit was coming into the cinema, my mind was entirely wiped away from its existence due to excitement that entered me.Now, movie review.As expected from Peter - almost flawless masterpiece. Given that he had a lot of material to work with, I imagine it was quite hard to put everything together for the scenery - yet he did it, once more. He captured the feeling of the book and transcended it onto a screen; of course, it was not solely his credit, to not be mistaken. The acting was amazing - perfectly fitting into fantasy style. The chemistry between actors was more than just the obvious - you could actually feel their interactions and live the story.

"The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey: Like Lord Of The Rings, if Lord Of The Rings was written by grade schoolers","Now don't get me wrong from the summary, I did enjoy The Hobbit. I enjoyed it in fact more than I expected to especially since I delayed watching them because of certain fears and frustrations I had regarding it.The Hobbit was the very first book I read back in the mid 80's and I adored it. I simply couldn't figure out how it could be turned into a trilogy! I feared it was being done so to milk the franchise and let's be honest that's exactly why it was done.The Hobbit has most of the charm of LOTR and all of its beauty. Top that off with a stellar cast and it was destined to do well at the box office (Which it did) However something was different, something was.....off.Though the film contains the same level of violence as LOTR its overflowing with comedy and goofiness. I expected some, but not to this extent. At one point it felt like I was watching Labyrinth (1986) again, not like that's a bad thing but I didn't expect it here.It looks great, its scored near perfectly and as mentioned the cast do a great performance and it was nice to see the likes of James Nesbitt and Sylvester McCoy up on the big screen.Inevitably there was going to be comparison with LOTR, that was inescapable and the comparison just doesn't help it at all. It pales in comparison and with all the silliness I found myself underwhelmed.The Hobbit is a passable effort but is more like the Mythica series than Lord Of The Rings.The Good:BeautifulExcellent scoreBrilliant castThe Bad:Some parts go beyond comedic into the realms of sillyMartin Freeman just isn't leading man materialGoblin town song, really?Stock scream was totally unnecessaryThings I Learnt From This Movie:Someone should never use the term ""Mothers glory box"" againThe distance Bilbo's sword needs to detect orcs/goblins changes between scenes, any particular reason?",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best of the Hobbit films. I wish the series was has good as the 1st half of this film,"I know people in general think the start of this film-basically everything prior to the Misty Mountains-is too slow and padded beyond what it should. I disagree. I think the first hour, hour fifteen minutes of this film is of the same quality as the LOTR. I wish the rest of the Hobbit films were as good as cinema and as thoughtful as adaptation as the first half. Instead the Hobbit series gets very action-y and very Hollywood after that point.The central flaw of the series goes back to the texts they are working with. The Hobbit novel has two aspects of it that make a post-LOTR film awkward. First the final quarter of the novel is *exceptionally* dark and this darkness isn't really set-up in the novel. Second, the Hobbit text doesn't flow organically into the LOTR. (Tolkien himself rewrote a key chapter after LOTR was published) Jackson and company had to decide if they were going to adapt the Hobbit or try to rework the material to flow better with their wildly successful film series. They chose the later for mixed results.The films are overextended-especially action scenes-and the Hobbit text gets mangled. But the films work well enough on their own terms and as preludes to the better LOTR that they are worth owning.This is in large part because the formal elements of filmmaking-but in particular the design work-are all top notch. Likewise the cast-McKellen and Freeman are their characters-paper over a lot of the warts of the screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson should be the only one allowed to make movies out of books ever,"This movie was so EPIC i'm speechless. I went with high expectations because Peter Jackson is awesome, but man, they weren't high ENOUGH. I couldn't see any flaw in this movie at all, they do change the way some events happened, but they're details and don't really change the story, actually you can tell they were needed.Jackson also adds some information, but he did say beforehand that he would, and is taken from other Tolkien stories, and as I haven't read them, I was very happy with the change because they were things I didn't know. The way the movie starts is very clever, and the whole introduction before the journey is almost exactly like the book, which I enjoyed very much. The fights scenes, just exactly as LOTR are INCREDIBLE,very well done, and with some funny moments as well. The cast is flawless, I think every actor portrays their character to perfection, I was happy with all the acting choices. The part of the book they picked to end the movie was great, the book though is basically divided into three main events, so it was somewhat predictable, but the scene they made to end the movie was perfect!!. So Basically if you're a Tolkien fan, or just LOTR-Hobbit fan you'll be puking rainbows of epicness throughout the movie.I had the luck to go to the premiere, but i'm obviously gonna go watch it again on IMAX.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"More beautiful than the book, yet simpler.","This is not going to be one of those long reviews, consisting of detailed writings about what was good or wrong, that is for you to decide, once it hits the cinemas. All i am saying to you, is that you should definitely find some time and read the book before you go and see the movie. Book is very complex, sometimes hard to keep up with, but has a bit more ambient depth into it, while the movie offers you all the eye-candy that even your imagination wouldn't be able to conjure. The movie is pretty, well acted and has a good script, that sticks to what was in the book, BUT, much less detailed (well, it is a movie, so that's normal). This movie is not enough to understand everything behind The Hobbit and the story behind it, but it does give a nice illustrative try to simplify things.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not groundbreaking but still a great fantasy experience!,"I Remember the first time i watched this movie in the cinema and i did not like it as much i thought i would! Maybe it was because my hopes were very high after LOTR and while this movie gad elements from that, it didn't reach the same level in terms of story and visuals!Jacksons overuse of CGI sometimes pull me out of it, but its not as bad as the third movie, which almost gives me headaches!But over the time i have learned to like the movie and look past its flaws! Compared to the first season of Rings of Power this movie is deffinetely not bad, and does a better job of conveying a story with characters you care about! When it comes to the source material this movie doesn't drag as much as the others! The scenes with gollum are ""hands down"" the best part of the movie!Overall a great fantasy experience that still excists in the shadow of its predecacors but entertains none the less!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Simply amazing! Manages to be even better than the Lord of the Rings,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" takes us back to middle earth and this trip back is even better than what I remember of it. The scenes and locations are more detailed and nuanced, the characters presented with more depth and subtlety and the action more frenetic and grander. The movie is an amazing technical as well artistic achievement in all aspects and absolutely a must see movie.""The Hobbit"" book is a simpler and shorter story than ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Being stretched out into three movies was expected to make it less epic and more mundane of a movie but that is absolutely not the case. Through sheer skill and artistry of movie storytelling, the plot feels absolutely epic and grand. While perhaps there is less at stake on middle earth than in ""Lord of the Rings"", there are more dimensions to the characters: doubt, guilt, frailty and a little extra space for humor and wit, which all paints a more colorful story.At every turn, middle earth brims with overflowing wonder, magic and excitement. The technical wizardry and artistry to create the breath-taking visuals and actions are indescribably amazing and everything is given an extra little more than last time around for us to soak in the intricate details and designs. The dwarf city inside the mountain with its blustering industriousness and craftsmanship, the serene Rivendale, the rickety goblin kingdom all are presented with so much more substance and detail that even though they resemble previous ""Lord of the Rings"" set-pieces, they feel completely new and refreshing. The technical prowess and skills of the visual effects department have gotten so much better and that indescribable feeling of awe I felt we had when I first experienced ""Lord of the Rings"" set pieces like Moria and Gondor is still evoked watching these new set pieces. Plus, they have also vastly improved their handling of differences in heights of the characters and the interactions feel more natural and fluid. Everything feels like it has multiple layers and depth: from Bilbo's house and pantry to the dwarf and goblin kingdoms to all the skirmishes and battles. Middle earth as is presented here is as close to the perfect fantasy backdrop as it gets.The new cast seamlessly blend into the middle earth world. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage as Thorin make the characters their own. Freeman's initial bumbling English demeanor and then the growth to an adventurer is skillfully done. Armitage wonderfully projects royalty and authority while still being constrained of being a dwarf. Ian McKellen's return as the wizard Gandalf is a more playful and comedic return while Andy Serkis's Gollum is more vicious and expressive than I remember him to be (this possibly is also due to some animation improvements in Gollum as well). The rest of the dwarf company are too many to keep track of individually but as a group they provide for the expected dwarfian physical humor but also the gravity when needed of a people who have lost their home. This generation of middle earthians are all around as wonderful a group to get to know as the generation from the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is simply amazing and is one the best movies ever made. With great storytelling, amazing visuals and very skillful acting, the movie grips you in a multiple of levels and never lets go. It is a movie to be seen as soon as humanly possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fan Service to a point where you roll your eyes,"Look I love this movie, but some parts of this are just over the top fan service. The music que from the original LOTR trilogy plastered everywhere, the overtop ""THERE HE/SHE IS"" characters for the sake of nostalgia bait are kinda lame. Its a solid story, you'd be invested in it quite a bit but I feel like this movie particularly was made in a warehouse full of green screen, native to the 2012 era of action film-making. It lacks a soul, and the whole experience of LOTR was cheapened by its constant fan service and nostalgia OST bait. I'm still on my third watch tho but I must say that its not aging as gracefully as the original Trilogy. I mean some of the chase scenes were straight up out of looney tunes!Anyway, that's my 0.02$",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A masterpiece by Peter Jackson!,"I enjoyed this movie to the max. Peter Jackson really outdid himself there. The Hobbit is a movie prequel to The Lord of the Rings, dealing with Bilbo (Martin Freeman), who was tricked into having a party at his abode. Earlier, a dwarf king rules a mountain until a dragon takes the gold the king has hoarded. That act cost him his life. Though Bilbo was very reluctant at first, he comes to aid when the Mountain Trolls steal the ponies, then capture the army for their dinner. Bilbo stalled them long enough for Galdolf the Grey (Ian McKellan) makes his move by cracking some light on the trolls: they fear bright light. Then they encounter the cave where they find the treasure and some weaponry in which Bilbo gets a sword for himself. This sword has a blue glow to it. Then after the separation of him and the dwarfs he encounter Gollum, a hobbit who was corrupted by a ring. Bilbo took it from him while he was eating the goblin. Following the battle, Bilbo proved his worth. This prequel has a very good meaning to it. Tolkien works will remember many things for years to come. It's great. 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
not bad,"I love the book, and the part of its adaptation is far to be uninspired. but, in strange manner, it is not more than...nice. a nice film , a decent try to use the succes of the first Peter Jackson trilogy. nothing unjustifid. except the difference between the two books and the sin of director to desire use the same tools and recipe. sure, it is a film who seduce. but the force of Lord of Ring is absent, the links between characters is fragile and the heroism has didactic aspect. result, a good choice for the young public. and that is all.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
too long,"This was too long... way too long. There is no reason to extend the movie to this length. The only reason I could see is that Peter Jackson doesn't have anybody who could say no to him. The pacing drags way too much in too many places. He tries desperately to add whimsy to this movie. However the slow pace and the hokey characterization really causes a lot of problems.Of course, this movie has all the Lord of the Ring grand scale... as expected. That and the fact that the characters are likable and the story watchable means it can't get anything lower than 7 out of 10. I certainly hope Peter Jackson will get a better editor next time who has the guts to say no to him. Let's tighten up the story, Peter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An adaptation of JRR Tolkien's much loved novel and prequel to the Lord of the Rings.,"I am a big fan of JRR Tolkien's work, both of the books and of the previous Lord of the Rings movies. Thus, I went to see this film with high expectations. Overall, I was pleased with the film. The colors were not as distracting as some have said (perhaps because I didn't see it in 3D), and I thought the majority of the cinematography was well done. I was pleased when I heard of the decision to make three movies out of the Hobbit--there's certainly enough material for it--but I was disappointed with the material they decided to put in this film. It's a lengthy piece, but far too much of the time is devoted to (beautifully choreographed) fighting. I think they could have shaved off at least 15-20 minutes of unnecessary violence. The CGI effects for the villainous creatures were great, but there didn't have to be that many of them. More time could have been spent developing characters or enjoying Tolkien's beautiful dialogue. That being said, however, I quite enjoyed the film. The first shot of Gollum sitting on the rock was everything I've ever imagined it to be. Gollum continued to be an enjoyable, interesting, and well-done character.A little less violence, more character development, and more dialogue would have gotten it a 10/10. As it is, great job.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A good film that suffers from a slow start,"Xarnis's review: It seems I'm in the minority here, but I like this movie. I don't know of its because i've read The Hobbit, the trilogy, and the Silmarillion, or what. And while it's definitely not as good as the original trilogy, it does a fair job of setting up the next few Installments. Unfortunately, at some points, it does feel bloated and uninspired.The performances are pretty good all around, but the standout is Martin Freeman. With this and Sherlock on BBC (where he plays Watson), Freeman has proved himself as a great actor with some good comedic timing. The effects are spectacular, and the battles are well-choreographed. The score is basically the same as the original trilogy, but it's still enjoyable. The effects, and the performances make you feel like you're back in Middle-Earth again.One highlight scene happens between Martin Freeman's Bilbo and Andy Serkis' Gollum. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's great and makes you sad that Gollum won't appear in any of the later movies.Unfortunately, the film has quite a few faults that cannot be dismissed. It's length could've easily been cut down to 2 hours, and the early portions of the film (especially a scene featuring actors from the previous trilogy) are fairly boring. The Dwarfs introductions were especially painful, but said dwarfs (the first five or so) have important roles to play later in the story. The ending is questionable as well, as is much unneeded content.Overall, I found The Hobbit enjoyable. Maybe I'm giving too much credit because I'm a fan of the books, and can appreciate some of the extra content. I still liked the film on second watch, and I hope the next installments will make up for this one's faults.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Hobbit — A true treasure, and now the new top fantasy movie","The Hobbit has always been the little brother book of The Lord of the Rings. However, in their movie version, it feels the other way around.For one, technology for CGI is better due to a number of years of innovation. Then, each camera shot looks fuller, as if, maybe due to greater CGI, Peter Jackson had stuffed more details everywhere. That's probably not the case, because after reviewing all the work that went into TLOTR, it seems impossible to do better. Maybe he simply got bolder.One thing is certain though, he, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens got really comfortable with Tolkien's work, enough to get creative, and deviate from the book on many occasions. With the help of a new addition to their team these forays completely respect the spirit the original work, as well as pick information out of The Silmarillion and TLOTR. I must warn fans though, that they do play with the original timeline of certain external event unrelated to The Hobbit.That being said, it's a roller coaster of a movie, especially once in the goblin caves. The encounter with Gollum is priceless. The dialogs are fuller than TLOTR, there's no statements of the obvious like Legolas was wont to do, no over-sentimental lines, and no waste of time. I credit the writers and director's heighten confidence.Even with all that, the council in Rivendell felt a bit weak, but it's the only scene that let me down. There's also the annoying detail about Thrain having a mental illness. I don't remember any such thing, he was no different than any other dwarf in that respect, and it adds nothing to the story. Those are the only negative things I have to say about the movie.If you want magic, adventure and fantasy, it's now the ultimate movie. Go see it in IMAX. The 3D has too many panning in the beginning, giving us more blurs than I care for, but it gets better fast.It's a must, for anyone, and everyone who doesn't mind 3h40min at the theater. The IMAX seats are a blessing in that sense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The swashbuckling first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit Trilogy—the much awaited prequel series to the ubiquitously acclaimed The Lord of the Rings Trilogy—based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, or There and Back Again. The trilogy's second and the third installments viz. ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" and ""The Hobbit: There and Back Again"" are scheduled to release in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey presents the first part of the quest undertaken by an artless hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and a band of vagrant dwarfs to help the latter reclaim their lost kingdom from the clutches of a fiendish dragon named Smaug. During the course of the journey Bilbo and company must always remain wary of the dangers lurking in the shadowy avenues of the Middle-earth. And the sooner they learn to trust each other's instincts the better would be the odds of their survival.In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson once again shows why he is hailed in the film circles as an auteur par excellence. When it comes to the fantasy genre Jackson truly has no equal. An Unexpected Journey serves to be a visual spectacle of a very unique kind, one that appeals both to the soul and the intellect. While one is dazzled by the movie's visual sumptuousness, it's quite difficult to overlook the emotional subtext—most evident in Bilbo's homesickness and the plight of the dwarfs who have been driven out of their rightful dwellings by a ferocious usurper. It's indeed awe-inspiring to see the way Jackson manages to strike the right kind of balance between style and substance.Overall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an exhilarating cinematic experience for viewers of all ages and groups. Vintage Jackson, the movie serves to be a fine specimen of masterful storytelling. Unlike most modern-day movies of its kind, An Unexpected Journey never lets story take the backseat and while technology plays a pivotal part the real emphasis is always on the movie's plot. Most of the sequences in the movie are beautifully crafted. The one in which Bilbo encounters the ever so spiteful Gollum remains my absolute favorite. While the movie's use of CGI and VFX is quite exemplary in itself the 3D and HFR effects serve to be a real icing on the cake that makes the movie quite unique even in comparison to its predecessors. Jackson manages to elicit worthy performances from his entire cast of actors. An Unexpected Journey has set the ball rolling for the final two installments of the trilogy, but what still remains to be seen is whether it would be possible for Jackson and team to match the success of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, both from the financial as well as critical point of view?A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I Thought It Was a Lot of Fun/Could be Hobbit Forming,"There seems to be an element out there that are afraid that IMDb is going to rank a movie too high. That it is their duty to give films low scores, rather than an honest appraisal. This has something to do with keeping the ""Fanboys"" in line. We don't want to be dictated to by people who are really involved in these kinds of movies. This seems juvenile and dishonest. If we weren't so jaded by the ability to produce special effects beyond our previous imaginations, would we be so cynical. The story is the story. The characters are the characters. Don't criticize Bilbo because he went on the quest, betraying his comfort level. That's what happened in the story. If you want to be critical, look at the elements of film making. I agree that the beginning is quite slow. It takes way too long to get things running. But once they begin the quest, they begin to face off with some incredibly amazing adversaries. If you read the book, you don't see a lot of character development. Gandalf and Bilbo are interesting, but it is in the classic tradition of courtly love. We don't really get to know the Knights of the Round Table either because it is their feats that are the thing of legend. They have a quest and they face off against the unknown, armed only with legend. The result is a series of amazing tasks going to the nth degree. I thought this was quite remarkable and look forward to the next installment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Do Not Listen to the Critics!,"Okay, first off I have been waiting for this movie for many years now and had ridiculously high expectations. However, before I went and saw the midnight showing last night I read all the critics reviews to see what to expect. Almost every single review complained about the pacing of this film, and compared it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy saying it was not as epic blah blah blah and so on. Do not decide based on those reviews. After seeing the film I realized my original expectations were not even high enough. Honestly the pacing was faster than any film in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy so I don't understand that complaint. Also, all the extra material, ie. the back stories and such, did not seem like random tangents but help with character development and some even serve to tie in this new trilogy with the original Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I wouldn't have it made any other way. Even my sister, who did not particularly like Lord of the Rings, said that the story did not drag on. Also, when deciding to see this movie do not listen to what they say about the HFR 48fps. Whether or not you enjoy this version all depends on if you want to feel like you are watching a film or feel like you are in the story with the characters. Personally, I thought the 48fps was absolutely gorgeous. It is not for everyone though. Take it from someone who is a film major in college. This is one of the few movies that have been released recently that I walked out of the theater wanting to walk right back in and watch it again.

It's Like the First Part of a 9-Hour Short Film,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the extremely highly anticipated prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is the first part of the story of Bilbo ""the Dildo"" Baggins, and how he helped the dwarfs reclaim their city from the dragon Smaug.I do like the original trilogy. I think it's a well put together series of films that can sometimes be really epic. So I was looking forward to The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Now did it live up to my expectations. No. It disappointed me. A lot.The movie feels extremely drawn out. I kept thinking the entire time for almost every single scene in this movie that ""this scene could've been shortened by many minutes"". I mean, let's think about it: It's a children's book only with around 300 pages, and it's being adapted into three movies that last about 3 hours each! And for that reason, The Hobbit's length feels so forced. It seems like the entire movie could've been done in an hour or even just 30 minutes. The dialogue just seems to have been stretched so far. I'm betting the writers were extremely bored with writing this movie, because it's all so dull.On the good side of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the special effects are absolutely incredible! The sets, locations, characters and action scenes look so good! The movie also does a good job on recreating a lot of the same elements from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.And the best scene in the movie is the one with Gollum. That was great.I saw the movie with 48fps, and I gotta say that I'd really like it if 48fps replaced 3D as a visual gimmick in the theaters. Because it makes the movie more immersive and the action scenes more fun to watch. The 3D is also good, but nothing special.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is disappointing. It's way too long compared to the story it's telling (which also isn't very interesting to begin with), most of the characters are forgettable and while the visuals are good, the CGI characters go a bit overboard. I mean, the Orcs in The Lord of the Rings looked way better than the ones in this. But the visuals and nostalgia factors make the movie tolerable. Overall, it's OK.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Repetitive and repetitive,"Never managed to read the books but overall I enjoyed the Lord Of The Rings film trilogy with its relentless use of cgi cartoonery taken to its limits in furtherance of the story. So I was also looking forward to seeing this, the prequel being also a trilogy. Some people may want to call it Art, I call it maximising the potentialities of this particular revenue stream. After director Jackson has done with it maybe he'll find a way to continue the saga, in the same way that Dune, Shannara and other tales have been resurrected in print more times than Frankenstein.Band of ragtag dwarfs looking for a home come unbidden in Bilbo Baggins the anti-hero's home to devise a way with Gandalf the hairy wiz to get their home in the Lonely Mountain back from the clutches of the Smaug dragon. Who unaccountably loves gold. One tedious chase or flight leads to another, however I suppose the tension does alternate between the tedious and the tiresome. The story development is almost nil because of the screenplay elongation and repetition in the real Quest to get money from the hordes of Smaugheads. The cutting edge cartoonery is used to the max, this alternating between impressive and laughable. Repetitive, complete and devastating mayhem rules yet there is no doubt there will be no casualties (except in the game version): vast mountain ranges thumping one another over their heads, half a million goblin-shapes against 14 are great odds, and falling miles into jagged ravines the brave band is as indestructible as Captain Scarlet would've been. Sometimes from a distance it looks like millions of hieroglyphics zanily slipping and sliding about a page. Gollum looked more like an old fashioned cartoon in this outing though, methinks someone was trying to save a few bob on him. I love all kinds of cartoons but this is unlovely. This was a motion picture I've just watched passively, not a game or I'm missing the controls.Most kids under 20 years old will be entranced by it, older kids will face an increasing problem: they've seen it all before, and in this case within the same film too. It's incredibly well made in most visual departments and I enjoyed it to a point but along with most other ordinary films I've watched will never ever watch it again.

Quite why Jackson et al have decided to turn it into a 3 episode overblown epic is unknown. Well, apart the extra money of tieing people into 3 films instead of 1. However, the cracks caused by the necessary padding (the book itself is smaller than a single Lord of the Rings tome) appear almost immediately the film starts, with rambling exposition and tedious backstory (inaccurately elaborated on from Tolkien's appendices and notes) taking up some 90 minutes of the pre-journey film.Once things get underway we are set for new lows as the 'humour', which up to now has merely been forced but dreary, becomes childish with snot jokes and toilet seat thrones making a 'comic' appearance. Yes the Hobbit is a children's book, but you'd not take a child to see the film as it has its fair share of decapitations etc, so don't make adults sit through 'jokes' only a 5 year old will laugh at. Oh, and I daren't even mention the bunny pulled sled! More Narnia than Nazgul, and far more likely to appeal to Harry Potter and Twilight fans than Tolkien devotees, this is painful indeed.All characters are forgettable with the small exception of Bilbo and Gandalf. The 13 Dwarfs meld into one and are all forgettable and interchangeable. We then have the de rigeur trawl through battle scenes, no dount in an effort to generate that LOTR nostalgia. But where in the LOTR trilogy they were epic engagements, here they are laborious affairs with no personal engagement, no sense of peril, just an excuse for a battle on screen.Then there is a backstory with Pale Orc Azog, a one dimensional villain with none of the motives of Sauron, the machiavellian nature of Saruman, or the deception of The Nine. Again, easy for children to understand but nothing here for an adult.We then have a massive abuse of Deus Ex Machina, with Gandalf literally being a walking Deux Ex Machina machine (just as well as his magic amounts to a few smoke rings and some lights). Perhaps the book is like this, I cannot remember but things seem far more noticeable on film. Perhaps because we are adults now such writing sticks out like a sore thumb, or perhaps Jackson's treatment of the material and the new writing just throws it into sharp relief. Whatever, it just feels hackneyed.Anyway, remember to set your alarm to wake you up by the time this rambling, overly-verbous and nauseous mess has finished.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
you NEED to watch the extended versions,"It's maybe hard to believe, but it's literally 2 different experiences. Normal versions feel rushed with bad flow - this is main reason many didn't like the movies, they watched the normal version, and not the intended one.Director's cuts flow a lot better, have scenes that make other things make more sense - you're just robbing yourself if you watch normal versions instead.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Overall Solid,"I read these books as a kid, many times. I expected to have my heart broken a few times during the movie. And I did - there were a few additions that I found baffling, and a few things left out that I think should have been there. But overall the movie held together, and captured some of the magic that the book did once upon a time for me.I do take umbrage with the fact that they turned it into 3 movies. I find this a bit silly. Maybe, maybe 2 movies, maybe. But they not only turned it into 3, but then added material to make it 3 really damn long movies? Bizarre move. And it would be one thing if they just added material from the Silmarillion, but they start making up characters and events... I don't know. Just let the source material do its job, executives.Anyway, that aside, it's good. Obviously by the money it's making and the fan base, it will do fine, and hasn't disappointed anyone too terribly.

Fears be gone!  You shall not pass!,"Being a huge Lord Of The Rings fan (my favourite films of all time) I met the Hobbit with trepidation. Especially after some of the reviews aren't as glowing as they were for the original trilogy.""It's too long"", they moan. Well, not for me – the 169 minutes flew by. Sure, the opening three-quarters-of-an-hour did were spent solely in Hobbiton but, being the first part of a trilogy, it needed to. It was nice being back there, listening to Howard Shore's majestic score and marvelling at the lush (as always) scenery. It was like coming home to an old friend. Ah, the Shire, how cinema's missed you.""It not as epic as Lord Of The Rings"" they bark. Of course it's not, it's not supposed to be! It would be foolish if they tried and replicated the scale of Rings. OK, the ante is ramped-up considerably from the book so it was still pretty epic albeit with a slightly lighter touch, whilst still maintaining the same feel and tone. I was back in Middle Earth.""They overused CGI!"" they cough. Yes, there is a lot of CG but it didn't feel out-of-place (like the Star Wars prequels). The important thing is, the CGI characters actually ""perform"" which gives them weight. The main big-bad Orc ""Azog"" grew on me as the film went on and proved to be a great villain that you don't want to see die too quickly (I won't say if he does or not). Which is a good sign.Martin Freeman was simply superb as Bilbo (no longer ""Tim"" from The Office) capturing all of Ian Holm's older Bilbo's mannerisms. His comedic timing is impeccable, with just subtle facial reactions being enough to make you smile. Ian McKellan was brilliant as always and praise has to be reaffirmed on Andy Serkis for his performance as Gollum, once more stealing the show. The ""Riddles In The Dark"" sequence being an absolute triumph. The dwarfs were decent also, even though half of them weren't given much to do (maybe they'll get more in the sequels) the stand-out being Richard Armitage's ""Thorin"" who made for a suitable hero figure.Along the way there are plenty of neat touches and nods towards the original trilogy, implying there are darker things to come. The success in this is that it feels like it could've been made alongside the older films. Whereas many sequels/prequels after 10 years can lose the magic and essence of their predecessors, The Hobbit does not. It gets the balance just right.That's not to say it's a perfect film. There are a couple of silly moments, like the dwarfs surviving a ridiculous fall in the mines and Sylvester McCoy's surplus-to-requirements animal loving Radagast – but those moments make up for about 10 seconds of its near 3 hour run time. And, no, it's not as good as The Lord Of The Rings. But then, it didn't need to be – and nor did I want it to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Exquisite Attention to Detail,"My conclusion upon watching this film and talking to others about it, is that if you are a fan of the Tolkien Universe, and not just the individual stories, then you will be a fan of this movie. That is because of the remarkably skillful inclusion of countless minor details and subtexts that Jackson has drawn from the Tolkien canon. The great thing about the Hobbit, both as a book and now as a movie, was that the lighter subject material allowed a greater exploration of the world of Middle Earth, so much of which is never actually written about in the Lord of the Rings. Places such as Mirkwood, Dale, the Kingdom of Angmar... before this movie they are just names on a map. But now Jackson has brought them to life.I was really worried prior to seeing this film, that it wouldn't live up to its predecessors and would veer into childish cliché. But this movie is such a magnificent rendition of Tolkien's world that I was left breathless after the first viewing, and have watched it with satisfaction about ten times since. Everything is spectacular - the acting, the costumes, the scenery. The dialogue is witty and I still laugh at the troll scene after watching it a dozen or so times. Jackson tackles the difficult task of characterising thirteen dwarfs with mastery, and you will find yourself growing attached to them and all their individual quirks (from the eye candy of Kili and Fili to the warrior Dwalin and the comic relief of Bofur and Ori). Special mention to Richard Armitage, who absolutely blew me away with his portrayal of Thorin Oakenshield, truly bringing that character to life and adding so much depth to him that wasn't included in the book. Ian McKellan is spectacular as Gandalf, as always, and Martin Freeman is just perfect as Bilbo. I could not be happier with this movie! As a Tolkien fanatic, it satisfied everything I dreamt of seeing in a movie rendition of the Hobbit. I can't wait for the next movies now, and pray that the same level of quality is maintained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An unexpected mediocrity,"Returning to Middle Earth felt a bit like a school reunion. I was pleased to be back, but slightly embarrassed and curiously unconcerned about former acquaintances. Two screenings caused me to wish they had left Tolkien's book well alone.Peter Jackson can't be blamed. Or maybe he can be. He adapts the book so faithfully (or at least the first 50 pages I've read) that you wonder why he bothered.The truth is The Hobbit is an inferior story to the Lord of the Rings. It's that simple. Compared with the grave prospect of the race of Men's extinction in Rings, this is kids' stuff – as Gandalf says, 'an adventure'. I could not watch it as a separate, distinct film. I saw it, and I'm sure others did too, as a direct prequel to Rings.Why didn't Jackson make The Hobbit first? That he didn't, I think, is significant. Perhaps 15 years ago he didn't feel it was worth putting on the screen. Perhaps he didn't then feel the story was epic enough. Perhaps three billion reasons forced him to reconsider.Whilst my second viewing (from a better vantage point) impressed me slightly more, nothing is new or improved. That's the paradox. How many sequels and prequels do we rue because of their deviance from the original? My complaint isn't that Jackson doesn't give us what we want; it's that he gives us what HE wants. Is this a director at the height of his creative ability producing something just because he can? The 1:3 book-to-film ratio would indeed suggest so.Yes, the Orcs are scarier; yes, some of the fighting is bloodier; and yes, the Pale Orc Azog is truly menacing, especially with his improvised left arm, but compare these things to what's not so good. All 13 dwarfs are bereft of any character. At least Gimley was funny. The film felt desperately dragged out, despite some stunning sequences, including an exhilarating fight with goblins and a stunning bout between rocky mountains! The often dubious CGI cannot, however, be excused.I am not optimistic about the next two films. Sure, I'll see them. I don't mind being proved wrong. But if this is to happen, some serious tweaking needs to be done before December. At the very least they ought to make Smaug look like he isn't from Mike the Knight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The one hobbit to reunite them all,"I was 12 when I read the entire work from JRR Tolkien for the first time. It was a revelation to me, a new world fill with magic, heroism, beauty and epic battles. Those stories are all about how we can all stand up and bond together in front of the most dangerous and perillous ennemies that threatens our lives or our family( death, disease, war etc...). These books inspired me throughout all my life and knowing the source material for this film I didn't anticipate it at all like a LOTR bis.Does the hobbit live up to my expectations ? YES and so more ! I felt ""at home"" immediately and it was like reuniting with all friends. The 40 or so first minutes may seem stretch for many but in my opinion necessary to introduce the quest and the dwarfs. One scene in particular is already cult it's shown in the trailers and loved by many : the dwarfs singing in front of the chimney. Wenhever I heard that song I feel shiver down my spine and goosebumps !The journey is filled with beauty as we can see again the gorgeous landscape of Middle earth(New Zealand) but with dangers that leads to great actions.The acting is top-notch as every main actors fits perfectly their character : sir Ian Mckellen IS Gandalf forever in my heart, Martin Freeman IS Bilbo like I never could imagine him and Richard Armitage IS Thorin Oakenshield in all it's heroic glory.There are so many things to say about this movie but at the end of the day all I can say is go see it and make your own opinion. This film is long and yet entertaining and as it is the hobbit already win it's challenge : to reunite the work of JRR Tolkien.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Silly yet serious, just as it should be.","This movie is sillier than it's older brother, something you could predict from the pictures of the shaved and silly looking dwarfs.It doesn't bother me that the younger dwarfs are more shaven. And the sillier looks don't bother me either, it was the perfect bland of serious and silly for a movie about a children's book that will one day become an epic saga.This is made for a younger crowd. It is still great for an older crowd, but it is perfect to get the kids/teens who are just discovering all the awesomeness there is to see in this world.This gets them interested with the sillier bits, and it gets them hooked with the more serious bits. Then, when they are older, they can fully enjoy Lotr.Lotr was a serious movie with a shimmer of silliness shining through at times. This is exactly the opposite, and that is how it should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Humour, action and tension. What more does one need?","As an avid movie watcher, I was very excited to hear two years ago that The Hobbit was indeed going to be filmed. Two years later there I was walking into the cinema with a bigger butterfly in my stomach than when i went to see The Dark Knight Rises. Was it going to be good? As intense as The Lord of the Rings? Would i like it? I went in (after 15 minutes of waiting for a drink) and got my seat and watched it.I can now say that it was the best money and time i have spent this year. It swiftly took the top spot for my personal favourite film of 2012. I loved the humour which i had heard so much about and i loved the choice of actors for the dwarfs. As soon as i got home i was telling my friends to go and see it, i highly recommend you go and see it if you haven't yet. Everything works in together, everything makes sense, and everything seems to add to the The Lord of the Rings experience. It improves the understanding of Middle Earth and how everything came to be in the story of The Lord of the Rings. I had one concern about the film, and that was whether it would be as dark hearted as The Lord of the Rings ... and i can honestly say that it is definitely not. Don't get me wrong, there is the darkness there but it is lessened by the great humour. I will be buying this on Blu-ray, it definitely deserves it.To conclude. Just go and see it!Thanks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An amazing return to Middle earth!,"I'm not going to spoil this for anyone so therefore this will be a rather short review.Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Andy Serkis and basically everyone else were just brilliant, they really are a great cast and it shows. Especially Gollum who is so dimensional, actually at one point I teared up because he was so cute (when you see the movie you will know.) The story is great, it's action packed and never leaves you bored or restless. Not even in the shire, the movie didn't feel long or dragged out - in fact it could almost be longer!All the dwarfs are fun, the CGI is amazing (the trolls, OH MY GOD, it felt like they were actually real!) except for Azog the Defiler who for some reason felt a little too unreal, but it definitely wasn't bad!I loved every second of this movie and I'm definitely going to see it again, but don't compare it to LOTR because it's not. This is The Hobbit so enjoy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed!I saw this in 48 FPS, which was really odd at first. But like everyone else said you do get used to it after a while. It really depends on who is watching to tell if it's good or not, i'd probably say that if you're content with the usual 24 fps format and don't really like change then don't watch it but if you're feeling adventurous and is open for new things i'd say go for it!Can't wait for Desolation of Smaug!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Don't trust the critics, it's a great movie","The Hobbit is an extraordinary movie and deserves a lot more than it is getting. For some reason critics are giving the movie ""average"" reviews which doesn't make sense. The reason for this is because of expectations. Critics expected the movie to be like The Lord of the Rings and they didn't get that. They got something a little bit different. But that is not a bad thing because The Hobbit is a really good movie.So to clear things up expect something different than the Lord of the Rings. You will notice some similar elements but you will also notice some changes and this is because The Hobbit (book) was a lot more lighthearted than The Lord Of The Rings. The Hobbit is an adventure, the Lord of the Rings is an epic. This is what the movie does great at: it feels like the book The Hobbit and doesn't try to act like The Lord of The Rings. And it shouldn't try to be The Lord of The Rings because IT ISN'T!One of the things that I loved about this movie that stood out the most to me was its great sense of humor and dialogue. The character interaction is very good and each character has their own specific traits and characteristics. I give two thumbs up to Martin Freeman for playing the perfect Bilbo Baggins. He truly mastered the role and I couldn't have asked it to be any other way. Back to humor, there were many (a LOT) of moments where the theater burst out into laughter. The movie is genuinely funny which is one of its greater aspects. Now don't get me wrong, the rest of the movie is great but I just wanted to point out that the movie is funny and the characters are very well made.A lot of people have been bickering about the whole 48 frames per second thing (it was 48, right?) and I just wanted to say that you shouldn't worry. I heard a lot of problems and complaints about it but honestly if Peter Jackson had NEVER said that it was in 48 fps no one would've cared or even noticed. It looks great and really smooth. It didn't take away from the experience at all and I'm glad Peter Jackson filmed it in 48 fps.For those of you concerned about plot changes you shouldn't worry too much. There are some plot changes and I wouldn't say that they were necessarily for the better but they didn't harm the plot. The changes were mainly to explain the Middle Earth universe better and to explain some things that are important to know but weren't in the Lord of The Rings (I'm looking at you Radagast The Brown) and I can say that Radagast was well done even though he wasn't entirely necessary. He was in The Lord of The Rings book but not movie so he had to be shown eventually.The visual effects are very good and I recommend 3D but everyone has their own preferences. The CGI was very good and is , of course, well ahead of its time. If there is one gripe (and this is my only real gripe for the movie) it is that the movie uses CGI way too much. The movie was a CGI feast and didn't rely on the standard special effects of The Lord of The Rings. Why is this a problem? Because in 10 years CGI will look outdated but high quality special effects will never look outdated which The Lord of The Rings has proved. Also I would say that the animators got a little carried away with the King Goblin and his horde. It wasn't terrible but it was a lot less serious and didn't seem too threatening, but that is more accurate to the book.Oh yeah and good job Andy Serkis! The scene with Gollum was priceless and very very well done. I was surprised with how well it came out and I was also shocked out how Gollum was lovable and scary at the same time. It was really good.Overall The Hobbit was a really good movie. The acting was top notch, the humor was great, it followed the spirit of the book well and kept itself lighthearted at all times and it has an awesome soundtrack (though a lot of reused tracks). The only gripes for the movie is the use of too much CGI and a couple of distracting side plots which changed the pace of the movie randomly. Still an excellent movie. Go see it for yourself!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very good film. Lives up to expectations.,"There were worries the film might be too long, there were worries that it shouldn't have been split into three parts and then there were people who thought it may have been too light hearted to be taken seriously.How these worried souls were wrong.The films pacing is perfect, it never felt too long and at the end of it I was asking for more. It is very similar to the first Lord of the Rings film where it isn't the most action packed but it does have a great story and all the characters blend into it really well and are easily liked and enjoyed. There is a certain amount of humour especially from the dwarfs but what can you expect, that is their personality from the books therefore it had to be portrayed on screen and it did give it a family element to the film yet it didn't stray too far from the seriousness of the story.Very solid acting, the scenery is fantastic (I only watched in 2D) and the film I enjoyed thoroughly. Do not listen to the bad reviews you WILL enjoy this film.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I should have stayed in my Hobbit Hole.,"I was excited for this new movie. It looked stellar. I like Lord of the Rings, of course, it's a great story, but I actually like The Hobbit more. I like the Hobbit because it sets up Lord of the Rings, it's a lot simpler, less dark, and it's generally ignored in favor of its bigger sequel. And I remember seeing a cartoon adaptation as a kid, which was my first introduction to the whole franchise. I really like The Hobbit.Like I said, I like The Hobbit because it's simple and can be explained lickety-split. The Hobbit is just one easy to follow narrative. Bilbo goes with Gandalf to kill a dragon. That's about it. Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece, don't get me wrong, but there are more characters than in a soap opera, tons of subplots, and lots of tangents about the culture of Middle Earth and so on. I like short, sweet, succinct stories. And that was one reason why I didn't really like the Lord of the Rings movies: They were long, drawn out, full of confusion, and I always felt like The Hobbit should have been made to give us some exposition as to who Bilbo is and what he's doing in his relation to Frodo. That's important.So I hear The Hobbit is coming out, right? I go down to the movie theater first thing, get some popcorn, and I'm prepared to hear the much less complicated, fun story of Bilbo and him going into Gollum's cave and getting invisible with the ring and everything. I'm all juiced up. The movie starts out great, really adorable, just like it should. Bilbo is in his little Hobbit hole, and Frodo is there, and then Bilbo is out on the front porch smoking some pipe-weed, and Bilbo is like, OK, I have this really cool flashback. So we go to the flashback.I'm all pepped up to see Bilbo go with Gandalf and kill the dragon and everything. But first, we just see Bilbo lazing around his house, and then Gandalf and the dwarves burst in, and you'd think they ask him to go with them and kill the dragon, but nope, they sing and dance and goof off and throw dishes around for a while. I mean, it's funny, and all, and it adds some light hearted humor, but they're on an urgent mission, they don't have time to dawdle. Then, they start out on their mission and everything, but they meet some creepy things, and then some more creepy things, and then some more creepy things, just for good measure, and I'm like, ""When are they going to get on with it and start killing the dragon and everything?"" But then they meet some more special-effect creepy things, just for good measure.Seriously, it made this fantasy way too creepy.So finally, we get to the part where Bilbo meets Gollum in his cave, and I'm very excited, because Gollum is my favorite character in the whole thing- no kidding, I love the little creep- and they bounce some riddles off one another, and Bilbo gets the ring, and Gollum is angry, and then Bilbo leaves. And that part was good. And now it seems like it's taken quite a bit of time to get to the part with the dragon, like maybe a whole hour-And now, I'm wondering just where the dragon comes in, where the dragon gets speared in the heart and everything, but Bilbo and Gandalf just keep going, onward toward the dragon, and then it says, ""To be continued..."" and then it's the end. Credits. And I am like, ""What the Hell did I just pay my money for?"" Being a misinformed lout like myself, I rarely check to see if a movie is supposed to have sequels or not... and I didn't check here. The title itself is misleading. It says, ""The Hobbit- An Unexpected Journey"". I didn't know it was the beginning of a fricking TRILOGY. I just thought it was about the JOURNEY that Bilbo goes on. I should watch out for subtitles more often.And here's where it really nips me in the keister. The Hobbit is a very short book for an epic fantasy novel. Only about 95,000 words. In the nineties. It's simple. The Lord of the Rings is composed of three super long books- all over a hundred thousand words. They need a trilogy to explain them. The Hobbit does not need a full trilogy to explain it. The director is just making a trilogy so he can rake in some more cash. And it bugs me because most people who see the movies already know how the story ends anyway. I saw the second one, thinking maybe that would end it, but nope, there was another one, and I didn't see it, so I don't get to see the end. But I really don't care. The whole thing is dumb. Really dumb. To set a whole trilogy off of this one standalone novel is like making an opera about The Cat in the Hat. It's just too long. Some of the stuff in this trilogy isn't even in the book, the director just pulls it out of nowhere. The movie would be nice, if it was just one movie. I suppose I could buy all three movies and watch them back to back, waste 6 hours when I could only spend 2. But I just won't stand for it. Everything about it is OK- except for the fact that it's way, way too long for a story about a goofy little guy with hair on his feet. call me shallow, but I'm giving this only a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I couldn't have expected more from this movie!,"I really don't understand all the hate that seems to surround this movie. It's only been out for some days, and hate is already streaming on the internet. Some even call it ""the new Phantom of Menace""... Really!? The movie has it's flaws, but that is just plain silly. Rather than trying to top the previous three films in every way possible, Jackson tells an entirely different story. The plot does somewhat resemble the previous, but it's all taken from the book so you can't pick down on that! Much from the book has made it into the film, and you can easily work out what it was! We've already come to know and love most of the characters in this movie, so it's much easier to relate to the movie at once! The character development is still there, and I think we will get more in the extended edition!In the technical area you will hear no gripes for me! First of all, the cinematography is awesome and beautiful as hell! The new HFR format is mostly to thank for that. The picture is so sharp and detailed that you'll probably need 5-10 minutes to get used to it, and I promise that you'll be blown away! Howard Shore's score is awesome and fits the movie very well! However, in the first three films all of the orcs and goblins were in fact real people. In this movie they are mostly just CGI, so it takes a little away from the sword fights. But the CGI and action is still quite good, and the props likewise!But one of the best scenes we have in the movie is truly the return of Gollum! The whole riddle thing is fantastically written and expertly transformed into the film! I could watch a whole movie with these two characters talking riddles! Andy Serkis certainly haven't lost his touch on Gollum, and he delivers yet another striking, intriguing and brilliant performance as Gollum! Maybe even the best. We also have Ian McKellen back in action as Gandalf, which is awesome! He's a little older but it doesn't matter. Martin Freeman truly defines the role of Bilbo just with his first scene! I like Ian Holm, but I almost forgot him when Freeman appeared on-screen. Richard Armitage is likewise brilliant as Thorin, and delivers a great performance! Much have been made about the character of Radagast the Brown aka ""the new Jar Jar Binks."" Sylvester McCoy is a decent actor and the character wasn't that bad. He was very silly indeed, but he didn't receive much screen time... probably a good call.If you're a fan of the first three movies go watch this! It's got some really beautiful props and the action is very good! You know and love the characters, and you are acquainted with Middle-Earth! The movie is entertaining and fun and you forget the running time! I couldn't have expected more from this movie!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Movie delivered,"The LOTR trilogy which came out in movie theaters 11 years ago is one of the best trilogies and most successful of them ever made. So to say that The Hobbit movies coming out has a little bit to live up to would be a very big understatement.I'm glad that Peter Jackson ended up being the director of the trilogy since his style of filmmaking is perfect for Middle Earth based stories. Guillermo del Toro would've done a fine job himself but PJ was basically born to make these movies. His style of being able to make movies with the action, fantasy, humor and story structure like this brings a certain style to this movie that other directors wouldn't have been able to pull off as well.And for the fans of LOTR who haven't read any of the books you get introduced to a bunch of new characters you haven't seen before but also get some returning characters from the LOTR trilogy like the characters played by Frodo, Bilbo, Smeagol, Elrond and Galadriel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too much of engineering is too bad,"I would like to send a message to Peter and crew: Too much of anything is good for nothing. I watched ""the making of Hobbit movie"" in Youtube and I noticed people slogging with deadlines on their head, people enclosed in rooms working on setting background music, cinematic effects etc.. This is not a good/healthy way of creating cinema.The movie was good with exceptional shots and sound but it lacked consistency: the fight sequences were rather stretched with ""Age of empire style music"", you know, like ""just get done with the fights and move on"" kind of thinking. The CGI was clearly evident, too much of pixel shading and pretty dented graphic configurations.I request the movie makers to be more natural, let the deadlines stay dead and work outside the studios to stay in touch with reality and not get carried away with too much of imagination and fantasies.""Imagination is a medicine which could turn into poison if taken in excess"".Hats off to every low fps part of the movie: exceptional cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A brilliant screen adaptation!,"I was always a bigger fan of the Lord of the Rings than of the Hobbit. It's only logical: The Hobbit was written earlier, it's a children's story, it felt to me like it was a rather inconsistent story about dwarfs with a mission hopping from one plot obstacle to another like people go to random attractions in a fun park. However, I did enjoy the story! Still, it had some flaws.Then the movie came out and it's absolutely brilliant. They added just the right things to give the story more 'balls' and increase the suspense, they were loyal to the concepts in the book that were most essential, ... They turned the book into a timeless adventure for a very wide range of viewers.Like the Lord of the Rings was a meaningful story about 'carrying on', having the courage to fulfill your destiny, the importance of friendship and so much other timeless wisdom; the Hobbit was exactly that about 'having the courage to take the leap', leaving routine habits and taking a risk, taking off on a journey to freedom and adventure, to 'whatever doesn't kill you can only make you stronger', ... It especially appeals to us, tiny Belgians of Flanders, who are actually the real life versions of Hobbits, dying of old age in the exact same tiny village we grew up in, never taking risks, saving up money our entire lives just to put it in a sock under our mattress and pass it on to our children when we die, always worrying about money while we have this elaborate social backup system, never launching an idea that hasn't proved to be successful elsewhere first, etc. This is a true story, more so than some other dark and gritty realistic stories about family conflicts.Peter Jackson gave this story exactly what it deserved. Azog gave it more force and 'necessity' and added more suspense, the dwarfs got more individual personalities (while in the book, they sometimes seem more like 'that bunch of dwarfs'), etc. An Unexpected Journey lifts the Hobbit up to a whole new level.Of course, as one might expect, there are a lot of 'true fans' verbally demolishing this movie 'because it's nothing like the book'. It's probably the very same ones who thought The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a terrible movie adaptation just because Tom Bombadil was never mentioned. But although I have in fact, you don't need to study film and literature extensively at university to realise a movie is a completely different medium and that novels are not necessarily better than their film adaptations (e.g. The Chronicles of Narnia for example).I was thrilled when I heard they were going to turn The Hobbit into a trilogy adding extra content from the Silmarillion, the Appendix of the Lord of the Rings and the notes on the Hobbit from Tolkien himself to improve a novel that (he would have been the first to admit) was flawed. All the flaws the novel had were straightened away by the movie and, with a proper understanding of the medium, I'm sure that eventually Tolkien would have agreed.I am convinced that this is one of the best screen adaptations 'ever'. It remains loyal to the themes and lore of Tolkien, the emotional connections and it even takes into account the notes and comments by Tolkien and reckons with the rest of his oeuvre, making a brilliant connection to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. People shouldn't forget the novel was written by Tolkien more than 75 years ago (for his own children) without the intention of ever having it published and that a very literal translation of the book to the screen simply wouldn't work. Peter Jackson is one of the few who understands that adaptations should be creative rather than literal and should elevate the entire work. And I haven't even mentioned the wonderful talent at WETA yet and the way a Tolkien story lifts the creative power of Howard Shore up from all the composers in the world to an unreal, intuitive and almost spiritual level.This is a great movie definitely worth seeing! I'm very much looking forward to the sequels!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Don't Let Some of the Critics Deter You, This Is Fantasy at Its Finest","I found myself reading a number of mixed reviews from a vast array of critics this morning, trying to make some sense of what they were saying. I ultimately came to the conclusion that their complaints were tinged with bias. Granted most of them weren't necessarily bad, but mixed. I will admit that the film does start out somewhat slow, but looking back after experiencing the entire movie, I wouldn't have it any other way. The beginning of the film makes you care about the group as a whole, but more importantly, it makes you care deeply about the key characters: Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. This is not the LOTR, it is an entirely different animal. The Hobbit is more of an adventure than an epic like the LOTR. Once the adventure began, I found myself becoming engulfed in what was coming next, and what new story we would stumble upon. I have read the Hobbit, however I have not read the Silmarillion. Throughout various parts of the film, Jackson incorporates stories from the Silmarillion to expand the universe even more. These took me a little while to get used to, but once again I soon realized how much they added to the story, and how much more they made me care about Thorin, Gandalf, and the entire Dwarven cause. The 48 FPS was absolutely spectacular, it takes movie escapism to a whole new level. I felt as if I was a part of each and every scene, soaking in the beauty of the landscape. Not only was this movie well acted, and well produced, but it was extremely well written. The film delves into ideas, and goes deeper as the film progresses. What really happens in the fight between good and evil, and what truly makes a hero? These questions are asked in this film, and that is the most important part. If a movie simply looks good, and has no substance, it would be a mediocre action flick with no legacy. But, when a film both looks great, sounds great, and FEELS great, then it is art. The Hobbit is art, and I am positive that it will only get better, the Hobbit has not yet been fully realized, but it is on its way, and while it may have its flaws, it has a heart, a brain, and tons of ambition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Go watch this dammit!,"Blew the critics, many people on my country too said the same thing, it isn't in the book. What the heck? What book? the hobbit, take look at the Unfinished stories, the book itself written in 1937, the history of the hobbit, read it too, and you will see there is a story of a White Ork.BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST what did Peter Jackson done right?He kept the songs, most people don't know the significance, how many of you fellow readers started to sing when Richard Armitage started to sing the misty mountain? I have sang the song with the dwarfs, I started to laugh when they sang That's What Bilbo Baggins Hates, I was fallowing the beat with my feet too. The troll song was there too. This is one of the many things MR. Jackson showed us.MOST IMPORTANTLY, they talk in their own language, Orks,Ogres, Goblins, Trolls all the abominable monsters you saw can talk, they have their own dark language and guess what? They talk in that language, elves talk in elvish, and Orks talk in Orkish and that's my friends is authenticity and many directors ignore that.The First 20 Minutes of the film, took me back a decade ago, the first time when I saw Fellowship Of The Ring and made me took a deep breath like I have returned home after a long trip and I felt good.OK film is great but not perfect, how and why, I think there was to much action at the end of the film, to much running around, and hacking and whacking, I don't know maybe I'm getting old but I missed few scenes in that chaos, other than that this was a fantastic film, with fantastic writing and with a fantastic job to put to screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"The best graphics with the worst script and editing, together","I watched this in 3D and I'd have to say, the graphics is as real as it gets. Absolutely stunning, I can't imagine how many CG artists have worked on the amazing details of the 3D models. Definitely one of the most photorealistic CGs I've seen to date, yet. The best graphics however are totally ruined by a boring and slow storyline. The plots move on extremely slowly, and after the first hour I was already beginning to wonder when the movie will end (unfortunately it's 3 hours). They tried to throw in funny spots in the script but did not work at all, the dialogs just feel stupid. Throughout the movie, the actions are repeated over and over again and boring. The editing is also poorly done. I don't feel nervous or excited watching the main characters fight at all, there are too much fighting scenes of the same kind and I ended up just watching the beauty of the computer graphics instead. I could not enjoy the storyline at all. Overall? Don't waste 3 hours of your time on this movie. It's not worth it, it's not motivating, it's not touching. It's just some sort of demonstrations of how good our 3D computer graphics can get today.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Jackson aims too hard to please,"As of 2012 and 2013, the initial reaction is to compare the fantasy journey among noble dwarfs and elves, and ignoble orcs and trolls, to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which technically occurs after this adventure.Director Jackson did a supreme job on the trilogy, but no matter what you do, you can't please everyone, and he too unprovoked heat from both sides of the fence. Some purists insist on using everything from the book, including Bombadil and his overly blond Hitler idealism. While the dorks wanted less character and the sort of goofy arcade room look in special effects that make the crack heads happy.Jackson goes out to appease the dorks in this one. Not a bad move, but certainly lacking in originality. Here, we get a bit more ""formula"" than what we would want.The abuse of effects enhance the comic nature of this story. The three trolls act so much like the Three Stooges that it is obvious Jackson was alluding to them. One of Jackson's signature stamps is the way he alludes to classics, high brow and low brow.The fellowship of nine from the trilogy includes Gandalf, Frodo, and seven others. This one includes Gandalf, Bilbo, and 13 others.With 12 serving under the one, it's not as easy to keep tabs on the characters.Since ""The Hobbit"" is done in trilogy format, Jackson appears to be comfortable to gradually let us learn about the 12 minor dwarfs. Here, 3 of them take center stage a lot, and 2 others a bit less. The other 7 are very anonymous.Most of us won't hold that against Jackson, so long as he does more character development in the next film.However, it's one thing to sacrifice the rapport for action, but quite another to sacrifice it for mindless drivel.However, as it is part of a trilogy, one looks at this as a third of a film, or a third of a story. It is often the comedy that brings out the pathos of tragedy. Wen we live and laugh with a group of characters, we are filled with even more sadness when some die.The accents are very thick, good for purists, but not for viewers. We rarely know what is being said, so while the big screen is great for the spectacle, it will be better with the closed captioning on a small TV screen.Not all of the detriments are Jackson's fault. Remember that Tolkien wrote the Middle Earth saga with some inconsistencies. The orcs look bigger, more like the Uruk Hai, but perhaps that is because they are compared to dwarfs and hobbits. The contrasts in size don't appear to be correct at times. And the orcs look much more muscular than Tolkien intended.Now, that was the problem with the film. Not much of a problem, is it? More like a nit pick.My rating shows that it is indeed a nit pick. First of all, the film lasts well over two hours, but you come away from it thinking you spent less than an hour watching. That's the sign of a top director. It flows and moves effortlessly.Next, Bilbo himself is a great character here. He is a throwback to old style films, of the golden age, the forties, fifties, and sixties.Like the ring trilogy, the hobbit begins with the status quo, which changes. That's what makes this sort of story so magical. You begin in a shire, and wind up facing trolls, goblins, and dragons.Jackson makes the climactic point of the saga, the point which fits into his entire Middle Earth legend, a point to remember. It is, of course, the point of Bilbo's mercy towards Gollum, which is done quite dramatically. This is the part of the film that is the classic moment, and Jackson knows this.Not that there aren't other great moments. There are. When we do get to characters, Jackson shows us what a great director he is.One of the great questions to be answered, since we know the Necromancer is Sauron, is whether Saruman is already duped by Sauron. It looks pretty evident that Saruman is already against the forces of good.This takes us to the ""breath of fresh air"", the character that makes this film quite unique, and gives Jackson a stamp of originality. There has to be at least one ""cool"" character in a saga of this magnitude.Enter RADAGAST THE BROWN, another wizard, like Gandalf. With him, Jackson has literary license, as Radagast is merely a name in the book, a name for a good wizard, but still mostly a name.Radagast becomes the cool cat of this story. His presence is not of our era, but one for the past and for the future. As Gandalf puts it, one with a great heart, and of great power, although he scarcely looks the mighty wizard.Radagast, Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarfs give us a great group of characters.This looks like it shapes up to be part of a great trilogy, but is lacking on its own. It still needs the next two parts to justify it. I would rather the film stand on its own as a film, but it doesn't. It leaves you hanging, much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did. Many people like ""Empire"" films the best. To me, they are the least. In either case, they are necessary if you want to watch the entire trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Return to Middle Earth,"It's been 9 years since we left Middle Earth, but we never knew that we would ever return to the land of enchantment – the land of dwarfs, elves, wizards and even the littlest of people – hobbits. As the intro to the movie shows us, it shows us what will be and then tells the story of a young, but naïve hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He never knew of an adventure until a certain wizard showed up at his doorstep.But as the movie goes on, we are re-introduced to familiar faces – Elrond, Galadriel, Saurman, and the ultimate villain of the entire series – the ""precious"", the conviving Gollum. All he wants is to live with the one thing that anyone could ever ask for – a long life of misery.It does not surprise me that Peter Jackson has revisited Middle Earth. It is a place of magic, a place of enchantment. We are just so intertwined into what was originally written by Tolkien and the magic of Jackson – it just makes you want to visit as often as you want.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the biggest movie of 2012 and what a way to end 2012. I can't wait to see what the next 2 installments will bring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazed!!,"I went in with an open mind despite being one of those who follows critics most of the time. To my surprise this turned out to be one of my favorite movies. It truly was a joy to watch this movie. I don't want to say much, I am mainly writing this (not much of a review) for those who follow the critics and may probably end up not seeing this on the big screen, well, please do watch it or you might regret it. There is not one single scene in this movie that I would take out, I think the length of the movie is totally justifiable with the content provided, I thought the pace was perfect. The casting of this movie and the voice acting for CGI characters are absolutely spot on. How often do we come across fantasy movies? Rarely. Fantasy or not, for those who love movies do yourself a favor and watch this as I am definitely going to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Expected Disappointment.,"I approached The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey with trepidation, fearful that Peter Jackson, a director whose career was born of excess, would go unnecessarily way over the top, as he sometimes did with his The Lord of The Rings trilogy (particularly Return of the King), and pretty much all of the time with King Kong (unforgivable, seeing as he already had a perfect cinematic blueprint to work from).And go way over the top he does. Frequently.With the film split into three parts in order to milk as much cash as possible from Tolkien fans, Jackson is given plenty of opportunity for bloated action scenes, the adventure becoming more preposterous as it progresses, its characters surviving the most perilous situations, often with little more than a scratch to show for their remarkably lucky escape from almost certain doom. The use of crude humour is also excessive, designed to please younger audience members for whom burps and bogies are comedy gold, but a lot less funny for adults.But perhaps what is most frustrating about The Hobbit is that, despite all of the expensive CGI laden effects sequences and the silly slapstick from its band of merry dwarfs, the film's finest and funniest moment takes place in the peace and solitude of an underground cavern between just two characters, reminding us of what a great director Jackson can be when it matters. If only there had been more movie-making of this calibre during the three hours it took to tell only one third of what is a comparatively short book. Sigh!6/10, a rating which some people might think is far too high given my review, but I sure ain't giving it less than I gave that damn giant ape catastrophe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"If You Enjoy Revisiting Middle Earth, the Hobbit is Astonishing -- A Masterpiece of English Mythological","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a projected three-film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's ""the Hobbit"", the first fantasy book written by Tolkien taking place in the mythical ""Middle Earth"". Many decades before the recent film, ""the Hobbit"", originally published by Allen and Unwin UK in 1937, ushered in the beginning of the quest fantasy genre of modern fantasy which has been copied many times since. And yet, Tolkien's original novel about a hobbit, a smallish humanoid living on the edges of a mythical world called ""Middle Earth"", who by chance becomes the pivotal character of a quest among dwarfs, holds up surprisingly well even after 75 years.Peter Jackson has once again provided a mesmerizing screen adaption of one of Tolkien's most beloved tales. The look and feel of Middle Earth is equal to and possibly even better than Jackson's adaption of ""Lord of the Rings"" ten years earlier. But even aside from the look and feel, the acting of the characters stands up well. Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, is the reluctant adventurer, a hobbit who would rather be smoking his pipe and perusing his books than outwitting trolls and goblins. Hobbits enjoy reading about adventure instead of actually engaging in adventure. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, the wise but eccentric wizard whose presence is the very face of Middle Earth. Richard Armitage plays Thorin, the displaced heir of the King Under the Mountain whose dwarven society was shattered by the dragon Smaug. The other dwarfs which make up the band of misfits all have their lovable eccentricities as Tolkien had forged them.While the story itself of a band of dwarfs seeking to reclaim their home and treasure which was plundered from them by the ominous dragon Smaug is quite well-known, some of the inspiration behind the story may be less well-known to most readers and movie-goers. Tolkien himself was raised in small medieval-like towns in the county of Worcestershire. These humble towns in the English countryside ring strikingly of Tolkien's Hobbiton. Both Bilbo Baggins and later Frodo Baggins will leave Hobbiton and become enmeshed in great epic quests and battles, somewhat similar to when Tolkein became a young man and entered into the epic conflict of World War I. These same themes on a grander scale will play out in ""the Lord of the Rings"". Also, Tolkien was a scholar of medieval and Nordic mythology, and these stories were intended as a kind replacement for the lost English mythology and lore resulting from the Norman conquest of 1066.I think the main issue for movie-goers is whether or not one wants to revisit Middle Earth and hang out there for nearly three hours. If you do, then there are almost no shortcomings at all to ""the Hobbit"". A few sequences went on a bit long, particularly when the dwarfs are taken hostage by Goblins, and other long-winded sequences in which the CGI effects are used ad infinitum. At the same time, the film is true to Tolkien's original vision. Jackson's intent I believe is to immerse the viewer into Middle Earth as if the audience is part of the quest along with Bilbo and the Dwarfs. Also, the scenes with the most ghoulish character Gollum, do not drag on too long. In all an absolute triumphant of high fantasy filmmaking. But if you're taste is not in the realm of fantasy of this type, it may be too much. All I can do is offer my condolences.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually Stunning,"When Peter Jackson decided to re-enter Middle Earth, I was skeptical of what he would come up with. I guess that's why it took me six years to watch this film. It's a visually stunning film to say the least, better than the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This first film in the Hobbit trilogy was great.A lot of the actors from Lord of the Rings returned, except Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin.

Watching the film now, I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for anymore than 3 Oscars; nor won any of those three, especially for visual effects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: When Bilbo Hitchhikes and Ends Up on a Dragon Hunt,"At first, Bilbo is just a chill guy, cozy in his Hobbit hole, thinking he'd spend the rest of his life smoking (legal) herbs and munching on cream pies. But nope, Gandalf, that wizard always brimming with ideas (and probably something else), recruits him for an epic quest: reclaiming a house squatted by a psychopathic dragon. And just like that, Bilbo finds himself on a road trip with thirteen dwarves as crazy as a bunch of CrossFit gym fanatics.Don't expect a sweet Disney-style adventure. No, these dwarves aren't singing ""Heigh-Ho""-they're dragging you into an odyssey filled with disgusting goblins, stuck-up elves, and creatures uglier than your reflection after an all-nighter. But hey, it's Middle-earth, so anything goes. And where it gets funny is that Bilbo, this shy little Hobbit, starts toughening up, realizing that his new team can't even have a picnic without attracting orcs.Visually, it's classic Peter Jackson. The New Zealand landscapes are so stunning that even your Windows wallpaper will feel inadequate. But the first hour of the movie? It's like waiting for your latest video game to install: it's long, it drags, and you start yawning. But once it kicks off, magical creatures get thrown at you, and suddenly you're settled in your seat, ready to feast your eyes.Special shoutout to our dear Gollum, that little schizophrenic genius who makes every scene as twisted as the script of Fight Club. The famous scene with Bilbo and ""the precious"" keeps you on edge, with this mental duel between a lost Hobbit and a creature scarier than a horror movie marathon. Andy Serkis, as usual, crushes it, and you can't help but think maybe we've all got a little Gollum inside us. Except we're not that ugly (well, maybe).And of course, there's fan service to remind you it's the same Middle-earth as The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf's throwing mysterious quips, Elrond's brooding as usual, and even Galadriel shows up to shine in all her glory. The writers even decided to invent a new elf character, just to remind you that The Hobbit is a big-budget flick having some fun. But hey, we're not complaining.In the end, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey takes a bit too long to get going, but once it does, it throws enough epic scenes at you to keep you glued to your seat. The landscapes, creatures, and that good old Middle-earth magic do the job. And while the first part makes you want to check your phone, the rest snaps you right back into action. Buckle up for a trilogy that's just getting started, because this is only the beginning of the madness!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The narrator is under the spell of a manipulative eye,"First of all, we need to have some perspective. Roughly speaking, Middle Earth was not conceived from the outset as a coherent mythology. The Hobbit was written first, a simple bedtime story for Tolkien's own children. Then over the course of the next decade, bit by bit he stretched that into the apocalyptic conclusion of LOTR, while furnishing but ultimately leaving unfinished the entire cosmogony behind it.There are two reasons why I think the endeavor proved such an overwhelming success. One is of course the cunningly crafted narrative; in both Hobbit and LOTR, our eyes in the story belong to what amounts to child or childlike protagonists—'halflings'—around which, he erects a cosmogonic struggle between gods and sundry ancient beings far beyond what we can readily imagine.And because he was an erudite man in his field, and wanted next to the fairytale to indulge his passion for language and myth, this allowed him to tinker with all sorts of minutiae that looking back upon, satisfy a sense of unearthing something whole. Overall, it is a simple but powerful effect.The second reason is more subtle, but every bit as powerful; the books came with maps. More on that in future posts.The rest of Tolkien's creation is seriously hampered by his romantic feelings towards archaic notions of harmony (to the point: Melkor's discord in the celestial music as the birth of evil), but at least this double perspective is worthwhile and creates gripping fiction: child eyes inside the story as we explore huge machinery, and visual—bird's eye—control of mapping the imagination.So nevermind what Jackson did or didn't to the original story of this. Nevermind too the obvious rehash of his Fellowship: Shire preparation, Erebor and the battle at Moria as historic background, perilous journey over mountains, Rivendell and ""something moves in the darkness.."", Goblin Town as Moria including the bridge standoff, Boromir's Uruk-hai death (almost).And I am okay with Jackson's decision for this to be another epic and 9- hours in total, and firmly behind his decision to loosely expand this beyond the limits of a pretty messy book. It feels good to be back, and though Tolkien liked to regard his work as a solid saga, in reality it emerged in a constant state of flux, rewrite and embellishment—if anything, Jackson is keeping true to the spirit of it.So what the heck is wrong with this?Jackson eliminates the double perspective—we are never, with the exception perhaps of the scene with the stone giants, both inside and hovering above the story at the god level. The hobbit disappears in the noise for large chunks of story. The funpark ride through Goblin Town is a major offender of this: the camera swoops in amazing ways, but we don't have an anchor inside the ride, and this is the reason (not bad cg work) why it feels fake and video-gamey. How exciting to imagine the scene in Tony Scott's hands a la Unstoppable.The big problem though is that Jackson, as exemplified in his Kong, is a poor storyteller, he has no sense. The film IS padded and overlong, because he has not found a powerful center, and this is where he should have proved his mettle, since the book—modestly conceived in the 30's— lacks that center.Look, we know who the Necromancer is. We know at this point that this is the prelude to world end—far from what Tolkien originally conceived. Furthermore, the film IS the memoir of an old man, here's the great part, already at that point under the spell of a manipulative eye. And a member of the fellowship is the author of the most captivating narrative device in the whole Tolkien universe: Balin of Moria.So, there are 6 more hours to ago of this. But, I am simply aghast that Jackson secured such a huge cinematic canvas, so rife with narrative possibilities, and is wringing out the same old blockbuster nonsense. I take offense as an appreciative viewer of well crafted cinema.This is pss poor entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfection!,"The Hobbit seemed like it would be a difficult book to make into a movie. In one way, it is a silly children's book with some silly characters. But the situations these characters get into are really life threatening and scary! Also, even though they are continuations of the same story, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have very different tones, with LOTR being very serious throughout.I should not have worried, though. In Peter Jackson's capable hands, An Unexpected Journey, the first part of The Hobbit comes to life in a beautiful way! He captures the silly moments, but tones them down just enough that they blend with the harrowing and frightening situations encountered on the journey without seeming jarring. The acting is all top notch with Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins being completely lovable and charming! In this first part of the story, we are just getting to know all the dwarfs and their tales, but already we are rooting for them!I've seen this movie in regular 2D and in IMAX 3D 48 fps and enjoyed it equally both ways. The movie was more visually brilliant in the 3D 48 fps, but that was offset somewhat by the distracting reflections I continually saw in the periphery of y 3D glasses.I highly recommend it his movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Inappropriately Grandiose,"Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a mighty epic fantasy, well over a thousand pages in length in most editions. Although Tolkien intended it to be a single novel, his publishers, for commercial reasons, issued it as a trilogy. (It is still often published in this form). When Peter Jackson adapted the work for the cinema, therefore, it made both commercial and artistic sense for him to make three separate films, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"", each based on one of the elements of the trilogy.Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", by contrast, is a relatively short book, in my edition only some two hundred pages long, much shorter than any of the three elements of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It was originally intended for children (although it is the sort of children's book that can easily be enjoyed by adults) and is much less complex in terms of its plot and in terms of its themes than ""The Lord of the Rings"". It could easily have been made into a single film of around the standard two hours duration. I was therefore dubious when I heard that Jackson intended to turn the book into another trilogy, rivalling ""The Lord of the Rings"" in length.Tolkien's story tells of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and of his companions, a group of thirteen dwarfs and the wizard Gandalf, as they set out to rescue a hoard of stolen gold from a fierce dragon. It also tells of their various adventures at the hands of the other inhabitants of Tolkien's imagined realm of Middle Earth- trolls, goblins, elves and animals. The book can be read as an introduction to ""The Lord of the Rings"", which is supposed to take place some sixty years later, because it introduces characters such as Gollum and Gandalf, who will play an important role in the later work, and because it tells of the earlier history of the Ring, which it will later fall to Bilbo's nephew Frodo to destroy.""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is the first part of Jackson's second trilogy. Although it is nearly three hours in length, it only covers the first few chapters of Tolkien's book, which means that the original story has had to be padded out a lot. This is done by showing in great detail matters which are only briefly described in the book (such as how the dragon Smaug obtained the gold from the dwarfs in the first place) and even by introducing events which do not occur, and characters which do not appear, in the book at all. Some characters from ""Lord of the Rings"", such as Galadriel and the wizards Saruman the White and Radagast the Brown appear in the film, although they do not actually appear in Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". (Radagast, who only plays a minor role in the later book, was omitted from the film version).I have given this film a relatively high mark, because it has many virtues, most of them shared with the first trilogy. Visually the film is very attractive, with a brilliantly imagined world of Middle Earth, set against some striking photography of the New Zealand landscapes. The various malevolent beings of Tolkien's mythology, the trolls, goblins and wargs (huge, ferocious wolf-like creatures) are all successfully realised; the vulgar and stupid trolls largely serve as the film's main comic relief. The very talented composer Howard Shore again provides the musical score, as he did for the first trilogy. Several of the actors from the earlier films, notably Ian McKellen as the wise, kindly Gandalf and Andy Serkis as the wretched Gollum, successfully reprise their roles, and there are good performances from newcomers Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm returns as the older Bilbo) and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the determined and headstrong leader of the dwarfs. The other dwarfs, on the other hand, apart from the fat, lazy Bombur, do not really come across as sharply-defined individuals, but this was also a weakness in Tolkien's book.I will reserve my final judgement on the wisdom of turning ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy when I have seen the other two instalments, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and ""There and Back Again"", but ""An Unexpected Journey"" has confirmed my initial suspicion that this lighter, shorter book was not really a suitable candidate for the full heroic fantasy treatment given to ""The Lord of the Rings"". Too often Jackson and his scriptwriters seemed to be guilty of padding out a very slight text in order to produce something inappropriately grandiose, and I found myself wishing that he could have found an alternative format for filming ""The Hobbit"". 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A visual treat, just like LOTR","First of all, The Hobbit, as we all know, is a prequel to the LOTR. So technically, there would be nothing different. How can it be any different?. It will be the same Shire or Rivendell or Mountains or any creature. So The Hobbit will not satisfy the viewers who are expecting surprise like the LOTR did. Story, its about the hobbit, who is not a brave warrior or hero. So, stop expecting another surprising film like LOTR. This will be a familiar film for all the LOTR fans.If you cut down your expectation, You have everything to look for. This film has a nice story, wonderful action sequences, very good performances and ground breaking visual effects. Cast and the technical team did their job perfectly. You don't need know anything else actually.Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing the Middle Earth to big screen again, that too in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
a bit self-indulgent,"Let me start by saying The Hobbit was casted incredibly well. Martin Freeman was the perfect Bilbo, mostly due to his comedic timing with a good balance of heart as well (similar to Pipin & Merry in LOTR) that would have made the film to heavy otherwise. Gandalf played by the always fantastic Ian Mckellan is able to shine comedically as well, being the occasionally ambiguous (trickesy hobbitses!) and light hearted Gandalf the Gray we all loved from The Fellowship. New guy Richard Armitage as Thorin the dwarf, is featured heavily and has to carry the film at points. Armitage has had the hard task of making his character likable, without using humor (Bilbo does steal the show in that respect). The other 12 (is it 13) dwarfs are handled very well considering there are so many of them, you take away a few characteristics and quirks from all of them, that do add to the humor of the story as well. Andy Serkis is able to once again able to channel Gollum's comedic and tragic identity seemingly without effort.The cinematography is as beautiful as it always is. If any movie wanted to make you travel to New Zealand this would be the one. As far as the frames per minute (some people feel as if they are watching a soap opera) as long as you have an HD t.v and you are used to it, the frames per minute shouldn't bother you too much. The 3D is a different story. Prepare yourself for some minor vertigo for some scenes. I am disappointed in Peter Jackson when it comes to he 3D it was completely unnecessary, and heavy handed. (If you want lessons on 3D go and see Hugo) The CGI was well done for the most part, but was heavy handed as well.The Hobbit was a bit self indulgent, and probably would have been better in two parts, but overall it was a very satisfying film. From the ambitious action scenes to the comedic dialogue, The Hobbit will be sure to satisfy fans of the novel and action lovers as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A potential for an amazing trilogy,"Finally Peter Jackson graces us with the prequel to the best film trilogy (The Lord of the Rings) with ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"". Obviously people are going to draw comparisons to the two, however, we have yet to see the completion of The Hobbit Trilogy so it's hard to make a strong comparison just yet. But we can see that there is a different tone for The Hobbit, a lighter tone with humour sprinkled on the film which is done in a tasteful way.First of all, praise has to go out to Martin Freeman for an amazing portrayal of Bilbo Baggins. He looks the part and plays a certain naivety and innocence and we get to see his character development throughout the film, and there is enough room for his character to develop throughout the trilogy. As a LOTR fan it was a treat to see Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman and Frodo within this new Middle Earth adventure.The Hobbit is full of great adventure and epic scenes. Favourite scene is the riddle scene between Bilbo and Gollum, it was so simple and engaging, to see two contrasting characters interact the way they do. The dwarfs are a great bunch, and praise for how their songs were included within the film.Initial comparisons of the two (LOTR and Hobbit) are that The Hobbit has a lighter tone, which is enjoyable. Yet I loved the more serious and epic tone to LOTR. The Hobbit has room to progress as we see stronger character developments and the adventure is assumed to get more dramatic and epic. This is not a criticism, as the first film is an introduction of what is to come, and what a great job Mr. Jackson has done. I just know that there are more exciting things to come, given from what I have seen from this amazing kick off to a new and potentially epic trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A good movie, but not great.","As a Tolkien fanboy, I knew that this wasn't probably going to meet my fanboy expectation. I think Jackson doing it tried to hold true to what the book was, but had to succumb o entertainment value. At times it felt like an anime filler, where bits and pieces were added to the movie in order to make it a bit more interesting. Jackson tried hard to try to make it so that once he has finished filming the three hobbit movies that you can watch them all in order with the LOTR trilogy, and it all flows in order.Overall could have been cut by half an hour or so. The filming and the cinematics were amazing and from what I had heard about the new frame rate making the CGI easy to spot. I often found myself wondering what was CGI and what was real.What would any sort of Jackson/Tolkien movie review be without the incredible acting of Andy Serkis as gollum, between him and weta, you ended up feeling like you were part of gollum.

"Your ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" movie guide","Your ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" movie guide.First, for those of you who LOVED the Lord of the Rings, which was a rich, wonderful ""adult level"" read in their original book form...remember that The Hobbit was a much lighter read aimed more at the child or young adult (in book form).Having said that, I am hearing of ""critics"" viewing the movie as not as well developed (as LoTR) and with many ""made up"" scenes......I am so tired of ""critics"" who don't know the history of the product they are reviewing""......every scene I did indeed remember from something I read about Tolkiens Middle Earth. While not all of them were ""directly"" from The Hobbit, they are on par with the time-line and come from sources like The Silmarillion.Plus, The Hobbit ""the MOVIE"" is NOT The Hobbit ""the BOOK"". It ""includes the book"" within its frame of reference but is also designed to give a much broader stroke of Middle Earth as Tolkein envisioned it. Peter Jackson is also trying to neatly create a tie-in for a smooth transition from The Hobbit to the Lord of the Rings movies.Peter Jackson is the ultimate Hobbit and Hobbit fan; as was I in my youth. What I have liked about all his Tolkien movies is the fact that he seems to have been a fan of many of the artist renderings I enjoyed as a young man (and collected) of Middle Earth. The most notable is the Brothers Hildebrandt. In fact, Gollum's grotto jumped right out of the screen at me as a direct childhood memory...including the shape of the rock on his lake center island.While there are a few slow areas as Peter develops the complex web he is trying to create, the overall movie worked very well.Plus I saw it in HFR (High Frame Rate) 3D, which I would highly recommend (even over sound quality). Instead of the normal frame rate of 24fps as most movies are made by, this was filmed at 48fps. Why? The result is a much smoother image which gives the human eye the ability to pick up detail even more than just 1080p itself. Frame rate is not high definition in itself, but the ability to feed more information to the human brain per second. It looked ""very"" life like. My only negative comment was it also, to me at least, appeared overly ""bright"". Perhaps that was a wrong setting with the projectionist as this was the first showing (ever) of this technology. In that regard it did not match the lighting of the earlier movies (at all). It came across a little cartoonish...hopefully they will fix this either at the theater or when the final Blu-ray or Red-ray DVD's come out.Still, even though this is only part I of III, the audience applauded at the end (rare enough) and I walked away having enjoyed myself immensely. Peter Jackson, the ultimate Hobbit, has done it again. :)Happy Holidays!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too much CGI, otherwise too long","I loved the Tolkien works so much as a kid that I often have mixed feelings with Jackson's work - he does a great job of casting and cinematography, but goes overboard where I don't think it's necessary. That holds true here, where the CGI just gets out of control too often in what is otherwise a fairly spectacular if overdone film. The Hobbit was more of a fairy tale than ""serious"" fantasy, so I don't take Jackson to task for any plot deviations from the source work. Actually, he develops another wizard, Radagast, in a way that was unfortunately ignored by Tolkien. And he also wraps in familiar characters from the trilogy that fans of those movies will appreciate. However, his idea to take a book shorter than any of the trilogy and expand it into three distinct movies is doomed to failure, as there needs to be a ton of filler to carry the running times of these movies.P. S. I have watched the LOR movies many times each. I have no interest in ever seeing this movie or any sequel again. I don't know what that means except it just feels really overlong and overcooked.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Unexpectedly magical journey!!,"One of the main problems of the ""star wars"" latest trilogy was the difference in time between chapter VI and chapter I. The filmmaking was so different that it was hard getting into that universe again. This time, however, the things are quite different. From the beginning you have the nice sensation of coming back to the same middle-earth that your visited ten years ago.Photography is great, setting is amazing, visuals are OK, not superb but they do the trick, costumes and makeup are outstanding and the sound and ost are top-notch. In those aspects everything is as fine as it was in the previous trilogy, but there are differences in the story itself and how it is told.I have never read anything of Tolkien so I can't compare the movie with the book but I can tell you some differences between the first movie of this new trilogy and the old one. One of the things that bothered me of LOTR trilogy was that in such a magical environment, fantastic world, sometimes I found myself lost between so many hierarchical and aristocratic references. It was so ""medieval"", full of wars that, in my opinion, the story lacked of magic sometimes. In this one, from beginning to the end the entire movie is full of magic. It is so magical, fantastic, epic, funny, ridiculously entertaining... absolutely unforgivable.Sincerely I think that director Peter Jackson have done what he wanted without restrictions. His filmmaking shares the same mistakes that he made in LOTR, but for me, at least, the direction seems more refreshing, more genuine... I can't explain properly but there is something different and better.Following with the main character, the only thing I can say is that I love Bilbo Bolsom. A thousand time better that Frodo was, not just the character, the actor too. Martin Freeman makes a brilliant performance and he shows that he's better than Elijah Wood. Ian McEllen plays his best Gandalf (yes, Gandalf was actually a mage and not a mere swordsman!!) and about the dwarfs I just want you to see the movie and make your own opinion about them. I can't be objective, impossible.In conclusion,the potential of the technical capabilities of our days, a marvelous story, and the magical direction by an inspired director create a totally amazing, classical masterpiece for all audiences. One of this year's movies and one of fantasy-adventure genre's best films of all-times.One thing: if what you liked the most in LOTR were the never ending battles between large armies, the parts involving humans and their crown, nobility, succession matters or if you are the typical who just love the elves, their immortality, beauty, purity... probably you will find this movie disappointing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Middle-Earth Comes Alive In Breathtaking Detail, Once Again.","J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings did cement Tolkien's legacy into the annals of literature but it wasn't the novel that really started the Middle-Earth mythology. Instead, it began years ago when Tolkien wrote a fantasy novel called The Hobbit, a children's book very lighthearted & innocent in its tone compared to its much darker successor.Decades later, at the dawn of the new millennium, The Lord of the Rings made a historical transition to the silver screen. And so when the filmmakers decided to adapt The Hobbit on film canvas as well, they didn't only have to make it reasonably faithful to its source material but also had a daunting task of living up to the mighty successful on-screen adaptation of The Lord of the Rings.And thanks to the mixed reviews this film received at its time of release, which as a result dented my expectations from it quite heavily, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turned out to be an absolute feast for the eyes & is one hell of an on-screen adaptation of Tolkien's work which, in my opinion, is unfortunately marred by only one major drawback; its inevitable comparison to The Lord of the Rings.Serving as a prequel to the events depicted in The Lord of the Rings, An Unexpected Journey is the first chapter in the planned trilogy & follows the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who is tricked by Gandalf the Grey into joining the company of thirteen dwarfs headed by Thorin Oakenshield in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain & reclaim their lost Kingdom of Erebor from Smaug the dragon.Expanding a relatively slim book into three major feature films when the entire story could've been told in a single film did allow Peter Jackson the opportunity to milk almost every event of the book for all its worth but it also robbed the film of a steadier pace. Nevertheless, Jackson's direction once again brings Middle-Earth alive in all its majesty & he does a neat job in bringing this chapter as close as possible to his magnum opus.Coming to the technical aspects, the production design team does a fabulous job in bringing back the homely Bag End, the evergreen Shire & the dazzling Rivendell on the big screen plus the new sets are equally stunning to look at. Cinematography captures each frame in meticulous detail, editing is a let down this time & unlike The Lord of the Rings, even the extended edition doesn't add much to the overall experience.The visual effects of The Lord of the Rings commenced a new era for VFX in film & was a groundbreaking feat of its time. The Hobbit unfortunately brings nothing new to the table & its heavy reliance on CGI over practical effects robs the film of the grounded realism the previous trilogy had. Lastly, the film is beautifully scored from start to finish & marks another glorious achievement in Howard Shore's career.Featuring an ensemble cast of new & reprising actors, Martin Freeman & Ian McKellen deliver outstanding performances as Bilbo Baggins & Gandalf the Grey, respectively. There are thirteen dwarfs in this nearly three hours long film & yet only one of them gets a proper introduction. However, it's Andy Serkis once again who steals the show as Gollum plus the riddle sequence between him & Bilbo is the only moment when this film felt as magical as The Lord of the Rings.On an overall scale, despite its bloated length & other inconsistencies, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is still an unexpectedly impressive commencement of another Middle-Earth adventure. There are few missteps along the road but most of its footing is spot-on. Faithfully adapted, wonderfully crafted & cleverly concluded, An Unexpected Journey may not be as memorable or spellbinding as The Lord of the Rings but it nevertheless begins The Hobbit film series on a right note & it'll be very interesting to see where it journeys from here.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Expect it to be different from the Lord of the Rings movies,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of the movie adaption of J.R.R. Tolkiens ""The Hobbit"". It was written years before ""The Lord of the Rings"" and intended for a younger audience. Making it into a movie after ""The Lord of the Rings"", is a very difficult task. The Hobbit's tone is quite light hearted and it's literarily somewhat inferior to its sequel. Also, for consistency some changes to the story would have to be made. Thus I was a little skeptical before I saw it.After seeing the first part now, I can say the result is very good so far. It's not a perfect movie, but far from bad. There are some problems with Tolkiens book and as far as the story was told, they were handled very well. It went by the book where it should have and went different ways where it was necessary.One of the greatest weaknesses is probably Radagast. Most of the parts involving him were way too goofy for my taste. Another problem was the story telling rhythm. Some scenes felt jumpy, others felt stretched too thin.Anyway: Prepare to see a more humorous and playful movie than the Lord of the Rings films. I'm definitely looking forward to the next parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Everyone should definitely see this movie. There was a ton of action, great story, orcs, goblins, dwarfs, elves, hobbits, new wizards, etc. They filmed it in New Zealand again, so the scenery was great!

I loved It,"After reading mixed critics I begun to worry.You shouldn't. Critics do not like it because they keep comparing it with LOTR, and it is not. This is an adventure written on a kids book. The story is lighter, and the only thing that LOTR and this have in common is the place and the ring.I watched it on 48fps and I really liked it. It made 3d more appealing and everything beautiful. The only problem of 48fps was that it was so real, that sometimes you could notice cgi.But the technology is not the film, just the media and I am reviewing the film (although I liked 48fps)The story is faithful to the book and brought me back to a place I thought I would never visit again. Just being back in middle earth is amazing.Martin as Bilbo, Richard as Thorin and Ian as Gandalf reprise their roles with excellence. And thanks to the division into three films we get to know more about the other dwarfs and care about them.The riddles in the dark scene is outstanding. And Howard Shore's composition is brilliant as ever.I could not have wanted more from this film. A fun, and amazing comeback to a great adventure to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Incredible movie. Yet failed 3D-48fps,"To begin with, as many others have stated, the movie is absolutely AWESOME!!! Only super-tiny negative comment I have is that the stone- giant scene felt a bit pushed and unnecessary. The viewer had no real prewarning it was going to happen(In the first LOTR there was a sense of foreboding about entering Moria for example). And it really didn't contribute anything to the story.As for the 3D-48fps. I was so unfortunate as to see it at a theater in Sweden(Heron City) where they didn't show it properly. At times, and they where many, the image got really blurry. Instead of showing 2 pictures at the same time(for 3D) it was like they were showing 4-5 pictures at the same time. Which made the screen blurry. And it was not just me who noticed this. Everyone seemed to remark on this. Although when it wasn't blurry the 3D-48fps added an incredible depth to the movie. Talked to a guy who saw it in another theater and they did not have this problem. Will definitely see this again in a theater where they hopefully have a working projector >:)!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Should be called an Unappreciated Journey.,"Tolkien's bed time story is revamped in a more epic fashion with Peter Jacksons return to the stunning world of Middle Earth in The Hobbit, a tale of a secluded, comfort loving Bilbo Baggins who prefers his comfort loving home to the perils of adventure with his whole world turning upside down when the wizard Gandalf nudges him into a quest to help a group of dwarfs reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug. The story involves the fish out of water character of the reluctant hero Bilbo Baggins trying to find courage he never knew he had. We start with a party before the perils before moving on to encountering the good, the bad and the ugly the world of middle earth has to offer with a slash and dash approach of fighting then running away.However, The Hobbit should be called an Unappreciated Journey then an Unexpected Journey because of its critical reception. Most of the backlash is unfair, with criticism's involving comparisons to Lord of the Rings and the drawn out narrative that is a slender children's book being divided into 3 movies. Comparing Lord of the Rings to The Hobbit is unfair surely anyone who is aware of the source material would know that, The Lord of the Rings isn't in the same league in a narrative level to The Hobbit. The Hobbit is the younger brother compared to the bolder older brother being the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In fact I thought some of the efforts to connect these 2 stories together were rather distracting with the inclusion of Frodo in the prologue, with ElijahWood delivering his 2 lines of dialogue, collecting his pay check then leaving. It seemed rather self indulgent and pointless. The looming threat of the Necromancer is intriguing however, adding a darker element to a relatively light-hearted journey making the decision of making these 3 films justified if executed correctly. These negative reactions only come off as minor gripes and shouldn't put anyone off watching this film. Jackson has created a true gem of a movie, with its delightfully charming cast of characters delivering brilliantly quirky performances.Once again Andy Serkis steals the show as the schizophrenic Gollum despite being a feral creature of his forma self there is a real sense of attachment to his character with elements of morbid comedy in Serkis's performance. The Riddles in the Dark scene is defiantly the stand out moment of the film I've never known a game of wits could be so intense! Martin Freeman brings the beloved character of Bilbo Baggins to life with his funny facial expressions and quaint movement. His performance is very relatable much more so the the slightly dreary Frodo in the Lord of the Rings. Sir Ian McKellan provides an enigmatic and a cunningly powerful performance as Gandalf the Grey (which is far more interesting then Gandalf the White in my opinion.) Richard Armitage plays a ruff battle,hardened dwarf determined to reclaim his home from the dragon Smaug(who we only get a teasing glimpse of.) All these performances are stellar apart from the fact that some Dwarfs get more screen time than others but giving every dwarf a chance to stand out is hard amongst this bunch of characters which best works as a rugged team of Dwarfs. One performance that stood out too me as flat out bizarre would be Radagast the Brown and his frantic frolics in the woods with his bunny sled, it made me wonder if someone put LSD in my pepsi. The whimsy, wonder and peril of Howard Shore's Soundtrack also show the sheer range of the films gravitas which resembles the soundtrack of the Rings trilogy.It's definitely worth going there and back again to your local cinema to witness the wonders of Middle Earth on the big screen despite the strenuous running time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Long awaited, much disappointed","After being blown away by the beauty, majesty and magic of Jackon's LoTR trilogy, I kept waiting and hoping for a fantastic Hobbit movie. Sadly, not to happen. The best parts of the book, particularly the exceptionally humorous bits with the trolls and Beorn get truncated and even changed! Same with the addition of an Elf-Dwarf love story?! What is up with that, I have to wonder. Still, there are some nice interweaving of threads from The Silmarillion. Also, Tolkien filled The Hobbit with songs ... where are they here? With the exception of the opening at Bilbo's home, the music gets relegated to the closing titles. All in all, most disappointed in this effort, and the final chapter in this Hobbit trilogy of films, too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
48 Frames: An Unexpected Journey,"A mild-mannered Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins is tasked with joining a group of Dwarfs, lead by Gandalf, to the Lonely Mountain in the hopes of claiming their home and gold back from the dragon Smaug.When word first broke out that Jackson would be splitting the 300 some odd pages of the children aimed book The Hobbit, into another epic trilogy, a lot of people groaned at how thin he would be able to stretch the material. In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, everything and anything that would have ended up on the cutting room floor is thrown in here, such as the Rock Giants. Why? Is it because The Hobbit lacks the thrills and spectacle that is the Lord of the Rings. I'm going to put my bottom dollar on yes. Jackson needed something to fill his films with in order to excite the audience, thrill them and make them have the same awe they did more than a decade ago.I want to say that The Hobbit works wonderfully, and it does for the most part. There are obvious flaws throughout, but my question is this. How do you rate a film, when it is presented in a format so distracting that it hurts your overall enjoyment of it? Not only am I talking about the use of 3D, but the infamous 48 HFR which it is presented. Let me get these two issues out of the way first.The 3D here is utterly useless. There are basically two kinds of 3D being presented to an audience right now. The Gimmick and the Immersive. The gimmick is what one would see in the Saw 3D, Final Destination 3D....any horror film really. Gags that poke out at the screen with gotcha moments. The second, the kind that James Cameron is trying to champion is the immersive one, in which the 3D makes you feel like you are in this world. Objects aren't really shooting out at you, but float around you. The most horrid use of 3D, many would have to agree is Clash of the Titans, but I must say, The Hobbit might give it a run for its money. Not once did I ever feel immersed in Middle Earth. It was not used to the scope and scale it should have been. There was depth, sure, but who wants to see depth with two people talking? It is distracting and overworks the brain to compensate for the film trickery.Second, the 48 HFR. I would suggest that the average movie goer seek out 24. I know Jackson wants to present the film in 48, but it is simply the wrong movie for this format. First and most noticeable. People move quicker, like they are on fast-forward of your DVD remote. Simple task like picking up a cup, are too quick and make for an awkward and unpleasant viewing experience. Later on this is not as intrusive, but most of the damage will already be done. Second, the clear, crispness of the picture. I am one for HD presentation on my television, but here it seems odd and out of place. Many people have compared the look and feel of the film to daytime Soap Operas. I would tend to agree. It feels like something on TV. The digital presentation makes close up scenes seem really out of place when cutting in from afar. Those far away shots and sequences looks spectacular, most of the CGI is wonderfully realized in this frame rate, but everything sticks out like a sore thumb. The first thing I noticed was the fabric and lines on Gandalfs hat. Feels like it was something out of The Wizard of Oz, or a stage play. The realism of the smoothed over 24 is gone, the digital crisp of 48 is a win/lose situation. I had more problems with it than enjoyment.With those problems constantly battling my enjoyment back to Middle Earth, I did walk away pleasantly surprised with the film. Everyone is on their A-game, which is of no surprise as Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman are always spectacular. Freeman manages to make a character I didn't care for in the original films, likable. Peter Jackson loves this world and his passion shows. One of the drawbacks would be that the film comes off as too cartoonish. This might be because the book was aimed to a younger crowd, but the Dwarfs and their antics are something out of a Star Wars prequel. Sure, they are meant to be comedic relief, but when dangerous and life threatening situations are happening, you don't want to be seeing them jump from tree to tree like some Warner Brothers cartoon.Of course, being a prequel, it's fun to see things being set-up for the Lord of the Rings. The best sequences is of course the Riddles in the Dark with Gollum, who looks better than ever. The Hobbit is a wonderful film, that doesn't match the scope, energy or emotion of the Lord of the Rings. Go in expecting a good fantasy, nothing more and you'll walk away satisfied....that's if you walk away from a screening in 24 fps.Leave 48 for Animated and Planet Earth like content.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not as Good as the ""Golden Trilogy"" but Still Strong","Traveling back to Middle Earth is always a treat. If you take the approach of soaking in the lore and marveling in Tolkien's world, there is much more to enjoy about this film.

welcome back to the maGic of the Middle Earth!,"Sequel films are really intriguing for me and this was one of them. Especially after watching three LOTR movies it felt like amazing going into the very beginning after a long time.I did not read the books and cant say that the adaptation is perfect but I mostly heard from readers it was quite fine. I will not read the books since after seeing a thing from someone's window of imagination, I guess it will be hard to make my own. Maybe I should read to see how it is going to be. But I can say that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is such a good movie like LOTR movies thanks to Peter Jackson.The cast especially the choice of Bilbo Baggins is perfect., 13 dwarfs are worth to know and the scene that the old dwarf Balin was telling the story of how he believed in Thorin was quite impressive and makes the viewer to understand and feel why they want to get back their lost home Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor. But it would be little bit more hard for Bilbo to leave his warm and nice home with a relax couch to sit and read beside a fireplace in the amazing Shire but this is a book out movie and u have a certain time to tell the main things. And for me it is not obvious enough why Gandalf choose Bilbo Baggins for this journey. But in the beginning of the movie seeing Gandalf gives a big smile on your face and waiting for his appearance when there is almost no more hope in a battle is perfect like in all LOTR. Acquaintance phase of the ironic character Gollum and Bilbo Baggins was fun among the battle scenes. There are so many scenes I can count as""woow perfect"" or ""kind of boring"" but totally the movie was amazing and a must-see.Now, need to watch the LOTR series again on DVD (this is a reminder for myself, make an empathy right now and after u watched please give them back to their owner!).

"It's not that bad, guys","Years after the groundbreaking Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Peter Jackson returned to Middle Earth by adapting the prequel, The Hobbit. The first sign of just how controversial the films would become was the revelation that the book, which runs about 230 pages, would be split into three films. Now, with the Lord of the Rings, it makes sense: three books, three movies. However, The Hobbit was just one book. And suffice it to say, the signs of just how much padding it would take to split the book into three films is there from Part One. The film takes a full 40 minutes to get to the titular journey. Granted, Fellowship of the Ring took that long to get there too. But, it had to establish the setting, the characters, and the massive stakes. The stakes aren't that massive here, despite attempts to make them seem so. And sure, it has an almost entirely new cast, but we'll get to that. The point is they could have trimmed the fat and gotten to the fun stuff quicker. With that said, when we actually get to the fun stuff, it moves at a reasonable pace and perfectly showcases all the stuff we only heard about in the original films, like the trolls and the encounter with Gollum, as well as cool new stuff, like Azog, the goblins, and Radagast.The biggest problem with the film, in my opinion, is that, unlike the Fellowship before it, the main cast, with a few exceptions, doesn't have enough differences to distinguish from each other. The Dwarfs aren't lacking in personality (they provide some of the biggest laughs) or creative design, but they look too similar and the film (and indeed the sequels) never takes the time to properly introduce most of them or even make it easier to know who is who. Then again, this problem originates from the book, so it's hard to lay the blame squarely on the film. However, they could have at least replaced all the filler with establishing the characters better. With all that said, the characters that do get established are enjoyable and well acted. Thorin is a cool leader who you do NOT want to mess with. And Bilbo and Gandalf are great as always, as are the other returning characters.From a technical standpoint, the film is as awesome as you'd expect. It's great to see the Shire and Rivendell again, and the new places, like Erebor and the Goblin Kingdom, look good. The effects, both practical and CG, are impressive as usual. The music has some great beats, both old and new. And the action scenes are a ton of fun, especially when the Dwarfs fight, showcasing their different weapons and the various ways they use them.Overall, is An Unexpected Journey anywhere near as good as the previous films? Absolutely not, not even close. But, is it terrible or even bad? I refer you to the answer to my first question. It's a decent start to a decent trilogy, for what that's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
One does not simply underrate this movie,"I went to see The Hobbit with a friend yesterday. He was fairly disappointed, I was amazed. We had a good talk about it afterwards, and I only have one advise for you when it's your turn to take on this journey. Don't bring your ""Lord Of The Rings"" goggles, they will only destroy the entire experience. You can't expect to feel exactly the same way you did after LOTR, because this is something entirely different. Different doesn't mean worse though, I was sitting with a smile on my face for 2 hours and 45 minutes. The actors are doing an amazing job(Andy Serkins in particular), the music is simply magical, and the new technique stunning. I have never seen anything like it, simply perfect. Of course, it doesn't bring you that ""old"" feeling that LOTR was able to give with a perfect combination of new technique, but I never expected that. I just expected to be entertained, and to be honest, it rose miles and miles over my expectations. My last advice for all of you guys: Buy a freakin ticket.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Slow story but a visual Masterpiece,"The expectations of ""The Hobbit"" were extremely high right from the start. While ""Lord of the Rings"" is already one of the greatest movies of all time, that's where you have to put the movie. Freed from all prejudices, Peter Jackson was able to empathize with the world of Tolkien with his first part of The Hobbit. However, the film suffers from its enormous length and thus tension holes. All three parts could have been cut into two parts, if not one part. Nevertheless, the film is worthwhile for its great camera work alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Fantastic Voyage Indeed!,"After many months of waiting and expectation, I was finally able to see 'The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey' in its midnight showing. I had read many negative or mixed professional reviews, and I was very worried, seeing as I am a huge Tolkien fan. And now, after having watched the movie, I can honestly say to those critics: To the depths of Mordor with you!There are very few things to complain about this movie. It remains mostly faithful to the Hobbit, and when it doesn't it remains faithful to Middle-Earth lore. I found myself actively cheering the protagonists on, my heart beating like an orc drum in my chest. And while some might say that cheering the protagonists on is what I am supposed to do in every movie, you are correct. And I do that, but in this movie, I felt like my own life would be affected by the outcome of the story.Coupled with the amazing scenery and incredible direction, I could not help being completely immersed in the story, an immersion that I have not felt in a fantasy movie since the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy.BE WARNED! The Hobbit, as should be expected, is not as urgent as the 'LOTR' Trilogy. Remember, the dwarfs are not attempting to save the world as the Fellowship of the Ring was. Their goal is personal, and their success or failure would not determine the fate of Middle-Earth directly. Thus the movie does not have that 'Save the World' vibe. BUT, in contrast, the protagonist's quest is of such a personal level that as a viewer I could not help but be captivated and moved by it. Their quest became my quest. A truly I do not think a movie could hope to achieve more. I, for one, ardently disagree with many of the professional critics. Go view the movie yourselves, and be prepared to be transported back to the Middle- Earth we have missed so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Boring Movie,"I don't know what is with Hollywood these days. They continue to turn out trash for movies or they create these nearly 3 hour movies thinking that longer is better. This movie could have been cut down to just a little over 2 hours. I did manage to get through the entire movie without having to get soda refills or bathroom breaks. Most parts of the movie are too long and drawn out. I keep sitting there waiting for someone else to yell out lets move this along please.I will say that the special effects are outstanding as well as the cast of this movie. After speaking to a friend about the movie, I was told there are 2 more sequels to this movie. I hope those aren't nearly 3 hours long either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"overlong, stuffed the gills, occasionally truly, unabashedly great","Originally Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct the Hobbit series. Whether he had two or three films at the time he was in pre-production is uncertain, but he still retains a co-writing credit on the scripts. His presence, I think, can be most felt in this film, An Unexpected Journey, which also takes the most from JRR Tolkien's original book of the title. His sense of grandeur and love for creatures - unique, big, small, darker and more disgusting and 'out-there', the better, which I'm sure jived with Peter Jackson's tastes - is there big and large here, and it helps in moments... and perhaps detracts in others when things go on, and on, and on.Now that the trilogy is complete, I can look back on this first film and see that there was actually a lot that was good about it, at least in the sense of kicking off this new series of films starring that Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, arguably the reason if nothing else to see the movie as it's a tremendous performance for all of the little moments and gestures he gets right). Bilbo is a stubborn little guy, though not as much as the dwarfs who crash his house to eat and inform him - via Gandalf the Grey and Thorin Oakenshield, a son of a departed king - that he is to go on a journey to help them get back their gold and kingdom from a diabolical dragon named Smaug.Of course, this was originally a children's book - not three separate ones like LOTR, just one, and the first version was not as complex as it later became with rewrites and reissues - and here it gets puffed up to unimaginable heights. Though shortened and imperfect, a 1977 animated film got the whole story in under 90 minutes. Ironic that Jackson's 'Rings' series was the best criticism of the Bakshi adaptation, where now it's reversed. His film is loaded with action and adventure, some of it well choreographed, scary, exciting, deranged, and just... long. And, as with a lot of franchises (including Star Wars) things have to tie together, even if inorganically. Hence you get appearances from Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett (albeit as actors they're never unwelcome, just sad it's this dragging material) as characters not in the book, only to serve as connecting tissue for the ""Larger"" threat that is really in the background of a tale of a little hobbit and the dwarfs.The film is the definition of hit or miss, and when it misses, such as an overbearing climax that just feels too BIG for its britches, giving a massive dose of epic battle to something that isn't that big, it's a lot to bear. But when it hits, I hasten to say it was almost (not quite, but almost) worth it for Jackson to come back to this series. The highlight above all else is Bilbo's 'Riddles in the Dark' with Gollum. Though the visual effects were astonishing and groundbreaking with him years ago, here they've gotten *better* and, in just once scene, we get so much from this character all over again - a showstopper, naturally for Andy Serkis in the best possible way, playing it for comedy, tragedy, horror, everything you dig about this character - that it's a reminder how much character is paramount in these types of films. You can have all the sweeping shots of New Zealand and characters running this way and that and CGI monsters and peril... but two people having a conflict over a piece of gold is much, much more intriguing.Indeed that one scene is a 10/10. But there's too much 'filler', so to speak, scenes that drag and characters who either have too much backstory (Thorin, the a-hole of the series and the kind of co-protagonist with Bilbo) or not enough. I enjoyed Unexpected Journey, maybe, just barely, the most out of all these new releases. But the lack of a consistent tone - some things played for much broader comedy than anything in Lord of the Rings, some things so dark that they nearly become comical, and action that feels like it's still going even after the movie ends - I don't know. It's a film where you can feel brilliance and mediocrity fighting one another.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Immensely enjoyable,"I don't understand the critics' reaction to this film. Well, I can accept some of their criticism, but I still feel that they're judging this film far too harshly. Perhaps it's the hype that quite frankly got blown out of proportions, or perhaps they reacted negatively to the decision to separate a simple children's story into three films, or perhaps they just expected another epic on par with The Lord of the Rings saga.And I cannot claim I wasn't equally as cautious, having seen the trailers, knowing the book and realizing that they would have to add a lot of padding. So I was prepared to be disappointed. Luckily, my fears were ill-founded and what I received was an adventure I haven't experienced since the original LotR films. A sentence written by a fellow fan sums up my feelings perfectly: ""It felt like coming home after a long journey."" Exactly. And yes, I realize that as a major Tolkien fan my viewpoint is heavily biased, but that's what this film does to you. It has its flaws, but I just cannot bring myself to care. It's Middle-earth.But don't get me wrong, it's not good just because it's Middle-earth. It's a genuinely great film on its own. And this wasn't an easy story to adapt into a film, especially when you want to make it a prequel to the LotR films. Because the original book in all honestly doesn't work as a prequel to the LotR books all that well. It's just a merry little children's adventure with humour and high adventure. Some of its events work as a backstory to LotR, but sometimes it feels like it's not even set in the same universe, the tone is so different. So adaptation was always going to cause controversy, because there isn't a good compromise to be had. Personally I think that Jackson strikes a good balance here. The film is a lot more humorous than the LotR films, but at the same time there are hints of events yet to come and you can pinpoint the certain events that would eventually lead to the War of the Rings and the downfall of Sauron. These scenes tie the film to the greater story and even though the constant shifts in tone might bother someone, I think that Jackson manages to balance the two aspects rather well.What I think Jackson got exactly right are the characters. The returning characters still feel the same, and in some cases even better. Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) had improved the most and the scene where Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Gollum meet is easily the best one in the film. The mood, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the slowly building tension, it's absolutely haunting in quality. And luckily the new characters don't disappoint either. Martin Freeman outshines the rest with a performance that absolutely nails the character of Bilbo Baggins, but the dwarfs aren't bad either. Thorin Richard Armitage) gets the most screen time as he by all means should, which unfortunately though doesn't leave too much time for the rest of them. The same problem exists in the book, so it's not completely Jackson's fault. There simple are too many dwarfs to give them all enough screen time to develop their personalities properly. Jackson tries his best though and I think that he succeeds admirably, given the circumstances. Most of the dwarfs look different enough and all of them have at least one quirk that makes them stand out from the rest. You still can't tell which one was Nori and which one Ori by the end of the film, but you at least have an inclination about most of them. It's not much, but it's something.Nevertheless, the characters do work. The other thing that I liked is the score, because well, it's Howard Shore, and even if we discount that I still find myself humming the main theme under my breath, and its been almost two weeks. I also quite liked the action, which once again reflected the more humorous tone of the film. It was flashy, fast-paced and filled with a lot of creativity. Sure some might claim that it was more silly than anything, but I think that it fitted and at least it was enjoyable to watch, especially from a big screen. And of course the visuals are still some of the best the industry has to offer. The sweeping landscapes of New Zealand looked good back then and they still do. The monsters and various caves and buildings are equally awe-inspiring and a lot of time has been spent on the details.Then the grievances and the nitpicking. The biggest complain that I have against this film is the voice acting. The orcs and goblins in LotR films sounded great with lots of growling and screeching, with sharp gutturals. And the orcs in The Hobbit still sound like that, but the trolls and especially the goblins are just unbelievably bad. A humongous goblin king should not sound like an educated middle-aged British merchant. It completely ruins the effect. But if that's the worst I can say about this film, well... it's a nitpick if even that. There were some other minor points that I would have personally changes, mostly dealing with changes to the story, but nothing major or anything that could have potentially ruined the film.As a whole it's a very strong film. The tone is a bit of a problem and it has too many characters, but what it gets right, it gets absolutely right. It's Jackson's Middle-earth and I like it very, very much. Is it as good as the LotR films? Not quite, but it isn't far away. I saw it once and I walked back in the next day with a smile on my face. That's about the biggest compliment I can pay to a film and this film more than deserved it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Emotions, emotions everywhere","Watching The Hobbit might be the best movie experience I've ever had. A children's book is brought to life. The essence of fantasy culture from its origin to today's video games etc, is brought to life. Especially the video game-culture is captured through amazing special effects, as well as the essence of the Tolkien book, and the three previous films.The flow of emotions is overwhelming and the movie leaves one satisfied from beginning to end. People complaining are heartless, and pretty much all criticism I've read are unfair and ungrateful interpretations. People demanding tiny adjustments for their personal unjustified perfectionism.

"It's nice to have a blockbuster that doesn't rush, but sometimes you wish it would to actually give the adventure of the story some momentum.","Missing The Lord of the Rings trilogy in the cinema is one of my biggest film related regrets. Granted, when I finally saw them a few years later, I dragged myself through a Fellowship and Two Towers VHS and couldn't stand them. However, after I got into film, I gave them another chance and saw Return of the King for the first time on DVD with the extended editions and although I'm still not much of a fan of the themes and mythology, it is a jaw-dropping technical marvel and worth it for the spectacle. I rewatched them one more time just before The Hobbit and they continue to grow on me, this time, the storytelling of The Two Towers got to me deeply (and for some reason, the cinematography is so much stronger in that film than the other two). I always wonder what I'd be like as a person if I did see The Lord of the Rings on the big screen as so film fans of my generation got into film by seeing them earlier. Although admittedly they would've been far too scary for my 9 year old self so maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed them in the first place. Anyway, I had one expectation for The Hobbit - spectacle.On that one basis, The Hobbit delivers. It isn't the same as The Lord of the Rings with a distinct lack of sweeping landscapes and intricate models (although it does have the makeup and production design), but it doesn't look too heavily Avatar inspired where it could've been flat and bland. It's not particularly special, but it's worth watching in the cinema, particularly in end of the second act with the Goblin caves even if there's some shaky CGI. However, the storytelling is another thing. On one hand, The Hobbit is one of those stories that takes the most basic formula for an adventure story and invents things to fill in the gaps, on the other, that method is very sloppy. Just judging Jackson's films and not Tolkien's books; it's an interesting approach, particularly for the intricate detail and rich mythology to go with it, but as an early scene in the film demonstrates where the group of dwarfs are saved by Bilbo by stalling for time, this is a technique that Jackson seems to apply to every sequence. It's nice to have a blockbuster that doesn't rush, but sometimes you wish it would to actually give the adventure of the story some momentum.It also does have a tendency to disconnect with the characters too much for an exploration of the mythology, which is only a problem when it feels like we haven't seen Bilbo for a good half hour. It's a shame since if it focused on Bilbo for longer, Martin Freeman's mannerisms would be more welcome, but they seem contrived and bizarre, devoid of its potential charm. Unfortunately, some of the conflicts and sequences aren't as creative as they could've been, particularly with the pale orc and wolves, which now feel generic. It's a decent film, but the only scene with any weight is the scene with Gollum, which although it is sometimes hard to follow, it's utterly captivating. Though perhaps that's just because it's deeply rooted into the nostalgia of 10 years ago, which the score also achieves through its welcome revisiting of the original Lord of the Rings soundtrack. This first part is a considerable step down from that trilogy, but I didn't really expect anything more. I may see parts 2 and 3 in the cinema as well, perhaps I'll experiment and try the 3D and 48fps although I really don't think I'll be a fan. We'll see. There's plenty of time before then.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Filler, filler and more filler","After reading the book, I wondered how the filmmakers would expand it to an entire trilogy, and feared that they would be bogged down in filler. My expectations were met exactly by An Unexpected Journey. After the riveting backstory and introduction of the dwarves, the scenes drag on and so much unnecessary fluff is tacked on. Although the scenes in this film are enjoyable as-is, they don't form much of a coherent plot, just endless vignettes that don't progress the story in any way. One moment, the protagonists are in danger and escape. Then the next, Gandalf and some allies are investigating rumours of the Necromancer. Then back to the perils, back to the Necromancer, etc. The shoddy CGI, cartoonish action and low character stakes didn't do wonders either. The film can't decide whether the treasure, Azog or Sauron is the main point and it wallows in endless CGI filler without really emphasising the emotional core.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A solid, greatly entertaining introduction","Key questions come to mind for those who have yet to see this movie. One is: is it as good as the Lord of the Rings films? While I personally believe it is not, that is beyond the point. The Hobbit is a separate story in itself with a different narrative feel, that happens to take place in the same environment. Don't walk into this film expecting it to feel like another Lord of the Rings film, and keep an open mind. One of the other main questions regards the disappointingly mixed critical reception behind the film. As a person who usually cares about critic reviews before seeing films, I must advise you all FORGET ABOUT THE CRITICS ON THIS ONE. ""An Unexpected Journey"" is a fantastic introduction to the three-part series, and will likely follow with even better sequels to follow. The same idea can be said about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 was rated amongst the worst of the Harry Potter films, even though the screen time itself was great when taken in context to the following final act. The same will be said about ""An Unexpected Journey"". Could it have been better? Sure, there were some areas the film could have done without. On the whole though, this is still a very entertaining fantasy movie, and one which I wouldn't mind seeing another time or two. It perhaps didn't blow me away like ""Return of the King"" had or the final battle in ""Two Towers"", but it is still a film I can highly recommend for any fan of Lord of the Rings to go see with some friends or family. 8/10 : B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic start to what will hopefully become another great trilogy.,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of Peter Jackson's planned trilogy based on J.R.R Tolkien's precursor to The Lord of the RIngs, The Hobbit. Various stars from The Lord of the Rings return here, such as Ian McKellen, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, 90 year-old Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Andy Serkis' spectacular motion capture Gollum. New faces include Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy, Lee Pace, Graham McTavish, Ken Stott, James Nesbitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Manu Bennett and Barry Humphries.This film starts with old Bilbo Baggins writing down his adventures with the Dwarfs in The Lonely Mountain for his nephew Frodo. Then, 60 years earlier, Martin Freeman is young, content with his quaint, quiet lifestyle in Bag End. That is, until mysterious wizard Gandalf the Grey and a company of 12 dwarfs. After that, he is whisked off on adventures in the dangers of Middle Earth.This was a really great film. Although I don't like one relatively short book being drawn out into three 2-and- a-half-hour films, I had faith in Peter Jackson after he brought us LOTR before. I like the way they managed to take small parts in the book and made them longer, as well as adding in some good stuff also. Howard Shore once again knocks it out of the park with a magnificent score, and the action is enjoyable and really fun. Also, this is the funniest of any Lord of the Rings-related film; most of it at the expense of the dwarfs. The riddle scene was amazing; Gollum was better than ever here. The character of Bilbo was brilliant, good character development and an awesome performance from Martin Freeman. My gripes with it? It is a little overlong. It was acceptable to have 4-hour epics with The Lord of the Rings as each one was a separate book. Here, there are some pacing issues as some parts are dragged out. Also, yet I think this will be resolved in the next parts, The Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again, the dwarfs' characters (with the exception of Thorin and Balin) were not fleshed out enough, and you didn't get to know them enough here. However, overall this is a great film, and I can't wait for its successors.Finally, I would just like to congratulate the film-makers on adding in a wonderful Wilhelm Scream from a goblin. It's nice to see they're still being used.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Beautiful but disappointing.,"This is my first time reviewing a movie here on IMDb, and the main reason is this: Though overall a good movie, some aspects of it left me deeply unsatisfied. I just want to share a little bit of why I was disappointed. Even though it is extremely unlikely that my opinion have any influence over the two following installments, being silent completely eliminates the possibility. The review may contain minor spoilers, so read at your own risk.So, let's start with the good things about this movie: It is extremely well done technically and artistically. The landscapes, props, costumes and camera work is absolutely fantastic. The movie delivers absolutely stunning environments, way more realistic and detailed than LOTR. The music is good and the overall feeling is great. The acting was good in my opinion, and the dwarfs were humorous, yet not to the extent of becoming silly. This was one of the big reliefs for me, as I expected all dwarfs except Thorin to be clowns - After all, we all saw what Peter Jackson did to Gimli in LOTR. If it weren't for the criticism I am going to post below, I would give this movie a 9/10.And here are the things that I disliked: The movie started good, but during the second half, things turned ugly. - The situations sometimes become totally absurd. The characters falls down great heights, get trapped on a rock giants leg and gets stuck in a ""rain of boulders"". And no one gets hurt. It seems like all of this is only created to maximize the use of special effects. It adds nothing to the story. The result, for me, was a total lack of tension, as I got the impression that the characters were immortal anyway, so why worry? The amount of impossible action sequences was just too large for this movie to be taken seriously. And then, in the middle of all this, the cheesiest comic relief I have ever seen is delivered. Embarrassing. Also I have a great problem with the way small things in scenes are changed, only making the movie worse than the book. The LOTR was also filled with these changes, which ruined parts of the last two movies for me, as I had the bad judgment of reading the books first. I also think that the movie was too long. If some of the pointless action scenes were removed, it would have been a much better movie overall.Hopefully the upcoming two movies will be better. An Unexpected Journey had the potential of becoming a fantastic movie. In my opinion it failed. So please, regarding the following movies, lets not ruin them with idiotic action sequences like ""legolas skating down a stair on a shield while shooting his bow"" in The Two Towers, or ""Trolls delivering cheesy one-liners before dying"" in The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey.And yes, I have read the books, several times.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I definitely plan to see it again in theaters. It had much of the classic characteristics of the LOTR trilogy but with the multitude of new aspects you would hope for in a new blockbuster hit movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the aspects of the movie that make it more of a kids movie, how the original book was geared towards a younger audience, which resulted in a lot of comedy scattered throughout the film.The scenery was absolutely amazing, be it real landscape shots to computer generated grand dwarven mines.

A Film Worth Remembering,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is by far a film masterpiece. With stunning 3D images and beautiful landscape shots this film certainly deserves an Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

However, I must say his role as Gandalf the White in the Return of the King perhaps matched this performance as well. He transforms into the believable Gandalf that uses magic more than ever in the previous films. Not once did I sit bored when watching this movie nor wish I wasn't there.

Disappointing,"Going in to the Hobbit, I had certain expectations based on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.I expected the film would be beautifully shot, with fantastic art design, intricate sets, detailed costumes, and spectacular scenery. They did not disappoint. The continuity of the art department and cinematographer from those films to this one shows, and it also shows that they still care about what they are doing. I especially love what they did with the dwarven stronghold of Erebor. My only criticism in this area is the make-up on Thorin Oakenshield, especially the facial hair. He does not look like a dwarf. I know it's a starring role and the actor needs to emote through the makeup in order to ""sell"" it. You couldn't have him buried in extensive hair/bear/mustache pieces (like John Rys-Davies suffered through in LOTR). But Thorin is just not a dwarf in this film. Kili also does not look like a dwarf, but at least he plays the character in an upbeat, youthful fashion so his ""5 o'clock shadow"" scruff seems appropriate. But Thorin is a dour character, and his look -- which I call ""dwarf metrosexual"" -- just does not fit. The rest of The Company have great looks, I know they could have come up with something better for Thorin.I expected this movie to have a great film score. Howard Shore's work on the trilogy was outstanding, and made those films complete. Here, well, there are few new pieces, but most of the score is derivative from prior works. I know it's important for some continuity. The hobbits, in particular, are very set in their ways, so it's highly appropriate to use the same themes for Hobbiton that Shore used in the first trilogy. But they recycled the Ringwraith theme, even though they don't appear in this film, and they used a lot of the same segue music and other cues. There are a few new songs, cues, and themes, but even there, a few fall flat. I remember one specific choral piece simply not fitting with what was happening on the screen. Choral music is used to imbue pathos into a scene, but I don't recall that scene requiring pathos. I just remember the choral music not fitting the mood.I expected this movie to have a lot of action sequences. This is where Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" is actually above LOTR: it has a lot more action sequences. There's a lot here to excite: Smaug's attack on Erebor is brilliantly portrayed, the above-ground warg chases are pretty harrowing, as is the film's climax. But there's an awful lot of goofy crap in it, too. The underground battle with the goblins has some goofy chase sequences that reminded me of a version of Pitfall produced for the NES some 15 years ago. A friend turned to me and said ""obligatory video game sequence"", so it wasn't just me. The Goblin King and his odd army are brilliant, but the escape scene is just goofy. There's also this encounter with stone giants in the mountains that, although faithful to the book, is so ridiculous it pulls you out of the film. Then there's the Radagast sequence, which is complete ""WTF?"" I know ""The Hobbit"" is a kid's book. I know it's not LOTR. I actually like that they had goofy dwarfs and a generally lighter tone than ""Lord of the Rings"". But some of these action sequences are just so utterly ridiculous they ruin the whole thing.Finally, I expected the story to be expanded. The writing team said as much throughout the production. I was hoping it would be a good, meaningful expansion (like the Arwen arc in the LOTR films). I was also hoping the expansion would bring depth to the other characters (JRR Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" could not be considered a ""character piece""). I found myself not pleased with the results. I found the additional story elements (specifically the White Council/Necromancer backstory) to be irrelevant and uninteresting and not thematically appropriate to the story. ""The Hobbit"" is a lighthearted adventure, adding in this heavy plot stuff interrupts that flow. I also found the addition of Frodo and ""old"" Bilbo in the beginning of the story to be unnecessary. Sure, it was cool to do a transition between Ian Holm's Bilbo and Martin Freeman's, but it could have been simpler and to-the-point instead of the exaggeration it became. I know the filmmaker wanted to include his friends from the first production in The Hobbit, and I am a fan, they are all fine actors, but he should have focused on the story at hand instead.What really bothers me about these additions is they take away time that could have been used to work on the various characters, specifically Thorin and the relationship between and amongst his fellow dwarfs. Adding a bit of interpersonal conflict between the dwarfs would have made it so much more interesting than just adding another storyline. As it is, they are (as yet) undeveloped. We know Thorin is grumpy and determined, we know his dwarfs are goofy and boisterous, we known Bilbo is a fish out of water. Beyond that, there's not much going on with them. Contrast ""Fellowship"", with it's touching character-driven scenes such as Gandalf & Frodo's talk in Moria; Aragorn & Boromir's encounter in Rivendell; the hobbit bonding experience running from the Black Riders; and all the touching stuff at the end when the Fellowship breaks. These moments don't really exist in ""The Hobbit"", and that's the biggest shame of this film.Bottom line: it's entertaining, it's beautiful to look at, but it's overboard on goofiness, camp, and PJ's favors to actors, and not deep enough on character. It's disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant and fantastical,"I'm going to give it a 10 basically to spite the moron that gave it a 1 to ""balance"" the score. Give it the score you think it deserves, not something to spite the overall tally. You can think for yourself. The overall score doesn't matter. It's a personal review.Your explanations about the music ""forcing drama"" were completely off-base, and it's obvious you went into this film hating it before it hit. That's been the case with 97% of critics: they went in expecting more LotR, even though The Hobbit was never the same epic, dark, relational tale as LotR. It doesn't deal with the world of men, so it's harder for an audience to relate. It's not about sweeping change in a depressing world like LotR, so it was never going to feel as dire. It's a lighter children's tale and people needed to think that way going in.Fans are smarter than the critics in this case.

What a Nostalgic Feeling Watching this Movie.,"I was a big fan of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, it felt like it had been so long since I had experienced a movie like the series.While the story line is different, the general feeling of the film while watching it really brought me back to the first time I ever watched Lord of the Rings in theater. There is all you can ask for; Golem, Orcs, Goblins, Dwarfs, Elves, and even Gandolf.The casting is incredible, I am so glad they stuck with as many LotR characters as possible. Peter Jackson did a great job of putting characters in their roles.Upon entering the theater I did not really expect a action packed film, but was I wrong! Once the movie gets rolling it almost seems like you are part of the adventure, like you want to jump in the movie. It really does look fun albeit dangerous.What really surprised me were the phenomenal graphics throughout the movie. There is no doubt this movie was carefully made with the best in the profession of CGI.Overall, the movie was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone with a good taste of action and adventure.

Action scenes over-done,"It's a mixed bag, but as a fan of LOTR this film was a bit of a disappointment for me. There were some well-scripted scenes and welcomed additions to the book, and some good acting, but my main gripe with this film is that the action scenes have become ridiculous and I'm surprised that Peter Jackson succumbed to this industry trend where the main characters survive impossible 1 in a million situations. Worse is the fact that many of the invented scenes were of this nature, extending the film to well over 2 hours and requiring 3 visits. Is it really possible to fall hundreds of feet and survive without a scratch? Or survive huge boulders being thrown all around you while you stand on a moving mountain? Fantasy this may be, but I'd call it ridiculous. Peter Jackson, and other movie makers, should perhaps look to The Game of Thrones for more realistic action and fight scenes. I don't mind if a film veers from the book if it is to cut short or to make connections - but this film adds scenes to bore us to tears with unnecessary, impossible and repetitive action scenes. I won't be going to see the next installment in 1 year - I'll wait until it arrives on satellite TV, such is my disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I didn't want to believe it was over,"I was rubbing my eyes, trying to convince myself that i don't see the credits. Fastest 169 minutes of my life, and i didn't watch it in 48fps, only 3D. First, i must say i am a big Tolkien fan, and my favorite books and movies are trilogy ""The Lord of The Rings"". Second, i must say i am a big fantasy fan, i even write it (not famous yet). Third, i must say i have traveled 200km (100 in one direction) only to see this movie (i don't have a cinema in my town), and paid 1200 Serbian dinars (about 10 euros) for the trip and cinema ticket. Even if the movie was bad, i would't have the guts to say i didn't like it. But i have the honor to say that i was worth even much more.That have been said, i can review the title. Simply, amazing. I don't want to diminish Tolkien's work, but i think it exceeded the book (it's not better, those two are different type of art, they cannot be compared like that), it has more to say but in a simpler way. I don't want to spoil anything, you will see which of the parts of the book are in there, which aren't, which are changed and which are added from other Tolkien's work and director's and screen writer's imagination. Peter Jackson outdone himself (it's not better than LOTR but i can equal it with TFOTR) in making a movie after the book.Peter Jackson with help of Del Toro made a really good, family classic, expanding the book, popping up many questions and making it for all ages (book was written chiefly for kids). Martin Freeman (except for the first 20 sec of appearance) did an Oscar worth job. Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Andy Serkis and rest of the cast did really good too. Music is fantastic, both the new theme and the old ones which awoke nostalgia. Visual effects and costume design are probably the best i have seen ever, even better than LOTR. My mouth were dry after the movie, i couldn't close them, from scene to scene effects and landscape get more and more breathtaking. Orcs, Goblins and Trolls were updated and enhanced (you'll see how when you watch the movie).I wanted this review to get an objective tone, so i must mention flaws of the film, which he had, like every other thing in this world. A few logical and material mistakes, story not rounded (it couldn't be, it's one book split in 2 + 1 movies) and some motives repeated from LOTR. But i must say, i am quite impressed, and my expectations which were high, were surpassed maybe even twice. If it came out before LOTR series, maybe, just maybe it would have been better, but even now the future trilogy will be a really wonderful and appropriate prequel. Can't wait for the second part. I warmly recommend it to everyone (not just fantasy and Tolkien's or LOTR fans). Really nice Christmas gift from Mr. Jackson and rest of the crew.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing Film!,"The film was just excellent, from beginning to very end I was submersed in what was truly an epic adventure, cannot wait to see the next installments now.What really impressed me was the sense of humour used in the film along with great scenes that keep your heart racing. I would really recommend this film to anyone out there that enjoyed the book, and previous LOTR films.I think negative reviews are a bit too over the top. Books are able to go into more detail, but when you are creating a film you have to visually create all important parts from the book, you can't possibly go into as much detail in films. The detail is less of the words and more in the visually aspects, and wow it really does keep your eyes on the screen!The credit goes to how well the characters appear, and how well the geographical landmarks are represented by use of New Zealand's draw dropping scenery and landscape.A lot of the credits also have to go to the artists and designers that create such amazing characters have done really well, the make-up artists in particular have done a great job on each character, and gives each one a personal trait. Really like the each individual touches to each dwarf, Bombur was so funny, seemed to be eating in nearly every scene, The CGI is also excellent, the dwarf kingdom Erebor looks really impressive in the opening scenes, and so does Rivendell, in fact every scene has excellent CGI from the shire, to Dol Guldur.I think people should be less critical about certain aspects of Jacksons work and focus enjoying the film and watching some what truly magnificent pieces of cinema!All the characters are played really well by an excellent cast, good mixture of heroic, evil and comical characters, make it such an all round great film!Thanks Peter Jackson for making the best of what are my favourite books, I'm sure you will have made Tolkien a very happy man, as you have turned his excellent stories into a visual masterpiece!10/10 for me, can't wait for the second and third now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"The first time I heard about the release of the first film of the Hobbit trilogy, at first I know that this is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. At the moment that I first watched this movie, I was really amazed on the direction and acting style of the actors especially to Martin Freeman. Martin Freeman was really appropriate for the role as Bilbo Baggins showing his profound sense of the personality of a Baggins and at the same time a Took.Recently, I read the Revised Edition of The Hobbit Novel. Yes, most of the events mentioned in the book happened in the film. The tough explanation of Bilbo and the company's escape from the Misty Mountains was one proof.Lastly,the excellent and professional riddles that were mentioned both in the book and the film were surprisingly amazing.

A far better prequel than the one George Lucas is famous for!,"'THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY': Five Stars (Out of Five)The first part of the much anticipated film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic 1937 book. Like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film series it's directed by Peter Jackson and written by Jackson and his usual writing partners Fran Walsh (Jackson's wife) and Philippa Boyens. This one is also co-written by filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who was originally set to direct the films but bowed out after too many delays and filming complications). Like 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film adaptations 'THE HOBBIT' film series was originally set to be divided into two films but Jackson was later given the green light (by producers) to make three films instead. He says he didn't realize it had to be three films until going over all the film footage and realizing there was too much for just two movies (but I find this hard to believe). The first chapter 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' plays out too concisely as a complete and individual film (with a nice climax) to have just happened that way (at the last second, by accident). Some fans had a problem with Jackson stretching and dividing the material out into three films but I was all for it as long as he could make each chapter a satisfying film on it's own (with a good climax for each) and at least with this first film he seems to have done that!The films are a prequel to 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' series (although the book was written and published prior to 'The Lord Of The Rings' book trilogy). Martin Freeman (of 'THE OFFICE' fame, the original British version) stars as the young Bilbo Baggins (and Ian Holm reprises the role, from the 'RINGS' trilogy, in his older years). Also returning from the prior films are Ian McKellen (once again as Gandalf), Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis (as the motion capture produced Gollum, once again). The film begins the legendary story with Bilbo being picked by the wizard 'Gandalf the Grey' to join a team of thirteen dwarfs, lead by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a mission to take back their kingdom from a vicious dragon named Smaug (who stole it years earlier due to it's mass collection of gold). Bilbo is picked for his burglar skills even though he has none and this becomes apparent to the dwarfs who quickly find him useless. Bilbo finds himself in way over his head and wanting to return home when he stumbles across 'the ring' and steals it from the creature known as Gollum.The movie has been criticized for it's length and pace but I found it to be no slower moving than any of 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' films (except perhaps the last one) and even a little more amusing. Of course it's too long and drawn out (and perhaps too faithful to the written material) but so were the other films. It's usually not a good thing to try and cram everything from a book into it's film adaptation (and then some in this case) but when it's such a labor of love for the filmmakers and they're that passionate about the material (and giving the die-hard fans what they want to see) it can't all be a bad thing. I only read the book once, as a kid, and don't remember it all too well so I can't remember what entirely is the same and what has been changed but that makes me a better critic of the film as just a film, in my opinion (and not in comparison to the material it's based on). I'm not married to the material at all and had no high expectations for the film adaptation, so I was pleasantly surprised. It's visually spectacular and I did see it in 3D (although not in the new 48 frames per second it was filmed in, there's no theaters near me with the capabilities of showing it that way). The performances are all good (especially Freeman and the scene stealing Serkis) and Jackson's directing is once again beautiful and perfectly fitting. I did find it to be just as entertaining as the other films in the series but it does lack the emotional depth that made 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' films truly great films. While it might not be quite as classic as the great trilogy it follows it's still a magnificent achievement and a far better initial prequel than the one that George Lucas is famous for.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NILhScQxII",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"""Thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread""","I have high respect for Peter Jackson for managing to direct three great films based on the Lord of The Rings (abbreviated as LOTR from here on) by J.R.R. Tolkien, a fantasy epic that some deemed unfilmable. So, years ago, I was naturally excited to hear that Jackson had decided to produce adaptation of another Tolkien masterpiece, LOTR prequel ""Hobbit - there and back again"", and had chosen Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy films, Pan's Labyrinth) as the director.Del Toro worked on the film for a while but apparently thought it was too big a challenge and left the project. Peter Jackson saved the production by once again taking the role of director, and at first intended to make a two film adaptation of the Tolkien novel. Whatever the reason was for Jackson's initial refusal of sitting on the director's seat - perhaps he was busy with King Kong or tired as he mentions many times in the DVD extras of the latter two of the LOTR films, or just thought Hobbit was best left for someone else - I think it would have better been a decision to keep.With the ""Hobbit - an unexpected journey"" it feels like Peter Jackson is trying to play safe by bringing us a very LOTR-feeling experiene, with similar grandiose music playing to similar helicopter shot imagery of a fellowship travelling through majestic landscapes, and what seem to me be dwarf versions of Aragorn (Thorin) and Legolas (Kili). The film lacks distinct creative spark and soul, and it seems like it's trying to suck the soul out of the LOTR films. I think Peter was very uninspired, perhaps because of tiredness, and he uses LOTR as a director's reference point far too much. To me, ""An unexpected Journey"" is a dwarfed down version of the first LOTR film in many respects.Instead of two films as originally planned, we get three. Tolkien's Hobbit is a relatively short fairytale, shorter than any of the novels in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Three 3 hour films are justified for the Lord of the Rings, but not for the Hobbit. At 169 minutes, ""Unexpected Journey"" is just too long. ""There and back again"" feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread, to quote Bilbo Baggins from the first Lord of The Rings film.For the first hour or so, not much happens in the way of plot advancement: A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins receives thirteen dwarf guests and one wizard and they eat. The high points of the first hour are a prologue about the Dwarf kingdom and a dwarf chant. The rest of the film is mostly about chases, cliffhangers, charges, and yells. They are delivered with pompous instrumental music and sinister visuals that would have perhaps worked if Tolkien's Hobbit was an epic with apocalyptic tones like Lord of The Rings. However, Tolkien's Hobbit is a fairytale about thirteen dwarfs and a hobbit and a wizard on a way to reclaim a treasure and home from a dragon.Tolkien himself has stated that he created the Lord of the Rings because there was no national epic for the Great Britain. Hobbit, in contrast, is more similar to the fairy tales he created as bedtime stories for his children. The Hobbit story does have epic elements but for this film at least, it is my opinion that there is a mismatch between content and execution here.One of the big challenges for the Hobbit was to make the thirteen dwarfs of the tale work cinematically. The Dwarf challenge is similar to the one Walt Disney faced with the Snow White. With major film length limitations and lots of dwarfs, Disney decided that the film would get a boost of liveliness if each of the dwarfs were given a distinct personality, a caricature, and named after their characteristic.As with Disney's Snow White, the dwarfs of Hobbit are very distinct from one another, but two major issues arise, at least for me. First is that they don't match my mental image of ""dwarf"". Regarding features like body language and mentality, the dirty dozen just feels too ""human"". I think Jackson missed a comical gold mine here. What is supposed to be fun in this film is that the dwarfs are really hungry, but that doesn't quite cut it, especially since there's no ""second breakfast"" kind of funny quips as with the hungry hobbits in the first LOTR film.The second major issue has to do with the simple story of Tolkien which the film stays true to. As distinct as the dwarfs here are, it is all the more harrowing that the differences between the dwarfs that cost a lot of introductory time to establish, don't shape the story at all. Now if i watched the film carefully enough, the truth is that there are no twists or turns that would depend on the individualities of the dwarfs, except for one of them. For a short children's animation like Snow White that's not a major issue, but for a three hour film that's a major negative.Basically all of the dwarf characters could be rolled into one, preferredly Thorin Oakenshield, the Aragorn of dwarfs and leader of the gang, without creating a need for Gollum-esque divided personality.I have to balance the criticism by saying that Peter Jackson, a true craftsman and a technological innovator, is a perfectionist when it comes to creating worlds. Certain aspects of the film are really impressive when judged on their own, especially the visual design and it is also the reason why people who are not Tolkien fans might think this is a film worth seeing. I'm planning on watching the film for a second time in theatre with HFR technology to see if that brings a new level of immersion to an already impressive looking film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

A bore,"I gave 6 because of the riddle scene. The rest is a bore. I almost fell in sleep in a 3D IMAX cinema...Also, 3D itself seems unnecessary. Nothing really that stunning happened in it.

But if you rethink about what you've seen in the movie, you might feel that you don't quite need this introduction...The spin-off doesn't seem to enrich the Lord of the Rings series. It doesn't add anything new or better.All we could see is a very handsome but stubborn princess leading a bunch of good and tough dwarfs, who by the way, every time could stand out when he faces his old foe Pale Orcs.

The Honest Truth About the Hobbit,"If you are one of those people who are looking for another Lord of the Rings you will not find that in this movie. While it shares many of the same elements that the Lord of the Rings movies had it differs from it through tone.

There are many intense scenes but they never quite get to the level that the Lord of the Rings had it at. Should you see the Hobbit? It is honestly a completely different experience than watching Lord of the Rings so if you like more intense dialogue and less of the action found in Lord of the Rings you will enjoy this movie.

"It's flawed, but tremendously entertaining","The Short: Wonderfully cast, incredibly shot, relentlessly adventurous, and an (almost) spot on adaptation of the beloved classic, the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesn't disappoint in the slightest. While it does stumble slightly in the beginning, the experience as a whole is one of the most enjoyable films of the year. And while it does take some getting used to, the 48 FPS presentation (in 3D IMAX) is absolutely the best format to experience this journey.4.5/5It's been nearly a decade since we last entered Middle Earth as envisioned by Peter Jackson. There's no denying that The Return of the King was going to be a hard act to follow. So lets just get this straight right off the bat: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is no where near the caliber of the final chapter we saw in 2003. What The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey turns out to be is an unexpected, but necessary and welcome, change to Peter Jackson's landscape of Middle Earth.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey features a memorable cast, but the standout is no doubt Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He completely nails Bilbo's character! Armitage is also fantastic as Thorin, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf is back again and still great. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but only a handful of the dwarfs get significant screen time.The technical wizardry is also of note, no doubt. It's not truly noticeable until the latter part of the movie, where the special effects are absolutely incredible. The rest of the movie is absolutely stunning. The battle of Erebor, the escape from the goblin stronghold, the fights with orcs; everything is incredibly animated and beautifully done. In 48 FPS the action does take some getting used to (the higher frame rate removes the standard blur of special effects. In the higher frame rate one can see all the nuances of the special effects, making each animated character or item look ultra artificial or incredibly real), but a good 30-45 minutes into the movie and the presentation felt completely normal, and in fact made some of the later scenes look absolutely spectacular. I can't stress enough that, once your senses have adapted, the 48 FPS visuals are unlike anything else.Howard Shore's original score is his bet yet for sure. Every bit of his original music captures the sweeping scale of the adventure, but it's the new theme that is still playing through my head even now. The first time you hear the haunting new theme it will stick to you, but by the time it is blasting over action scenes it will send chills down your spine. Original themes from TLOTR trilogy make brief returns in just the right places as well. Overall, It's Howard Shore's best work yet.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is more of a change of scenery from the past trips to Middle Earth. It's subject material is much lighter, the action is much more sparse, and the character building is considerably different. I will admit that the beginning is sluggish and overall a little too drawn out, the Goblin King looks like he was stripped out of a video game, and there are some inconsistencies here and there. So when it comes down to it, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not perfect. Far from it actually. It won't win any awards. It won't be favored among the critics. There are some silly choices made, and it isn't the most tightly crafted piece of film.But I could care less.This movie is adventurous, exciting, funny, all while capturing the original essence and character of the classic novel. The stunning special effects, great performances and incredible score make this a memorable return trip. But what truly stands out is Peter Jackson's eye for adventure. There just hasn't been a quality adventure movie in a long while. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the perfect antidote. It's big, epic filmmaking with a purpose: to tell a story (albeit the long winded way) that's grand in scale rooted deep within its characters. Make time to see this movie, and go into it with excitement, because The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great deal of fun and makes one thing inevitable above all else: the wait for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is going to be incredibly painful.4.5/5 - while flawed, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is tremendously entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"As a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings saga and reader of all the books I must say I was very disappointed with this new film. Lacks all the good stuff that made the book one of my favourites back when i was a teenager and hinders all Peter Jackson's good work in the previous films. It looks to me more as a film for Twilight fans than anything else: plain, childish and overall predictable in gags and action. Shame. I'm pretty sure Tolkien would have not enjoyed the adaptation this time. Let's see what happens with the next two films though my expectations are already quite low and I still don't understand the need of exploiting one book into a new trilogy.

Jacksons Return to Middle Earth is a triumph,"Once again the idiotic critics and members of the public who think they are great by putting down big blockbuster movies are so far out with their judgement of this film. If you do not like fantasy adventure films then don't judge it, your opinion is meaningless.I haven't seen the 48fps version, only the basic 3D version, so I cannot comment on the TV like film quality that has been reported, the quality of what I did see was great but I must say the 3D didn't add much to the film and I am a fan of 3D so do not expect too much from it.So let's address the major issue people seem to have with this film, it's far too long. Yes it is long, yet none of it feels like it was out of place or did not drive the film forwards. I did leave the cinema feeling quite worn out and I do have to be honest, just before the end of it, I was preparing to go, which is a clear sign that i'd had enough and was ready to go. It is a film that must be experienced on the big screen, so unfortunately you have to take the rough with the smooth but it is a small price to pay for such an epic adventure. If I was to have one criticism it would be that there was a little bit of repetition with the fight scenes, they usually began with someone in trouble and just as they are about to meet their end 'AH HAAA!' The dwarfs jump in to the rescue, it appeared to happen quite a lot but I'm sure when I watch it again it will probably not be as bad as I recalled. I also found Gandalf shouted 'Run' quite often, since most of the film is spent running I would have thought Gandalf would have guessed that they get the idea by now. These are minor niggles and nothing that can have an effect on my 9 star rating. The only reason it didn't get a 10 is that Lord of the Rings so far for me just had an increased amount of tension drawing me in more so I couldn't justify rating it alongside a perfect trilogy....yet.Martin Freeman was absolutely flawless as Bilbo and brings so much to the character. The dwarfs were all likable in their own way, it was great to see Gandalf back in action. Gollum was great as to be expected. Howard Shore's epic score is incredible and creates yet another heroic memorable theme, adding excitement to even basic chase scenes with not much going on.Peter Jackson has done the series proud and once again delivered a wonderful adventure with jaw dropping visuals and action sequences. If you have read the book then you know that it's going to get darker and a lot more traumatic, the best is yet to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Superb return to Middle Earth,"I thought this film was amazing, I'm going to see it again. I absolutely loved it. Martin Freeman was amazing as Bilbo Baggins and actually topped Sam as my favorite hobbit. The action scenes were amazing although they have revamped quite a few sequences from the book it's all fantastic. The best scene by far has to be the iconic ""Riddles"" scene. Personally I think that scene is one of the best scenes from all 4 films. There's only one criticism I have however and that is the dwarfs. 4-5 not only don't get their time to shine or even a couple lines although I can understand Peter Jackson's dilemma with this. Thorin, Balin, Bofur, Dwalin, Ori, Dori, Bombur, Fili and Kili are the only ones to have either a large part or just memorable moments. The rest are forgettable and if it wasn't for the fact I've read the book, I doubt i'd remember their names. Other than that the film is outstanding with the second half being vastly superior to the first half. I highly recommend seeing this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Truly an unexpected journey!,"It is not very often that a film's title encapsulates all it stands for. We truly are taken on an unexpected journey of wonder, and the most sensational fantasy ride the world of cinema has to offer. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one of the few films this year, that just continues to get better as we embark on this phenomenal adventure.After the first hour, we begin to suspect that the thrills we have just been witness to will come to an inevitable end, and the integrity of the film will exacerbate and become exhausted with time. Well that is what I anticipated anyway, and I could not have been more incorrect. Peter Jackson finds a exceptional balance between accommodating to The Lord of the Rings fans (which I admit I am not) and creating a new, fresh film franchise that will be just as memorable as the trilogy of the 2000s. There is a predictable nature of comparing The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings, and I won't try to do any differently as there are natural parallels and differences to be observed. First and foremost, the story is vaguely similar to The Fellowship of the Ring, in that a peaceful and I guess, underdog of a hobbit, is given the task of a greatly important quest that requires determination, loyalty and cooperation. Differently to the trilogy however, The Hobbit does not emphasise its key themes until we are close to the end of the ride and the brakes are seemingly being put down. Nonetheless, when the motifs of loyalty, pride and patriotism are revealed, there is no surprise or disappointment as they have been present all along, just not prevalently expressed as camaraderie is in The Fellowship of the Ring.In all honesty, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is simply fun. You have fun when you are watching. Scratch that. When you are living it. You don't feel like a human sitting in a theatre watching a film, you feel so completely engaged in the story, the characters, and the world of Middle-Earth. I almost felt that after leaving the cinema, I just been brainwashed for 170 minutes because I was just taken into a land of utter amusement and inconceivable enjoyment, not just surpassing my expectations for the film, but making those very expectations feel ashamed they ever doubted the opening of the trilogy for a moment.I feel no need to proclaim everything the film did right and fantastically because the list would be endless. It probably would be more appropriate to discuss my dislikes of which there are only two, but to discredit The Hobbit in written form in any way possible would be to seemingly decline my enthusiasm for the next two years of the franchise, so 'I shall not pass' negative judgement.I was quite happily ready to regard The Dark Knight Rises as 2012s finest offeringof film (that I have seen), even in July. Now I am afraid that Christopher Nolan's incredible conclusion to a trilogy, has been replaced by this almost perfect opening to another, what I hope will end up as, magical in every sense of the word, trilogy, of its own. That may be the unexpectedness of my enjoyment of The Hobbit, and slight disappointment at the conclusion to Nolan's Batman talking, but nevertheless, I stand in saying that Peter Jackson has delivered the standout film of the year... so far of course, there are seven days left.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A fun revisit to Middle-Earth,"The original Lord of the Rings is one of the best novel series and film series ever and it has been a long journey for the adaptation of The Hobbit. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a welcome returned to Middle-Earth, even if it does not match the heights of the original trilogy.The Kingdom of Erebor is the greatest Dwarf kingdom in Middle-Earth. It was built on the wealth of the materials of The Lonely Mountain. But the Dwarfs of the kingdom are exiled after Smaug the Dragon overruns the Dwarf forces and the Elves refuse to help. The rightful king of the kingdom, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is determined to reclaim his birth right no matter the cost, and with 12 other dwarfs at his side, goes on a quest to recapture The Lonely Mountain.Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) is a part of the dwarf company, wanting to ensure Smaug does not ally with other dark forces of Middle-Earth, and it is up to him to find the 14th member of the company. He decides to recruit the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) as a burglar because hobbits are light on their feet, even though Bilbo has never set foot out of The Shire and is too attached to his home comforts.Besides a fiery death, many outside factors affect the company's quest: a lack of support from other dwarfs, the political tensions between Thorin and the elves and the return of an old threat to Middle-Earth. The company is also being hunted by Thorin's great rival, Azog (Manu Bennett) ""The Pale Orc,"" who looks very much like an Orc version of Kratos from the God of War series.The Hobbit is a much shorter novel then any of The Lord of the Rings novels; it clocks in at around 400 pages. To make it into a new trilogy, Peter Jackson and his team had to expand the story using expanded material from Tolkien stories and a little bit of artistic license. Elements of the story from the novel have been altered and embellished, such as the rivalry between Thorin and Azog, the Elves saving the Dwarfs before reaching Rivendell and the events involving Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) discovering a new evil in Mirkwood. Of course the previous trilogy also embellished the story, particularly The Two Towers. For fans of the original novel there are some fun references, from lines of dialogue and voice-over to the story of Bilbo's ancestor.Jackson employs a lighter tone for the prequel, using more comedy than previous films. Of course there was comedy in the original trilogy and the tone of The Hobbit was written as children's novel. When the dwarfs arrive at Bilbo's home it was tonally light and there are some genuinely funny moments, particularly involving the trolls and the dwarfs. Because of the nature of the story and the way it was told it is a slightly more family friendly film.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stills supplies plenty of fantasy action that you want and expect. Jackson delivers plenty top-notch special effects and creative action sequences when they are on screen, especially the fight within the Misty Mountains. As a fan, there were some nice little improvements, the biggest being the wargs which actually looked like wolves, not those silly looking hydras that they were in The Two Towers. Fans can also look forward to another fantastic score provided by Howard Shore, hitting every note perfectly.Jackson does assemble a great cast for the prequel. Of course old players like McKellen, Andy Serkis and co. do their parts justice and Armitage was perfect as Thorin. Armitage brought to life the bitter warrior longing for crown, a seriously minded fellow who did provide on the action stakes. Freeman was also a strong performer as the hobbit in question, the reluctant hero of the piece who is forced to come into his own.A problem with the film is some inconsistencies with the Dwarfs in terms of some being more prominent than others. Balin and Bofur were played by recognisable actors Ken Stott and James Nesbitt and their profile led to them having decent screen time. But other characters simply disappear off the screen, having no personality or characteristics and are just noticeable because of their appearance. This despite the profiles the studio created. But this is also a problem with the novel where some of the dwarfs felt like they did not need to be in the movie.The running time is 2 hours 50 minutes, which is long. A straight adaptation of The Hobbit would have easily have fit into a film lasting even less than that. Some scenes could have been trimmed and the scenes involving the wider context felt inconsequential at the moment. But The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not disgrace the legacy of the original trilogy and it is still one of the best medieval set fantasy films since Return of the King.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
All I could ever ask of The Hobbit!,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an impossible standard of a trilogy. The Hobbit is an entertaining, heartwarming, and humorous film that nobody will recognize that views it with a critical eye.Having seen it in 48 frames per second I see why people dislike the technology. As a teenage film critic I couldn't help but notice the mistakes. The speed of the frames is jarring at first, many things that would look real look fake...then, I start seeing plates flying, start hearing the dwarfs sing, and start feeling the emotion and humor and the action starts and I'm entranced in the likability of the film. Slowly I'm not watching a movie but being transported into Middle Earth. The frame rate stops becoming annoying and starts enhancing the experience.If you treat this like a movie you won't enjoy the fun. If you try to treat it like actual events in the Lord of the Rings series you miss the point of the film. Bilbo is recalling the story from his memory, and like Gandalf says in the movie, ""All good stories deserve embellishment."" This is the way it's being told, maybe not how it happened.The editing is slower than modern films. Many complained about the pace, but every scene has a purpose in future sequels, no scene is poorly written, and I loved every single one of these characters, including the trippy Radagast.48 frames isn't perfect yet, isn't the new standard, but a new way to watch film. If you find yourself too attached to the cinematic experience this will be different. It's not headache 3D, it gives the feeling of a live performance with awesome effects, and gives HD minus the annoyance. I love it! It turns of the film critic and brings in the story lover.This deserves a 10, it is by far the most immersive films of the year, but because it is a prequel to a superior series I cannot raise expectations too high. My advice is put your 3D glasses on, your notepad down, and enjoy a new way of viewing cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not half what it could have been .,"I just saw The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and it was very disappointing. When I heard they were going to make 2(3) movies out of a very short book I expected them to use a lot of the backstory from The Appendices, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.Instead they completely rewrite the history of Middle-Earth, weaken Gandalf in order to build up Radagast and to compress 500 years into 5 days and basically give us a huge amount of filler they made up for the movie when the original story would have been more interesting and more engaging if properly expanded instead of being completely rewritten.Its a good movie, but its far short of the standards of the LOTR films, which at least stayed true to the spirit of the books. If it had stayed more true to the source material it would have been at least twice the movie it actually is.The Hobbit is full of plot holes, missing explanations and bland filler.The extremely high frame rate makes everyone seem fat-faced in close-ups, although the 3D effect is impressively floating.And Glamdring still doesn't glow around orcs, and nor does Orcrist; despite Gandalf saying all elf blades do and the goblin king actually mentioning Glamdring is supposed to shine like daylight.And Gandalf still summons the eagles through freaking Moths! That was a dumb idea from the beginning, sigh.Its just a disappointing movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not well made,"When the lights go out there are 9 minutes of cheap-looking CGI with voice-over story telling. Then ""The Hobbit"" starts. From here the movie seems to move at the same speed as reading a book. Not a good idea generally. Perhaps that is why the opening section is there – to sort of 'make up' to movie audiences for the slow start the real story has.The next half an hour is set in Bilbo's house, before they leave Hobbiton on the journey – which drags.The highlight of the movie is Martin Freeman. Well cast, and well played. The rest of the acting is functionary.I wanted to enjoy the movie but felt that the ticket price is more than it is worth. Unfortunately the production quality comes across as the level of TV movie, or like playing a level of Doom 3 over and over. If I had watched this as a TV special I probably would have said well-done, but not great. As a big-budget movie it is very disappointing.I imagine for a generation who have enjoyed Harry Potter movies without having read Rowling's books, and who will never read Tolkien either, The Hobbit as put together by Peter Jackson might be just as expected.For me, sitting in a cinema for this long without being sufficiently entertained was tiresome. Thankfully I read Tolkien's books at a younger age so those memories will always remain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

HFR 3D version is Awful!,"Couldn't tell you about the story line. The graphics in this version are so unbelievably bad it will distract you from the plot. The action scenes look like they are cut scenes from a video game. There are way too many scenes that rely on CG that don't need to. From the Awful rabbit pulled cart to the fight scenes with goblins, all are poorly done.Remember the gorgeous scenes from Rivendell from the original series? Looks like a (bad) matte painting here. The scenes from the original trilogy with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas chasing Orcs on foot across luscious landscapes? Similar scenes here are CG and just look wrong.Look at other reviews of this version of the movie, and don't say you weren't warned!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Reflections after seeing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"First of all, let me say I'm a great fan of all of Tolkiens works. Silmarillion is being read like the bible in my house, and yet I can't feel satisfied with this first part of The Hobbit.It is much more true to the book than the previous LOTR trilogy, which is a great plus. Another thing worth mentioning is the CGI, at parts fantastic, but as well with some flaws that kind of annoyed me a little, such as some of the dark spawn and their pets. Since the original story is such a fantastic tale of the bravery found in places never even considered, it is hard to make anything else than a solid story for this adaption. But I feel there are some lack of commitment from some of the cast. Most of the actors (females are pretty much none existent) does a good job with the characters, but I can't feel with the characters as I did in the LOTR trilogy, which I was pretty critical of from the beginning due to not following the books properly (you who actually read the books knows what I mean), but those actors made you feel for them, regardless.But what really made this movie just a good fantasy flick instead of a great one, is the first hour or so. If you ever watched the British soap opera ""Emmerdale"", this looks pretty much the same. The camera work felt under par for this part, though the settings are pretty nice. The other thing I would like to criticize is the many Jar-Jar Binks turning up here. He was funny for the first 5 minutes of Star Wars ep 1, but here we gets plenty of the same thing. My guess to why? For selling as much merch as possible to kids and their parents of course, there are no other explanation since a majority probably agrees with me; Jar-Jar is lame.This movie is really hyped, I get that, and as a side effect this movie will and have gained a much higher rating here on IMDb than it deserved. I give it a 7 for a solid effort, but in some ways it lacks the depth that Tolkiens masterpiece provides, and that is a big shame.edit: There seems to be lots of people that doesn't find this review useful. Never mind those negative voters since those most certainly are in the category of people that hails everything that Hollywood produces, no matter what. As long as the budget is gigantic and the CGI is massive, those people are satisfied. This review is not for those people. This review are for those who actually intend to use their own brains, even if it is just for a slight second.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A lucky 6,"The Hobbit is an enjoyable enough movie, although it's too long. This is a children's book, it doesn't need endless LOTR tie-ins and the other additional material. This movie suffers from Peter Jackson's self indulgence, and the simple story is almost lost in the scramble for tie- ins, back-stories, marketable action figures and a sense of sweeping grandeur.I shudder to think what the extended edition on DVD will be like (and we all know there is one to come.)On the upside, there are some funny moments with the dwarfs descending on Bilbo Baggins' house and the interactions of a number of characters.I gave it 6 - but would love Peter J to lift his game and just tell the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Disappointment,"About a decade ago, Peter Jackson concluded his film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and swept the awards with ""The Return of the King"". Since then, Jackson has only had a couple of directing gigs, including his lackluster remake of the classic ""King Kong."" And only one piece of the LOTR saga remains for him to tap into. Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"" isn't just a prequel chronologically. Tolkien actually wrote and published it almost twenty years before what would be considered the first book of the LOTR trilogy. While the books in the trilogy were epic fantasies that dug deep into the lore, the prequel was a light-hearted romp, a first footstep into a Middle Earth still taking shape in Tolkien's imagination. It was also a short romp, only a fraction of the length of any of the sequels. So, while fans clamored for the Extended Cuts of Jackson's original trilogy a decade ago, eating up the scenes that couldn't make it into the three-hour theatrical cuts, there's not much excuse to turn ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy of its own.The movie starts by bridging the gap between ""The Hobbit"" and LOTR by reintroducing Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo says he will now tell the story of his greatest adventure, and then spends several minutes relating the entire history of the dwarfs to the audience before finally picking up where Tolkien chose to start, ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."" (Since the book was in third-person, and the movie adds a first-person narrator, the line now seems a little pretentious.) And then, instead of diving into the story, Elijah Wood wastes a few minutes of screen time with a completely unnecessary cameo as Frodo. Only then do we finally get to meet the young Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, and reunite with Gandalf, played again by Ian McKellan.Martin Freeman has a talent for being the everyday man who is always agitated by everyone around him, from Arthur Dent in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" to Watson in ""Sherlock."" And playing homebody Bilbo gives him a great opportunity to roll his eyes and look perplexed by the 12-dwarf army he finds himself surrounded by. We meet each dwarf as they barge, one at a time, through Bilbo's front door, and then insist on singing an uninspired musical number for about two minutes as they wash Bilbo's dishes. When it's not dwarfs, it's the McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, or Christopher Lee characters from Jacksons' earlier trilogy pushing Freeman's Hobbit to the background. Instead of showing the same reverence to the source material that made Jackson's earlier trilogy so successful, here he ignores Tolkien's main plot and instead pads the movie with a subplot involving Radagast the Brown, a character taken from elsewhere in Tolkien's writings who has no place in ""The Hobbit"", and a Necromancer, and another one involving an albino orc pursuing the dwarf leader, in order to give the new trilogy a central antagonist. Where the novel was all about Bilbo's surprising resourcefulness, more emphasis is placed on sword and axe clashes between the dwarfs and the orcs.Also, most of the light-heartedness of the novel has been leached out in favor of making the movie feel more like an extension of the original trilogy. While the movie is brighter and more colorful then the previous films, this just has the surprising effect of making the movie feel like one of those sequels the original director palmed off to someone else after he lost interest in the franchise, even though Jackson is still at the helm. There are some weak attempts at humor, but rather than Tolkien's wit, the biggest laughs come from unintentional comedy from the terrible acting and writing (disappointing, since one of the co-writers this time is Guillermo del Toro, who's better than this) behind lines like ""After sickness, bad things happen"" or ""If there's a key, there's a door.""Like the previous trilogy, most of the visuals are a cross between New Zealand landscapes and CGI special effects. Peter Jackson makes the same mistake he did with ""King Kong"", assuming the computer-heavy effects are as impressive now as they were the first time we saw them in LOTR. Even the rain is disappointingly animated, noticeably leaving all of the actor's faces completely dry. A scene involving the dwarfs running in single-file and decapitating goblins feels dull and hollow. There is one scene worth raving about, a riddle contest between Bilbo and Gollum in a dark pit. Not only does Andy Serkis, through voice work and motion capture, remind us that he should have won an Academy Award for the role he's still great at, but the scene finally gives Martin Freeman a moment to shine. Considering they decided to tell the story through Bilbo's perspective, it's surprising that this is the one scene that really gives the title character a central role.At the risk of sounding like one of those snobs who always complains that the book is better, in the time it will take to watch what is sure to be a 9-hour trilogy, you could probably read Tolkien's entire book, and be much more entertained doing so.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Unexpected Journey is a well made adventure film.,"An Unexpected Journey is an adaptation of The Hobbit, or There and Back Again written by J. R. R. Tolkien. However, it serves more as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings than an adaptation of Tolkien's book. The film covers the first six chapters of the book, from 'An Unexpected Party' to 'Out of the Frying-Pan Into the Fire'. In addition to the content from the book is other worldly events occurring alongside the hobbit's tale, presented as prelude to the fantastic The Lord of the Rings film series.The film excels in technical achievements. This film is presented in 48 frames per second for select theaters. This new format for film is subtly different. The motion is smoother and makes the 3D format bearable. The screen is well lit, and the 3D process is not distracting. It does little for the film itself, but it is exciting to see a new format with obvious benefits. The photography and set design is mesmerising. Every location is beautiful. Every set is finely detailed. Middle-Earth looks beautiful. Unfortunately, some of the gorgeous scenes are deteriorated by post-production. There is an inordinate amount of CGI in this film. Certainly much more than its predecessor, and certainly much more than this year's The Dark Knight Rises. This creates a world that is less real, more abstract, and more requiring of a suspension of disbelief. Where once was prosthetic makeup, now a computer graphic replaces a great goblin's face.The acting in this film varies wildly. The two stars, Martin Freeman as the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf, are as good as ever. Freeman's performance gives a strong personality to the main character, even if his screen time is really relatively short. McKellen presents his Gandalf with far more mystery than that seen in The Lord of the Rings. With his top notch performance, he is the carrier of this film. Richard Armitage's Thorin is another noteworthy performance, although sometimes he is perhaps too callous and thoughtless to be believable, and occasionally a tad bit over the top. One last performance worth mentioning is the hammy and ridiculous rendition of the brown wizard Radagast by Sylvester McCoy. It's unfortunate that a figure deemed to be wise and powerful is made into a comic numbskull of no importance.With plenty of interesting characters, the film falls flat on what it decides to do with them. The characters, including Bilbo, are just there. Any attempts to develop them are quite futile. Bilbo discovers his inner courage. Thorin learns to not judge books by their covers. It is all so elementary. There is no criticism for these developments. There is only criticism for the fact that these developments don't mean much. There could've been more depth to these faces, but there isn't. Perhaps the great exception is the relationship between Gollum and Bilbo, in which Bilbo shows mercy for the beast when he has the opportunity to kill him. Still it is a wonder what the writers were going for. Perhaps some kind of 'kill only when necessary' thing, though the heroes seem to have no remorse for killing orcs. Orcs have no feelings anyways.So the actual Hobbit story is pretty good. It's unfortunate that there is more than just this simple Hobbit story in the actual movie. There is a subplot of a rather ridiculous orc villain with such a clichéd villain trope that it seems unreal. Also there is the dark and mysterious Necromancer, yet another villain introduced to the series. These are really nothing more than distractions adding to the films length. Sometimes, especially when in relation to the Necromancer, the cuts away from the main story can be so long and over-dramatic you forget what the film is actually about. Perhaps the editor was sick or something. Considering the title, The Hobbit, it is astonishing to see so little of the hobbit.An Unexpected Journey is a really nice Christmas film. It is fun and entertaining and nothing more. Those who want more have already gotten that from the book anyways.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Review of the adaptation and the HFR 3D,"Many reviews from the professional or amateur film critics have already gone over the story and mechanics. Wanted to write a general overview of the entertainment value and if the 3D is worth viewing.Peter Jackson used additional writings of J.R.R. Token to make this film. The author wrote prolifically in the LoTR trilogy, epilogues, and works not published about the events of this story and Peter Jackson has added them to the film. This makes it longer than the book would have been on its own. It adds to the story but there are elements that were added by the screenwriters. The movie felt a little too long partly from the added story and that the source material is character driven more than action driven. It is an entertaining film and tells a good story. The acting is up to the high standards of the LoTR trilogy. It has more humor and is lighter in its theme, cinematography, and tone. It was written as a children's story but has been adapted to be more PG-13 with the fight scenes showing violence and blood in a realistic way.I was able to catch the film in the High Frame Rate (HFR) 3D version (non-IMAX). The HFR 3D is filmed and shown as 48 Frames Per Second (FPS) as opposed to the movie industry standard 24 FPS. There is a noticeable difference. One nice part to this is it carries the same ticket price as standard 3D, no premium like the IMAX 3D. Regular 3D can darken the film a little. The HFR 3D was very bright and clear. It has a higher immersion affect than standard 3D. The best way to describe it is with an analogy, HFR 3D is to 3D what a standard CRT (tube) TV is to 1080P High Definition LED TV. It is much sharper and brighter. Special affects and makeup/costumes are more visible and sharp. There did appear to have a small negative to this, it is easier to spot CGI affects and makeup. The dwarf's bald caps and some actor's makeup were noticeable. It did take a little while to get used to how it changed the picture. For the movie buffs who understand the technical side, it appears as if no filter was used on the camera, it had a home video camera sharpness to it that lacked the smoothing of the images for the sets and actors. Though, the outdoor scenes were much more spectacular. The Shire was incredible! The mountain scenes were also incredible. Certain special affects were improved with the HFR 3D while others were more noticeable.The HFR 3D is new technology to movie theaters and may not be for everyone, yet. If you are going to see it more than once in a theater, would suggest seeing it once in this form to decide for yourself. For me, it has many of the same strengths and weaknesses of HDTV, and the HFR 3D does look High Definition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Chapeau bas!,"It is the first time in my life when I can say that a movie is better that the book! Very good story, impressive special effects and a great sound make ""The hobbit, an unexpected journey"" a must see! I admit I was a little wary about this movie because I had read the book and I loved it. I criticized the lack of detail LOTR film that is in the book and I expect Hobbit an unexpected journey have the same shortcomings. The reality, however, exceeded my expectations and I can say that the film is more explicit than the book and explains more details. It is advisable to see the film only after reading the book, but even those who have not read it can watch the film, which can be easily understood. The characters are well defined, the special effects are confused with reality and how the film makes all seem real without any effort! And if I have not convinced you to see this film worth seeing the movie for absolutely great performance of Gollum ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What a great experience,"Just saw the movie yesterday in 3D and i think it was AMAZING, me and my brother set for the full 170 min and the only thing that i was sorry about was the 5 minute break that interrupted the flow of the movie. First of all let me say that i came as everybody did, with the expectation to see a great movie but an overstretched one that might spoil my fun. but to my and my brothers amazement it was a great movie, when the break came after half the movie was gone i thought that only 10 min have passed,the movie was so reverting and exciting i HAVE to say that i felt like there were no dead moments every thing was just like i hoped, and they even managed to spice it up with a lot of hummer and fun. All the actress do a Great job of acting and from the first moment you fill like you're being socked up into the plot, like being the 15 member of the gang. I must say that peter Jackson embellished some parts and added all kinds of scenes that aren't even in the book, but every thing looks welcomed and adds the appropriate tension and excitement to the plot. Most of all i must say the 3D effects look amazing, its even better then avatar. everything has a great depth to it and the computer graphics just overwhelms you at every corner of the movie. Its a must see movie. better then the lord of the rings and i know i'll go to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually great, but somewhat flawed on the characters...","Having enjoyed the first three movies that Peter Jackson managed to shake out of his creative sleeve, then of course I had to watch the prequel as well. Although I am a big fan of the fantasy genre, I have never really delved into the hype about these movies. Sure they are enjoyable, but not masterpieces. What was really great about ""The Hobbit"" for me, was all the places that I recognized from having played Lord of the Rings Online.The characters in this movie, was as in the previous ones, great and nicely detailed. However, I think the band of dwarfs were too generic and lacked individual personalities. The movie didn't really focus enough on the dwarfs, nor did it give them much chance to really form and build any characteristics. It was more about showing off spectacular landscapes and majestic scenery.Although being a huge fantasy fan, I never got around to reading any of Tolkiens work, but always had the plan to do so. So as in terms of how much (or not) ""The Hobbit"" is true to the story that Tolkien wrote down and immortalized, that I can only guess about. But there is a lot of work that has been put into the movie, especially with the level of details there is to everything. And as a fan of details, then it was a real treat to sit through this movie.The wargs, orcs and goblins were, as the prior movies, really nicely detailed. However, how odd it is to say, then they were actually displaying more individual characteristics and personalities than the band of dwarfs did. Which was sort of a sad thing. All throughout the movie, you just really root for one single dwarf, and that being Thorin, while the rest merely just get the occasional shrug of the shoulders, as they are too generic.Having worked in a bookstore, I am familiar with the size of the novel ""The Hobbit"", so it is sort of interesting how Peter Jackson is planning to turn it into a full trilogy - as that is how I have come to understand this to turn out to become. I guess a whole lot more of prolonged scenes of showing off landscapes and scenery as he did in this one.On a personal note, then it would be interesting to see the Dungeons & Dragons universe brought to life with the same amount of money and production value as they used for the Lord of the Rings movies.All in all, ""The Hobbit"" is a beautiful movie that is entertaining, but could have used a tad more energy on the characters that the story revolved around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but not a classic","I went the day it was released to watch it at 12.30pm to a virtually empty cinema - which was nice.Overall I did find it entertaining but it differed quite a lot from the book and overall I thought it was a weaker effort than any of the 3 of The Lord of the Rings films that preceded it.I found the film to be very frenetic and many of the scenes ""over the top"". I also did not like many of the differences from the book. I think the strength of The Lord Of The Rings films was that is stayed close to the book. It's been nearly 2 decades since I read The Hobbit but even now I can think of at least a dozen changes.The main one that I disliked was the introduction of yet another ""super orc"" - similar to the one that killed Boromir in The Lord Of The Rings. A large amount of the plot in this first film revolved around this character that does not exist at all in the book!Another thing I disliked was that some of the dwarfs are completely anonymous. I kid you not when I say one of them had maybe 5 lines in the whole of the nearly 3 hour film. I think a slower paced film with more focus on the characterisation would have made this a much better film.I thought the Goblin sequence was fairly poor - again too fast and ridiculous in places.As for what I liked - the scenery was superb as were the special effects. Many of the scenes were also entertaining even if they were slightly different to what happened in the book.I am confident the forth coming films will improve.It's a decent film and probably one you will find entertaining, but it's not a great film.If you have read the books and are expecting a close rendition of it you are likely to be disappointed.I'd say this film is to The Hobbit as Troy was to The Iliad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A fairly decent movie, but not The Hobbit you may have read...","I will do my best to keep this review short, like the story Tolkien created, NOT like Peter Jackson is doing by making this into a trilogy.I will start by telling you that all the special effects and CGI magic works well for visualizing an adventure story. The settings, the costumes, the filming, yes it all works well and looks marvelous! For that reason alone, and the wonderful soundtrack, Hollywood will love this movie. But... I came to the theater to see The Hobbit, and this is not how I remember the book to be. This is a drawn-out, over done attempt to milk the viewers for 6 plus hours and a lot of money, for a story that can easily be told in 2.5 hours.The Hobbit is a very simple story, if you bother to read the book. It tells about a brave little creature teaming up with a band of hard-nosed dwarfs, who head out to fight a dragon.Peter Jackson has taken way too many liberties with the film by adding elements which were not a part of the book, and by dragging everything to the extreme just to lengthen his movie(s). He is trying to make this into another LOTR, which was not Tolkien's intention, and why Tolkien wrote The Hobbit first - THEN went on to write LOTR. A prime example of this is the first 40 minutes of the movie, which was covered in the book by just a dozen pages! Go see the movie to whet your appetite for some spectacular scenery and action sequences, but please do not think that these characters and the storyline were as they appeared in the book. I urge you to read the story if you haven't already, so you can understand how the focus was on a timid little character who managed to survive perilous situations. It seems that Jackson is more intent on making EVERYONE a hero, a fighting master, a focal point and portraying them ALL as main elements to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What the F&^% happened,"So I am not the biggest fantasy epic, sword and sorcery fan. I did however enjoy the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The huge scale of it was impressive and the story was relatively close to the originals as far as I could remember.So I rented the Hobbit remembering the fun of the Trolls, the goblin capture, the riddling. All the good stuff.What I got was a poorly, poorly crafted piece of crap that was made without care or quality. Just for laughs and fun.I shut this off before even finishing it. It was completely ridiculous. essentially it was one long action sequence where all the midgets, sorry, little people should have died. I bore little resemblance to the books and even introduced a new villain that was throughout the movie. WTF!Apparently the fame went to Peter Jackson's head and now he is pumping gout the same trite crap as James Cameron.Skip this at all costs.

"A slow start, but it takes it's time to become something magnificent","First of all don't judge the film itself positively or negatively strictly due to the OPTION of seeing it in 48 fps. Now the beginning of the film is slow and at times doesn't even feel like LOTR due to the lack of familiar faces. The wait is worth it because at about fifty minutes in the movie picks up and becomes something extraordinary. This is the point where old friends, incredible fighting choreography, majestic cinematography, and stand out performances truly come together. Peter Jackson takes his time finding his way back to the LOTR glory, but when he does he comes back with just as much strength. I'm not saying this is another LOTR and it shouldn't be because this is something else. The second half of this film is phenomenal and if P.J. can continue with this momentum throughout the next two films then we are in for quite a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Well worth waiting for so long,"It's been a while since I have last seen a movie that solidly good and qualitative in any respect. Absolutely amazed by the visual effects, the beauty of every single scene/shot... What amazed me most is that visual effects and 3D effects were used not solely for the sake of effects, but quite in place, used to create that special atmosphere, spirit of adventure and suspense rather than merely to show off the achievements of modern visual graphics. Loved it. Felt like i lived it myself - those rare sweet moments, like in the childhood, when you feel completely drawn into the movie....Can't wait for the next one.

A truly excellent and worthy addition to our world of Middle Earth.,"As a big Tolkien fan, and a huge admirer of Peter Jackson's triumph with the LOTR series, I was somewhat nervous before this film, hoping and wishing it would live up to it's expectations, proving wrong the critics who rather uselessly claimed it ""plodding"", ""overblown"" and ""eye straining.""Firstly, having known that Jackson only uses a precise selection of chapters in such a long film I anticipated some plot gaps and some hasty dialogue to assist where needed. I was wrong, the pace, script and scene structure of the film are excellent - free-flowing, fast paced and overall consistent with The Hobbit.Visually, it is quite breathtaking, most memorable for me are the eagles gliding through the sun drenched sky, the 48fps adds exceptional detail to every scene making the fight scenes especially, even more engaging than the LOTR battles. ""Eye-straining"" Perhaps that particular critic should refrain from judging 3d movies, because my partner and myself found the animation beautiful and easy on the eyes, and we were in the most straining of positions 1 row from the screen.Having seen the film all faith in Jackson and his team is restored, with such a formidable cast, excellent visual capabilities and one of the most exciting adventures still to be revealed, I am confident that the Hobbit series will be completed with great success, and easily stand side by side among the LOTR trilogy.A truly excellent and worthy addition to our world of Middle Earth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A flawed journey, but quiet charming and entertaining nonetheless","This is one of the movies that you either enjoy as a whole and try to overlook the negatives, or you be put off by its flaws, luckily .. I was among the first group.We have to remember that this is a first installment of a series and not a complete story by its own, so the upcoming two films may have a positive or a negative effect on it.That being said, let me start addressing what I liked and disliked about the movie. The introduction to the characters was very well done, the movie manages to flesh out the characters despite having too many of them, they are all likable and none of them feels annoying or unnecessary. The story is well built, I loved how they underlined some of the themes like finding what it takes to leave your daily life and do the unusual and the grief of being homeless.The acting was magnificent, all the actors were perfectly fitting for their roles. The scenery and colors were so beautiful and Howard Shore's score was great.My biggest issue was with the pacing, at least half an hour could have been cut out, especially some of scenes played solely for humor, I am very annoyed by this mainly because Peter Jackson has repeated the same mistake he made with king kong, but all that can be forgiven in return for many parts of sheer brilliance.So is it perfect? No. Is it on par with The Lord of the Rings movies? No. But this remains a very well made film that succeeds at being entertaining, heart warming and magical and it's definitely a very welcome return to middle earth.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Very disappointing split,"The movie is a bit disappointing. This split in 3 parts seems like a big commercial thing. The rhythm get slower because of this, and the movie which is good looses interest. Also, trolls are not very well made, they look like a joke whereas they where really bad asses in the book. Compared to the lord of the ring, we do not really get into the characters, they seems very simple and lots of first degree jokes about all the dwarfs makes it silly. What i did however like : the introduction of golum, real nice and scary ! Best in the movie. I think that this book deserved better and that peter jackson has a bit lowered his standards after the success of the previous movies. Bouh !",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Disappointment,"I thought the Lord of the Rings trilogy was excellent!! So, when ""The Hobbit"" came out, I was extremely eager to see the film... until I started reading reviews. Life got in the way of me seeing the movie in theatre, but I ordered my copy on Blu-Ray.I had the afternoon off. Had some pizza and my Coke, and started the movie. I wake up and the credits are playing -- seriously. So, I chapter search back to find where I fell asleep... 35mins. The next day being a Saturday, I start at 35mins and I wake up to see a magnificent battle scene with orcs and the dwarfs. Woah, what did I miss? I chapter search back to find that I fell asleep at 65mins in. It took 3 sittings to watch this disaster of a movie -- and I'm not one for falling asleep during movies.I'd challenge anyone to tell me the significance of the first 50minutes of movie. Way to put an audience to sleep with meaningless dwarf antics for most of an hour. This 50minutes could've been accomplished easily within 15mins. Frequently, the story dwells on 'nothing' but merely showcases how much money Peter Jackson must have accessible to waste this much film.If the Hobbit book didn't exist. If this wasn't the prequel to the Lord of the Rings. If this was simply the first notion of ""The Hobbit"", this would be a disaster. The only reason it has been a success is it peaked the curiosity of LOTR fans. But then again, who am I to say... 8.2 avg viewers rating speaks volumes. For me, this was brilliant special effects, great acting, and extremely poor story execution! The movie failed enough for me, that I'll like rent the sequels on pay-per-view, but have no interest in shelling our $12 for a movie ticket or $25 for the Blu-Ray.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson does it again,"Like all good stories there is always a beginning, middle and end.

The movie itself does not disappoint, another Peter Jackson masterpiece, when the movie ends after almost three hours you are left wanting more, the mark of a great movie. Rating this movie a ten does not give it justice, there are good, great and movies that sets the bar such as this one. Can't wait to see it in 64fps.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great watch,"The Hobbit is well-paced, starts with more of a back-story and introduction of the main characters before exploding with an action-packed second half. I can't remember all the little details from the book but the arc of the movie follows the book closely, which in my opinion is good.Most of the actors carried off their roles well but the one that stood out for me was Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. The movie version of Thorin has a lot more steel than the one in the book. Although Bilbo Baggins is the main character of this story, Peter Jackson has done a good job of fleshing out the main characters, giving enough screen time to each of them, especially Gandalf and Thorin.Would definitely recommend The Hobbit - I will watch it again myself, this time on 48fps format!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Wonderful production values, but lacks substance","Going into The Hobbit, it was always going to be about expectations. I must admit my expectations were very low. However, I went in with an open mind. The Hobbit was not as bad as I thought it would be, not a failure either: the production simply is too good. But it does not come close to The Lord of the Rigns either.One prejudice I had going before actually seeing it was that the splitting into three separate movies was induced by greed for cash. I was wrong. Having seen this, I am now convinced it was indeed a wrong decision to make three movies, but for a very different reason than I thought. Peter Jackson wants to tell every single line of the novel (and the LOTR appendix he used). This is actually a very admirable motive, clearly something a fan would do. The total opposite of milking an audience. But when translating novel to movie, such an approach does not work. An Unexpected Journey almost solely focuses on secondary matters, with perhaps only 20% of screen time contributing to the essential story. Three full-fledged movies for The Lord of the Rings were justified as there was a fleshed out story available. Three movies were mandatory there to tell the story right. This first entry into the new trilogy lacks such a substance. I truly think were this movie made before the success of TLOR a second set of eyes would have intervened, saying: ""Cut this and that"", resulting in a tighter result (not three movies, but one long or two short). Jackson had carte blanche now and was able to fulfill his dream of filming every line of the novel and more. Admirable, but not tight and substantial.Still, the production values are stunning. Martin Freeman is well-cast as a young Bilbo too. The landscapes are beautiful again. I must admit the first ten minutes were as good as any of the best scenes of TLOR too. If only there were more of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Innovation and perfection always comes at a cost...,"The most stupid comment about the movie was ""its too real, it reminds me of a documentary!!!"". And i guess that that summarize 99% of the problems with the title...peter Jackson was capable of getting the book and give it time on the screen to develop the story and the characters in one of the most beautiful fantasy roller coaster ever made. Even better of the lord of the rings trilogy.The editing is astounding, the musics are coherent all over the story and to dye for while photography its the best you can get at the movies.Right on top he redefined what colossal means and weta its the king of the hill when it comes too graphics way ahead of their competition.Hands down ""the hobbit"" its not only the best movie i have seen in 2012 but by far the best fantasy, action oriented, adaptation of a fantasy book to date. So loyal that manages to fill in the gaps that Tolkien wasn't allowed to put in the original story and left as notes about it.So whats the big noise about it? Well, thanks to the techniques used the movie can be disturbing, AT FIRST, because it looks real and thats weird for us to adapt to but going back to standard definition after it its tough. Another problem is that its not a stupid movie. Mind me, it has 1 and an 1/2 hours of chasing, fighting in such a pyrotechnic way that can only please but it has even time to let you think and admire the gorgeous world thats being unfolded in front of your eyes. Our generation of viewers doesn't agree too much with that. We are going towards a video game/cinema style of stories and ""the hobbit"" isn't that. The hobbit i quintessential, mind blowing, innovating great cinema and peter Jackson is, without any doubt, in the directors Olympus of our time. Thanks again mate.

A lackluster return to Middle-Earth,"For a long while Tolkien's work was deemed almost unfilmable. Yet, anyone who has seen 'The Lord of the Rings' knows this maxim is not true anymore. Peter Jackson did an excellent job in bringing to life Tolkien's masterpiece, so he decided to go back and also do his other introductory work: 'The Hobbit', an adventure that kinda sets up the events for the LotR adventure.Yet, this time around Jackson didn't manage the same amount of success.'The Hobbit' was already much more light-hearted, quasi-comedic in relation to its sequel, but 'An Unexpected Journey' goes a bit farther than needed. Far too much buffoonery, specially in its overlong introduction of the characters. Overlong introduction which, by the way, describes two points of my complaints against this.Like with 'Fellowship of the Ring', this ends up as mostly an introductory chapter. This is comprehensible, as most of these characters weren't even on the LotR films; still, while 'Fellowship' introduced and made sure to give each character an uniqueness, 'Journey' does not. The company of dwarfs are mostly personality-less; other than Thorin and the old dwarf, all others end up as mere background characters to the point it is not worthy (nor necessary) trying to remember their names. The addition of even more plot elements, some of which weren't even in the book, also hurts this a lot.Another problem is its length. Unlike LotR, 'The Hobit' is not big enough to warrant a trilogy (maybe two-parts, but not three). As such, Jackson has to make the film move at a snail's pace, dragging events and scenes far too long; at times, it makes what could have been a good scene boring and/or lose its impact/importance. Its terrible pace is such, this movie is almost 3-hour long when it could have been told and finished in mere 2-hours.Not only that, Jackson (or possibly Guillermo Del Toro, who was originally the one to do the script) litters the film with unnecessary scenes/plots not from its original source. They still keep to the nature of Tolkien's world, true, like the bit with Radagast and the whole Orc plot line, but they are overtly unnecessary. Like when he did LotR, Peter Jackson seems insecure of his storytelling and public's reaction to it, and forcefully changes the source material to seem more 'mainstream' and 'attractive' to audiences.As a result of its terrible pace and changes, the film drags on too much and takes away from the enjoyment, from the magic of Tolkien's mythos.The film is still good, despite those flaws. It still retains the incredible visual quality of the LotR trilogy, which helps making its pace somewhat bearable; still, as good as its effects are, at points it feels like it is dragging on purposefully to show off them (ie.: the 'mountain fighting' scene, which was kinda ridiculous). The casting is great as well: not only the returners from LotR (Ian McKellen once again steals the show as Gandalf, and we also get Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and even Andy Serkis as Gollum), but Martin Freeman is excellent as Bilbo (in special, his altercation with Gollum) and Richard Armitage as Thorin.The action and adventure aspects of the story are very good and the film still is entertaining, though very far from 'Lord of the Rings' level.Tolkien's characters and fantasy world is always good to watch, and Peter Jackson (despite all his insecurities) truly knows how to capture it in all its visual splendor; however, the film itself drags on to the point of boredom thanks to its horrendous pacing and the whole deviancy from the original storyline proves not only unneeded, but might actually put off the more rabid Tolkien followers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Did the user reviewers even watch the movie?,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one word: masterpiece. Upon looking at the user reviews I found many of them were negative, So I thought to myself: Who could've possibly disliked this movie. Honestly, it had humor, action, and it also stayed true to the book. Sure, the story was expanded upon with information that wasn't in the original Hobbit book, but Peter Jackson plainly stated that the movie would include information taken directly out of the appendices at the end of The Return of the King book. Even if you haven't read the book you will enjoy the movie. It sets up the LOTR series so well. So I'm pretty sure that the people who gave this movie one star either haven't seen it, slept through it, just like to mess with people, or are thinking of a different movie. I really hope someone sees this so they can know that this movie is definitely worth going to see, with others or by yourself. Thanks and I hope this helps!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderful interpretation of the classic.,"I never thought anyone could turn a book like The Hobbit into 3 movies, but Peter Jackson has in his interpretation of Tolkien's classic. People expecting a replica of the book will be disappointed. There is much embellishment in the story, but I think it's appropriate and well done. For example, in the film, you get a short history of the Thorin's people - how they lost Erebor, their kingdom and their struggle with the Orcs and Goblins. You get a strong sense of this theme running in this film; of these people, these dwarfs being like refugees - people without a home, driven from their homes by war, who will go to great costs to regain what they've lost (is this Peter Jackson's commentary on the world refugee crisis?). The sets, costumes and make-up are great. And Howard Shore's movie score is as usual fantastic. Looking forward to the next instalments, but gosh we must wait so long to see the entire thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth learning to watch movies again,"I saw the digital HFR 3D version, not sure what to expect. I liked ""Avatar"", but there were times when the 3D in that movie was simply distracting, and to be honest I can't even recall now what it looked like, which goes to show how much of an impact it made on me.Peter Jackson's HFR 3D technology, though, is another thing entirely. For the first time the movie screen is an actual window into another world. In fact, I think that's the part of my visual brain that was activated by this film: the ""window"" part, not the ""movie"" part.They say your brain has to learn how to interpret pictures, and it's different from interpreting the real world through your eyes. That's why ""tilt-shift"" miniaturisation works, by activating a part of your brain that has learned how to associate camera focus with distance.HFR 3D is the opposite of tilt-shift. It makes the world in the film full size. You ""know"" you're looking at a real world because that's the part of your brain that Jackson has managed to reach.To fully enjoy this movie, you have to learn how to watch movies all over again, and this movie makes it worth doing so. It really is a masterpiece. I'm looking forward to my future visits to Jackson's world in 2013 and 2014.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A movie not able to live up to its expectations.,"Peter Jackson's The Hobbit has hit cinemas with a hype collected by his previous The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Ian McKellen (Lord of the Rings) reprises his role as Gandalf while Martin Freeman (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) plays a young Bilbo Baggins. For those who do not know, The Hobbit is a prequel focusing on the tales of Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey as they attempt to take back the original homeland of the Dwarfs with a group of thirteen chosen dwarfs.As this movie was released by itself, I will not be taking into account what could potentially happen, or if improvements made within the future ones.Peter Jackson's use of CGI is very well done. This is highly prevalent within multiple scenes, however stands out within Gollum's scenes. Jackson has done well with utilising technology along with Andy Serkis to create a better looking Gollum as well as a very good scene.The world of Middle Earth is created fantastically. From the beautiful city of Riverdale alongside its waterfalls to the fantastic like homes of the Hobbits in The Shire, Jackson creates it so well that it immerses the audience. The inhabitants are also complemented alongside the lore of the film with the use of CGI. In other words, Jackson shows that Middle Earth is never boring.The use of costumes has been done well, as expected. The audience is further immersed with the different armours that both the Elven forces and the dwarven forces possess, as an example.The Hobbit's story is average. While it does have evidence of its Lord of the Ring roots within it, it can be seen as a bit redundant with the use of its unneeded action scenes as well as the lack of character development (which will be discussed below)When watching the movie, I found that the characters were not very memorable. Jackson has seemed to replace the Fellowship, a group of memorable characters which I had grown to learn and love, with a ragtag group of stereotypical dwarfs. Character development is most non- existent as the story does not go into enough detail explaining each individual character and their motives and as such, I became distant with the characters - even the charismatic King Thorin.That being said, Bilbo Baggins' character development is evident and quite well received. As the viewers travel with Bilbo, we can see his eventual transformation into his scared and timid nature to an adventurer.Relationships are pretty standard within The Hobbit. Due to the dwarfs having almost non-existent personalities, much relationship potential between them and Bilbo is lost. What really stands out, however, is the progression between Bilbo and Thorin, who begin as indifferent.The Hobbit's soundtrack is very nice and varied, which gives a very nice touch to the movie. From the upbeat dwarven melodies to the melancholy ones, it gives the audience a nice transition into the film and into the next films.Many of the action scenes, I thought, were not required to be in the film. It could be seen as a time filler, or even potentially a way for time length to be at par with the original trilogy.Despite having the expectations of being as legendary as the Lord of The Rings and the fan base, it fails to live up to it. However, when set aside from the trilogy, it is quite a solid movie. For those who are new to Middle Earth and its inhabitants, I recommend the original trilogy. However, for die hard fans of the original trilogy as well as fantasy goers, this is a flick you do not want to miss.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Sometimes I think they enforce the idiom 'pride comes before a fall', and want previous successes to be tempered by present failure.That's what I think has happened here. Of all the reviews of this movie I've read at least half were negative, giving less than half the available marks.Let me rectify this by saying I don't know how anyone can view this film and see it as anything other than the epic masterpiece it is.Not only does Jackson wonderfully encompass the plot of 'The Hobbit', but he draws in further prose from Tolkien's wider collected writings to flesh out those portions of 'The Hobbit' that are only alluded to in the original children's book.The sets, lighting, cinematography, CG work, dialogue, editing and plot are all extremely strong. After almost 3 hours I found myself wanting more.Are we so spoiled we will see this visual wonder as anything but phenomenal? So jaded that we can look at this spectacle with indifference? So cynical as to say this magic is not worth the effort of sitting and looking?To criticise a movie this excellent and of this scale and granduer as much as certain critics have is simply disingenuous. This is evidenced by the box office results - the public clearly have little respect for the critics and until they are more honest in their criticism they will find their voices increasingly silent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
WOW! Better than the book... loved it.,"The Hobbit, as a book, and as a story is a little weaker when compared to those of LOTR. But this movie for a change, outshines the book.... everything about this movie is awesome. The pace is perfect and gives us fan boys of the series, enough time to soak in LOTR nostalgia. The references are so very well placed too. For once, the critics who reviewed negatively do not matter. The scenes between Bilbo and Gollum are alone enough reason to give it a 10 rating. Add to that the ever wonderful background score, the amazing cinematography with stunning visuals, and some superlative performances by all the actors, this movie satiates everyone's thirst for middle earth adventure.Watch it in anyway you wish to, it will still manage to surpass your expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fun return to Middle Earth that is damaged by a drawn out plot and some overused CGI aesthetic choices,"The making of the Hobbit is a story to tell in its own right with film rights being tossed around in legal battles for years before the MGM finally obtained everything it needed to get the production moving. Sadly MGM was in a bit of a financial bind and went bankrupt which held things up for more than a couple of years. During this financial standstill, Peter Jackson was brought into produce and was eventually moved in to direct after Guillermo del Toro had to leave because of the uncertain future of the project. Finally, the first part of the prelude to Lord of The Rings has arrived in the form of An Unexpected Journey. Has the decade long wait been worth it or is the cinematic Middle Earth best left to the history books?Read full Review: wp.me/p1tyJd-lf",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Saturday arvo matinée fare...62.5+%,"It takes a little while, but eventually this movie does make the prospect of seeing more in the series interesting. Roughly 30 odd minutes. That first half hour is a real chore to watch and you wonder if you have the stomach for another two and a bit hours of it. In it you have Bilbo Baggins (as an old Hobbit...still played by Martin Freeman?) narrate some events which he was not a witness to in order to introduce us to the adventures he had as a young Hobbit as a result. I was actually wondering if the entire movie would be like a bedtime story! All this alternates in that first half hour with scenes of the old Bilbo at his home with his son Frodo (just Googled him...""adoptive heir"" is the phrase used to describe him), preparing for some ""party"". It's all just so incredibly dull...perfunctory dialogue and action which just makes you question why it so lovingly depicted. In fact, the dialogue is just uninspired...low level writing...not showing but saying.Things don't improve that much when Bilbo is imposed upon by a small band of dwarfs, including their prince, Thorin (played by Richard Armitage). Thorin plans to reclaim his ancestral home from a covetous dragon. The dwarfs intend Bilbo to help them do this...something which Bilbo is understandably reluctant to agree to. The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) is set on having Bilbo join the adventure in any case. It's as tiresome and annoying to watch this deluge of dwarfs in Bilbo's house as it is for Bilbo, who likes his house to be neat. And when the dwarfs sing...hmm...entertainment ain't what it used to be!Anyway, the movie is almost ready to redeem itself...but not before having some perfunctory action scenes. Not sure whether the flaws of the movie are the flaws of the book (not having read either of Tolkien's famous novels but enjoying the previous ""Rings"" trilogy...especially the second, which knows how to stage engrossing action scenes), but the film does not come across as great art. It's more like adequate Saturday afternoon matinée fare...and on that level it delivers...albeit in just under three hours! Whilst the early part of the movie comes across as a children's fairytale, the latter part of the movie is pitched more at adults...there is some violence which I think would not be suitable to a very young audience, perhaps.At some point the movie rises above these humble beginnings and makes you want to follow the story down the road. After the great work of the ""Rings"" trilogy by the same maker (Peter Jackson), The Hobbit seems like a precursor work where those involved find it hard to reach the right tone. Richard Armitage's Thorin at times seems nothing but poses. Cate Blanchett's character of Galadriel doesn't seem to capture the ethereal tone she set much better in the ""Rings"" trilogy. And the quizzical elvin poses seem style over substance often times too...suggesting dogs...or Spock. All this just adds to the sense of a story full of action which signifies nothing.Sad to say, these weren't the only times I found proceedings just plain silly. Imagine my surprise when told that dragons ""covet gold""! M'kay. When the stone giants fight, that just seems pure popcorn from a Saturday arvo matinée with no pretensions of greatness. With such silliness going on, the at times solemnity and earnestness is an odd fit for this kind of story.Since this trilogy will be a prequel to the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy, I now wish that I had remembered more of the story of the ring in that previous trilogy. It's also a pity that some of Gollum's intriguing riddles are difficult to understand and so are missed because the movie wants Gollum to be quite ""Other"". Hopefully the DVD will have subtitles!It was interesting to read the disclaimer at the end of the movie about no animals being harmed in the making of this movie. I think that that is what was stated. That might be false advertising as this movie has been in the news prior to its release for the number of animals that died during the making of it...goats and horses, I believe.Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, hopefully things will improve from here on in. Currently it seems like a glorified ""B"" movie, with hammy acting and some nothing dialogue. But it would take a pretty bad sequel for me to give up on the trilogy.It must be noted though that the cinematography and special effects are a treat...an award for the latter would be deserved, if not the former...but I do like ""Life of Pi"" for that honour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Amazing, has blown me away.","This review is going to be very short, because I am still completely blown away. It rendered me speechless. I saw the Hobbit last night and I can't stop being in the movie, in my head. Sinking back into Middle Earth is executed perfectly, it's as if we have never left. For me that's one of the biggest strengths of this movie.I heard complaints that it is a less epic story than LOTR, and in fact: it is, as it well should be. It is more of a 'fantasy meet a road movie' than LOTR has been. But for me it doesn't take away anything from the amazing, most beautifully crafted spaces of Middle Earth and the characters played SUPERBLY by Freeman or Armitage. I loved seeing the old characters coming back, for some reason I really liked seeing Elrond, he is fully fleshed out this time around. In short, this was amazing.Add the score that is hauntingly familiar yet completely new, with a dark, murky, cave-like undertones of dwarfs, and you have perfection. I think shots and music are a work of genus. I will be coming back to the cinema for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey unless you read the book which was forty times shorter and for children.,"Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic movie, but only if you've read the Silmarillion and drew obscene pictures of elves as a kid. Otherwise this massive undertaking to bring the classic children's book to life is as convoluted as a trans gender midget in clown make-up that only washes VW buses for a living. While this level of depth worked perfectly for Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's absolutely ridiculous in a movie based off a book that was created to maintain an eight year old's attention span.I love Tolkien, and I'll go toe-to-toe with anyone regarding Middle Earth trivia but The Hobbit was a first attempt children's book by a master linguist who wrote it as he went along. Look at the first two chapters of the book and you'll see there's a natural narrator that somehow disappears as Tolkien starts to find confidence in his ability to craft the story. It's simple and fun, and that's what makes it such a great lead-in to his epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Unfortunately for Jackson's wallet, Tolkien's The Hobbit isn't nearly as detailed as his great masterpiece, which forces Jackson to pull out every back story he could to warrant three years of merchandising all because King Kong sucked as bad as Jack Black in the Pit Fall commercial.So going into it, you should know that 75% of the film has nothing to do with the original book and is full of abstract back story that you can only find in the comment section of the appendix section of the Silmarillion. Now if you don't know what that massively long book is about, then congratulations on having fun in college. It was a culmination of all of Tolkien's background work in creating the world of Middle Earth, and is awe-inspiring to say the least. It also helped guide him into singlehandedly creating fantasy fiction as we know it today. But The Hobbit was his first attempt, and made for children, not Harry Knowles. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first three hour entry to a trilogy that is based off of a 320 page book, which adds up to a nine overall hour film derived from a book that can be read by an elementary school teacher in less than four, according to yahoo answers which is never wrong.I hate to knock The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, because as a Tolkien dork, I loved it. I felt goosebumps while watching some of my most nostalgic memories come to life, such as the troll battle and riddle game with Gollum. But in typical Jackson style, he altered these classic moments so that they were almost indistinguishable from the original version just like that prick George Lucas, post 1985. If you don't believe me, go back and read the troll scene and then compare how close to the original it stayed. Or find one single mention of Radagast riding a sled of bunnies anywhere in The Hobbit, or Lord of the Rings for that matter, and I'll forgive Jackson's insult of leaving out Beorn the shape-shifter or Bombadil (I realize he was in the LOTR, but I can still harbor resentment).Still as I said before, I enjoyed the movie and must give credit where it's due, and there were many things that worked including the superb cast. The fantastic Martin Freeman starring as the young Bilbo Baggins was stellar as expected, as he's mainly known for respected roles in original series like The Office and Sherlock, among others. Furthermore the rest of the cast is engaging and really embraces their fantastical roles, particularly the forty five dwarfs whom I'm not going into detail about because there's too many. Also watching the early stages of Gandalf, played perfectly by Sir Ian McKellen, was refreshing and brought a greater impact when you go back to watch the LOTR trilogy. It's also impossible to fault Jackson completely as a director, simply by how he maintained the basic ties to the themes that worked from the LOTR's series, such as the beautiful cinematography and incomparable score by the great Howard Shore.Still the film was confusing and unfocused. While the earlier trilogy was complex and could also be seen as overwhelming, LOTR centered on a small cast of heroes that we rooted for and a clear cut villain, and so was easier to follow. With The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, we have the entire cast of the Keystone Cops to keep up with, not to mention a hodgepodge of orc leaders mixed with the mysterious darkness in Mirkwood, as well as Smaug the Dragon, whom the eleven year old that forces me to eat crème horns after midnight can't wait to see. Then you have to remember that most of the plot development has yet to happen, which makes this first installation pretty much three hours of listening to a bunch of dwarfs spinning yarns to a hobbit who gives about a much of a damn as you did before you found out your grandfather really worked as a women's shoe salesman in Albuquerque during Iwo Jima.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was a fun film to watch if you have any idea who the Witch-King of Angmar or Gary Gygax is. I won't lie that I personally enjoyed the movie, but my nine year old nephew, who had just read the book to get ready for opening night, walked away having a better understanding of how itemized tax deduction works than what we just sat through. So wait till all three versions have come out in three years, and watch it all at one time. Or just buy the original Rankin/Bass Production on vinyl here, or the 1977 movie version because it's awesome and doesn't involve knowing who Mithrandir is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"POINTLESS, no character development or emotion, BORING","The Hobbit SUCKED. It's like Star Wars Episode 1, all effects, no character development or emotional content. No charm, no magic.Horribly cliché script and dialog, terrible pacing (did we really need to see dwarfs eating for a half hour?). You know there's a problem with the entire audience is happy to see Gollum--and he elicits the most empathy!Really, this was inexcusably bad, from the dwarf makeup that looked like early Star Trek prosthetics, to the boring effects, to them slowly traipsing through New Zealand which we saw three times before.This was about nothing. Bilbo should be the center of the movie, right, but he wasn't. You didn't get to know him or care. He goes from freaking out because the dwarfs are using his dishes, to the next morning waking up and wanting to go with them-- with NO hint of why his character would make such a huge shift.It doesn't matter how much CGI you have, if you don't have people to root for, you simply don't care and all those battles are boring! Compare this with ""Life of Pi"" where the CGI was totally in service of the characters, where you cares about the boy--and even the tiger!There was NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE. It's insulting and stupid that they're turning this one book into three bad movies, just try to make one GOOD one.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Success,"Few non-elven words can describe how pleasantly surprised I was by this film. At first, I was seeing the movie simply because I wanted to experience the new 48 fps and what better way to do that than taking a trip back to Middle-Earth. However, once the film started, I was immediately mentally and emotionally immersed in the very simplistic yet intriguing tale of Bilbo Baggins.Being a major Tolkien fan and a self titled Middle-Earth historian, I had very high expectations for the film. From the few clips I had scene, I was a little worried that Peter Jackson was going to pull a ""James Cameron"" and forget that the effects should compliment the story, not drive it. The Hobbit is a simple story and I didn't want this factor to push Jackson to add pointless scenes and characters simply to make his trilogy a possibility. However, this was not the case. I was throughly pleased to see another brilliant work of art come from the mind of Peter Jackson.The Hobbit is no epic like Fellowship, Two Towers, or Return of the King, but it does stay true to the emotional and humanness that we find within our beloved hobbits. The Hobbit holds countless comical, emotional, and action packed moments that leave the viewer like a Hobbit at a feast, begging for more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"One of the greatest cinematic experiences, ever!","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is here at last and it's worth its wait in gold, ten times over! It is unquestionably one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever, and a proud prequel to the equally consummate The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Spectacular beyond belief, this emotional and visceral visual flight of fantasy truly celebrates the art of storytelling and storymaking at its most enchanting and mesmerising.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is one of the most imaginative and gripping stories ever, and as a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is what cinema and the art of filmmaking is all about.It's astounding to think that one of the greatest stories ever told, brought to life by one of the greatest filmmaking teams in the world, sprung from the fertile imagination of Bloemfontein-born J.R.R. Tolkien – it is interesting that as a child Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider, which is echoed in The Hobbit. Also, the themes of personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story and along with motifs of warfare; these themes reflect Tolkien's own experiences during World War I.And, NO, I am not going to reveal anything about The Hobbit's story; it will a deadly shame to ruin such a refined and illuminating experience.What makes The Hobbit such an endearing and memorable journey, is that its magnificent and overwhelming epic grandeur, and gallant mythology are grounded in an astounding magic realism.There are moments that take your breath away and willfully imprison your imagination, unlike anything you have experienced before.Even if you are not a Lord of the Rings follower, you cannot deny its artistic merits and intelligent storytelling.And if you experience The Hobbit fresh, without having read the book and still have some vivid recollections of The Lord of the Rings films, you will most definitely make a point of watching the entire saga all over again; this is one marathon you can look forward to.One of the most charming aspects of The Hobbit is its characters; good or bad, meaningful or malevolent, each and every creation is unique and perfectly brought to life – from Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey, to 13 fortune-seeking dwarfs, the legendary Dwarf warrior Thorin Oakenshield, dragons, to giant spiders, hostile elves, ravenous wolves, and – perhaps the most perilous of all – a subterranean creature named Gollum, they are all magnificent in both performance and realisation.Director Peter Jackson's passion deserves every award bestowed on him and his team, particularly his dynamic co-screen writing team of Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, his fellow Oscar-winning co-writers on The Lord of the Rings films, along with Guillermo del Toro.They pieced material together an additional treasure trove of material from a revered English writer, professor and philologist developed in the decades after The Hobbit was first published, as well as 125 pages of appendices at the end of The Lord of the Rings which provided more back-story to the history of Middle-earth, describing some of the politics and events that occur during the years pertaining to The Hobbit and was more serious, darker in tone, and more in line with The Lord of the Rings.Although there are moments of pure terror, its nightmarish horror never offends or becomes overbearing; the dark forces of antagonism become a worthy opponent in the warzone for supremacy.Another great aspect of The Hobbit is that it underlines an important message during a time of war and dispute; and shows that home is indeed where the heart is and that outside familiar comfort zones, there lies an adventure that challenges the endurance of the human spirit and ultimately reveals our true humanity.The Hobbit also shines a beacon of hope for outsiders who grow up in a shadow of destitute and loneliness, showing that friendship can be found in the most unlikely of places and that it can indeed make the world a better and more peaceful kingdom for all to share and rejoice in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
God Bless you Peter Jackson.  Thank you so Much!,"As a HUGE Lord of the Ring trilogy fan, I was looking forward to going on my own ""great adventure"" to the movie theater to take in The Hobbit. I was not disappointed as this movie delivered all of the goods and them some!This wonderful movie was a ""visual feast"" from start to finish. One of my friends really dislikes all of the JRR Tolkien works. He hated LOTR. But that didn't stop me from going to see this wonderful movie. There were so many great parts to it. All of the dwarfs didn't really seem as small as Gimli did in LOTR but they were all wonderful and captured my heart and gave me so much inspiration. The Hobbit himself was amazingly well cast for the part. The animated Hobbit had Bilbo appear as a fat sort of a hobbit with a huge nose. The movie version cast Bilbo Baggins perfectly!The monsters in this movie were so amazing! The Goblin King with the gross flab of flesh for a beard was beyond sinister and of course his legions of goblins were gross and wonderful! The dwarfs and Gandalf sure did kick their asses in the caves! There were only 15 of them vs. 1000s of Goblins and they did wonderful.That leads us to Gollum. Oh yes, ""my precious"" is enhanced in this movie and has superb facial expressions thanks to the animators at Digital Domain!!!I can't say enough how good this movie is. I am just forever in debt to Peter Jackson and thankful he is making two more Hobbit movies.

I'm glad that Piter made this movie with ""childish"" humor, since the book is written in a very different way than the LOTR. The scenery is (again) amazing, and in my opinion Andy Serkis gave his best performance ever! However, to someone who doesn't know what this film is about, it would seem that Dwarfs are the main carracters, and Bilbo is left behind. The thing that I most dislike is the scene when Dwarfs sing Far over the misty mountins... That's probably the best theme this year, and it seems it was put in the movie with no care, like: ""Ok, we need to put this in, oh, here's the good spot!"" But it wasn't!

"If you're worried about The Hobbit, fear not!","I was very taken aback, as well as disappointed, at the many negative reviews coming from critics. It did seem, however, that most of the negative reviews revolved around a couple of key point: the technology, and the pacing.Quite simply, all I can say is that critics can be very wrong, and The Hobbit is truly a great film, continuing Peter Jacksons addition to the Middle Earth legacy.Technology-wise, the use of HFR (48 frames per second) was, as many have said, unusual to begin with. However, after around ten minutes you barely register the difference, and it just adds a huge level of depth and immersion not capable in 24fps. The heavier CGI use compared to LotR, which admittedly worried me a lot, also turned out to be absolutely fine as well. If anything, it reflects the more wonderful and light tone of the Hobbit book.In terms of pacing, all I can say is that there is a fairly long introduction to the film, including the scenes in The Shire. This is in no way a bad thing; we are being introduced to the start of a three-part epic trilogy, and to anyone who enjoyed LotR, they will only find this an enjoyable experience, rather than tedious as some critics have said. As far as I can see, PJ has been given even more freedom this time round due to the success of LotR, so has essentially released an extended edition in the cinema.I don't need to say, but the characterisation, set pieces, action and storytelling is typically amazing.So, there really is nothing to worry about, a great film. Just don't expect it to be LotR; its a little more light-hearted, and not QUITE as strong, although very close. I can only assume a lot of the critics are trying to be edgy, hipster, whatever, by panning what will obviously be a hugely successful, influential, and above all loved film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Excellent and Entertaining, rich history of Middle-Earth, 48FPS is nice!","I saw the movie on 12/12/12 in Zurich. Our party purposely booked the 48FPS 3D version. We had to check out that new technology.After reading early reviews of the movie and especially of the 48FPS technology, I was getting skeptical about what was going to expect us.But be assured this movie totally rocks!! Also the 48FPS are very noticeable, but in a positive way. Breathtaking! I will be watching it again though in 24FPS 3D just to compare. And then again at 24FPS 2D...I am a Tolkien geek who loves the books. Still I am very well aware that certain changes are necessary to bring the story to the big screen effectively.I read the Hobbit and the appendices just a couple of weeks before seeing the movie and I was delighted that certain scenes made it into the movie almost one-to-one not only from The Hobbit, but also from the Lord of the Rings appendices. And for the changes that Peter Jackson and his team made, I fully OK with them. After all this is their interpretation of the books.To me as a Tolkien geek, this gives the movie so much more history and richness, just beautiful! A lot people in early reviews complained about the running time of The Hobbit. That it's too long. Well our entire party (also non-geeks and average movie goers) after the movie did not feel like 'phew, it's finally over' but rather felt like 'what? over already, oh man can't wait to see it again...'... which we gladly will.Don't trust any movie critics, go and see The Hobbit yourself to judge it.

In my opinion not that great of a movie.,"I just came back from the movie and I felt a strong urge to write a review on it. I have never written a review before on anything, so I registered to IMDb and just started writing this.This movie will be forgotten very quickly I think. Yes it has the epic effects, yes the scenery is amazing, but like Avatar, the plot is greatly lacking. I found myself saying to myself often ""who cares?"" throughout the movie.I am not a LOTR fanboy, far from it. I do think they were great movies, but I haven't seen them again since they came out, so my review isn't coming from a fanboy POV.The chain of events in the movie is quite ludicrous. More then not it was quite clear to me that the plot was made up just to give an excuse to have huge CGI spectacles. I read the book a long time ago but I am certain a lot of the plot is made up since half of what happens I have no memory of ever taking place in the book. Granted, it's downright visually stunning at times and I was like I WANT TO GO THERE! Whenever I saw the beautiful lush landscapes LOTR is known for. But how many times can you be shown beautiful scenes before you get bored of them, and waiting for that something to happen.That brings me to another point. Most of the time I was sitting in the theater, I felt as though I was waiting for it to begin. Just waiting for things to start rolling, for the adventure to begin, and I left the theater quite underwhelmed, with that feeling never being satisfied.Especially when the ending came (which I will not spoil for you), one thing was clear to me. The main goal of this movie was to make money. It's not hard to throw boatloads of money and make epic CGI sequences (much like the movie 2012, which this movie reminds me of in more then one way, for example the many ""nail biting"" scenes where they are saved by a hair, cliché scenes where they are hanging by one hand, etc) It is a lot of show and very little soul. Yes it's a fun movie to go through albeit can be boring a lot of the time, it is still a good time, there are some good laughs to be had as well, but falls short of the original trilogy by a mile.In summery, with more show then soul, The Hobbit falls short of being a memorable film.(if you found this review helpful please tell me, I really want to know if people like my review or not. Also feel free to comment to me!! :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"An enjoyable, warbling and bloated return to middle earth","(reviewed from a 24 fps 2D screening) Some things are pretty indisputable about the Hobbit: the story has been stretched (for the sake of Commerce) to the point of breaking and for a pretty lean novel, it feels bloated and tangential. But for the most part I quite enjoyed this return to middle earth, admittedly from a lot of LOTR nostalgia.When the Hobbit works it works because of Peter Jackson's sure grasp of how he wants to present middle earth and it's characters. Visually the film looks amazing and the use of New Zealand as a stand in for middle earth is once again fantastic. The action is staged brilliantly and I'd go so far as to say Jackson should be mentioned alongside Scorsese when speaking in terms of camera movement. Also the great cast and memorable characters ensures there's usually something compelling about any given dialogue scene.Where the Hobbit doesn't work is where it feels so intent on elongating the material to add unnecessary elements and incorporate material from Tolkien's The Simarillion, which amount to making the film feel episodic. There were moments when we'd return to Bilbo and I'd forget he was even in the film (this cannot be wholly contributed to my early onset Alzheimers) and scenes that went on for 5 or so minutes but could have been expressed in a few simple lines of dialogue (the dwarfs eating Bilbo's food was pretty unbearable).But I cannot deny that I relished the opportunity to revisit middle earth and although my opinion of the film will probably diminish in subsequent viewings, watching orcs get beheaded is my definition of entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
What if we Sit on them and Squash them into Jelly?,"That's what I would like to do to the Trolls who are attacking every positive review in here (probably using multiple IDs). We'd have quite a glob of squished IMDb trolls, maybe enough to satisfy even the Three Trolls of Trollshaw.Peter Jackson once again visits Hobbiton and takes us with him, this time for real, as they have left the Hobbiton set standing. In my mind only Jackson could have made this, just like only he, an unlikely Director, could have made the first (Or rather, Second) Trilogy. Is ""The Hobbit"" a 200-page book? No, actually it is more like 986, at least in i-Books. Regardless of book length on paper or in Bytes, what is forgotten is that ""The Hobbit"" is simply one very small part of a much larger story written by Tolkein which included ""The Hobbit"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""The Silmarillon"", and several collections of ""Lost Tales"". If you are not interested in the whole of Tolkein's Awesome Creation, then maybe these trilogies are not for you. As this story never really begins, and never really ends, I can live with these very short in perspective sorties into Middle Earth that these films afford us. Jackson has handed us a window into Middle Earth, a doorway in fact. We can either enter and enjoy it as it is, or spend our time using multiple IMDb accounts trying to drag this film and the others down. Me, I prefer to enjoy them, and write about why I enjoyed them.First off, I don't think Two Hours and Forty-Nine Minutes are enough. And in fact, the extended version is over three hours. And that is almost enough, at least for this first part.We are given an illustrated history of how the Dragon ""Smaug"" (Benedict Cumberbatch/Khan) took down the town of Dale while getting at the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor for it's Gold, and the unhappy history of Thror, the King Under the Mountain, and his son Thrain, and grandson and subject of this film, Thorin Oakenshield, named for the Oaken Branch he used while fighting the Orc ""Azog the Defiler"". This all given to us by Ian Holm as ""Old Bilbo"", in a note to Frodo (Elijah Wood, looking very much as he did almost 15 years ago).This gives us something to grab onto, since The Hobbit is the same story as Lord of The Rings. It gives us a continuity as Old Bilbo reminisces of a time 60 years past - At which point Bilbo meets Gandalf, who looks basically the same as he did in Lord of the Rings - When he was still Gandalf the Gray. Enter 13 Dwarfs led by Thorin, who ""Blunt the Knives and Bend the Forks"" while eating all of Bilbo's food - Of which Bombur doesn't use a knife, eating blocks of Cheese whole.One thing these films have more of, and even more in the extended editions, are the delightful Songs of Middle Earth, mostly in the same form as they are in the books, even a few from Lord of the Rings that we missed in those films.As far as young Bilbo is concerned, Martin Freeman portrays a much different Bilbo at first, and as the films proceed the mannerisms start becoming more like Old Bilbo. I was expecting 13 Dwarfs much like Gimli, but we never saw any Young Dwarfs in Lord of the Rings. Apparently they look very Human until they start digging for Gold and their noses grow. These are all relatively Young Dwarfs save Balin, and they show his progression from being younger in Flashback. Fili and Kili are most handsome dwarves, Kili (Aidan Turner) even managing to attract a wood-elf. More about that in part II.This was Middle Earth as it was before the end of The Third Age, there was more Magic, this was reflected in the look of Elves and of Rivendell, even of Orcs, Goblins, and Trolls, all riding Wargs. By the time of Frodo, much of this magic had been subdued.By my second viewing I was better able to see which effects and characters were practical and which CGI, there are a lot of practical shots and Miniatures. What we are offered here is a level far beyond Lord of the Rings, it works because that is how the story is.After the party gets abducted by the Trollshaw Trolls, the film veers away from the book somewhat, expanding the role of Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy). Or merely telling us more than is told in the book, not necessarily adding more than is in The Hobbit, merely foreshadowing things to come in Lord of the Rings- such as The Release of The Witch King of Angmar and the rest of ""The Nine"", further trying the loose ends of Lord of the Rings.There is one little thing about Stone Giants, I thought this had been made up and added, in fact, Gandalf talks about it briefly in the book. Once we get into Goblin Town and Bilbo meets Gollum, it is the heart of the story, ""Riddles in the Dark"". Maybe Guillermo del Toro had something to do with the look of the Stone Giants, feels like his handiwork.There is one severe homage: during the escape from the Goblin Tunnels, see if you can find something that looks a LOT like the escape over the bridge in Khazad-Dûm, even including steep wooden ""staircases"" and a short wooden bridge. Where, instead of just Gandalf falling, everyone does. But just like at Khazad-dûm, there is a similar huge obstacle, a ""Fat-rog"" if you will, rather than a Balrog. Just watch the ""Riddles in the Goblin Tunnels"" section. And of course Andy Serkis is Gollum once again, before he takes over duties as the 2nd Unit Director, a job he performed dutifully. If anywhere a script supervisor was needed, it was needed for the scenes where young Bilbo finds something that falls out of Sméagol's poopy garment... They did a better job with ""Roast Mutton"" and the final disposition, and position, of the Trollshaw trolls.To be Continued.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"An enormous amount of filler, but enjoyable nonetheless.","The major problem with the hobbit trilogy is that it should not have been a trilogy but a single film. It is a very simple tale, that has been padded enormously throughout the three films, especially if you watch the extended versions which are each 3 hours long. That's 9 hours for a story contained in a single book.The first episode (an unexpected journey) is the weakest of the three in my opinion. It sets off with an interesting premise (a quest) but 90% of the film is basically the cast of characters running from the same orcs, in a three hour film, along with meaningless events such as encountering Goblins who dance and sing a song (almost Disney like).It's just pretty terrible compared to the amazing original trilogy, but it's still Peter Jackson and Lord of the Rings, so is enjoyable in a way.I highly suggest you watch the theatrical version of this film and not bother with the three hour extended version. This is something I usually don't recommend, but here it's really three long hours of not much happening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: an unexpected greatness,"I Wasn't really exited about this movies since the second I heard they were making three of them, from ONE amazing book, then hearing it'll include other stories was too much for any purist J.R.R. Tolkien fan... how can something like that be any good? it'll be a mess and obviously nothing I'd get to enjoy at all.Who'd knew I was wrong... The whole movie has the same magic brought in the original three Lord of the rings movies, the characters, old and new are just perfectly casted. seeing familiar faces, having almost exact quotes in the early scenes, hearing The Shire theme song again, it held and twisted my heart once more. it sounds emotional and subjective, but this movies, and the books for those who read them when young are emotional and subjective, so the second I heard the story of Erebor, Smaug, the Arkenstone and Thorin and Thrain and everything else it was just perfect, long time since I enjoyed a movie like I did with this one.I'm pretty sure there's no actual spoilers on a story this old, is like giving spoilers on Snow white... but even if I tell you every detail you'll find a million things to enjoy when watching this piece of art.Once more we have a great cast of perfect nobodies, once more we have characters that are so different and embody the different races in middle earth in a way that having me wondering if Peter Jackson and his team has someone to get advise from.The story is fast, there's always something happening, adventure and danger in every scene, strength and courage, lessons to learn just like that first time when you read the book. Is never boring and is never too much you have the time to soak in every detail and is like one fast visit, it last forever and one can't have enough. Sometimes they use lines right out of the book and it carries the book to you again. I could hear my sister's voice reading the trolls dialog.Thorin's story, Richard Armitage was only Guy of Gisborne to me, from a Robin Hood TV Series a couple years ago, I never even payed attention to him aside of the fact that he was the only good actor on that show, and seeing him as Thorin Oakenshield was enough to bring memories of other times. Some dwarfs are well known too, Kili, from being Human, he's great, you can see how talented this kid is, Bofur was Jekill and he's also lost in his character, some of the older guys are funny and strong and so believable. I've heard complains of the dwarfs looking too Disney, to me they're perfect! if they keep doing them all Gimli like we couldn't point one from the other, this way is easier and better. There are pieces that are not from the original story,but I'm okay with it.Extra points for the Music, if Howard Shore doesn't get an Oscar this time there's no justice in this world, Song of the Misty mountain is powerful and great and adds emotion to scenes where not one word is spoken yet you see feelings and changes. The other song at Bilbo's house was even better. All in all is a great first adventure if you've lived under a rock this last decade and have never seen the Lord of The Rings trilogy and is a great new adventure if you've enjoyed the first three.One of the best movies ever, There's so much I'd like to convey in this review but my mind is clouded with sentiments and this weird innocent awe that seems to fill me, I was held by the hand the second Bilbo start with his ""My Dear Frodo.."" and dragged back to middle Earth where the last bit of my childhood resides.I honestly hope you get to enjoy this movie half as much as I do, then you'll understand this ramble.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Welcome back Middle-Earth,"First off, I must tell you all that I am a normal guy.. not some movie critic who knows all about directing or anything on the technical side but listen here.. Don't be fooled by the critics!The Hobbit tonight was one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen in my life. I am a Tolken fan and a Peter Jackson ""Lord Of The Rings"" fan but I think like a lot of 'Star Wars' fans of the original trilogy, you can tell whether the prequel is good or back no matter how much you love the original or the world it has created.I hear all these people going on about frame rate.. how it's been ""hollywooded"" up.. poor connection to the viewer and all these other reasons why the Hobbit was disappointing.. but I don't understand what these 'critics' were watching.For a fan.. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was everything you wanted, needed and more.. The characters, locations, action, storyline, memorable scenes (The Riddles) and humour is everything the Hobbit needed to be. It is not 'Childish'.. it is purely more light hearted than Lord of the Rings because it is true to the original author!For someone who has not entered the world of Middle-Earth.. There is no way that you will not enjoy the ride!(By the way.. if you don't like 3D.. WATCH IT IN 2D!!)I hope you guys have had or will have a similar experience to the one I had.. Going in with high expectations and being completely satisfied is something special.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a film where you can get sucked into its world easily. And when the credits start rolling, miss and crave to be back into the same world... A year is way too long for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.. Bring it on!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A new epic trilogy commences,"Watched 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' last week - and loved it. Great to be transported to Middle-earth and get reacquainted with some familiar faces - and meet many new ones too. Awesome vistas, plenty of action, and nice ties to the LOTR story lines. The cast performances were great - with special mentions to Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, and newcomers Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage. Saw it in 3D HFR and the clarity is amazing - like being in the story. Looking forward to seeing it again next week. And I can't wait for Part 2 in December. It promises plenty - Thranduil, Legolas, Tauriel, Bard and Laketown, Spiders and Flies, Beorn, and Smaug. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
overuse of deus ex machina,"The story was interesting, but the threat of danger became increasingly contrived for all the protagonists. Major disruptions turn out to be fairly inconsequential hickups in the quest to walk around to various unknown places (we never get to see a map) − part of a larger plan to steal some gold before anyone else does.The costumes, lighting, cgi and acting were fantastic.The character development of Bilbo consisted of little more than pondering the question of ""should I have stayed at home and relaxed or was it correct to be a waste of space for these dwarfs?""Fans of this film will invariably use the book to justify the unappealing plot developments, but I felt that the film adaptation made its own share of contributions towards this film's status as an example in the gross overuse of deus ex machina.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
a nice movie: EXPECTED,"I don't understand why there is so much negative review among critics. The movie is simply: very good entertainment. Yes, it is lighter and funnier than LOTR but it doesn't mean that it is worse. Characters are nicely done, the actor that plays Bilbo did a such a good job-believable and witty. Others are good as well. Each dwarf has its own trait and you can easily distinguish them. Gandalf is great, even better than in LOTR, by my humble opinion. Special effects are one step further, although I think there is too much of them. The only big problem is action scene with orcs in mines that is very confusing and fast. You feel like your head is spinning because of digital camera movement. Actually this would be my biggest minus. The story is told well and it is almost 100% by the book, which is very nice for die hard book fans. But I am sure that everybody in the theater who did not read the book enjoyed the whole movie.All in all: Very good entertainment for kids and adults as well. Definitely worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
For me the better Hobbit movie but not quite good enough to earn an 8 out of 10.,"Over time my rating for this movie has gone down along with the other Hobbit movies. If you're a JRR Tolkien fan and stay true to the books you may not want to see this movie.The first 30 minutes of this film are simply true to the book and great to watch. But the made-up events in the middle of the film just make me want to turn off the TV due to boredom. But there are great scenes in this movie. Howard Shore does a great job with the score, although there are scenes where they just get lazy and use the LOTR music instead.But overall its a film worth watching and for that reason I give it a 7/1.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Pass the Popcorn review,"The first part of the long-awaited adaptation of Tolkien's The Hobbit came out in December of last year. It obviously made everyone interested and left different impressions. The whole adaptation's a little weird, since there's three movies planned, based on one book that has barely 300 pages, while one part of Lord of the Rings consists of more than 400 pages. So, no need to say that everything's going to be stretched out more than it has to be. The Hobbit also includes information and additions from other books, but that's not enough to create three movies. Imagine if LOTR had three movie adaptations for each book. Funny, right? Money clearly does its work.The story in The Hobbit is a prequel to Lord of the Rings. Bilbo (Martin Freeman), the Hobbit, goes on an adventure with thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and the well known wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), to reclaim the dwarfs' gold and homeland which was destroyed by a dragon called Smaug. This is the most simplified version of the plot. The film starts with old Bilbo (Ian Holm) who starts writing the story based on his adventures that started 60 years ago. It's a really nice beginning and intro to the whole background story that needs to be known in order to understand the plot, so I'll give Jackson an A+ for the beginning.I would also give an A+ to the next scene, which starts with an amazing display of Erebor – the Lonely Mountain and the city of Dale, which lays outside the dwarven kingdom, and which introduces one of the main characters – Thorin Oakenshield. His grandfather, king Thror, rules the Kingdom under the Mountain, which is wealthy and full of gold (who would expect that from dwarfs, eh?). All this gold attracts the dragon, who destroys the kingdom and claims the gold for himself. The film continues with one more scene with old Bilbo, who's remembering how it all started. Gandalf visited him asking if he's interested in going on an adventure, which Bilbo automatically declined. However, his response did not discourage Gandalf from his intentions, so he left a mark on his door which the dwarfs would later notice. The next half an hour is spent introducing us to the dwarfs who are coming to Bilbo's dinner party that Gandalf set up. In this part of the movie, some of the scenes and dwarf portrayals are a little goofy, but appealing. They show two sides of the dwarfs – the 'party' and the 'serious' side. At first, they leave a funny impression with all the eating and drinking, but when Thorin kicks in they're all up for some serious s**t.The book readers will notice one constant phrase that kept getting on my nerves – 'reclaiming the homeland'. The f**k? Of course that their mission involves 'reclaiming the homeland', but if the gold wasn't in their homeland I'm sure as hell they wouldn't care about it, since dwarfs are all about gold. I get that reclaiming homeland sounds more epic than reclaiming gold, but it keeps being presented as their main goal. As they start their journey, they meet Radagast (Sylvester McCoy), one of the five Wizards of Middle-earth (who was not in the book, but at the time The Hobbit novel is set was in the same areas as Bilbo and the dwarfs), who introduces Dol Guldur and the threat that lays in the abandoned fortress – The Necromancer. This is useful for understanding the complete story, even though the novel The Hobbit does not involve too many facts about Dol Guldur. This plot line about Dol Guldur will come later in play, possibly in the third Hobbit movie, when Jackson's planning to give more details about Gandalf's undeveloped disappearance in the novel. From this perspective, this introduction to Dol Guldur worked out great.There's one more thing that considerably differentiates the movie from the book and that's – drum roll – Azog (Manu Bennett). He is not present in the book, but here he plays a major antagonist role. Furthermore, the big problem is that he died in the battle of Azanulbizar (although he wasn't killed by Thorin) and yet, I repeat, he's the main antagonist in the movie, if we exclude Smaug (should I even call Smaug an antagonist?). There was a lot of material in Tolkien's work that could've been used instead of Azog that wouldn't have been so contradictory to the book. On the other hand, I understand that such a movie has got to have an antagonist, especially since Smaug's main part comes in the third movie (I guess).On a positive side, there are a lot of epic scenes in the movie, including Trolls, Rivendell, the Goblin king and Stone giants, and of course the amazing New Zealand landscapes. On a negative side, you can't really get attached to all the characters, since there's too many of them, and they all follow the same storyline so nobody in particular stands out – excluding Bilbo, Thorin, and maybe Balin. In conclusion, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a pretty good movie and I'm really looking forward to the two sequels. I guess Peter Jackson has many reasons for all the things that he included in the movie and that differ from the book, both the minor and major ones and I hope they'll fit in the whole trilogy.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: Best Movie Experience Ever,"The Hobbit exceeds every expectation that I had. Being a fan of both the novels and movies, I did set the bar high for this movie because... well, it's one of the most widely known franchises production history. I watched the movie in the real 3d and HFR(High Frame Rate) and most certainly was not left short. It did take a quick moment to adjust to the new 48 frames per second(standard DLP is 24), basically it's like switching from a 60hZ television to 240hZ. However, from then on, it was an epic adventure for the next 167 minutes and was glad to have chosen a showing that was using HFR.Starts off by introducing back to our baseline characters, Frodo, Bilbo, Gandalph, etc. Some say this part is slow. I find it essential to get the audience back on the same page and draw us back into Middle Earth and The Shire. During this time you're also introduced to some brand new characters(mostly dwarfs) and they then set off on their adventure. Others also have said this movie is more directed towards kids rather than the adult audience. I disagree, there is humor to lighten the mood at the appropriate times, clever dialogue exchanges, and original thematic material. A whole new director means different movie layout, but you still obtain that LOTR experience that was so popular in the original trilogy.CGI was fantastic(troll scene is amazing), major kudos to those in charge of the art design and scenery(amazing in 3d), and the battle scenes were mind blowing. I'm very glad they are breaking this out into a total of 3 movies because I would be disappointed to only have this movie experience once. Although you do get left with a cliff hanger, for me, it just build anticipation for the next few movies.

BEST movie I've seen in a long time,"You know what gets my goat? People who complain that a movie doesn't match the book. First of all, you realize that when reading a book, your IMAGINATION is the theatre screen. NOTHING can match YOUR imagination. Books are written that way for you to enjoy, and no matter how good the director is, a movie will never totally match what you imagined when reading the book. So, if you read the book and expect the movie to be the same and you imagined it, you will always be disappointed. Unless, of coarse, you have virtually no imagination, then a movie may help you.That being said, I believe that Peter Jackson's version of the Hobbit stories is FANTASTIC. This movie goes into great depth and detail that many movies feel they do not need to. This movie is head and shoulders above most other movies. Its like how Disney World is way better than Six Flags parks.I thought the 3D was great. OK, some of the animations on the edges of the screen were choppy, but that may have been by design. After you get adjusted to watching 3D, you get immersed in the movie.I loved the character development, and the detail. The musical score was great. I let myself be pulled into the movie, and enjoyed it very much.Many of the critics putting down this movie probably don't enjoy anything anyway and will complain about everything.Do yourself a favor during the holidays, and take some time to see this movie.

Review For People Who Haven't Watched LOTR: Fantabulous!,"The first installment of J R R Tolkien's The Hobbit novel is extraordinary. I haven't watched the LOTR trilogy but have heard a lot. Nor have I read any of those books. But after watching I am gonna read those including The Silmarillion.It is indeed a very unexpected movie experience with all the colors, essence, hue and magic. I was taken aback by how the plot revolves around the people most valuable and then etches the story onto our minds. Every sequence - one after another will bring you closer to the screen, and if it's 3D then bang! Absolute marvel!The adventure to back home shows many life values, aspects and notions including home-sickness. Martin Freeman is great and I could never guess he was 41. Gandalf is mystery and yet he knows why he had called the lead character of the series which he is not at that time. You feel a peculiar kind of happiness when things gel and you are not confused at the movie.Special effects is fantastic, screenplay is intriguing, direction is magnificent and the cast and their performances are just par excellence. Bravo! is what I shout at the whole crew of this movie. Yet there are some unnerving scenes and the melodrama at the end troubled me a bit.But let me tell you, this is gonna make history am sure because this is fantabulous piece of cinema!WATCH OUT FOR: The conversation between Gollem & Bilbo!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"Good, but not great this time","Sadly, this movie doesn't threaten to topple the greatness of LOTR. It is a good movie, for sure, but like for so many artists looking to follow up on a monumental achievement, it doesn't reach the same heights. It feels like they made the wrong movie for the book by trying to make The Hobbit fit into the LOTR mould. They are very different stories.The Hobbit is a much lighter (and shorter) tale written well before LOTR, and to me seems as if it was written for a slightly younger audience. So in trying to force the story to become an epic like LOTR it has more weight than the story can hold. The movie could have been a jolly good, ""There and Back Again"" adventure like the book is, but they became too bogged down in the details and moved too slowly through it. Some of the lighter more whimsical elements of the story try to come through, but they sit uneasily with the gravitas that has been imported into the rest of the story.It feels very much as if they were still attached to LOTR and reluctant to let it go. In Rivendell, they add Galadriel and Saruman to the story for a long-winded council about an evil rising. I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett - and here, again, she is stunning as Galadriel - but why the need to insert LOTR characters when they don't add to the story? Apparently Legolas is also making a cameo. It really does feel like they had such a good time making the first trilogy that they were looking for an excuse to work with their old friends again. Had they wanted to explore some of the back story and appendices further, then the end of The Hobbit could perhaps have segued into that nicely.My biggest disappointment though would have to be with the visuals. I knew the story might be stretched a bit far, but I expected that this would be another visual masterpiece after all the talk of the fantastic technology used. There are few better in the world at creating beautifully detailed and realistic sets than Peter Jackson and Weta Workshops, yet from the opening scene it looked very much like a movie set - more like watching a film of a play. I did see this in 48 frames per second, which apparently is much clearer than the regular 24 fps, but even on my computer, comparing the trailers, it doesn't look as convincing as LOTR.The Hobbit had big shoes to fill in terms of reputation, yet made the mistake of trying to fill those same shoes, rather than becoming its own story. If you liked LOTR, then you'll enjoy the movie, but just don't expect it to be as flawless as LOTR - it lacks the visual beauty and the fantastic story. It still gets a 7 out of 10 for me, probably due to a little home-country bias.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Adventures is what we need,"'The Hobbit' is impressive. Very impressive. I remember to have read a lot of somewhat negative comments about the Hobbit first. But comparing the Hobbit with the The Fellowship of the Ring is a KO for the later. The 3 hours reveal much more about Hobbits and Dwarfs culture and their attitudes than every other Tolkien based movie. Martin Freeman and mostly every other actor did a great job, though IanMcKellen's performance seemed as he was a little bit tired, whereas Sylvester McCoy as Radagast was just amazing. Nearly every 'new' character is a great addition. The already well-known characters had quite short appearances therefore. Tolkien fans will find a lot of déjà vu moments, newcomers have probably the best introduction into Tolkiens universe, funny moments go hand in hand with stunning action scenes and the ever wonderful ambiance. Only 9/10 as I found some flaws. For example Gandalf. He seems to play his role as savior much too frequently this time. My impression - the plot felt too constructed. And of course, as LOTR is the successor of The Hobbit, a NEW huge political plot cant be expected. After an hour the story really flattens out a bit and the turbulent action-driven tour begins. But this were just small flaws in a overall mind-dazzling fantasy tale with great adventurers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Less a Film and More an Intro,"First and foremost this is a terribly L O N G movie. Epic does not it justice. For it is truly epic and much more than that, and in that it is inherently just a very long movie -- with very little plot. Which perhaps is the greatest irony regarding this mammoth project of Jackson's. The trilogy format worked so well for him in THE LORD OF THE RINGS films that one assumes that he believed he needed to do the same thing with this remake of THE HOBBIT. Problem is, there is very little story here. This, the first of THREE, is over two and a half hours long. And what is it? The first of three films to retell the tale told in a book for children that's a little more than 100 pages. It is Hollywood hubris gone mad with an over abundance of money resources pride and short sightedness. Yet at the same time it is inspiring to see someone take an ""ah screw it"" attitude and take all that pride money and hubris and do what they want with it. In that Jackson has created in this movie and the ones that follow it something rare in American cinema, art for art's sake. And that is a refreshing thing indeed. It is needless to say that this is far and away the ""largest"" grandest spectacle that's ever been attempted in film. It is gargantuan. Just unnecessarily too long. It could have easily been an enjoyable hour and a half and been just fine. But as it is it still remains a remarkable achievement. We need more artists like Jackson, men who are willing to buck the system for their own selfish desires and delusions of importance. These films definitely deserve the low critical Meta Scores they have achieved; but they will last forever and entertain and astound for generations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hard to get passed through...,"I heard from many people that The Hobbit trilogy is fun, yet not so charming. I have never read the book but from what I heard, it's more light-hearted adventurous likely for kids and older people to enjoy. After watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy, is was curious about how The Hobbit will hold up. Will it be it's own movie with new things we never seen or try to live up with The Lord of the Rings with references?Awhile ago, I did go on the movie to watch it and...well, seems unwatchable. Too many characters to remember, have CGI that looks like it came out of the 2000's, characters being too invulnerable, no atmosphere tone (atleast for me), and it's just so...boring. It's so boring, I have to go on my phone to entertain myself. After realizing the movie was still going on, I changed it to another movie.Few days ago, I decided to give it a chance to have a go at it, thinking to myself ""The writing, the visual, and the characters won't entertain me but I hope the action can get a pass for me."" I watched the movie again and the beginning of the prologue was pretty promising. There were some questionable things I have to say about it, but I let it slide. I did enjoyed Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves at the beginning of the scene...then, something felt off where the movie killed my enjoyment. I honestly don't know what it is, but it made me stop watching the movie.I really want to enjoy this film, I really do, but something keeps throwing me off that makes me want to close my eyes. It's really hard to get through the beginning of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A perfect fairytale movie for the whole family,"For me this movie is a perfect fairytale movie that I wish I could have watched back when I was a kid. I am a grown man now but watching this movie took me back to my childhood. To really appreciate this movie though you have to be 3 things: 1) A fan of fantasy world in general, or particularly a fan of the world of Middlearth. 2) Someone who will not take a movie too seriously while watching it since this movie is not meant to be a ""serious movie"". This movie is meant to be a fun lighthearted fantasy movie, a fairytale kids would enjoy. 3) Someone who knows how to enjoy a movie experience. This means leave your cynicism at your doorstep please and head out into an adventure.If you are unable to do any of the 3 things I mentioned you will not like the movie. If you don't like fantasy in general and are expecting a gritty realistic story you will not like the movie. Go watch the godfather instead. If you are looking for a gritty, (overly) dark fantasy story, you will not find it here. Go watch game of thrones instead. Basically, what I am saying is, if you find the idea of a rabbit power sled that carries a goofy wizard through the forest unacceptable, then this movie is not meant for you. Too bad. A fantasy setting makes this idea not only acceptable, in such a fantasy universe, these things happen every day. Two stone giants are boxing for no apparent reason. Move along and try not to get hit by a rock. Where do you think you are, this is fantasy and it is well withing the realm of possibility. Not to mention, I find all these things cool. Watch this movie with your kids, they will love it. And one last thing, the action in this movie is meant to be fun and over the top. The good guys will run in all sorts of trouble, but will come out unharmed. The fighting and chasing scenes are creative, visually stunning and fun. Also don't be one of those parents who think the violence is too much, the violence in this movie is just right and children will find it adventurous more than anything. The villains though, some monsters might scare the kids but that is what they are there for. The design of the creatures was superb. I salute Peter Jackson for making the most fun movie that came out in the last 10 years. I like it better than Lord of the rings movies, because the LOTR trilogy had a grand and an epic story from the books to follow and there was no way to make it really bad. That is why I underestimated Peter Jackson's talent and ability. I thought ""oh well, he followed the epic story, character and location designs were already there, big deal. It was good but how could it not be?"" But Hobbit (the book) had much less grandiose story and character development than LOTR (books), but the movie exceeded my expectations. My final verdict, I like Lord of the rings books better than Hobbit the book, but I like Hobbit the movie better than Lord of the rings movies. Hobbit, the best fantasy movie to come out in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
So much love,"I was a little worried about going to see this movie after some of the early reviews going on about pacing issues and the length being unnecessary and so on.Happy to say that my fears were unfounded. I loved every minute of the film and would gladly follow Peter Jackson on any journey he wishes to begin on film.Rich a beautiful as one would expect, I enjoyed the way the story was presented using not just the book, but the extended appendices written by Tolkien as well. The story feels fuller and for a nerd like me it is pure heaven.I have no issues with the small book being made in to three movies. It gives ample time to let fans soak in all the wonder and excitement.There were some CGI issues I wasn't in love with, but they are minor. I saw the 2D version and had no problem. I hear the HFR version is pretty awesome, perhaps next time.Ignore the critics. make up your own mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolutely Enthralling,"Too tired to make a thorough review right now as I just watched the premiere. But I will say this movie was excellent. The fantasy and story of it drew me deep within the realm of the Lord of the Rings, which I hadn't visited in years.I will say this. People have to realize that The Hobbit is very different from the Lord of the Rings. The Lord of the Rings was meant to be a mythology, the Hobbit is more of a light-hearted fantasy story. As such, it has many more formalist aspects. The characters, events, and action are all much more exaggerated than the Lord of the Rings.My only criticism is the same criticism I had of the original movies, Gollum. I love Andy Serkis, but I have always felt the movie Gollum greatly falls short of the power of his character. There are 2 reasons for this. For one, they tried to make him a comic relief. Gollum is not supposed to be funny, he's supposed to be scary. And two: there's no contrast in his craziness. Gollum is supposed to be scary because of the way he reacts to the ring. It is his obsession, and when you take away his obsession he becomes irate. However, for the movie's Gollum, he's always at 100%, so when his ring becomes threatened, he just seems his normal crazy self. He would seem more crazy if he were slightly more dialed down most of the time, and then psychotic when he realizes the ring is taken.Any way, that's something I've wanted to say for a while. Overall it was an amazing movie, and Gollum didn't diminish this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Back to Middle Earth,"I was very young when I first saw ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and it was without questioning one of the greatest sagas of movie franchising. When I heard that Peter was making another trilogy based on Tolkien's book ""The Hobbit"", I thought for myself if he could reach the expectations for the general public, and my answer, after watching the movie, is yes. Despite all inconsistencies with the book which are perfectly normal for this kind of movies I thought that the storyline was great, the characters are very well interpreted and has a lot more action that I was expecting. So, point being: - Just like ""Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring"" this first movie gives us a small taste of whats coming next year with ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and 2014 with ""There and Back Again""; - The storyline is yet opened for some characters to appear in the next movies; - Rivendell is just as great and beautiful as I remember; - Bilbo and Thorin's interpretations are flawless and it really gets us into the story; - The 48FPS ratting didn't make much of a difference for me, but the 3D is also very interactive and detailed; - My favorite scene is of course the Bilbo-Gollum encounter; So, final view: This movie is awesome and none of you should miss it, I advise you to enjoy the 3D version as much as you can and if you don't like this 1st movie, don't worry because just like LotR, Return of the King, the last movie is (always) the one that really can make a difference.

A solid start to the Hobbit trilogy,"A decade ago Peter Jackson awed both critics and audiences with his film adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. With its talented cast, stellar production values, epic scale, and faithfulness to its source, Jackson's trilogy was one of the cinematic high points of the first years of the new millennium. Now, after much anticipation, he has returned to tell the story of how it all began, and he's gotten off to a very good start.The Hobbit works, above all, because it has everything that made the earlier trilogy work. Firstly there's the rich cast of characters and the actors who play them. Ian McClellan remains as sagely, imposing, and playful as ever as Gandalf, and Andy Sirkis has lost none of his effect as Gollum. He's every bit as unsettling and pitiable as when we first met him, and his arguments with himself are every bit as fascinating and entertaining to watch. Martin Freeman likewise is perfectly cast as Bilbo, capturing all of his pluck, courage, and utter bewilderment at the situation he's gotten himself into.And of course there are the dwarfs. The young, headstrong, and somewhat foolish Fili and Kili fill much the same role here as Pippin and Merry did in the earlier films, and to equal effect. There's also the fiery tempered Gloin, the folksy, cheerful, and rather oblivious Dwalin, the cantankerous old Balin, looking like a miniature Santa, the comically rotund Bombur, and all the rest of the gang. They're as merry and rowdy a bunch of fellows as you'll ever meet, and their antics will often have you keeling over in laughter.But as jolly and at times buffoonish as they may be, they are also powerful and deadly warriors, and none more so than their leader Prince Thorin (Richard Armitage). Strong willed and keen witted, with a seriousness and solemness that sets him apart from his companions, Thorin has an unmistakable aura of greatness. From the first glance it is visible to all that he possesses incredible fortitude and determination, and that he was born to lead. He is the kind of man (or Dwarf) who inspires those around him to great deeds, and surpasses them with his own.Even characters who had only a brief appearance in the book are greatly fleshed out here, both in the narrative and physical sense. I only faintly remember Azog the orc lord, but here he makes a most imposing and menacing villain, his bone white skin and bulging muscles reminding me of the sinister aliens from Prometheus. On the other end of the spectrum is the corpulent goblin king, who manages to be more revolting than Jabba the Hut. By far the most delightful addition was nature loving wizard Radagast the Brown. Though he was only given brief mention in the novel, Jackson has made him into one of the most oddball and effective comic relief characters in recent years. I leave it to you to discover his marvelous mode of transportation.As important as the characters is the story they inhabit, and this obviously draws from a very good one. Anyone who's read the book or has children who have will no doubt be familiar with the tale of how Bilbo is plucked from his peaceful existence in the Shire to join thirteen dwarfs on their quest to recover their lost kingdom from the fearsome dragon Smaug. And for those of you who aren't, I just told you the story, so there.Jackson hasn't been as faithful to the story this time as he was the last, but special attention given to the most beloved parts. The 'riddles in the dark' scene is exactly the way I imagined it when I first read it years ago, and identical word for word to its source. Even better in my opinion is the hilarious encounter with the three trolls. This one scene better captured the spirit of the old Three Stooges than the Farely Brothers' entire movie.And there is a great deal of action and sustained battle scenes, all of them very good. I especially enjoyed the running fight through the goblin caverns, fought up and down across and rickety walkways and across collapsing bridges at breakneck speed as hordes of goblins appear from every crevice. Another high point was the flash point to the battle outside Moria, in which hundreds of orcs and dwarfs charge and hack at each other across the rocky slopes. And for sheer visual impact, nothing equals the stone giants. Seeing the very mountains come to life and do battle with one another as the heroes desperately hang on for dear life, it was a hundred times more awesome than I had imagined it.The nearly three hour runtime has given Jackson time to include practically every scene from the book, many in greater detail than Tolkien wrote them. This is an asset in that no fan will be disappointed because their favorite part was left out. But at the same time this is also The Hobbit's biggest flaw. The fact is that maybe not all the scenes from the book needed to be in the movie, at least not at the length that they are here. At several points I had the feeling that was a three hour movie with only two and a half worth of material. I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't try to cover the entire book in one film, but I do wonder if two movies might have been a better idea than the planned three.Still, The Hobbit was a very good film overall, with good acting, better effects, much for children and adults alike to enjoy. It may not quite measure up to the Lord of the Rings films, but it was both charming and highly entertaining, and I have high hopes for the next two installments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A long-expected success!,"After a fall of underwhelming cinematic fare, I had long-anticipated a film that would condone going to the theaters. Fortunately, one existed. In the crisp mid-December chill, we were invited to return to Middle Earth after a 9-year break. Yes, I thought to myself, this film will be truly epic. A newcomer to the Lord of the Rings franchise, I had spent the last year procuring copies of and rabidly watching the original trilogy. None of these titles disappointed, whether it was the character-driven Fellowship of the Ring or the darker war-film The Two Towers or the emotional and triumphant Return of the King each film proved to be epic. So after watching the trailer for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey thirty somewhat times, I was ready for another classic film.Unsurprisingly, Peter Jackson delivered this time abet a few flaws in the film's pacing. I was treated to a rich, touching adventure in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien with some memorable characters and intense action pieces. The reason why I say some memorable characters is due to the immense supporting cast. We had Gandalf the Grey: wise and wisecracking, Bilbo Baggins: Reluctant but eventually develops beautifully, Thorin Oakenshield: The stoic and solemn leader of the party and 12 other dwarfs who never got enough screen-time. We'll probably see a lot more of them in future movies, but I never bothered to learn all of their names, they were just uncharacteristic faces that made up their company, and some of them could fight well I hate to be a nitpicker but that was my major quim with the film.Other than the underwhelming Dwarfs, I found the movie quite enjoyable and found that the Production Design really was given the chance to shine here. We had some fantastic costumes, ranging from the elegant and proud Elrond to the paranoid and silly Radagast. Taking a page from the previous trilogy, the costume designers really just had to get back into their old mindset and think like they did ten years ago. The hobbits still wear periodic corduroy suits with bare over-large hairy feet and the dwarfs still have extravagant beards. But it doesn't stop there, the film is shot, once again, on location in New Zealand, hobbit-holes and all. This really added to the feel of the film, bringing Middle Earth to life with magnificent locations and a truly epic feel. When the crew wasn't fighting mountain trolls or evading a swarm of angry goblins they were trekking up the Misty Mountains to a truly magnificent score written by Howard Shore.As far as the acting was concerned, this movie truly delivered. Martin Freeman was the perfect Bilbo Baggins, he came off exactly as I pictured him when I read the book in the 5th grade. The audience really fell in love with him in the beginning of the film when he had the conversation with Gandalf about the ""Good Morning."" It was then that I decided that he really was perfect for the role. Which brings me to another actor, Ian Mckellen was once again a show-stealer as Gandalf. The scenes where he isn't shown are never quite as good as he is more or less one of the icons of the entire franchise as a whole.By far the greatest scene in the film was the infamous ""Riddles in the Dark"" where Bilbo falls down into a cave and encounters the creature Gollum, who is obsessed with the Ring of Power, but still really playful. There, Bilbo has a game of riddles with Gollum, putting his life on the line in exchange for the way to escape the Goblin Cavern. When Bilbo finds the ring and the theme from the past movies is played, I got chills. And Andy Shirkis as Gollum is and has always been a delight. Gollum is a really interesting character, he has two personalities to him, the Murderous and conniving Gollum and Sméagol the friendly character who wants to play games and help hobbitses. This scene really embodies the film as a whole: playful, but dangerous and it shows that Peter Jackson is still very capable of directing this fantastic series.As a whole, this movie did not disappoint, sure it was different than the other movies, but it's supposed to be The Hobbit was written for little kids! It still has Peter Jackson's DNA coursing through its legendary veins.4 ½ stars (out of 5)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Satisfying beginning to another Peter Jackson trilogy.,"There is already over 200 reviews, so I'm sure everything has been said by now, but I am still going to review it.My experience before the show was a pain. The path to the theater was blocked so I had to walk and since the room the movie was in was being cleaned the staff made us wait outside in the cold. It was more than worth it. Like all the LOTR movies they're visually impressive and proves that Peter Jackson is the king of blockbusters. It also had some humorous dialogue and when the movie ends it leaves you wanting more. If you're a Elijah Wood fan or the majority of the cast members from the other movies, you're gonna be disappointed because some of them don't appear. The one who appears the most out of all of them is Gandalf. The movie is also a bit less darker than the LOTR trilogy, but I still wouldn't recommend taking young kids to it because it will frighten them. Somehow it doesn't reach the same level of greatness as the LOTR movies did, but it is a great start to the trilogy and hopefully the other two will be better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic movie in every way!,"This is the first review I write and it's for this movie. That means something...I've read some other reviews first and I just can't understand why some of them are completely against this movie. Some say that everything is bad and boring. I just can't believe that they actually know what they're talking about.I write this review because everything was just so perfect. This movie held the pressure of the Lord of The Rings Trilogy and yet it rocked! The tone of the hobbit is indeed lighter than LOTR, which is obvious because the hobbit is originally a children's book. Peter Jackson also added some very good jokes here and there. Sometimes when you don't expect it, it happens. I liked that humor very much. It fits with the movie very well.Many people had doubts when the hobbit became a trilogy. They thought it would be too stretched. Well, I can honestly say that this isn't the case. The pacing of the movie was very good and the time flew by. I never got bored at all. Jackson also added the side story of Gandalf which Tolkien released at the back of the return of the king. He also changed little things that were necessary for the film. I won't spoil it, so you'll just have to watch it for yourself. This is the reason why The Hobbit became a trilogy. It was a good decision. It gives more depth to the whole story, and it links to LOTR.The visual aspect of the movie is just off the chain. The HFR is superb together with the 3D. The movie is very clear and it really feels like you're in middle-earth. I didn't get dizzy at all and it didn't look like an ordinary TV program as some critics said. You should definitely watch it in HFR 3D.Last but not least. Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage were born for those roles. Martin plays Bilbo perfect. Out of 7billion people they chose the right guy. He's funny, emotional and heroic when he has to be. The same counts for Thorin. Richard played this character so well that I think many people will choose Thorin as their favorite character of Tolkiens world. Outstanding performances. The rest of the cast is also very good but these 2 were the standouts.Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, Fran Walsh, the cast and crew that brought this movie, THANK YOU8Can't wait for part 2: The Desolation of Smaug.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"It has some problems, but I enjoyed it","I've been looking forward to this film ever since the word first got out. I am a huge J.R.R. Tolkien fan and I've read the book multiple times. One thing that particularly attracted me to the adaptation is that, at first announcement, Guillermo del Toro was chosen as the director. He is one of my favorite directors and I felt that he will bring a new approach that we haven't seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Then he was replaced by Peter Jackson. I had nothing against this decision, considering that he was the man behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy from almost ten years before.To start off with, I was somewhat suspicious about the fact that there will be two (later three) films based on a book that is 300 pages long so I assumed that many scenes will be added from other Tolkien works related to the plot. They were also attempting to make the film accessible to those who haven't read the book and possibly even those who haven't seen The Lord of the Rings.It is important to point out that this movie, which has a running time of 169 minutes in its theatrical release, covers about 120 pages of the book so it is clear that some scenes will drag on while others were added from The Return of the King appendices and Unfinished Tales.As a matter of fact, for the first 90 minutes there is not much action involved. There are some flashbacks that involve a bit of action, but other than that the movie up to that point is mainly dialog and scenes that are only meant to introduce the characters and scenery to people who haven't read the book.The acting in this movie is excellent. It is wonderful to see Ian McKellen return to play Gandalf and Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins was spot on. However, my favorite character is Thorin, played amazingly by Richard Armitage. I can say that he is the Aragorn of this trilogy and, frankly, the main character of this story. One thing that bothered me is the company of dwarfs. There are thirteen of them but apart from a few, we don't anything about the others except their names.The musical score by Howard Shore is wonderful as people have expected, considering the fact that he was the man behind The Lord of the Rings trilogy music, which are clearly some of the best film scores of all time. To my mind, An Unexpected Journey is not as great as, say, The Fellowship of the Ring, but it does contain some memorable themes and it makes it a good and pleasant listen.Overall, this film is somewhat mediocre compared to any of the Lord of the Rings films and some fans might be disappointed. Myself, the only problem I have with it is that it is too long for the 120 pages it covers. Other than that, it has very good acting, very good visual effects and an excellent musical score. My opinion is based on the fact that I've read the book multiple times before watching the film so I had some expectations. However, as a standalone film, it will be entertaining to those who haven't read the book or have no idea about Tolkien's works. Considering all of these, I will give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My Favorite Of The Middle Earth Tales,"Hello my friends! It's Robbie K back with another review after coming off of a two week dry spell, and what a movie to return to. As many know, this weekend belongs Peter Jackson's newest installment The Hobbit, another tribute to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings world. Now The Hobbit might be one of my favorite fantasy books, so I was very excited to see Jackson taking on the challenge of bringing the Middle Earth to life once more. Yet with his plans to make three movies based on this book, I was worried that Mr. Jackson may have added some extra footage that took away from the movie. So let's get to work as I review The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.With a good book, comes great characters and with great characters come big expectations, and in my opinion, this movie meets those expectations. While the Hobbit has many characters, I have limited space to complement on a few actors that brought the traveling company to life. My first actor to talk about is Martin Freeman, who played the protagonist Bilbo Baggins. Freeman has already had experience portraying legendary characters like Sherlock Holmes' Dr. Watson, and has impressed me with his work in the past. I'm happy to say that Freeman has done his job again, using his natural awkwardness to bring Bilbo's shy and cowardly nature to life on the screen. I felt that Freeman's facial expressions were perhaps the strongest tool in his arsenal, using it to represent the internal emotional struggles Frodo faces in the book, while solidly delivering his lives. The legendary Ian McKellen returns to play Gandalf, using his enchanting voice to bring the wit and wisdom of the wizard out to entertain the masses. Of all the characters, he was the most diverse, as McKellen manages to deliver well timed lines with just enough emphasis to make it funny. Even McKellen's look portrays wizard, as he goes from joking, lovable hermit, to wise and fearless warrior. To finish up the actors section I'll talk about Richard Armitage playing the lead dwarf Thorin. Bringing a hero of the dwarf world to life was no easy feat I'm sure, but the casting crew did a great job picking him for the part. Not only does Armitage have the look of headstrong, proud warrior, but he also has the voice that I pictured the character having. Armitage managed to capture pride, emotional recklessness, and determined nature of dwarf leader, which kept me hooked into the story Jackson was portraying.However, acting isn't the only strength of this movie. Like many fans, I wondered how Jackson could extend this story into three parts. I feared that like some of his other movies, Jackson was going to put in extra detail that was a dragged out boring mess that was merely used to extend the movie into some obscenely long time. With the Hobbit though, I think he managed to get the balance right, as the extra scenes I saw made the story even more interesting. Though I do not remember everything about the book, the film contained some plot elements that were new to me. Jackson managed to integrate these scenes well, making them key parts of the story that set up more adventure for the later installments. Some of these scenes though are a little tough to understand at this point though, as some of these extra scenes are left unexplained leaving them a little out of place in this movie. Despite these extra scenes though, Jackson did a decent job capturing the immense detail this book contains and in a decent amount of time. Although there is almost a three hour price tag with this film, it didn't feel like I was in the movie for that long. Unlike its predecessors, The Hobbit's pace stays decent moving from one challenge to another quickly, yet making sure to address the backgrounds and plot elements that are necessary. Yet like the book, the beginning is a little slow, with Jackson taking a little too much time on the Baggins home, especially the unneeded Frodo cameo. Yet my friends and I agree, once the quest has started, there are very few lack of a better phrase ""long feeling"" scenes that will bore you out of your mind. I'll go ahead and answer the question of how is the Action? Like the earlier installments, Jackson's crew has gone above and beyond bringing the battle to life. Whether it is flashbacks or troll bashing, this movie had a decent amount of sword swinging, axe smashing, and arrow shooting chaos to open up a new trilogy. Fans will be pleased with the teamwork of the dwarfs, and may appreciate the focus on individual combat styles of the party instead of the clashing army swarm fights many movies like to use.What else is there to say about the Hobbit? One thing is the camera work, which captures the beautiful wilderness frontier, though a few scenes may cause some motion sickness. The digital art and creation of the various Middle Earth kingdoms was also impressive, as the computer generated lands were stunning. The intricate details of the dwarven halls, the polished finesse of the elven castles, and the rugged waste land of the frontier were all designed to capture the emotion of the scene. Though what are visuals without music? Fear not my friends as the Hobbit has another award winning soundtrack that will take your breath away.Overall this was my favorite movie of the four Middle Earth films. With great balance, a fantastic pace, beautiful visuals, and some entertaining characters I have no doubt the other two movies will be great. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie in theaters, preferably 2D, and enjoy the world Peter Jackson has created once more.

An Unexpected Failure,"I was very excited to see this after considering The Lord of the Rings a resounding success, one of my favorite series of movies of all time!But when I found out it was going to be a trilogy of movies, I thought ""Why are they making 3 movies out of a very short introductory book to the Trilogy?""Why, indeed?Basically they RUINED it by making it 3 movies. 
The first one is boring, the 2nd one is more boring and the 3rd one I didn't even care to see.They took a successful idea (being faithful to Tolkien's books!) and turned it on its head and decided to invent all kinds of scenes that never existed, and make a really great short book into a way-overlong trilogy of movies!DUMB IDEA!If you are a kid who just likes Hobbit stuff you *might* like this. If you're an adult who loves Tolkien's books, you are almost surely going to dislike it.My advice: Skip this one and go back and re-watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy again! Or better yet, spend your time reading the books, starting with The Hobbit!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey movie review,"Why did I vote this new movie, an amazing start for a trilogy 10 out of 10. Well I fell in love with Tolkiens work (Not that I am a fan boy of the previous trilogy) and I respect Jacksons adaptation of The Lord of the rings movie and this one as well it is fair to the book and there is no any other film director that would have bring Middle-Earth on screen other than Peter Jackson himself.This movie is almost perfect every way, the great technical achievement in this movie is amazing, the very much admirable acting by the great actors/actresses thats starring in this film, and of course the main crew that helped in creating this astonishing movie. I don't think there is one scene that's useless, I mean for people who have not read the book it's a great way to know the characters, and certain important plots.Even though for its perpetual run time (something that critics should not whine about) it's definitely the movie we all have been waiting for, the movie that will inspire some people, the movie we all should watch in these holiday seasons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Doesn't hold a candle to the LOTR trilogy, but decent overall.","First time I saw this I wasn't the biggest fan, mostly because of my bias towards the LOTR trilogy. Looking at it again, it still has its issues but it's by no means a bad film, it's a definite worthy beginning to this epic trilogy.The lovable, care free Bilbo Baggins, (Martin Freeman) is enlisted by Gandalf and a group of Dwarfs to go on an unexpected journey to Lonely Mountain to reclaim it from the evil dragon, Smaug.It has similar charm to the Fellowship of the Ring. Martin Freeman is an improvement over Ian Holm as Bilbo, bringing an all new sense that we haven't seen yet. The dwarfs are all fun and charming, but their introduction rather dwells on comedic relief, though as soon as they hum the Lonely Mountain song, it drowns you in its atmosphere. As the journey progresses, you learn more and more about each dwarf and their background, and you're lead by Bilbo the whole time, making you feel for him when he feels left out by the group for being not as brave or not cut out. The effects of the film are not as impressive as the ones in the LOTR, not that the CGI is much better, just that it's used more carefully.The film does drag on a tad. A lot of scenes painfully go on and on to try and add to the epic tone of the film, but trying to make the innocent little kids book into a major epic doesn't always work. A lot of memorable scenes in this, most notably the Gollum scene, but is covered by dragged scene after dragged scene.Overall it's the weakest film of either trilogy, but it still gets by with likable and familiar characters, and some decent action scenes. I would watch it to get through and watch the others, but it has some charm to it that makes it stand out overall.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Unexpected Journey or An 'Adventure' of Procrastination and Reminiscence?,"Often we are compelled to do something we wouldn't usually do due to a rush of emotion and indeed, writing my first film review is accompanied by sorrow, anger and disappointment. Sorrow, because I am sorry that I wasted 3 hours of my life; anger, as I feel one of my favourite books has been desecrated; and disappointment, that now this film exists no- one will be given the further opportunity to actually do this book justice.It might be expected that this review would harp on that there is an unnecessary amount of padding, which is true, but not what I particularly want to comment on; in other reviews it has seemed to overshadow, what I believe, are other major issues this film has.Martin Freeman's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins left me feeling very bitter. After watching and very much enjoying BBC's fantastic series 'Sherlock' with Martin Freeman playing 'Dr. John Watson', I was very much shocked that he has done nothing short of copy and pasting this character into 'The Hobbit'. We are presented with a scatty, cliché spouting 'hero' with all the charisma of a schoolchild acting up for attention. In Sherlock he is able to bounce effectively off of the stolid Benedict Cumberbatch but in 'The Hobbit' he is a source of mild 'kookiness' that festoons the plot-line like a wacky tie on a businessman. It becomes very difficult to take the story very seriously.In the dwarven camp we also have the other extreme. Much like the famous seven dwarfs there is Grumpy (Thorin) whose levels of grumpiness have reached titanic proportions, unfortunately to the extent that he just comes across as being a rude, nihilistic homunculus. I don't even believe that he wants to succeed in his quest because then he might not have anything to whine about. There are also the other dwarfs... actually this is harder than I thought because the remaining 12 dwarfs are just uncharacterised all-purpose plot drivers. I suppose I also remember Fatty (Bombur) who is amusing in the same way that a cat confusing its reflection in a mirror for another cat is amusing; you will laugh but you would not exactly pay money to see it.My mother always told me ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"", so I will compliment Andy Serkis and certainly the team behind the rendering of Gollum for what was the only scene that I enjoyed. The exposition of Gollum treads very carefully and I believe successfully along the line between quirky and menacing that I think even excelled the character's appearance in 'The Lord of the Rings'. I feel that I was challenged whether to feel sorry for or be frightened of Gollum and though his time on screen was disgracefully ephemeral, I felt that I was drawn in.It was very difficult to be drawn in by the rest of it. Bilbo, despite claiming to be a poor sword-smith, becomes remarkably fortunate in his blows against presumably trained fighters. Most of the cast get battered against rocks and fall down vast crevices with no injury. None of the scenarios the dwarfs find themselves in seem the slightest bit daunting as they appear to be completely invulnerable and there is no sense of fear or peril. The actors barely deign to care about being captured or being attacked. It feels as if Peter Jackson is not even trying to convince you that the antagonists might win. Tension is created by promising the audience that the heroes are in serious danger, characters that you sympathise with will meet an unjust end at the hands of evil. If their absurd fortune suggests they are blessed by the Hand of God I am given no reason to feel any emotion beyond abject apathy.The problem that the film is left with is that there is no sense of an epic journey. The frequency of flashbacks and asides just renders the main storyline incoherent and seemingly secondary to the back story and appearances of characters from 'The Silmarillion'; I'm not sure which story they are really trying to tell. The film is entitled 'The Hobbit' yet it tries so desperately to avoid the actual plot as much as possible that it ends up looking like a montage of deleted scenes from 'Lord of the Rings' interspersed with tenuous dialogue.I enjoy films that throw different plot strands together but I like them to make some sense at the end of the film. It's like a puzzle where finally the picture reveals itself as all the pieces have been slotted together. I already knew the plot of 'The Hobbit' and I felt that I had my puzzle set up, ready to be admired, before Peter Jackson cast his hand carelessly across it and knocked all the pieces into a mess on the floor.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
So much better than the book,"Let me start by saying that I have read the books a long time ago (both the LotR series and the Hobbit), as well as a wide array from the fantasy genre. I do personally believe that authors like Terry Goodkind, R.A. Salvatore or Sapkowski wrote superior novels to those of Tolkien. However, Peter Jackson always had a way of making something good into something of legend.And he outdid himself this time. I expected that the 2:49 hour long runtime would be a bit too long. Well, by the end of the film (this is a film, not a movie, nuff said), I was thinking ""what, it's already over?"". Beautiful landscapes, breathtaking cinematography (pretty sure it will receive a nomination for the Academy Awards this year), insanely well choreographed fight and action scenes, and a lot more than I can give praise too.There is also a tendency toward humor, more so than in the LotR. I found it enjoyable, however, it might not be for everyone. Also, I have heard controversy about the 48 frame high-def version being unpleasant and a failure. I cannot comment on this, as I have seen the 24 frame version, in standard 3D, and couldn't find anything bothering about the way it was filmed. However, the polish of the CGI could have been better. It's not bad at all, but it did feel ""meh"" at times. Still, I personally think that CGI is hardly important when setting up atmosphere and telling a story, and there cannot be any complaints there. The costumes were great, and the soundtrack is far, FAR better than in the previous LotR titles (even though Howard Shore obviously reused some of the themes, altering and improving upon them).As for the acting, it was top notch. I had no doubts that Ian McKellen would deliver, but I was pleasantly surprised by Martin Freeman. He does a vastly superior job compared to Elijah Wood. Richard Armitage and Ken Scott also deliver solid performances. I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of them in the future following these roles.Overall, my expectations were high, and I was not let down. I knew I would love The Hobbit, but I never expected it to be this good. Sure, we can nitpick some of its elements if we really wanted to, but overall, it is one of the best films Hollywood gave us in quite a few years, and you should not think twice about going to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow!!!,"When I heard they were going to make 3 movies with this little book: ""The Hobbit"", which I read awhile back, I immediately thought corporate greed, that they should be ashamed and it was going to ruin the franchise. Furthermore, I was also concerned about hearing that Peter Jackson was going to take liberties with his version of this great Tolkien classic .But after watching ""The Hobbit"", I would like to apologies for my assumptions that I made. Indeed, Mr. Jackson's attention to detail justifiably needs 3 movies...and he made a great classic even more epic, but yet, still remained true to Tolkien's vision.Was this movie really almost 3 hours long? Seriously, I lost track of time, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, I was that mesmerized. Visually, scene after scene, one word sums it up: beautiful. The acting: superb. The sounds/music: powerful, full of emotion.This movie is so good that I am going to do something I never do, pay to watch it again at the theaters.This movie is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I loved the movie.,"I have seen the movie today. It was great and the 3d effects where super in the new High Frame Rate(48fps in stead of 24fps). Only a few parts had to much CGI in a very fast scene and because of that it became a little bit blurry. This didn't bother me to much.I really hope the next parts will at least be as good as this one. I loved it and I can't wait for it to be available on Blu-ray. Only Bum didn't like it but that's because he's more of a Trekkie. For everyone who loved ""The Lord of the Rings trilogy"" this is a very nice prequel. Can't wait for December 2013 when part 2 ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" will be shown in theaters.

Don't Listen to the Critics!!,"Hi, this is my first review but i must speak out from the appalling reviews i have heard from many sources, and put them to rest.first of, i am a avid Tolkien fan, and i have watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey on 2nd day of its release, and i have to tell you all......it was absolutely amazing! so much fun watching, so easy to get in to as well but i must point out that i watched it in 2D and in 24fps.from what i have heard from such critics as the ones interviewed on the BBC show ""The Review Show"", those critics have no idea what they are saying regarding the duration of the Hobbit, because it isn't slow moving and the characters don't look like children's cartoon!Now, onto the actual review:1: the duration of 169 minutes is not slow at all and is not at all boring!2: the acting is pretty astonishing, especially from Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Sir Ian Mckellen and the rest of the cast, if any of the cast from the film are reading this..good show :)3: the story blends in to the novel quite well, apart from a few situations but they aren't significant really.4: the humour is very funny at times, and isn't cheesy as i would have thought it would5: the action was awesome! a few over the top scenes with the Dwarfs in the goblin town but they were still awesome :)now, i have read a few things on IMDb posts regarding some shots not in the film, the Gandalf shots are in the trailer are from the second film i think because that trailer was released when there were only two films being released.. ""POTENTIAL SPOILER"" the shots of Gandalf fighting in Dol Guldur are in the second film because Gandalf was never near Dol Guldur in the first film :)and one last thing... the whole controversial thing about 48fps is risky, but it could be worth it.. after all it isn't about what the film looks like, its about what the film's like :)Well done on Sir Peter Jackson, and all of the people involved in this film, and cant wait for the Desolation of Smaug!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Great movie! Ignore the negative reviews!,"I have seen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey and it is a great movie! The Hobbit is not as good as The Lord of the Rings movies, but that doesn't mean The Hobbit is a bad movie in any way. The movie has astounding music, beautiful locations, incredible make-up, amazing weapons, huge sets and brilliants actors. The movie was not 'boring' but was filled with action, story and humor.The movie felt a little more 'fake' than The Lord of the Rings though. I tried to figure out what it was. Was it to much CGI? Did the CGI not look real enough? This first Hobbit movie is full of Trolls, Big Animals, Wargs, Giants, Goblins and Eagles. There is no way to avoid using a lot of CGI. But the CGI DID look good. Then what was it? What made the CGI feel more fake was all the talking creatures. The movie felt more like the book in having some more childish parts to it, such as singing goblins and talking trolls. That being said some negative reviewers exaggerated when talking about this. They said that ALL of the goblins where ENTIRELY CGI which is not true at all. Most of them where actors in suits with CGI faces, and some did not even use CGI at all! Most of the orcs we see in the movie where also actors in full make-up.I was glad and a bit shocked that Peter Jackson decided to have so many things in the movie that where just like the book. So the singing dwarfs and talking creatures that where in the book, there in the movie. And I am also glad Peter Jackson didn't go to far in keeping everything exactly just like the book. Having a troll's purse talk just wouldn't work in the movie. So overall I am glad at the balance Peter Jackson made with changes from the book into making The Hobbit a great movie. Ignore the negative reviews! People are being negative because they didn't like the new 48 FPS or they where expecting the movie to be as good as The Lord of the Rings. I gave The Lord of the Rings 10/10. I'm giving The Hobbit 9.5/10. (Since you can't give half a star here on IMDb I'm rounding up.) Good job Peter Jackson, I can't wait for the next movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great and worthy return to Middle-Earth.,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is very impressive in terms of storytelling, action, VFX, cinematography and many more. It's a great film.The first time I watched The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (about 6 years ago), I decided it was the best movie I had ever seen. It was a pure masterpiece and it was a film you can watch over and over again without getting bored or sick of it. The Hobbit was not as good as the original LOTR but it sure is a damn good film.The Hobbit takes place before the events of LOTR and tells the story of Frodo's guardian, Bilbo Baggins. He meets Gandalf, the ultimate badass wizard, who asks him to go on an adventure with a group of hilarious but brave dwarfs to take back the dwarfs' homeland. Bilbo is introduced very effectively and you feel straight back in Middle Earth. It really is great.The acting in The Hobbit is fantastic and the highlight of the film is definitely the dwarfs. Absolutely hilarious.One thing that let me down about The Hobbit was that it felt rushed. For me, it seemed that Peter Jackson had little time because most of the orcs were CG. It let me down because there wasn't a lot of weapons made by Weta Workshop and Peter disappointed me. That was why I rated it an 8.Everything else in the film was spot on. The set decoration was brilliant and the company did a great job at making this a magical world of brilliance. The cinematography was impressive, smooth and satisfying. Music was again a great score composed by mastermind Howard Shore, who also did the music for LOTR. The script was very well adapted by Peter and co.So yeah. A great and worthy return to Middle-Earth that completely satisfies you.Brilliant film. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Vidiot Reviews,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected JourneyThe best thing about returning to Middle-earth is that you can call little people dwarfs and not get sued for it.But you will be required to join a harrowing campaign similar to the one in this Fantasy/Adventure.Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) tricks the lissome hobbit Bilbo (Martin Freeman) into helping nomadic dwarfs - led by their displaced ruler (Richard Armitage) - reclaim the Lonely Mountain from an avarice dragon.Before they can get to the scaly usurper, they must first contend with trolls, giants, elves, goblins, Orcs, a Necromancer, Gollum (Andy Serkis) and the White Council (Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett).An ocular feast featuring new and familiar faces, this pulse-pounding Lord of the Rings prequel may be jocular but it's as high a caliber an adventure as its successor.Incidentally, the upside to traveling with hirsute dwarfs is they never borrow your voltage converter for their electric shavers.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Peter Jackson once again has done a great job sending us the picture of the Middle Earth, once again it is magnificent. The story that walk as Bilbo Baggins life is somehow exciting , however lack of intense moment and that is because the story is created for younger viewers. So to me LOTR is still the best, the hobbit is brilliant though! It brings more knowledge for people who has already watched LOTR! The dwarf kingdom is now the new excitement!I hope for every living people in this world that is capable to definitely watch this movie.Especially who has not watched LOTR and do not know how great it is.My family and friends who watched the movie with me are all now trying to copy the LOTR trilogy.

NO, not at all! Oh boy, it feels good to be back in the middle earth! The movie is excellently crafted, I liked the detailed costumes and thought that pacing was good. At places the movie did feel less serious, but it's not LOTR.Although 3D is still strenuous on the eyes , I felt like High frame rate (HFR) actually helped. I must agree it looked a little awkward at the beginning but few minutes into the movie and I really appreciated the quality of the picture and the smooth movement. It is very new and we are not used to it, so I can understand people that didn't like it however us humans never take change very kindly do we ? So don't be disheartened by the critics this is one of those movies that people and critics have to agree to disagree (I found myself in this situation very often). My suggestion is, if you like fantasy, Watch it, if you have an open mind, watch it! However, if you don't like fantasy then yes it will be too long and it will disappoint you, it is a fantasy movie after all !My honest mark is actually a 9, but just to spite critics I gave it a 10 =))",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A well-fit adaptation to the infamous fable.,"A quiet and peaceful hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, having never known danger and adventure, is called to suddenly embark for an unexpected journey.As far as the acting goes, Ian McKellen's performance is enjoyable albeit conventional. The choice of Martin Freeman playing Bilbo was a pleasant surprise as he inarguably draws the attention of the audience with his witty performance. No wonder Peter Jackson insisted on him. The dwarfs bunch serve well, either for comic-relief or for a couple of formidable moments.While the book features no stylistic continuity with the LotR trilogy, the movie clearly recognizes its predecessor and strives to appear familiar to the fans. As such, the appearances of some LotR characters are to be expected, even when the book doesn't supposes to. Some well-known musical tunes are back as well. Despite these, the overall theme of the movie remains slightly deviant to the trilogy and more loyal to the original, ""fairy-taleish"" material. We see strange creatures and weird, comedic situations, giants and magic more often than not.The director's decision to cut the story in three separate films allows time for an explicit introduction (to the point that it may tire) and adequate character development. Those who expect closure though will be disappointed.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a deserving prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy and a well-fit adaptation to the infamous fable known as ""The Hobbit: There and Back Again"". It's nearly everything it could be, no more nor less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit is a Journey Well Worth the Trip,"It will doubtless come as no surprise to you that I'm a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (no one was more delighted than me when The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King won its Best Picture Oscar, and well deserved it was!). But while you might think that's to the movie-maker's advantage, it isn't. Sure, I'm predisposed to like the film. On the other hand, you do not mess with something as beloved as Tolkien's masterpiece! Director/Producer Peter Jackson didn't disappoint with his Lord of the Rings series, and I'm truly pleased to say that — so far, at least — he's managed to engineer the same feat with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (part 1 in a series of 3).The Hobbit takes place sixty years before the events that unfold in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. A much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is unexpectedly approached by a wizard he scarcely remembers having met as a child. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) wants Bilbo to go on an adventure, something the stay-at-home hobbit has absolutely zero interest in accepting. But when his home is effectively invaded by a troupe of dwarfs led by heir-to-the-throne Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), Bilbo becomes even more certain that adventure is not for him!Suffice it to say that a combination of envy, shame, and a desire for something beyond his own environment convinces Bilbo in the end to join the quest of the dwarfs: to take back the Kingdom of Erebor stolen from them decades ago by the greedy and vicious fire-breathing dragon, Smaug.Though he knows the journey won't be an easy one, Bilbo is taken aback by the hardships of life on the road which are only exacerbated by the fact the dwarfs are less than impressed with the hobbit or any abilities he might or might not have. Gandalf, however, maintains that Bilbo has hidden depths and that he'll admirably suit the group's need for someone with the skills of a burglar (which, of course, Bilbo steadfastly denies he has).Along the way, the travelers run into any number of impediments ranging from marauding orcs to duplicitous goblins, to say nothing of mountain trolls, giant spiders, or wizards who appear to be just a little less than entirely sane. And, of course, there are the elves, led by Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and advised by the Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). But perhaps the most dangerous and important creature to surface in their travels is met by Bilbo alone: the warped and undeniably psychotic Gollum who loses his most precious possession for which he blames Bilbo.Although the script (penned by a team including Jackson himself and Guillermo del Toro, originally tapped to direct) diverges from the book (a certain Orc, for example, plays a pivotal role), it holds beautifully to Tolkien's vision. (In fairness, the added parts are also Tolkien's; they're part and parcel of extensive appendices Tolkien crafted to further flesh out his intricate creation of Middle Earth.) It includes moments of humor which are welcome, as well as some surprisingly deep emotion.In some ways, it's the special effects that make or break movies like this no matter the caliber of the acting (very good), the direction (excellent), or the editing (also very good). It's also typically my favorite part of any movie like this, and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey lives up to expectation. Given the extensive use of CGI, I'm amazed to have only seen a split second or two that might have been improved upon, and I'm still lost in jaw-dropping wonder at an extended battle scene that takes place in the goblin tunnels. I'd like to say that the special effects are brilliant, but that word really isn't sufficient. Though the 3D treatment wasn't strictly needed, I can't lie: It, too, was beautifully rendered and, in my opinion, added to the reality of even the most unreal of moments. Of course, the actual location of the filming doesn't hurt, either. A trip to New Zealand is so on my bucket list!BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, you'll love seeing so much of what you've read come to vibrant life before your eyes. If you're not a fan of The Hobbit, you will be if you see this movie! I was a little concerned with the length since I'm not one to sit still for long if I'm not completely engrossed. Perhaps my best recommendation for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, then, is to tell you that the nearly three hours' run time flew by for me. I literally couldn't believe the movie was over already!POLITICAL NOTES: It's interesting, especially in light of recent debates in Washington, to see how greed can so thoroughly corrupt even previously decent leaders. It's even more heartening to see that there are those who still (as Thorin Oakenshield says concerning his rag-tag company) value ""loyalty, honor, a willing heart..."" more than anything else, and who are willing to fight for what's decent and right.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is rated PG-13 ""for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images."" The violence, though of a fantasy nature, is sometimes quite graphic; the suspense is beyond what younger children could easily handle. The storyline is also complex enough that younger children aren't going to understand it. Most of us read The Hobbit for the first time when we're 12 or 13 at youngest; The Lord of the Rings is typically read even later than that. And that's frankly not a bad gauge to consider when you wonder if this is a movie for your kids.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as it could have been,"Peter Jackson created something so reminiscent of LOTR that is looks like he is lacking new ideas. Many shots, scenes and even lines were almost copy-pasted. Hobbit is my favorite fairytale, and I expected the film to retain all the magic of the book. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It was just another blockbuster for Christmas, not more. Partially it has to do with Peter Jackson himself - his directing style was appropriate for LOTR, but not for Hobbit. He made it too realistic for children's book. What I imagined while reading the book was a mysterious land of Middle Earth, with a lot of fog and dark shadows. What I got in the film was sunlit tundra. Another thing which ruined the magic for me was the use of digital cameras for filming. Images they are able to acquire simply lack the gorgeous look of celluloid, which we all are used to associate with movies. Jackson has explained that digital cameras allowed him to shoot 3d, and were cheaper and easier. But what matters for me is the image quality and impression I get from the movie, not how hard or easy it was for filmmakers to create it. I also don't need this gimmick 3D. Overall, if you just wanna watch another blockbuster on your holidays - it will not disappoint you. If you have read the book and are a Tolkien fan - it will.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth it - Short and Simple,"I'll try to keep this short and simple, not going into great detail, starting with the good stuff: The effort put into making this film has definitely paid off. The LOTR quality is ever so present in The Hobbit as well. The casting is brilliant, and of course Ian McKellen absolutely steals the spotlight with the character only he could portray :) And now I've seen Martin Freeman as Bilbo, I don't actually think they could have found someone better too.The music score is fantastic, absolutely no step down from LOTR. The graphics have also greatly improved, but this also has a down side, as I'll discuss later.There are merely a few ""down point"" for me. Firstly, this film seems more ""childish"" than LOTR; there is much more humour and silliness in the film, sometimes in particular scenes where the sincerity of the situation becomes undone as a result of a joke. I didn't think that was suitable.Also, Jackson has used wide CGI shots with hordes of goblins where the action seems a bit too ""fantastic"". Sometimes there's just too much going on; swords swing through the air and miraculously hit dozens of goblins within seconds. Entire constructions fall down ravines with the dwarfs on them and they land perfectly safe amidst clouds falling planks and splinters.Please note though, I have not read the book in years so I can't say whether Jackson's approach in this is true to the book or not.All in all I definitely felt this film deserved a lesser rating than LOTR, but its an absolute must see nonetheless. If you liked LOTR you'll certainly like The Hobbit also.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Action-packed welcome back to the Middle Earth of LOTR,"Peter Jackson continues to balance a faithful adaptation of a revered book with the realities of the movie format. The almost 3 hours fly by quickly and it almost feels like the movie needed a slower pace, but I suppose it has to first and foremost ""entertain"".The acting is superb and while there are some comical and light-hearted moments, it is never kitschy or childish. I was afraid Bombur was going to turn out to be ridiculously silly, but I was wrong. Gollum is arguably even better than in LOTR and in some scenes surprisingly likable! Martin Freeman is an amazingly convincing hobbit, and Bilbo's relationship with Gandalf is nicely introduced/explained at the beginning.The New Zealand scenery and sets are as grand and detailed as we are used to from LOTR and the CGI so good that you don't notice it, which in my opinion is the best compliment one could give. The Shire looks wonderful and even more detailed than in LOTR and other locations in both forested and mountainous areas are stunning!Minor criticisms: 1. The scene with the mountain giants fighting felt a tad unnecessary for the flow of the movie.2. Some action sequence shots seemed ""made for 3D"". Note: I watched the 2D version.3. Only because it was unexpected: This movie is *not* for children, even though the book was intended for children. That will perhaps disappoint the parents of kids who read The Hobbit in anticipation of then watching the movie. I would say the minimum appropriate age for The Hobbit would be 13, but every parent has their own opinions on that.In summary, an extremely well made, entertaining movie, irrespective of whether or not you've read The Hobbit.PS: My favorite scenes: * The introduction of the dwarfs - well paced, balanced amount of humor. * The game of riddles - Andy Serkis at his best! * The final scenes concluding the confrontation with the Goblins/Wargs (can't be more specific without spoiling it ;-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Confusion is all cleared up,"The Lord of the Rings were on equal scale as Harry Potter. However, If you've missed the first Harry Potter you aren't as quite enthusiastic to continue to watch the remaining series. The Hobbit DEFINITELY clarified the following journeys. I now want to go back to watch all three - The Lord of the Rings.This epic is captivating to all age group. My fiancée and I sat in the theater for close to three hours and were craving for more. It's sad how this is the last story of the beginning. We didn't watch this movie in 3D but felt as we were part of this majestic journey. One thing I can say we were wishing for is a little bit more humor through the journey. Peter Jackson has definitely put his magical touch in this master piece. I'm definitely looking forward to see how he can continue to rekindle the child that is in each one of us. This is a must see for the whole family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
the hobbit review,I'm not going to say much. Just that the film is beautiful. the cg are fantastic. the action sequences are brilliant. the story is clear and leaves no confusion. it starts slow then it gets better. WATCH IT IN HFR! ITS WORTH IT! it makes you feel like you are really in the movie. I know people are saying that the 48 fps makes the cg look fake. trust me it does not. the animation is in fact smoother and fight scenes look well polished and not like some cheap close shots of 3d animated fights with lots of motion blur. The audio also blends well with the film. the music played are all appropriate based on the setting of the scenes. This film is the best film i've seen in 2012 and have no regrets in watching it in imax hfr 3d. i will definitely watch it again and again.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too serious and dark approached in screening of novel which just isn't nor serious nor dark,"The perfect visual impression, excellent music and great scenery are fully anticipated positives of the last Jackson's movie adaptation of Tolkien's works, but that is, more or less, where the positives stop. After a slow and uninteresting, but visually and emotionally nice beginning, in which we see how and why did dwarfs went on their journey and how Bilbo ends up with them, story evolves in even more slower and not too interesting bunch of relatively unconnected adventures. Book intended to be children story and this movie as children movie would be great, but Jackosn's too serious and too dark approach, like one in Lord of the Rings which are more darker stories, made most of the movie torn between something like half comedy children story and dark and strong wannabe Lord of the Rings story. Indestructibility of group of dwarfs is also terribly unserious even despite it is a fantasy film. Forest wizard with sleighs which are driven by big rabbits and big thick goblins who perform strongly and fall from one touch while telling a joke, just aren't characters for the movie Jackson wanted to made. There is also too often use of deus ex machina which is making the movie even less serious. Comedy sequences are great and very funny and they even fit in dark atmosphere, but basically they are just one more element which is making this story childish. A lot of attention was given to unimportant dialogues and scenes while many details are left vaguely, as eagles that help only partially, Saruman and Elvish opposition to return of dwarfs, Gandalf power in a one and weakness in other situations, and even the choice of Bilbo. While the CGI scenes were done almost perfectly, the one without it look amateurish. Camera often hides more than shows, and type of filming dialogues is like one in the soap operas. These were a huge disappointments. On the other hand, acting deserves applause, although not too big. Too serious and dark approached in screening of novel which just isn't nor serious nor dark is a fundamental mistake. Despite big backlog when compared with first trilogy, The Hobbit, if anything else, brings beautiful visualization and solid entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too much running time for too little substance, but amazing visuals!","The two things that make ""An Unexpected Journey"" not that good as we all have hoped are its length and the inappropriate funny stuff Jackson mixes into it. The dwarfs and their burping and quaffing destroy the mystic feeling of Middle-earth and turn the movie into a unfunny comedy. Luckily, only the first third of the film is ruled by the dwarfs, the rest is focused on the great battles and the wonderful views of Tolkien's world. But Peter Jackson's habit to turn every little story, as tiny as it may be, into a three-hour-picture is really pesky. Less dwarfs, less battles, less pseudo-humorous talk and we would've got a much better film. But after all, the first part of The Hobbit is dominated by the Oscar- deserving visuals and acoustics, a mostly felicitous cast and fantasy stuff, that is simply amazing to see. Just because of the 3D, the cinema ticket is worth its price. Eventually, you have to keep in mind that this is only the initiation to a hopefully marvelous journey.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hugely OVERRATED,"Hobbit Unexpected Journey is in my opinion an average movie. I just don't get it why people would consider it to be one of the greatest movie ever made. There are several reasons in mind:1. Adapted from the novel written by the author who wrote LORs so this have to be a good movie 2. Directed by the director who directed LORs so this have to be a good movie 3. A lot of dummies who probably have only seen several movies of same genres and can not tell if a movie is good or bad so if someone thinks this is a good movie then this have to be a good movieDo not get me wrong, I don't doubt the quality of Peter Jackson's work, it is simply that the book 'Hobbit' is not supposed to be made into a trilogy. The story 'Hobbit' is good if it could be done in 3 hours, but in 3 movies that add up to roughly 8-9 hours??? No! In 9 hours time you can probably have all the details in the book presented on the screen but as a movie that will be a failure guaranteed.The most recent time I fell asleep in theaters was watching 'The Hobbit', ironically, I was a huge fan of LOR.I would rate it as a decent movie, much worse than my expectation. And sometimes the audience's expectation really matters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Jackson does it again!,"If given the option of describing this movie in one word, in all modesty, I would call it ""Spectacular"". Then again, after the multi-award winning THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, how can you expect any less? THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is a fantasy adventure of such epic proportions, it takes an accomplished and acclaimed filmmaker to lead us on a grand adventure the likes of which we are yet to experience. Even so, as the first of three installments, this film lets us experience just one-third of the proverbial iceberg. And that's a good thing.Once again, adapting from J.R.R Tolkien's spellbinding tales of Middle-Earth, director Peter Jackson returns along with writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens in cinematically narrating an incredible adventure that is truly out of this world. Set as a prequel to THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, The Hobbit is adapted into a new trilogy of its own where chapter one, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, begins with the decimation of the once prosperous land of Erebor by the dragon Smaug, followed by the savage and brutal Orcs. We are then introduced to young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a hobbit who lives alone but content with his eventless lifestyle. Bilbo's simple life changes the day he meets Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen reprising his role) and thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage), whose father was the slain king of Erebor. Together, they begin a perilous quest to reclaim Erebor and all its treasures from Smaug.As the first of three instalments, there were a lot of high expectations riding on this one and I'm happy to say that the director, the grand storyteller that he is, has gone and done it again. Whether you are a Tolkien fan or not, Jackson takes everything we loved about TLOTR trilogy and breathes new life into it. Not only is there tweaking, sanding, and upgrading of various hallmarks from the original trilogy, there are lots of cliff-hangers, frequent skirmishes, and dollops of humour throughout. There is so much happening at any given time that you just don't feel the film is almost three hours long. From the fast paced story to the humorous predicaments of our little on-screen friends, to the captivating score by Howard Shore, there is little chance of a viewer's attention drifting away. To begin with, the 3D effect is immersive when required, rather than having the audience bob and weave at the swing of every axe. After the mixed reception of THE LOVELY BONES, Jackson has probably learned a valuable lesson in limiting only the best moments in visual splendour; an aspect he nails in this movie.Just In case you were wondering, the best part of this prequel is just that it is one – it is a prequel in the most rewarding manner possible for fans of the original. Bilbo and his new found friends traverse various locations that are brought back from the original, but grander in scale and visual aesthetics thanks to returning cinematographer Andre Lesnie. This says a lot about the quality of art design that has gone into this film, from green carpeted landscapes to snow-capped peaks, and various mythical beasts in between. There are also a plethora of familiar characters from the previous films, some who even aide in giving this story a new spin. My favourite, and perhaps the highlight of the film, is the attention given to reintroducing Gollum the goblin and his dark kinship with the One Ring. If performance capture technology is the next best thing in films of such calibre, it is no surprise that Andy Serkis is the best in the industry. Having previously worked with Jackson as Gollum and in 2011's unbelievable RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, it's a matter of time before Serkis is duly recognised for his ground-breaking efforts in CGI. But without doubt, the film's greatest strengths are Freeman as Bilbo and McKellen as Gandalf. Freeman crackles with charisma in almost every scene, yet the transformation from a meek and insignificant hobbit to becoming the group's hero is remarkably seamless. Together with Gandalf, Freeman's Bilbo becomes the catalyst in establishing a brotherly bond with every other character – everyone just seemed to be having fun no matter what the situation.THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTEED JOURNEY does not appear to break new ground, but trust Peter Jackson to show the world how a prequel should be made. Although he has caught our attention again, I suspect the best is yet to come. Watch this space.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A redundant, disjointed mess..","Martin Freeman plays young Bilbo Baggins who's been given the role of Burglar in a quest to reclaim some hill once exploited by The Dwarfs that since long has been domiciled by a nasty dragon named Smaug. Bilbo wants no part of it but, without any motivation given, teams up anyway. The head scratching begins.Not discussing the technical merits, the film is a complete disaster from beginning to end. Every bit of dialog is puerile, fake and contrived, not to mention progressing in the most clumsy, dragged out fashion imaginable. The incoherent plot lines lack any focus and there is no character development to compensate for it. Every scene is a copy of another scene that was copied from pick-your-installment of Lord of the Rings in which it was already a copy of some earlier scene. Every climax in those scenes ends with a deus ex machina subterfuge allowing our heroes to get away unharmed, no matter how ridiculous or insulting to the genre formerly known as Fantasy.The film is simply a vehicle showcasing the technical improvements in CGI, 3D and recording techniques (the doubled frame rate) which oddly enough makes the actual picture seem completely unconvincing. All I saw was a bunch of dressed up, overpaid actors rehashing the lines they memorized for the scenes they were in. The added realism which is brought about by the 'improvements' in recording, garners the complete opposite of what is aimed for. Everything seems detached from what should be a steady canvas onto which a story is painted. And that would include the completely needless cameos by Weaving, Blanchett and the warmed up corpse of 90 year old Christopher Lee who looked as if a CGI version of his character might have been the more humane option to go with.The 8.6 this marathon of nonsense currently presents itself with on IMDb defeats the purpose of having a rating system at all. Check the 'hated it' review section for future references for any film. It's probably the last resort to find an honest critical analysis for your movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
HFR advantage compared,"Having seen both the 3D and HFR-3D versions of the Hobbit, I can tell you that the HFR is much more fun.Compared to HFR, the non-HFR 3D Hobbit is like most 3D movies. At times during the non-HFR Hobbit, the 3D is more noticeable than others. The effect is more like a gimmick which wore out for me as the movie progressed.As with a few other non-HFR 3D flicks, I got a headache about half way through. I closed one eye for a few minutes and it went away.HFR on the other hand is like watching real people in real places. The depth starts in front of the screen. Every kind of motion is lifelike. Details in the image are sustained during motion. Objects tossed about are smooth, water flowing is like watching a natural waterfall in nature. The camera moves like your eyes would, and the panning of scenes is beyond breathtaking. The realism continues through the whole movie, and there are no gimmicks in the ending credits to remind you it was 3D.In non-HFR, there are occasional things that jump out of the screen, and you feel you could touch them for a moment. In the Hobbit HFR, characters were standing right next to me to the point where I really thought someone had sat in the seat next to me for a moment, though it was in the movie.There was no headache at all. I could watch HFR all day and love it.With this realism, character development was stronger, and the soundtrack seemed a notch better, though I didn't see the HFR at an ""XD"" theater (not this first time anyway).Though I have a great 3D home system, this HFR is not happening at home theaters any time soon, and will surely be missed. I will see The Hobbit in HFR again at the theater, which is a rare event for me these days.8/10 since for the story and 10/10 for the introduction of HFR 3D.

The Hobbit: or There And Back Again by Bilbo Baggins  10/10,"The Hobbit is very different from the LOTR (Lord of the Rings) trilogy. This is filled with humor that has the whole crowd laughing, where Lord of the Rings trilogy is more serious. Ian McKellan, Martin Freeman, and Andy Serkis star in this unexpected journey, where an ordinary hobbit of Bag End in the Shire is chosen as the 14th member of the dwarf family, so that they can go get their home back from the evil dragon, Smaug.Personally, my favorite scene of The Hobbit was when Bilbo Baggins has an encounter with the creature, who once was a hobbit, Gollum. ""We lost it! My precious, we lost it,"" Gollum says when he figures out that his ring (precious) is gone. This is a very fun scene because Gollum is so clumsy and very silly, as he is in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.It's very hard to believe that the same actor that plays Gollum also portrays Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong.If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings, you should see The Hobbit!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A whole lot of nothing!,"I am a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings series of films, and no matter how many times I watch them I am always astounded by the amount of detail and story and how gripping each individual film is for the length. The Hobbit, unfortunately does not follow this trend at all. I thought I should finally get around to watching this film after missing it in the cinema and being particularly jealous of hearing the rave reviews.How this film got above a 6 is beyond me. Nothing happens at all. Once I'd watched it I had to look back and remind myself how long the film was... and whether I had missed an important part somewhere, the whole film could fit into a 30 minute introduction to a more gripping and fitting story line.I would pick out particular bits that where a complete waste of time (i.e. the rocks fighting, the slapstick trolls) but really.... I can't think of anything that was worth watching.

Where's the magic?,"I definitely felt like the magic of the original trilogy was missing here, the issue isn't so much with making three, three hours films based on thin amounts of source material (with extended editions mind you) which is even testing when you watch the original trilogy. They really don't hand out Oscars for best adapted screenplay for the good of their health.The problem really lies in the production, it's entirely over extended. It's photographic process resembled an aesthetic similar to a role play, like the police were going to show up at the end a la Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The effects of this are significantly reduced on DVD which is a format I definitely recommend seeing this in. There were way too many CGI effects in some places which again just screams ""THIS IS FAKE!"" or at the very least made it look like a cartoon. The entire movie looks like one big Photoshop. It was a huge disappointment considering how well done the costume design was on the original trilogy. I guess gone are the days where people could make classic movies where the only gimmick they had was a faulty mechanical shark.This is by no means a bad movie, my high regard of the LOTR movies kept this engaging from start to finish, and I don't really think there's much merit in comparing like movies, however they've made it very clear that Peter Jackson wants these movies on the same shelf, in the same box as the LOTR movies. I just felt really disappointed at how over produced it was and let down because it really was due to adding in the stuff that draws a crowd to the box office and not the tangible elements that make movie classics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
All the charm of the original novel has been replaced by lots of growling.,"Tolkien must be spinning in his grave. This movies bears absolutely no resemblance to the book, aside from the names of the characters and the general plot.There is no character development - everything is just a vehicle for the special effects. The story has been changed... I suppose they needed to to add more growly parts and 3D effects.Of course, the technical wizardry is exceptional, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. And, when it comes down to it, it's the story that's the most important part. It's the story and the charming characters that made the book so popular - I've read it dozens of times, over the years.Bottom line - if you removed all of the growling, you'd trim the movies down to about an hour and a half, at best, and you'd still be no closer to understanding the characters and their charm. I can see why they had to split the story into 3 parts - just to fit in all of the technical wizardry... and, of course, the growling.Definitely a disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Yes there are scenes that seem unrealistic and yes, the battle sequences in Goblin City are a bit far-fetched but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of watching them.

You need 3 movies to tell a short story?,"I took my son to see this as a Christmas treat for him. And discovered three things about the Hobbit I did not know before:1) As expected, it was better than any of the LoTR films. This is partly because the technology has been developed in the last few years, partly because Jackson and his crew have done this before, and partly because, let's face it, the Hobbit was a better story to start with. At least when it comes to a fun, children-oriented fairytale.2) 3D is not for people who already have 4 eyes, such as myself. It's OK if you wear contact lenses I guess, but it's impossible to fit the 3D glasses over or under your normal glasses and get a proper focus. The movie is long and I eventually got a headache and did not enjoy it as much as I would have. It was my second attempt at 3D, and I think it will be my last in the foreseeable future. So, if you wear glasses, go for the 2D version, which I am sure will be just as fun.3) But the most amazing thing I discovered around 2 hours into the movie, when the heroes did not seem to be getting anywhere near their final objective, is that this is only 1/3 of the Hobbit story. It's going to be another trilogy! I'm sorry, but I cannot go once a year for 3 years in the hope of eventually watching the movie by 2015. Oh come on now! I could understand it when it comes to LoTR, which after all was a 1000-page book they had to bind in 3 tomes (which is why it has been mistaken for a trilogy). But the Hobbit is a much shorter, straightforward story. I'm sure they could have told it in 3-4 hours without chopping out any major parts. In fact, I'm pretty sure they added extra subplots to fill up the time.But in any case, all in all I'll have to give this movie a 10, despite my own objections to the length and format. For what it is, it was brilliantly done, taking the viewer once more on a magnificent journey to Middle Earth. And, unlike the LotR movies (especially the last one), this one is family-friendly and can be easily watched by non-fans and children of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Stretched too thin,"Think about everyone you know who read The Hobbit. They all loved it, right? Think about everyone you know who read the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Did more than a few of them actually finish all three books? What makes The Hobbit a better read than the trilogy is exactly what made the Lord of the Rings films easier to take than the books: with the trilogy, Jackson whittled the far too dense story down to its essentials, or rather whittled down the pile of world myth details to find one single story. He made an opposite move with this film, ruining the novel's one advantage over the trilogy, its brevity. Not only did he drag one brief novel's story out over the course of three three hour films, but he added story elements which have only the most superficial connections to the plot at hand. Although the trilogy did well, I don't see this ponderous heap of a film, repeated twice, adding anything to his reputation or the studio's profits.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Epic and Enchanting Film Affected By An Inconsistent Tone and Fragmented Story,"The Lord of the Rings made me fall in love with movies. A towering achievement of craftsmanship and epic yet intimate storytelling, Peter Jackson's film trilogy was a visionary piece of filmmaking that had me dreaming for over a decade.I never like to compare a film with its source material. Both art forms are significantly different and should be judged on their respective merits. As long as a movie adaptation doesn't betray the spirit of its origins but rather builds upon them, I'll be on board.In that light, The Lord of the Rings was a triumphant example of an ambitious director transposing Tolkien's literary narrative to a powerful and moving film experience. It should also be said that each Rings chapter constituted a great, fully realised film in its own right. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey should then also be reviewed through that same critical lens.As a film then, An Unexpected Journey fails to meet the impossibly high expectations that were set with The Lord of the Rings, but it still remains an enjoyable and enchanting motion picture. It's a solid, well- crafted film that contains many of the elements that made the previous trilogy memorable. The fragmented narrative, inconsistent tone and excessive special effects, however, prevent An Unexpected Journey from being a great movie.The film is perhaps too faithful to the details of Tolkien's novel, as it includes anecdotal scenes that are probably best left for the extended edition. And whereas Fellowship of the Ring can really stand on its own, this first chapter of The Hobbit trilogy truly feels like an introductory chapter of a greater whole. Jackson is establishing many character arcs here – maybe too many – to justify an entire trilogy of films based on one novel. The result is a fragmented film searching for a focal point.Fortunately, that focus finally settles on Bilbo Baggins, played to perfection by Martin Freeman. Freeman is Bilbo here. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role. His character arc of starting up as a homely comfort-loving Hobbit becoming a brave adventurer is well developed. It's also wonderful to see Ian McKellen as Gandalf again, who is given more screen time this time around. McKellen is better than ever, giving the film a fine touch of humour and a much needed sense of gravitas. Speaking of which, Richard Armitage is great as Thorin Oakenshield, who is clearly presented as the Aragorn of this series to good effect. He anchors the dwarfs' quest in a heroic and convincing manner. A couple of other dwarfs get their time to shine, but that's it. And while Jackson admirably tries to introduce each and every one of them, we don't really have the time to invest ourselves in the rest of the company.It wouldn't be fair to measure up the first instalment of The Hobbit to the memory we treasure of The Lord of the Rings. Yet, Peter Jackson consciously invites the comparison by structuring the film in a way that echoes The Fellowship of the Ring. He also neatly ties the two stories together with a narrative framing device and by bringing back characters from his first visit to Middle Earth.An Unexpected Journey suffers from an occasionally confused tone. I got the uneasy feeling at times that Jackson bet on fans' nostalgia for the previous trilogy to compensate for some flaws of the film. The movie flirts with greatness in moments when it achieves the majestic sweep of the Rings films. In other instances, however, Jackson struggles to find the appropriate tone for this new venture. Humorous moments are most welcome when they reflect the spirit of the novel, particularly during the terrific introductory dinner scene at Bilbo's house, but at other times they feel out of place. Radagast's antics, for example, feel like they don't belong in this specific vision. By tying together the majestic tone of his Rings trilogy and the more carefree and joyful spirit of The Hobbit, Jackson attempts an ambitious balancing act that doesn't always work.Since this is the first chapter of a three-movie adaptation of a single novel, there's not much drama that can unfold in an emotionally satisfying manner. I never felt as invested in the proceedings as much as I wished, and the action scenes are not as thrilling as I hoped they would be. The intermittent overkill of special effects in some scenes drew me out of this incredibly immersive world. While The Lord of the Rings made equally great use of practical effects and CGI, this new film relies much too heavily on the latter. The magic is occasionally lost, particularly in a scene in a mine and with Thorin's nemesis, Azog, a fierce Orc who has absolutely no reason to be CGI and yet still is. Thank heavens for Gollum, played with exceptional skill once again by the terrific Andy Serkis, who demonstrates why Weta can produce some truly extraordinary work. It's thrilling to see Gollum again, this time around in a standout scene where Martin Freeman really comes into his own as Bilbo.Despite its shortcomings, rest assured that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fantastic adventure, propelled once more by a beautiful score by Howard Shore, lush cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and the same expert craftsmanship orchestrated by Peter Jackson. I suspect die-hard Tolkien fans will be very pleased; others might think the film is too anecdotal at times due to its faithfulness to the novel. It's a solid and impressive start, if not an exceptional one, that foreshadows great things to come. The final moments in the film reveal that the throat-clearing is out of the way and that Jackson has found a fitting tone. It will be very interesting to see how the next two chapters unfold. In any case, it's truly great to be back in Middle Earth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unnecessary long film,"This movie was really disappointing. Let me say that although I didn't read the LOTR books, I loved the movies. However, I did read The Hobbit. Just got back from the theaters a few hours ago so I've had a few hours to think about what I liked and didn't like. First off, one hour into the movie I found myself getting sleepy and closing my eyes for a few minutes (I have never done that). I thought, ""maybe Im just exhausted from Christmas"" but after the movie my Mom, cousins and uncle all said they did the same thing! We actually got a little laugh about it as it was the only reason we could find to smile after seeing the movie. It just took too long for ""the adventure"" to get started, and there was little reason to understand WHY Bilbo changed his mind and decided to go! Second, Im done with IMAX,3D movies that are set in dark locations like this movie. Its physically too hard to follow the action and I find myself exhausted trying to keep up with ""whos getting killed"" or ""who lived"". Speaking of getting killed, NOBODY DID! About half way through the adventure it just started to get ridiculous how these puny dwarfs were surviving everything they were going through. I know its a fantasy movie, but gimmie a break! By the end I knew everyone was going to live through everything, making the battle scenes very boring. Bilbo had to be the most disappointing character in this movie. The book was written through his eyes and it made you sympathize with his struggles. I had ZERO sympathy for Bilbo! I almost feel guilty saying that as I almost cried watching the cartoon when I was a kid! Lastly,(and I might be the only person who didn't know this going in) when the movie ended I got a real sickening felling deep inside. The Hobbit was ONE short book! Why are they trying to make it into 3 very long movies!! All of a sudden I realized I had been duped. Duped into a typical Hollywood money-grab riding on the coat-tails of LOTR. At that point I realized why this movie was so bad. Its just trying to be something it is not. If this movie was made as a one movie blockbuster it would have been great. John Carter could have done the same thing but instead, the writers put all the books into one movie and it turned out great. This is the exact opposite. Parts 2 and 3 of this story will be seen by me at the dollar theater.

The film is rich, packed with detail (even better looking than LOTR), the characters are well realised and expanded slightly from the book..scenes and events from the book have also been fleshed out (but don,t worry Peter Jackson has done a brilliant job in bringing the extra material that Tolkien had written after the hobbit and incorporating it into this movie) Absolutely Brilliant !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing adventures of Middle-earth !,"Finally, I came out of the theater of the long-awaited Hobbit. I have to write a word , I was thrilled. Excellent actors , design , effects and music with an ingenious plot -centric bridge to the Lord of the Rings . The complaints about the length are generally false, and rather serves as a slur. It is due to misunderstanding of original and above what the creators intended . Absolutely masterpieces are for the fans are mentions of the Silmarillion .

Watched it in 2D and in 3D HFR.....,"I know there are loads of these types of threads already, before I watched the movie I looked at them and everyone was complaining...I booked a 3D screening on the day of the release and the cinemas projector had overheated so they offered us a free 2D screening; I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the movie, but I didn't come out the cinema thinking it was amazing like I did with LOTR. But yesterday I watched it in 3D HFR and I think it was amazing! I should have watched it in that format on the first day and not went for just 3D. I did go in the cinema expecting it to look too realistic and fake but it really was great. I recommend people to watch it in 3D HFR, its the best 3D I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Too much low-quality filler spoiling the brew,"Some examples of the low points of the movie, that merely chew up time unproductively: .1. A harmless stick insect in someone's mouth, but which almost a minute of movie time is spent on.2. Moths flying in and out of a snoring character's mouth for 30 seconds.3. A huge wattle of fat dangling from the chin of a character, with the camera focused on it swaying around for 30 seconds.4. A troll blowing his nose repeatedly for about 30 seconds.5. A long, long fall of a triple-decker structure for about 30 seconds.6. Radagast is involved in the same chase pratfall about 6 times in a row. A few of those times, the CGI looked exceptionally poor. Why not just repeat the pratfall 3 times where it looked better? Or just avoid the pratfall.7. Golf. Balls. Deposits.I've been a big Peter Jackson fan for years, and I've watched everything he's done, including Bad Taste and Forgotten Silver. I thought his first serious low point as a director was with Jimmy the Cabin Boy in King Kong. He spent half an hour on that character for no coherent reason. Here, he's showing the same weaknesses. With the above 3 minutes of movie trimmed or excised, I'd have given the movie 2 more stars.Why couldn't each of the dwarfs had at least one line, or at least said their own name? All that said .. I did like many of the embellishments. The Necromancer is an interesting storyline (but they haven't really gotten to it yet). I loved seeing Saruman (but not with a brown beard), and I thought the actors with speaking rolls did fine.I'd have been happier with more careful trimming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Picturesque Image, Wonderful Story","Watching the Hobbit : unexpected journey was like a reunion. Saw the Hobbits village, their unique house, Frodo, Gandalf and.. Gollum. I can't believe I can still see them again, in a new story. for me LOTR series was ended in third movie. I remember how sad I am to see the story had finished.From the Hobbit, we will know why the ring was with Bilbo, why Gollum act like a jerk and how much he loved that 'ring'. The story started in one fine morning, Bilbo was sit in his terrace, enjoying his pipe after a nice breakfast. Suddenly Gandalf came and ask Bilbo whether he was still recognized him or not. At first Bilbo didn't remember, then find out where he was meet Gandalf. He asked Bilbo to follow him in a journey. Bilbo refused, he said a good life for a hobbit is a warm bed, nice food, adequate snack. Adventure was not suitable for a tiny hobbit. Gandalf said, OK, fine. But he marked Bilbo's door house, in some kind of sign. At the evening when Bilbo just finished cooked his dinner, a delicious fish, suddenly he heard that his door was knocked. He wondered, in fact he didn't expect a guess. Bilbo saw a dwarf, and the dwarf asked did the party start yet? where's the others? where's the food? as he saw Bilbo food, he ate it and asked him whether he has more or not.Shockingly, Bilbo said, do I know you? but again, his door knocked, group of dwarfs came and ask food. Helpless, Bilbo gave them food, but that was not enough, they mess around and took Bilbo's food supplies. The situation was messy and merry. Gandalf appeared and explained that those dwarf gather now to take over their homeland which was taken by a dragon. That dragon live in the palace, which filled with gold, golden coin. They need a thief to infiltrate silently to their kingdom. They need Bilbo, as he was small and others tend not to realized his existence. at first Bilbo refused but at the end he's accept and traveled with dwarfs to their taken over kingdom. In the middle of their journey, they found many obstacles, as dwarfs are small like hobbit, weak, and has no power like a wizard, strong like a orc, and have integrity like Elf. But their willingness to live in their land, beat them all. they almost eaten by troll, death in the amidst of 'stone war', killed by orc, with the integrity of Bilbo, help from Gandalf, their unity and cooperation, they can beat them all. Do they succeed won the war? As this movie trilogy, I guess we will get the answer.. next year!if you are LOTR watchers, you will be familiar with the scenery. Till this day, it's still mesmerize me and wonder does this view really exist on earth? Peter Jackson is a brilliant director. If you are fans of LOTR, love an exquisite sight, an imaginary fellow and love to see something beyond imagination, please, please, watch this movie! I gave 9 because up to now, still curious, why Gandalf not getting younger? All of the people in Hobbit which we know them first in LOTR is getting younger. As I watched behind the scenes of the hobby, how details and serious them working on this movie, there is no way they missed this fact. then why?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A masterpiece!,"It is hard to describe film, because the words are so pour, it is absolute marvelous! I finally felt that the story was coherent, with no gaps like in The Lord Of The Rings.. After 160 minutes man, I wanted more, it felt like the film just began and everything was so immerse that it felt like half an hour or so...The 3D was very well implemented, man could see that the film was designed in 3D, the only exception was the DOF sometimes; the industry must learn that 3D with out of focus areas is crap, the beauty in 3D is to see all the planes clear and to travel with the view as you like, but this is another story, the all need to learn these things. The good part was the 48 fps which made the image smoother, finally someone is trying to get reed of the crappy 24 fps which gives blurry motion. Most of the critics have no clue what are they talking, 24 fps was a very old technical limitation not something to be desired...STUPID! Some pans and very fast actions in the film cold have been improved on 72 fps on my opinion. The high resolution was welcome, and in conjunction with the higher frame rates made the film so immerse that felt like you are there experiencing the Hobbit. I know it was already very hard to produce the film with 2 cameras, but a perfect film in my opinion who'd have been with 3 cameras. 2 for 3D with large DOF all the time and high fps and he third with small DOF and 24 fps for normal theaters.Excluding the comments about small DOF in 3D I cold fined only few problems actually. Gandalf's stick in some parts of the film was more like a plastic stick not wood, the poop from the brown wizard hare also, and wooden shield of the young king of the dwarfs certainly looked in some scenes like a piece of plastic. But maybe I to grumbling.Anyway, the film is a masterpiece, and I'm pretty sure that almost everybody who likes the genre will love it, with the exception of grumpy critics which this time are all wrong in their bad comments about not being a film but more like a TV show, the are so wrong!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Unrequired Epic,"I am a longtime Tolkien fan who likely read most of his works before most of the posters here were born. Peter Jackson did an absolutely superb job bringing LOTR to the screen, due in large part to sticking very closely to Tolkien's work. (Okay, Arwen got inserted to provide a love interest, but she replaced Glorfindel in part.) And while LOTR may be both my favorite novel and film, I wouldn't say I'm a Jackson/Tolkien fanboy as many here appear to be with their 10 of 10 scores.Given the success of LOTR by sticking to the story, I was nervous when I heard The Hobbit would also be a trilogy. Show me the money! The Hobbit is shorter than any of the 3 LOTR volumes. More importantly, it's told in an entirely different way. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, told breezily with large sections of narration. Its dwarfs are largely comical. LOTR though is an epic, deep in setting, detail, and dialogue. Still, because of the breeziness (e.g. important events are covered in a few pages, the narrator intentionally skipping forward intentionally in some places) I had hopes that Jackson's understanding of Tolkien would compensate.Did he? I must say, a mixed bag there. Certainly borrowing the settings, cinematography, tone, music, etc. from LOTR helped. Freeman's Bilbo matches Tolkien's pretty well, a simple fellow thrown into an adventure. The initial scene with the history of Smaug was a good way to give context to what follows. Whenever Jackson is sticking with Tolkien, things are great such as Gollum's scene.When Jackson is on his own though, the film drags. Jackson had to mine every reference and back story for additional screen time. It's safe to say than when a character not in the book is on screen, something ain't right. Radagast, Galadriel, Saruman, and CGI Azog add little. Moreover, the battle scenes are excessive in the extreme. In the book, there as no fight with the trolls nor with orcs approaching Rivendell. The ""main"" fight with the Great Goblin was over pretty quickly, with the dwarfs needing to flee rather than fight. That all 14 continuously and miraculously escape unharmed from multiple situations drains all the drama. (Just the fall into Goblintown should have killed them all.) But Jackson has to have his CGI/video game fun, even though this too is filler.All in all, The Hobbit is not a bad film. Go see it. But it would have been better had Jackson told the tale it in just two films, sticking to Tolkien and thus the success formula for LOTR.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Leaves a dent in the LOTR legacy,"OK, to be fair this is not a 1/10 movie. But it is so far from being a 10/10 and a top 250 movie that I felt the need to make a point.I can see that many of the reviewers who have given the movie a top score have not even seen the LOTR-trilogy. That is absurd. That would be like declaring ""Godfather III"" to be the best mafia movie ever without seeing the first two (which of course are FAR better). Or, perhaps more relevant, saying that ""The Phantom Menace"" is the best Star Wars-movie without having seen the others. You simply cannot judge ""The Hobbit"" without seeing in it the context of the LOTR-trilogy.Sadly, ""The Hobbit""-trilogy is probably going to be far more costly and extravagant than the LOTR-trilogy was. What a pity that is, when you think of the material the two trilogies were meant to cover. In LOTR each movie covered a thick book. In the Hobbit, each movie covers a couple of chapters in a small book for children.The book which is ""The Hobbit"" simply does not warrant a trilogy of films. It should have been a single movie and nothing more. The pace in the movie is agonizingly slow, and it is filled with so many time-passing action sequences and special effects that you almost feel like you are about to have a stroke at the end of the movie. Three hours is spent on what is an hours worth of material at the very most.As for the casting, it is cool to see some of the old gang again. But you can tell that it has been over ten years since the last movie. Which of course is a bit odd considering that this movie is a prequel to the others. I personally can't stand Martin Freeman (Bilbo) with his perpetual and one-dimensional annoyed/dumbfounded facial expression, but I guess that is a matter of taste.The special effects are very good. I wish they were available when they made LOTR. But even though something is good, there is a limit too how much you can stand of it. Maximum Overkill is how I would describe it in this case.All in all, I was very disappointed in the movie, and I do not feel like seeing the next two.For you guys who have not seen LOTR and rates this 10/10 - you are unforgivably ignorant.For those who have seen LOTR and STILL rates this 10/10 - sacrilege is the word that comes to mind.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent film and among the best to watch in 3D!,"I'll try to keep this review short and sweet. I'm not a huge LOTR fan like some. I've never read the books and I've seen the first trilogy only one time each (and I did think they were great). But what I am is a movie fanatic/sci fi fan, and movies like The Hobbit are hard to pass up.First and foremost, story, CGI, acting, sound/score, all among the best. Peter Jackson knows how to take the viewer on a journey and make a fantastic looking film. The 3D in the movie is absolutely stunning. I'm not a fan of 3D but this movies special FX and even basic scenes like walking around were very convincingly done. If you get a chance to watch this in 3D, jump on the opportunity, it's worth it!My only complaint about the Hobbit (as well as the other LOTR movies) I think these movies are TOO LONG!!! It's not an entirely bad thing for a film like ""The Hobbit"". But I could go for a sweet flick just under two hours. It seems like these movies drag on for far too long, and to be honest, ""The Hobbit"" is the worst of them all. There is a lot of side-track story telling in between and the movie just seems to drag on at some points. If you absolutely love these movies/books for LOTR then you probably like it being long. But as more the typical viewer, it's hard to stay interested for that long. Also, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but the way the movie ends was just kind of weird and obvious that there would be a sequel.All and all, still a great film. Despite the running time this is a great film and definitely worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good stand alone film, but falls short of the LOTR trilogy","The dilemma of delivering movies of baronial proportions such as the Lord of The Rings trilogy is that the makers can seldom revivify their own brilliance. The same is the case with The Hobbit. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, pacy, crisp. Cinematography is at par with the trilogy's predecessor and the 3D effects are an added incentive. However one is left desiring for more due to the absence of a pivotal character such as Aragorn. However given the fact that the book, The Hobbit itself is not as grandiose as the Lord of The Rings, Peter Jackson deserves a good deal of praise for his work. On the other hand, if you're one of the minority who are yet to witness the LOTR trilogy, this movie would be nothing short off breathtaking. The revolutionary 48 RED Epic digital cameras don't disappoint as well. Disregard all those skewed reviews which downplay the cinematography of the film. Martin Freeman just fits perfectly into the character of Bilbo and Ian McKellen is the best of the lot. His personification of Gandalf is as fluid and natural as ever. The only central character that falls behind is that of Thorin portrayed by Richard Armitage. Jackson should have dedicated more screen time, but then again we might get to know him better in the following sequels. Had this been released before the Lord of The Rings trilogy, the film would have received better appreciation. I've been to the theaters twice to see this film and trust me it gets better with each viewing. Probably another show and I might bump it to a 9!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Eagles Soar, Dwarfs Sing, and Peter Jackson has the one Ring","I will start with the bad, many reviews have discussed this at length, in truth the beginning could have used a bit of tightening, however when the Dwarfs began to sing the folk songs of old, I grinned from ear to ear yes its in the books. Peter Jackson embraces the technological changes since he first lensed the ring Trilogy and lets be honest when he made them back in 2000-2001 they were state of the art of film technology and so to is the Unexpected Journey. He also creates links from the Hobbit to the Ring Trilogy something I really did like after all it is a prequel to the Movies and while no movie is ever as in depth as the book their are strong reasons to create these histories of the characters, in fact Tolkien did much the same writing other tales, along with various notes his son published later and Tolkien himself referred to as his Legendarium. I also think its important to remind ourselves this story was originally published in 1936, with the Ring Trilogy published 1954-55. Whats astonishing to me is how well Peter Jackson relates to these stories along with his creative writing team Fran Walsh and Phillipe Boyens, its nearly impossible to imagine any other team bringing these books to the screen. What I so loved in this first installment was the things I found missing in the original three movies and thats the animals the over-sized rabbits, the spiders, the Eagles I actually teared up seeing them it was as if someone had peered into my imagination and stolen my vision. I will close with the good, CGI was done well don't listen to the haters, Gollum is wicked, visually stunning presentation, exciting and well paced 2nd half of the movie were it not for the pacing in the first 40 minutes I might have given it a 10 but I deducted for it, the acting was good and eventually Bilbo Baggins Lives this first installment is about Courage.

An Expected Journey,"Warning: This is not a review in its truest sense.Anyone that looks forward to the movie 'The Hobbit' does so due to one of two reasons - he/she either loved 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy so much, or because he/she loved the book so much. But I safely assume fans of the book must have watched the trilogy already. Those who just woke up from a eleven year old coma, and have no idea which trilogy I am talking about, can stay away from this review, as I deem you unworthy.I won't give away much of the plot, so read ahead without worrying about spoilers.The movie starts at the Shire that we all love (and wish we lived there). Peter Jackson knows how to cash in on our nostalgia (so does Howard Shore, we'll talk about that later). The story begins with Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins, yet again preparing for Bilbo's 111th birthday. But Frodo makes the cameo appearance only to garner those loud whistles and cheers from the audience, because we are quickly thrown back in time by 60 years. Gandalf the Grey pays a visit to young Bilbo's hobbit hole at Bag End, and so do a merry bunch of dwarfs. Before Bilbo can realize, his food and wine stock is devoured and depleted, and he is part of an adventure he is unprepared for.That adventure takes them (and us) through so many familiar and unfamiliar territories. We see many familiar faces - Lady Galadriel, Lord Elrond, Saruman the White, and the adorable Gollum (this time the whistles and cheers were louder). We also visit Rivendell (another place that we wished we lived in). Little events that got mentioned in the LOTR trilogy unfold before our eyes, inspiring awe at the wizardry of a certain Tolkien.Bilbo always seemed an insignificant character in the LOTR. But here, we immediately fall in love with the charisma of his innocence, his body language, his mild stupidity, and his courage (oh yes, even Gandalf says he draws courage from him). He does possess a lot of fear, but that's exactly why his courage is remarkable when he overcomes his fear.Those who are unfamiliar with the book will be overwhelmed by the number of dwarf characters in the movie, but soon you will be familiar with them all (Thorin, Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin (Gimli's father, if you know who Gimli is), Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur). Thorin deserves special mention here, as his presence is so kingly, other dwarfs get dwarfed in his presence (pardon the pun).We have seen Gollum in three movies already, hating it, pitying it and loving it. It is the same Gollum that we see here, but it still manages to make our jaws drop with its matchless expressions. Heck, some may even consider killing their dog and replacing it with Gollum as their new pet/companion. But make no mistake, it is equally menacing, manages to kill a goblin with ease, and is not so forgiving when a hobbit rids it of its most precious property.We also encounter new characters - Radagast the Brown, a nature loving wizard, Azog, a pale and baleful Orc, and the Great Goblin, who deserves the adjective only due to his size. Then there is the Necromancer, and then there is Smaug.Before the end of the movie, we already care for the fellowship and their quest, and look forward to the next part, and that is the director's triumph.Let's talk about the visual grandeur of the movie. In a period where every movie comes out in 3D, this one really stands out. It never overuses the effects, but middle earth looks astounding in 3D, and at times it throws a few surprises at you, making you smile. The drooling Wargs look a lot more menacing when they stretch their heads out of the screen towards you. Birds and butterflies flutter all over the theater. The sweeping visuals of a goblin infested mountain can never look better even if you happen to be captured by those goblins and taken there. To say it short, this movie looks even better than LOTR, and that's saying a lot. Every frame of this movie can be used as a wallpaper for your computer/tablet/phone.Dolby ATMOS - When the stone giants were fighting, the entire theater was rumbling so much, I was afraid the multiplex might suffer a structural collapse at any time. When Gollum was throwing its riddles, the riddles were coming in at us from all directions. As a lover of sound, I truly enjoyed the experience, and will pay yet again to experience it again.Howard Shore is another reason why the LOTR trilogy is so loved by the fans. Here he mesmerizes us again, in spite of reusing some of the old themes for the sake of nostalgia. The song of the dwarfs is my hot favorite now (it's blasting through my speakers even as I am composing my review at 12:45 am). He also introduces some new themes that we will get more familiar with as the next two parts of this trilogy are released over the next two years (I hate the commercial reasons for such a long gap already). As for me, I will be quite familiar within a week, as I will watch this movie again and again, and have also purchased the soundtrack.The movie is quite long, running dangerously close to three hours. The more the merrier I say. I already await the extended Blu-ray edition of the movie, which I know will add at least another 30 minutes of middle earth viewing for me. When I went to this movie, I did not go looking for flaws. I am a fan, not a critic. So what else did you expect from my 'review', apart from words of praise?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"A plain 2D version at the local multiplex, culminating my not-so-frenetic film-viewing activity of 2012. The first chapter of this contentiously extended THE HOBBIT trilogy from Peter Jackson revisits the familiar ground in New Zealand, with Bilbo recounts his tall-tale with Gandolf and thirteen dwarfs (strangely their purpose of their journey seems to be deliberately dodged, for viewers who have not read the novel, the journey itself is conspicuously ""unexpected and unexplained"").In light of my growing fondness towards THE LORD OF THE RING trilogy, I had my wishful thinking that this film could kick off with a competent start, which would be a pipe dream to eclipse THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001, 9/10), but at least to re-ignite certain amount of evocation of the land once brought us amazement and awe. And on this ground, the film has indeed only fulfilled its primary undertaking with its breathtaking skirmishes with trolls, goblins, orcs and other monsters (dragons excluded though), but fails to spike any refreshing ingredient into that wonderland.Peter Jackson has to stuff the less-epic expedition with viable accessories to slide smoothly in its almost 160 minutes length (which may further spark the profit-seeking rapacity behind the trilogy contrivance whose plausible excuse has never been elucidated otherwise). The competence of the renowned-and-much-anticipated CGI technology and the innovative 48fps HFR (High Frame Rate) terminology surprisingly backfires quite harshly due to the diminishing ramifications of the epic sensation which audience demand fervently and preferably upon the franchise.The film is a re-run of forming the pack, with elves intervening, but the best part has to be the Golem vignette (which might sadly insinuate that Golem is Peter Jackson's career apex and barrier ahead), so melancholically deployed to summon all the empathy from THE LORD OF THE RING TRILOGY followers.The massive cast comprises some well-beloved returning immortal figures (McKellen is overpowering while Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee and Elijah Wood's cameos cannot register any thrill) and a young Bilbo (Martin Freeman is shortchanged here since the novel is called THE HOBBIT) with a clutch of dwarfs to be barely discernible to identify their respective names, with Richard Armitage trying desperately to simulate a Viggo Mortensen embodiment.So, under whatever different circumstances in regard of expectation, the film is a jolly cocktail of a series of roller-coaster adventures and a chirpily reminiscent runaway train, anyway its rosy box office shows basically audience are quite merciful during the Christmas season, so let's wish the miracle will continue occurring to Jackson not once, but twice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Bloated and simply boring,"Just saw ""The Hobbit"" in 2D and standard 24 fps. There is some good to be said about this movie: Many set-designs and landscape shots are quite beautiful (in case you missed the same set-designs and landscape shots in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy)... Alas, this does not a great movie make! In terms of plotting, pacing or character development ""The Hobbit"" falls unbelievably short. Actually this movie is like watching six or eight fantasy video game trailers in sequence. Jackson put much effort in creating 3D-worthy graphics but none in a story worthy to be told. The additions to Tolkien's Book feel contrived and unnecessary, bordering on ridiculous.The movies action has neither point nor focus. Especially (but not exclusively) the battle scenes feel drawn out and overlong. During the screening I saw, two people in my row actually fell asleep during the movie, proving that action for it's own sake is simply... tiring.Jacksons interpretation of The Lord Of The Rings was partly faithful as well as partly very far from the original source. Either way, one had the impression, that Jackson was driven to tell (his version of) this story. With The Hobbit, you get the expression that Jackson's only drive is to cash in. A pity.I won't say, that I'll avoid the coming parts two and three - I'll definitely wait for the budget DVD/Blu-Ray though.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Impossible requirements met,"I'm a die hard Tolkien fan who has read everything I got my hands into by the age of 15. I first picked LOTR when I was 10 and have been lost ever since into the undying lands, Valinor and middle earth.When I heard about the Hobbit airing, I was both excited and terrified. The previous 3 movies had been really good (the last 2 with some minor setbacks but tolerable) and I was really worried if the new movie could ever top those. Also the story itself is so very dear to me, I was honestly worried a bad movie might stain it to me forever. Also there is lore to the characters that are not in the hobbit book and yet they are significant to the story - of which leaving out would leave the story hollow. So I was having these really high requirements of what this movie should and shouldn't include, and was almost sure I got disappointed.Then the movie started. And I was in the Middle Earth once more.All my life I have considered books better than movies, simply because I believe no movie could ever top my imagination. Or even come close. It is - until the hobbit. I was at Bilbo's home, at all the other wonderful scenery.. I was with Bilbo and the dwarfs, and it was THAT good I forgot they were actors. I had to fight back tears because I was so happy. The hobbit is easily my favorite one of the movies (LOTR + this). For the longest time the Fellowship of the ring was the best one, but the hobbit easily takes the cake now.The only bad thing to say is that it takes too long for the next movie to air, and I can't WAIT to see more. This movie was worth the 10 year wait and I trust so will the part 2 to the Hobbit. So I wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A great experience (might contain minor spoiler),"After watching the premiere of ""the hobbit: an unexpected journey"", I could finally breathe out in relief, and know that The Hobbit trilogy is off at a good start. All in all, ""an unexpected journey"" is fantastic film which stays true to the nature of J.J.R Tolkien and his universe. The film does in fact go into a bit more detail and might contain some parts which were not added in the original novel ""the hobbit"", but never the less, it is a marvelous journey back to middle earth. The story was great compared with the novel, but it also stands strong alone as film. Some scenes and prologues might have large similarities with the LOTR trilogy, but nothing that hurts or compromises the movie. Fight scenes were well choreographed (in my opinion), but I feel that some fast paced scenes might get a bit blurry with the 3d and the animation. Dialogue is warm and familiar, while at the same time they manage to pull of the new ""not so elegant"" dialogue of the dwarfs. Martin Freeman has portrayed a very convincing Bilbo Baggins. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is strong and prominent as ever.It has a runtime of 169 minutes, which is a handsome but necessary amount of time for the fantasy genre. When it comes to the 3d experience, I was a bit skeptic at first, but know that the combination between 48fps and the 3d effects is stunning. Middle-earth is simply beautiful. The 3d does enhance the cinematic experience, but does not enhance the film experience. When it comes to critics discussing and claiming that ""an unexpected journey"" is just a dumbed down version of Lord of The Rings, please keep in mind that the atmosphere in novels ""The Hobbit"" and ""the Lord of The Rings"" are very different. ""The Hobbit"" was meant a children and young adult's book, while ""LOTR"" aimed for a bit older audience. This is because that ""LOTR"" both the novel and trilogy have a darker tone and feel to it and it is in fact a battle between good and evil. While in the ""Hobbit"" both the novel and the movie have a warm feel, and the journey is more personal. In other words, it is a fantastic film which brings joy and tension towards the audience. It Stays true to the novel ""The Hobbit"" and its atmosphere. Some scenes might feel a bit off or forced, along with some minor characters. Amazing cinematic experience, along with breath taking scenery. Fantastic story which leaves a warm feeling inside you long after the film is done. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Nothing less than expected from ""There and Back Again""","Young Bilbo is visited by Gandalf. He is invited on an adventure as he is very adventurous (for a Hobbit). After declining the offer he will be visited by a variety of characters and is coerced into a life of a burglar. Will he survive this life and will we after going on the journey with them? Watch and find out.This is the beginning of ""There and back again"" not worth viewing until you have the complete story in hand.The story starts with a token view of our original beloved characters by the original actors. An observation is that the story starts excruciatingly slow and takes a good chunk of time to get off the ground. Yet this may be on purpose as with any movie it is best to introduce the characters about to take the journey and their Hobbits... Oops, their habits.For people that are interested in technology as much as the story presented it may be premature to purchase anything for a while until all the different versions are sorted out. We already have Blu-ray and digital. And by the time you find this review probably 3D so we can watch a lame rabbit sled. Then there is the denser version of Blur-ray, probably another try of smell-o-vision, seat bottom vibrations, interactive conversations, etc.Avoid using rental services as they are using the crippled (missing all the DVD extras) rental version of the DVD.I can easily go two ways on this presentation. First, it tries to fit the general feel of the LOTR movies and the ""Hobbit"" book which is different. So this is more of a LOTR prequel.Having a lot of the same actors helped with consistency, as always, we must have new actors; yet that splits the viewers into the two camps of one's following the story and the other's saying this is not the same actors (good or bad). I suggest that it is worth a viewing to decide for yourself.I am glad to have had a shot at seeing this now and will again later after the second half is finished.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit An unexpected disappointment.,As a standalone movie The Hobbit is a good movie thats why i gave it a 7 but when compared to the LOTR movies it sucks the visuals are fake looking the big orcs and wolves are like cartoons and i watched it in 2D. The problem lies in the fact that Peter Jackson took years and years to plan and film the LOTR trilogy and it was obviously a labour of love for him in contrast The Hobbit seems rushed and the care and respect is not there. The result is not too much of a surprise really as peter Jackson always wanted Guillermo del toro to direct and only took the job when the pans labyrinth director removed himself this was a sure sign that his heart was never in it from the start. That being said i still enjoyed it and i am sure the younger audience who did not live through the build up and hype of the first trilogy will love it as they have nothing to compare it to. Also non film buffs will love it as they will not be fussy about the visuals and pacing of the story but the bottom line is when you create a world so perfect and loyal to the source material you can not then go on to expand on that universe with a lesser product and think no one is going to notice.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Let down for LOTR nerd,"As a huge LOTR trilogy fan, I set the bar on this movie pretty high to begin with, but it just didn't come close to where anyone should expect. I am not complaining about the story changes that many fans are, but about the production value of the movie itself. The LOTR trilogy had dragons, trolls, goblins and all other manner of creatures that looked spectacular, or at the very least sufficiently real to keep the viewer from loosing interest, but the special effects in The Hobbit were of very poor quality. All of these effects and characters looked very cartoonish and were a huge drag to the movie. One action scene looked like it was pulled straight out of an arcade game (you will know which one I am talking about when you see it). Also, the dwarf's characters were childish and poorly developed, and much of the dwarf acting was 'phoned in'. Don't go to this looking for LOTR. Go expecting LOTR meets Harry Potter meets the second Star Wars trilogy, because that is what you will get. I just hope that if Peter Jackson is picked for the new Star Wars, we will see production like we saw in LOTR and not this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Might have been an excellent film,"... if only it had not tried to blow a wonderful, short and sweet children's book up into an LOTR-style epic. While the commercial rationale for this explosion seems unfortunately clear enough, what was an adequate formula for Tolkien's epic of epics, which at the source is already a massive and dense trilogy, just doesn't cut it for the Hobbit. Indeed, it speaks for Jackson's undoubted genius that in spite of this formula for unmitigated disaster he still produced a film somewhat worth seeing.Some scenes such as the initial visit of the dwarfs are great, not to speak of the encounter with Gollum. All the makings of a great film are there. A true pity that Jackson did not opt to go for that one great film instead of three mediocre ones...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Almost as good as LOTR!,"In a hole in the ground, there was a Hobbit movie. It was not a poorly acted, disappointing film with poor special effects that make you laugh, nor yet a film that wasted its budget with overuse of CGI; it was a Hobbit movie, and that means happiness.
This film is the definitive on-screen retelling of the timeless tale. Seeing Gandalf return in the film, not to mention several other characters from LOTR, is amazing. Seeing Frodo's cameo in the beginning is astounding. The special effects are glorious and the scenery dazzling.
If they hadn't gotten Bilbo right, none of this would have mattered. But they did. I couldn't ask for a better Bilbo than the movie gave me, and doubtless many moviegoers think the same thing.

Welcome back to Middle Earth!,"Directed by Peter Jackson. Starring Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage. Written by: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro and J.R.R Tolkien."" True courage is not when to take a life. It's when to spare one""'Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen Dwarfs led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield.'Peter Jackson did a fantastic job with this film. His direction was great and he controls the story from beginning to end. His cinematography is amazing. As like his earlier trilogy of LOTR, there are plenty of panning crane shots as the characters travel and the camera usage during battle is nothing less than flawless. His efforts with the Gollum scenes were my particular favorites. I was astonished with the reactions I felt during the 'Riddle Game' between Bilbo Baggins and Gollum. Such a simple idea but my heart was pounding throughout. The mannerisms of Gollum, the atmosphere, the fear in Bilbo's eyes and the creeks and sounds from the background made this an excellent display. The CGI was exquisite in this film yet it brings out the only flaw in my opinion. There was more CGI usage than actual sets. That disappointed me. It stole the realism away from the film.The acting in this picture is excellent. Ian McKellen is once again great as Gandalf the Grey. I particularly enjoy watching McKellen portray the Grey version of Gandalf than the White used in the LOTR trilogy. The make-up and effects used to make the character younger was phenomenal. Another superb performance goes to Richard Armitage portraying Thorin. Through out the film, he is the Dwarf that brings the most discipline and leadership. He wants nothing but to retain his fallen kingdom. He thinks of Bilbo only as useless weight. He barely acknowledges him throughout the journey and has no faith in the hobbit, bringing him down inch by inch. Yet at the end, he shows his true colors. It's a notable transition.The score in this movie was it's strongest feature. There are many themes used from the LOTR trilogy that fit very nicely in the appropriate scenes. They also created a new sound for this film. Most particularly the Lonely Mountain theme. It fits perfectly in the crane shots used to follow the characters march onward and as the Dwarfs are in battle.In the end, this motion picture isn't on par with the LOTR trilogy but it's a magnificent film in it's own right. A must see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The story of the adventures of an important hobbit,"""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was released in 2012, and Peter Jackson, the author of the cinematic trilogy about the Lord of the Rings, sat down in the director's chair again. This is an exciting start to an epic story that takes you back to the world of Middle-earth. The film skillfully combines the magic, adventure and familiar atmosphere that are so beloved in The Lord of the Rings, while offering a new look at the history preceding the great battle for the Ring.One of the most interesting aspects of ""Unexpected Journey"" is how Peter Jackson and his team were able to transform a relatively small book by J. R. R. Tolkien into a large-scale trilogy. The fact is that the original on paper is no bigger than any of the books from the trilogy about the Lord of the Rings. But if each film of the original saga conditionally adapted one book, then ""The Hobbit"" was literally stretched into a new whole trilogy. It was not an easy decision, but it allowed us to explore the world and characters more deeply, add new storylines and introduce episodes that are only mentioned in the book. As a result, we get not just an adaptation, but a full-fledged cinematic journey that captivates and immerses us in history. However, sometimes it still seemed to me that the picture was somewhat stretched in time.The film attracts not only with its visual effects, but also with its attention to detail. Jackson once again demonstrates his masterful work with sets, costumes and makeup, creating a world that feels alive and filled with history. The scenes in the Bag End, meetings with dwarves, a journey through mountains and forests - all this looks impressive and authentic, which makes the viewer completely immerse himself in what is happening on the screen.The acting in the film is at the highest level. Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins coped with the task brilliantly. He brings not only comedic elements to the character, but also deep emotions, showing Bilbo's growth from a humble hobbit to a real hero. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf, and his wisdom and charisma once again become one of the main pillars of the plot. Do not forget about Richard Armitage, who perfectly embodied the image of Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of a group of dwarves, whose goal is to regain his kingdom. He doesn't look much like a bookish man, as for me, but the female half, I'm sure, was delighted. The actor is charismatic in his role.""Unexpected Journey"" also impresses with its battle scenes and stunning special effects. Battles with orcs, encounters with trolls, exciting chases - all this is done with the highest quality and attention to detail. The Gollum scene deserves special mention, where the viewer can once again enjoy the masterful performance of Andy Serkis, whose performance of this iconic character is consistently impressive.The musical accompaniment by Howard Shore, who has already become an iconic composer for films about Middle-Earth, once again adds epicness and emotional depth to the picture. The soundtrack perfectly highlights every moment, from quiet and touching scenes to grandiose battles.The first ""Hobbit"" is a worthy beginning of a new trilogy, which offers viewers not only a familiar, but also an expanded view of Tolkien's world. Despite the fact that initially the idea of making three films out of one book could have raised doubts, the result, in my opinion, justified itself. The audience enjoyed the cool story, and the creators made money and gave the world a great story. The film pleases not only fans, but also those who plunge into the world of Middle-earth for the first time, offering a rich adventure full of magic, dangers and unexpected alliances. It's a journey worth experiencing, and it promises to be as epic as what followed.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An uncomfortable journey,"Let me use the standard preface... I am a die hard Tolkien fan, and I loved the previous LOTR films. I still love the story, I'm not a fan of this film.The RED cameras shooting a massive 48fps made for hyper realistic filming which I felt was rather awkward for a fantasy film. I found action scenes video gamesque, while close ups had an almost doco feel. The picture quality was so refined it served to highlight any 'flaws' (which ordinarily would be unseen)- the makeup and costuming (wig seaming).Sweeping scenery reminiscent of the previous films is again breathtaking, but this time is in stark  contrast to the humanness of the actors. I felt pulled in and out of the world, never immersed enough to forget I was in a theater.For the positives- the score was amazing, at one point I closed my eyes and listened, possibly the most enjoyable part of the experience for me, second only to the Gollum scene. Andy Serkis brilliantly brought to life Gollum, emotive and complex, and by far the most well received scene/s of the film.It is worth a watch, but perhaps the technology is too advanced for this old tale?A wonderful story, but a long 3 hours lacking the authenticity I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

It's like trying to show the whole universe with 1 small Polaroid picture.The LOTR movies were all-in-all pretty good but The Hobbit (Part 1?) was a total disappointment.

a brilliant start to the trilogy,"Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit. And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed. This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie. On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here in fact the humour and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarfs, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive but what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarfs. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favourite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasising the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.There are some liberties taken with characterisation. Probably less than in The Lord of the Rings but the dwarfs in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarfs Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected. James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kili, Dean o Gorman as Fili and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo Baggins not Martin.This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it. Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

I cannot help watching this movie without wondering what the first trilogy could have been.,"And with that statement, I do not want to manage down the original Lord of The Rings trilogy, which most of us agree they are far superior than The Hobbit trilogy. However, the budget difference between both trilogies is mind boggling. The first trilogy had a budget of $300 million overall, all three movies combined. The Hobbit trilogy costed around $800 million dollars to make. This means that almost each Hobbit movie had all the budget of all LOTR movies combined. As I said, mind boggling. I sometimes wonder how the original trilogy would have turned out, with that budget. I any case, ""The Hobbit"" is another example of spending tons of cash does not make a good movie.Despite this, the Hobbit trilogy is a spectacle to watch, the story drags too much across the three movies and probably one single installment would have made more sense. However, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh managed to complement the original novel with bits and pieces of the LOTR books and the Silmarillion, making the next installment of the cinematic Tolkien Universe.This movie was panned down by critics. Overall, the trilogy amassed around $3 billion, exactly what the first trilogy did. I think the world is ready for more movies set in the Tolkien world. Do you know there is a TV show coming up, right? I cannot wait.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit: An Unexpected(ly Bad) Journey,"I don't have time for a full review, now - I'll try to add more later if I can, but I was majorly disappointed. My wife and I just finished re watching the full 12 hours of LotR to get back into Middle Earth, and enjoyed it immensely. After watching the Hobbit last night, I'm infinitely glad that it didn't get made first, because otherwise I may not have had interest in seeing LotR.The plot of the Hobbit is plodding, wandering, with a stated purpose that is never really explored, and motivation that is upheld by the weakest of threads. The special effects are no better - and maybe worse - than from 10 years ago, and the scenes that are meant to be light-hearted are just silly without being funny, while the scenes that are meant to be epic are so over-wrought as to stretch beyond the reasonable borders of suspension of disbelief. I can't count the number of times I thought (and by the end of the movie, said aloud) ""yeah, right, whatever"" when some other implausible battle scene occurs in which they escape from inescapable places just because the movie feels like they should. Gandolf seems to have no power, but then, at the moment where the script decides that maybe he should do something helpful, he can suddenly do whatever is required, only to be powerless 10 seconds later except to yell ""run!"" Or ""this way!"" How many times in one movie can one character strike a hero pose? I didn't count, because my fingers and toes don't go up that high, but maybe you can let me know when you watch Thorin throughout the movie. I get that he is supposed to be this film's Aragorn, but all he does is strike a ponderous pose with his hand on his hip. Also, Martin Freeman is supposed to be Bilbo, but all he does is take Arthur Dent to Middle Earth. Over and over again, you are expected to care for this fellowship of the poorly motivated random folk, and fear for them in increasingly implausible scenarios. In reality, each subsequent action scene made me care less and less: ""oh, here's another scene of inescapable death in which the bad guys will lose hundreds and one of the Dwarfs will walk away with a slightly bruised left patella that will heal by nightfall. Yawn."" I could go on.It isn't all bad - the music is spectacular, and fortunately is nearly omnipresent for the entire 600 hour running time of the film, and some of the panoramas and other sweeping cinematography is brilliant. Also, I genuinely belly-laughed a few times at some pretty good lines (hint: none of them came from the Dwarfs, whose lines were written by a six year old). Also, at one point Galadrial and Gandolf are talking by themselves. When you watch the film, imagine Galadrial giving Gandolf a shove. Given the nature of what they are saying this made me laugh out loud. The scene between Bilbo and Gollum is the best scene in the film, but unfortunately the sound is a little off, making it hard to hear and enjoy Gollum's riddles. I could have used more of that interaction and about an hour and a half less of the rest of the movieI have much more I could say, but I just don't have the time, so this will have to suffice. Any true fan of Middle Earth needs to see this film, but not because its a marvelous piece of filmmaking; rather, you should see it simply to feel immersed in Middle Earth once again: in other words to get your high. Lord of the Rings was the gateway drug, but as usually happens with drug dealers, they get you hooked, and then give you the watered- down junk.A barely passable and overlong movie that progresses at a plodding pace and repeatedly fails to deliver. Ultimately, it can't decide if it wants to be a children's book or a sweeping epic, and thus fails on both counts. It breaks my Middle Earth-loving heart, but this film only merits 5/10, and most of that for the fantastic score and the joy of being back in Middle Earth once more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

"A bit disappointing, IMDb rating is useless nowadays","I read both the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Hobbit. As many others have mentioned, the Hobbit is a pocket, maybe 1 tenth of the number of pages compared to the LOTR trilogy. So I feared the story would be weak, but watched it anyway, as IMDb viewers gave it a big 8. In the past that meant it should be a good movie, but nowadays it doesn't mean anything anymore. People in the cinema started talking to each other, not paying attention anymore, and although impolite, I don't blame them. The movie was boring. Mr Jackson should have made just one Hobbit movie. That would have been great, but not 3 times an almost 3 hour movie.Some of the 3D effects were nice, but some were also disturbing, for example, you see some guy sitting on a horse from close by, but you see half a horse coming out of the screen. The only good 3D movie i saw was avatar, and I'm afraid it will be one of the few.It's good that IMDb now have a critics review, I should have looked at that, and skip paying for seeing this movie in the cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An Unwelcome Gross-Out,"The owners of the film rights of Tolkien's legacy naturally hope that each new instalment they provide will satisfy every demographically analysed sub-section of the massive potential cash cow (I mean audience).So, in the case of the gentle children's volume ""The Hobbit"", what's it to be guys? A basically faithful-to-the-book rendition for old-fashioned types - like yours truly - who really only want its look and feel translated into visual format?A lavish family-friendly epic for casual admirers of the Tolkien 'franchise', with enough easy reference points to this 'back material' for the new 'product entry' to fit seamlessly into the whole?A 3-D Wide-Screen Tom-and-Jerry-cartoon-writ-large for the Video Game Generation, not overly concerned with plot, character, dialogue, coherence, dramatic tension, authenticity, or any other damn thing save 'awesome' special effects and bespoke cartoon violence?The sad answer: a mishmash of all the above. This handsome looking, unevenly paced, garishly sensationalist dog's dinner is much more of a nightmare than a dream come true for any real lover of Tolkien. Even those of them, such as me, who liked the LOTR films.Received wisdom has made us aware of the book's supposed shortcomings for modern adaptation. But has the hectic beefing-up of story, action scenes, back plot, character arcs/motivations etc. made things any better? Quite the reverse. Excessive tinkering has actually only served to show how well engineered the book was/is.To be scrupulously fair, there are still some traces of wit, beauty, a sense of wonder, not completely trampled into the mud. But enough of the structure and (crucially) feel of the book is annihilated, leaving an admirer of the original feeling depressed, angry and manipulated. And this syndrome unfortunately gets ever worse as the film progresses, meaning that, despite the occasional good bits, the final impression when leaving the cinema is very negative indeed.One senses a frantic, and toxic, combination of no-risk-taking combined with throwing-in-every-possible-kitchen-sink throughout. Any previously commercially successful star in the fantasy movie universe has to be referenced at all costs. Boyish knockabout slapstick; check ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". CGI superbeings slugging it out: check ""Transformers"". Simplistic racial conflict plot structure; check ""Avatar"". Generic quest narrative; check, er, ""Lord of the Rings"".Examples of manipulation, all periodically evident throughout the film's entire run time, include: crude signposting of every plot twist; every being's inner feelings and motivations exaggerated and rammed home; every dangerous situation amplified beyond rhyme or reason into the completely absurd, thereby destroying rather than enhancing dramatic tension; totally generic 'stirring' fantasy soundtrack music unsubtly underpinning the action to further stupefy the senses.Allotting specific blame on the director, or script writers, or producers, or backers of this pumped-up product for its artistic failure is futile. ALL the above, plus others, whatever their intentions at the outset, have combined in some unholy reverse alchemy to foist upon the world not a thing of beauty to be cherished forever (like the book), but rather a tasteless assault course for the senses, a crass base-metal reinvention of a golden literary creation.And – no, please, no – we're still only a third of the way through!Thoughtful fans of Tolkien, beware. Do not trust the positive reactions to this artefact from the sensation addicts who are evidently blinded by their dependence on cheap thrills. I don't care how depressingly numerous they are!

One must keep in mind that while 'The Lord of the Rings' was narrated by the protagonist of that story, Frodo, 'The Hobbit' was narrated by Bilbo, so the change in style was also a necessary one, in my opinion.After reading a lot of negative reviews about this film, I did not expect to be as invested in the story and this adaptation of my beloved Middle-Earth as much as I ended up being.

The visuals are absolutely incredible and it has that familiar LOTR feel that we all know and love. I couldn't quite give it a 10/10 for a few reasons. For one, there are so many characters that most of them have absolutely zero development whatsoever. Frodo gets more screen time than some of the dwarfs and that's really unfortunate. Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin are the focus of the film, as they should be, but the rest of the dwarfs are essentially filler in the movie. I don't know how Peter Jackson could've done this differently without making the movie even longer (and it's already about 3 hours) so it's really just the nature of the content that has trouble transitioning to film. Secondly, the feel, while similar to LOTR, doesn't seem as epic. When watching Lord of the Rings, even after already having watched it before, there's a sense of awe that this film doesn't quite capture to the same degree.

Nothing more than a long and boring picture book.,"I had high hopes for The Hobbit, after Peter Jackson, Warner Bros, and the NZ government sold off our labour laws for this $540,000,000 monster. Alas I was met with disappointment. For a start the 48fps made everything look false, ultimately giving off the sheen of a Syfy movie. It also exposed the overacting/movement of Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman, and dodgy polystyrene set pieces. The problem with stretching out a book as small as The Hobbit into three long films is stretching out the content. It felt like I was watching the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Hobbtannica) there was a lot of information we really didn't need to know. Nothing was left to the imagination and the bombardment of information, which did very little to progress any sense of plot or storyline, became very boring. While the songs were great (minus the repetitive score), the cheesy and usually pointless dialogue had me shaking my head. Andy Serkis as Gollum seems to bring the only sense of saviour to this film and I struggle to see how the next two will cope without him (if he isn't in them). Overall the humour was childish, It was boring despite being action packed, and I can't see this franchise sustaining my attention for the next two films. However I must say Weta Digital have done an outstanding job on the visual effects as always.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My amazing take on this Video (must read!),"Now, before I begin, I want you to feel where I am coming from.I have seen all the original films, (cartoon and Heavy Metal variants.) I have just finished reading a re-posted review from the guy who said The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkeen was a rip off of harry potter.This Movie was amazing.Now I've said my piece, I will actually be watching this film for the first time tomorrow.I hope you can conceive the level of humour required to understand the contemplative nature of this challenging, summary of a movie that I am yet to enjoy.Translation (for the simple.)dur. ugh good movie. what movie? ugh this one.Thank you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Abysmal,"Although The Hobbit was by far my favorite childhood book, Peter Jackson managed to turn it into the worst movie that I have ever seen. The movie was devoted only to the journey to the mountain, which did not need to be dragged out for three hours; rereading that portion of the book would have been faster than watching the movie. The Hobbit is a relatively short book compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so there was no reason to split it into three movies.Jackson left out the heart of the book, and instead got lost in the scenery and action scenes. If you're the type of person who likes picture books, then you'll love this movie. However, if you can actually read and are familiar with the elements of a story, then you'll feel like much was missing from this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't let the nay-sayers spoil your fun - How many chances do you get to be a kid again?,"When I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings as a result of wanting to know more about the story behind the 1977 animated special, I got a very clear picture in my head of what a live-action movie would look like. I've gazed at Alan Lee and John Howe artwork through the years, played Middle-Earth Roll Playing (MERP), and collected graphic novels, still wondering if a descent movie would ever be made (or in the case of the Ralph Bakshi attempt, completed). Finally, December of 2001 arrived and I was able to see the vision that I'd carried in my head for so long given life when I sat spellbound for three whirlwind hours with a smile stretched across my face.I'm not a Peter Jackson disciple, okay. I thought King Kong sucked eggs. But Jackson and his small group of writers were able to do what no one had ever done before. First of all, they made a movie about a treasured classic that most of the fans appreciated. But more importantly, they were able to talk the studios into letting them handle each book in the Rings trilogy as a separate movie and film them all at once. Obviously, it payed off. Most of the story was kept intact as each film stretched for three-plus hours, not to mention the sprawling uncut versions that would be released on DVD.Jackson's vision was so successful that he was able to perform yet another feat when it came time to pitch The Hobbit: he turned one book into three movies. I saw the first of the new trilogy and was again awed by the attention to detail and the love of the material. Jackson loves these stories, folks. He went to bat this time to tell the full story without having to edit a thing. So far, I have not been disappointed by the omission of anything. He's got nine hours in which to tell the story of The Hobbit. The book is only a little over 300 pages, for crying out loud.So, in order to keep from cutting any of the parts we know and love, Jackson had to sample tales and characters from other Tolkien Middle-Earth works to move the story at the right pace. How else are you going to split a novel into thirds, people? Where is a good cut-off point for the end of the next movie-Bilbo sneaking into the Lonely Mountain and seeing the dragon? Sure, fans will love that! Jackson had to take a piece of a book and reshape it into a mini-story that would provide all the elements of a good movie: setting, conflict, plot, characters, and theme.I will say, however, that some of the battle scenes were almost impossible to differentiate from those of the LOTR. Also, there were just so many ""saved in the nick of time"" moments I rolled my eyes once.Needless to say, I don't agree with the uproar about the differences between the novel and the movie so far. All the things I wanted to see were there, and then some. I suspect it will be the same in the next two. I will set quietly for three hours again and again, staring at the screen and feeling once again like I'm twelve and carefree and adventure is around every corner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Wonderful Return to Middle-Earth,"If any of you are at all skeptical of the smallish book being made into three feature length films, cast your doubts aside. Jackson took the classic novel, and expanded upon it. While the book was a fun ride, the first film in the trilogy takes it to a whole new depth. The story is adapted beautifully, with enough added detail and back story to provide a fun filled ride. There was barely a slow moment once the story began, and at the end it didn't feel like a (nearly) three hour film at all. Like the Lord of the Rings films, Jackson did a fantastic job of bringing the viewer into the world of Middle Earth. Within the first few minutes I was already in awe of the beautiful and elaborate sets that the characters are placed in. The cinematography is decent, although many shots seem reminiscent of Jackson's earlier films. I was nervous about how Martin Freeman would portray such a beloved character and the uncle of Frodo, but I was convinced that he was the right choice just a few minutes into the film. Bilbo isn't the typical story book hero to begin with, but Freeman brought emotion into the character, and I felt attached to him instantly. Overall, let's just say I plan on seeing it again within the next week. A must see, especially for fans of the previous Lord of the Rings films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantastic return to Middle-earth.,"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a fine return to form for director Peter Jackson. Guillermo del Toro, who's one of the writers for the film, was initially supposed to direct but he left the project in May of 2010. If this first film in the new fantasy trilogy is a sign of what's to come I certainly look forward to seeing The Desolation Of Smaug and There And Back Again. As Gandalf the Grey says at the beginning of the film this is an adventure. Ian McKellen is just as good as ever in his role as the wizard. Maybe he's even better than before since I found his character more likable. While watching the film I didn't at all doubt that he is Gandalf. Martin Freeman is excellent as well in the role of Bilbo Baggins. He does well with his character's insecurity and the humor, which comes often in the course of the film. At first Bilbo is clearly reluctant to get involved in the adventure but after everything that happens he manages to prove his importance to the company. The company of dwarfs is well realized, just like everything else. Richard Armitage expresses authority as Thorin Oakenshield. Every dwarf has a distinct look and personality. The special effects are impressive too. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy has special effects that look good even now but in The Hobbit it's clear from the beginning that CGI improved in ten years. The look of every creature is impressive and even terrifying. This is especially noticeable with Gollum (Andy Serkis), who now looks completely realistic. Some people questioned Jackson's decision to make a trilogy out of one book, expressing that there's not enough material for this. It's not really a problem however. In Jackson's hands the film doesn't lose steam until the very end and the grandeur is still there, made clear from the very begging when Bilbo describes Thror's rule of the Lonely Mountain. The running time is 169 minutes but it seems much shorter because there isn't really a dull moment. Like I mentioned before the acting is impressive. Of note is Sylvester McCoy's appearance as Radagast the Brown. The Hobbit doesn't have the sense of drama of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy yet it's a perfect prequel. I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
3hours long.. so good it seemed to last far less.  Brilliant,"Its 3 hours long, just about, but its brilliant. They seemed to have taken what was good from LOTR and made the Hobbit a lot better. Critics don't seem the like the movie. I found it fantastic and very well made. The whole scene with Gollum was very true to book and well done. Music was amazing. Anyone who goes to see the movie knows what they are going to expect, who hasn't read the hobbit as a child, so the story was not going to be new. But they did exceed my expectations with the movie. Storyline was well done and very very detailed, which is important if you are a Tolkien fan. I could not fault the movie, my only regret I did not see in 3d as it would have been better, but we don't have in our area. See it... well worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Epic with great CGI!,"Review: What an epic movie! I was lucky that I had something to do, because I definitely would have fallen asleep whilst watching the film. Anyway, I wasn't a big fan of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy so I wasn't overly excited about this movie. I loved the parts with Gollum and some of the CGI looked amazing, but I did lose interest in the film. I suppose that was my fault because I didn't really know who was who. To be honest, it just seemed like Peter Jackson wanted to show off what he can do, which will make everyone rush to the cinema to see the whole trilogy. Watchable!Round-Up: It's obvious that Peter Jackson is going to milk this franchise for what he can get because with 3D technology and the extended Blu-Rays, he will definitely be able to retire. I don't know how close this film was to the books so I can't really comment on the storyline, but I would have liked an actor with more charisma in the leading role. Galdolf did kick ass but it was Gollum that done it for me.Budget: $250million Worldwide Gross: $1billionI recommend this movie to everyone that was into The Lord Of The Rings franchise. 6/ 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Nutshell Review: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"Peter Jackson again took some liberties with the narrative that may irk the purists around us. Some may deem it serious departures from Tolkien's intent and sequence, such as the party's capture by three Trolls amongst others, but I suppose for a film to move things along, and translate effectively from print to screen, these decisions had to be done, in addition to coming up with story-arcs that ups the ante for action, since the first third of the book didn't have much to boast of. But these changes were judiciously applied and I thought effective for the film to gather and introduce a little more background and material, to show how expansive Tolkien's universe actually was, and set to get larger when all the completed films get put together.What also worked was Jackson's filling of the gaps each time Gandalf disappears in the story, which in the film was a reason to re-assemble thespians such as Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving to reprise their roles, in what would be another over-arching sub plot that sounds out the mysterious developments in Middle Earth revolving around a necromancer, that I'm sure many fans would appreciate additional easter eggs pointing to what's to come. Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins also makes an appearance, in what would be Peter Jackson's way to ease into The Hobbit, sowing the seeds for any viewer in future to link up everything together. With pictures already leaked on more recurring characters, one waits with bated breath how it all gets uniquely intertwined.Otherwise, this was essentially The Fellowship of the Ring part 2, where instead of a mixed fellowship consisting of hobbits, a dwarf, an elf, a wizard and many humans, this one was predominantly dwarfs led by their de-facto leader Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who have gathered together, mentored by Gandalf, and introduced to the 14th member of their squad, the reluctant Bilbo Baggins. In a promise of adventure, the true quest here is to recover the legendary kingdom of Erebor at the Lonely Mountain, which the dragon Smaug had massacred dwarfish ancestors and had taken over all of their land and riches. Thinking that Smaug, being unseen for years, could be dead, or time they'd get their act together to take back what's dwarf legacy, this becomes the main objective and plot of the film, in addition to common themes covered such as friendship.The similarities between the earlier movies and this one cannot be more pronounced. Take away the deliberate, creative aspects, this felt very much like Fellowship of the Ring 2, albeit with a new team and new objective altogether. Thre's this sense of deja vu, whether be it fight scenes in the underground mines of Moria, or being pursued by Orcs and their wolf-dogs, that you'd wonder how else the filmmakers could have deviated or innovated with something new, rather than cutting too close to what many would have already be fairly familiar with. Granted that themes are universal in nature, but this translation to the screen could have been a little bit more varied - do we need another archer in a dwarf to compensate for Legolas' absence, or filler scenes such as the many sweeping shots of landscapes?I was initially a little apprehensive with Martin Freeman being Bilbo Baggins, but I'm glad to be proved wrong through his superb performance, in perfect balance to bring out those small town principle and values and applying them to the extraordinary situations he finds himself in, making him truly the accidental hero many times over, and drawing us in to this wildcard of a team member within the company of dwarfs. It doesn't matter if one is the smallest or most inexperienced, that it's what inherently inside that counts and inspires. As Gandalf had put it, his choice for the last member of the company is puzzling, but somehow Bilbo gives him courage, which gets proved time and again through the narrative, which I hope to see more of in the following films.And of course, holding this film together like glue as we get acquainted with the ensemble, is Ian McKellen reprising his role. We get to see more of Gandalf the Grey at his element, shrewd and sly to aid his cause and motives amongst the company, serving as the strong link between two eventual trilogies. Richard Armitage provided his Thorin with natural leadership and charisma, whose development later in the story will almost definitely be heart-wrenching given where the film here had left off in his established friendship with Bilbo. As for the other dwarfs, well, too many and too few screen time for most meant that it's unfortunate they remain in the background, save for a handful played by Ken Stott, Aidan Turner and Dean O'Gorman. Perhaps the other personalities will shine in the forthcoming films.Being the first film of the trilogy, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, was quite expected in the way things turned out, by playing it safe, adopting a narrative structure similar to The Fellowship of the Ring in its build up, having familiar characters return to the table to provide that level of comfort for audiences returning to Middle Earth, before and hopefully, finding its feet and tangent off on its own as we got left with the usual cliffhanger involving gazing into the horizon, promising a lot more. The Misty Mountains song, already lyric by Tolkien himself in the book, will prep you with goosebumps each time it's sung, by the dwarfs or during the end credits, or when it serves as the broad theme in the soundtrack, lending prominence to the objective charted out for the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a good film and in my mind is receiving to may negative reviews that it dose not deserve.,"First off I have heard a lot about pacing and that the movie is too long. This is true, but not in a bad way. Many critics have criticized the movie's beginning for being too long and that Bilbo takes much longer than needed to get out of the Shire, but I disagree I feel this is one of the strongest parts of the film. You really get to see a hobbits life style, and you get to know your main character Bilbo Baggins. Then the dwarfs come in and you get to know them and what they are like, you begin to understand and connect with their journey Which I might add is important for this and any film. Normally if you don't connect or at least understand your main characters the film sucks. And I feel that the dialogue in this movie is its strongest part and has a lot going for it.The problem with this film is the pacing, and the action. I think they could of left a lot of the action on the cutting room floor. If it had been just a tad bit shorter, say 10/ 15 minuets I would of given it a much better grade But I believe they had plenty of dialogue scenes that were perfect.However I cannot stress how well written this film is. My absolute favorite scene in the movie was the one with Gollum, it was pure movie magic. All I have to say on the subject is that the two characters, Martin Freeman(Bilbo)and Any Serkis (Gollum) have great stage chemistry and the animation is the best I have ever seen. It is hilarious when you Gollum's face, and you really love his character.Now I need to talk about the action, which is good, but too long at points. Now this movie was filmed for 3D. Most 3D films don't make use of it at all, but just by watching it in 2D, I got a feeling that a lot of the action and exploding things would of looked terrific in 3D, and that is why I will watch it again in that format (specifically IMAX).As for the casting and actors,each brings something to this world and makes it better. You don't really get to know half of the dwarfs but that's all right with me, because I realize having 13 dwarfs in a movie you are not going to be able to learn all about each one. But you do get to know about half of them, and each has his own oddity that makes them unique. Gandalf is amazing, he is emotional, insightful funny and just plain epic all the rest of the time, I am positive nobody else could play that role. Pure perfection.Some people have compared the character Radagast the brown to the completely stupid brain child of George Lucas, Jar Jar Binks. Which I think is totally unjustifiable. First off you hardly ever see this character, and he actually feeds into the story, of the great middle earth and the begins the fight against evil.As for the trilogy part of the movies, I now trust Peter Jackson (the director) completely to make the next two films even better by listening to the criticism. Am I like how at the end they give you a little teaser, to (really) really really want to come back for more, all I am going to say is that the ending is very good & very LOTR like. The only really bad part of this film is its length. However I would put it just about equal with the 'Fellowship of the Ring' in my mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson has done it again!,"I personally think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the epitome of film-making of the last 10 years. For three consecutive years, I turned myself in a rabid fanboy of everything LOTR, source literature included. I was delighted to find out that Peter Jackson had taken it upon himself to turn the prequel of LOTR, The Hobbit, into a new trilogy. I was a bit sceptical at first, but I have to say, Jackson has done it again. The Hobbit is a marvellous fantasy movie of epic proportions that could only have been made by Jackson and the likes.In short, I thought The Hobbit was absolutely spectacular. Every single frame, every location and every character has been brought to life with such imagination and love for the source material. The movie looks fantastic from beginning to end. I saw it in HFR 3D and although I found the viewing experience a bit jarring at first, it grew on me very quickly and I was completely accustomed to it after an hour. Everything is smooth and the HFR effect is definitely noticeable during action scenes with a lot of panning movement from the camera. Sometimes I even forgot I was looking at a movie. The 3D was also implemented very well. Subtle at times, but engrossing when it needed to be. Viewing The Hobbit is a mesmerising experience and I was entranced all the way through. The Hobbit definitely feels different from LOTR. The focus of the story is on the 13 dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf who set out on a quest to reclaim a treasure that was taken from the Dwarfs by the dragon Smaug, who destroyed their hometown in the process. It is a different scale from that of LOTR, in which entire Middle Earth was at war with Sauron and the fate of every race depended on the outcome of Frodo's journey. However, The Hobbit doesn't feel any less epic. Jackson took some liberty with the source material and added characters that are only present in other Tolkien stories, or he added scenes himself completely. The story takes a lot of time to get going, but I felt that every scene needed to be in the movie and some minor pacing issues aside, the story in The Hobbit is a fantastic ride from start to finish. Seeing some characters reprise their roles from LOTR felt like welcoming an old friend.Another compliment flies out to Howard Shore, who once again outdid himself with the composition of the soundtrack. It was nice to hear some themes make a welcome return and the new main theme is nothing short of epic and bombastic and it returned a lot of times during the movie, be it in a lot of different renditions. I found the soundtrack to be a bit less memorable than the one in LOTR, but I loved it nonetheless. It even makes for some nice listening outside of the movie. The soundtrack should be an instant buy for anyone who enjoyed the music of Shore in the LOTR films.All in all I find it hard to fault The Hobbit in any way, shape or form. If I had to name one negative remark about the movie it would have to be that I think that the fellowship of Dwarfs could have been fleshed out better. We only really get to know Thorin Oakenshield. It is even hard to remember the names of the other 12 dwarfs, they are mostly just along for the ride. I massively enjoyed myself during the entire duration of the movie. I felt something I hadn't felt since The Retun of the King in 2003 - a sense of utter bewilderment, amazed by the things that are shown to you on screen. A feeling of adventure that marks the years of our youth. The Hobbit is an accomplishment of rare proportions and I will be there next year for The Desolation of Smaug and the year after that for There and Back Again. I absolutely can't wait.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Cutting Edge in Cinema Technology!,"I will not review the story because if you are interested you already know it. With one word the film is awesome!What is new are 3 things: 1. 3D 2. High Frame Rate - 48 frames per second shooting and projection. 3. Shot on video with the Red camera.The 3D is awesome! I think it add to the movie a lot.The 48 Frames per second is awesome - no longer you will see annoying flicker and jitter on a moving shots! I still would like to see even faster frame rates as the ideal is 72, which creates the ultimate immersive experience.My problem is video look (in some scenes)of the film that is sometime very pronounced - especially on the bright scenes. People call this too realistic, I call this to synthetic, plastic and divorced of reality look. It is so because it reminds them of the bad video they shot with their own VHS tape. Too real they say. I say not even close to reality... I fully blame for this the inability of the Red camera to reproduce highlights properly, and its miserable performance with skin tones. Also, because of the video compression and low qantalizalion the tonal gradation has suffered - especially in the more natural scenes. The scenes where they have done heavy, stylized color correction are better.In conclusion I think it would have been better to shoot on 65mm film for the better look. On the other hand shooting 3D at 48 frames per second with two bulky film cameras might have been impossible, so the compromise of shooting on video. Maybe they had to use a better camera than Red...Anyway the best way to see it is in HFR, 3D, IMAX.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
impressive,"and this is not a surprise. because it reflects passion of Jackson for story. and it is not exactly an adaptation - spirit of novel has as root extraordinary vision of director. only problem - it seems be strange as part of trilogy. and this ambition makes film to long and , for few fragments, confuse. it is only a novel for children. the dream of Jackson makes it more. but before this problems, it is the joy. the pure joy of public and actors and the meeting with few old friends heroes. fight scenes, monsters and gnomes are really beautiful. so, a delight. spectacular, nice and epic. sure, it is not Lord of Rings. but its chances to be are not little.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"I liked it, but...","That's sadly mainly because of my enjoyment to be back in the universe by Tolkien on screen. There was another IMDb-reviewer here who called it ""enjoyable but flawed"", and that is exactly what it is. I gave it an 8/10 because I loved to be back in the world of Tolkien and Jackson but as a movie it isn't more than a 6, and here's why:It seems to me that Jackson was too interested in portraying the appendices. Remember that the Lord of the Rings was adapted into a modern classic in 11 hours (in the extended versions) and The Hobbit is a book somewhere around 10 times shorter. Why don't just adapt it into one film 160 minutes in the theatrical version and then go for a 200 minutes (or so) extended cut? Then he probably could've found a way to adapt the appendices as a link between The Hobbit and LotR for next Christmas. If the second movie had become a failure as a result of difficulty in doing so, at least we would've had a great movie about The Hobbit in stead of three somewhat more or less mediocre. I can't see a way the two next ones can avoid the same narrative problem.The problem is that unlike LotR, it is only an enjoyable experience for the Tolkien-fans, not others, because it simply isn't great. The narrative doesn't fit together, it feels like more action than Tolkien and a breaking point in such a lightweight novel is wrong. This movie will sustain Tolkien fans, not increase them, as the great previous trilogy did.Still, some of its parts are great. I loved the riddle-scene with Gollum as well as most of what happens before the unexpected journey, and I can't say it wasn't fun seeing the White Council at work even though it is part of the destruction of the Hobbit-story. It fits in my vision about an appendices-movie.Conclusion: Reviewed from the perspective of a film-enthusiast, which I am, it is a 5 or a 6 for the reasons mentioned above. It isn't cinematic greatness in other aspects than the wrapping (visually). For a starved Tolkien enthusiast it is a 9, also for the reasons above. Together it is a 7,5 for now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

Technologically sophisticated and entertaining,"This first Hobbit movie follows the plot of the first half of the book more or less faithfully. If you are wondering - as I did - how Jackson is going to make three movies out of one book, it's by including everything: the good as well as the ridiculous, and supplementing it with a back story out of the appendices of the Lord of the Rings.While the plot seems at times disjointed, and people next to me complained that ""nothing much happens for a long time"" it is still (not) happening in Middle-Earth and very much worth seeing. The screenplay is at times subtle, at times very in-your-face. Overall, despite containing dark themes and scenes, the movie is much more lighthearted than Lord of the Rings (as the book was), and the scenery is much more epic than the plot itself.In 3D, the movie suffers from the same weaknesses as other 3D titles, occasional blurring and center brightness. However colors are still vibrant and at 48 frames per second, the movie is extremely immersive.Final verdict: 7/10 for the movie, 9/10 for the technology.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"

There were a lot of parts that were added and changed but I can understand why it had to be done, the Hobbit did not have as many defining moments as did LOTR.

Another groan-inducing pathetic money-grab typical of Hollywood,"This was a terrible, boring movie with all the awful comic relief, one-liners, and cartoonish, over-the-top retarded action typical of brain-dead Hollywood blockbuster garbage. The magic of the original trilogy is gone, replaced by Phantom Menace stupidity. This is a movie not even worth watching once, except for the only highlight, which is the riddling contest between Bilbo and Gollum--the rest of the movie is pointless drivel.I almost fell asleep so many times only to open my eyes to yet another groan-inducing action scene or musical number. The Goblin King looks like Jar-Jar Binks on acid with a skin condition and goiter and about as much intelligence and personality. The three trolls behave like the Three Stooges. You only see Smaug the dragon for a few seconds and the Necromancer for less than that. Radagast the Brown is a crazy magic mushroom-tripping wizard with bird-poop running down his face and crusted to his beard who drives a magic sled pulled by giant bunny rabbits. Retarded!!! Hated all the new annoying characters except the main dwarfs (Thorin, Balin, and Dwalin, IIRC). Bilbo didn't get to do much. Other characters (Elrond, Galadriel, Saruman, Frodo) have pointless cameos and add zero to the story, just drag the unendurable running time out even further. There's some lame attempt to connect this story to the Lord of the Rings, but that amounts to a couple lines in a boring round-table conversation between the cameo cast.Despite all the stupid action, nobody on the team ever dies or is in any real danger as they get saved at the last minute by Gandalf every time things don't go their way. So there's zero suspense. The action is so impossible to believe at times that it makes most cartoons look realistic by comparison. I suppose it's better than the god-awful Phantom Menace (which also only had one cool scene with Darth Maul's fight), but not by much. It feels like a parody of the original LotR trilogy. Shame on everyone involved for drinking the Kool Aid and signing off on this pathetic money-grab.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A joy to watch,"I'm a big fan of Tolkien and I am really glad to see the Hobbit on the screen; nonetheless, I have to say turning the Hobbit into a trilogy is not a flawless idea. I believe two films would have been much better. Jackson made the right decision to connect the Hobbit story to the long war of Dwarfs and Orcs and the background Middle-earth story of the White Council and the appearance of Necromancer/Sauron in Dol Goldur. Even with this rich background story,two films would have done justice. And for big fans, like me, the fine, excellent bits could find their way in the extended editions. You finish the Unexpected Journey and you find that you haven't reached the 100th page in the Hobbit book. No line has been missed.SPOILERS FROM HEREThough boring to some, telling all the details had its interests for many, including me. The prologue about Smaug's attack on Dale, the White Council in Rivendell, Radagast's visit to Dol Goldur and Bilbo's game of riddles with Gollum, which I think was the shining spot of the film. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis stand out in the whole film. The acting was great, but except for Thorin and Balin, the rest of the Dwarfs lacked any depth in character. The music and the scenery were great too, as expected.SPOILERS ENDEDIn short, I think all the Tolkien fans and all those who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings films would like the Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey, though they should not expect an epic as grand as LOtR.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Do not listen to the critics on this one..... Go see it!,"Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I'm, in general, a sucker for critics' reviews. I'm like that friend of yours who refuses to see a movie at the theater unless it has a minimum of a 70% rating on rottentomatoes or metacritic. Well, I'm glad I wasn't overly beholden to this rule for The Hobbit.I thoroughly enjoyed my viewing experience from start to finish. I was in a small town whose only theater offered it in 3d but not the high frame rate version, so I can't really comment on that. However, the movie looked great. Yes, CGI was abundant but I didn't feel that it distracted from the overall feel of the movie. After all, it is a fantasy-based movie, so I believe one must give some leeway for the lack of realism. Also, while some may argue that the plot was thin, you must consider that we have only seen 1/3 of the whole story, as this three part-er is based on a sole book.In conclusion, I was highly pleased with part one of The Hobbit. It may not have risen to the greatness of the LOTR trilogy, but it still met or exceeded my expectations, especially in-lieu of many of the critics' reviews out there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Very Good Welcome Back To Middle Earth!,"When I was growing up the lord of the rings was being released and because I was young I didn't really get the full enjoyment out of Lord of the Rings due to the fact I couldn't get into the movie as I didn't understand most of it. So when I heard Peter Jackson was doing the hobbit, for the past year I have been umming and areing if I should actually go and watch this film. But I decided it would be good to go as this is the start of the whole story. And I was completely blown away by this film. It was so good to return to middle earth and now because I am a lot older I could really enjoy the just amazing story and the jaw droppingly beautiful scenery. It is a long film but your money is just so worth it. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is just perfect, he really connects with the character, and I have to say this is one of his best performances ever! A utterly fabulous film which ends so well, it will be torture waiting a whole year for the next one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Exactly what Peter Jackson said it would be, and more!","I truly don't understand all the hate for this movie. I know there are intentional haters like die-hard Nolan fans (one of my best friends is a HUGE Nolan fan, but not this intense) who are purposely disliking any other movie this year just to let Dark Knight Rises win awards. There are those who are unaware of Peter Jackson including information from the Appendices in Return of The King as extra material (shouldn't really be news, but some people live under a rock) and say that he's adding material just for $$$ when clearly, Jackson has a huge admiration for Tolkien, and then there are those who prefer fancy art films, which is fine.Don't get me wrong, I like The Dark Knight Rises, and I can appreciate the art films, but when a movie is good, a movie is good. Growing up, The Fellowship of the Ring changed my goals and dreams, and put me on a path to go into film, now, 11 years later, ""An Unexpected Journey"" continues to drive that passion and desire.I've read the book 1,000 times over (along with LOTR) and what some people don't seem to understand is that it's a CHILDREN'S book. It was written that way. Professor Tolkien went to re-write it to make it more like LOTR in terms of depth and tone, but never did, thus, the Appendices.Peter Jackson set out to recreate the magical world, with less of a dark and serious tone, and did so, but at the same time, kept some of the things that made LOTR dark. There is light humour throughout the film sure, and I loved every minute of it, but when it's time to get serious, it does exactly that. The battle sequences are intense, and very large in terms of scale. Not one moment of it was boring.Another thing I don't understand is that people say it's slow? That's called character development. This isn't a mindless action/adventure movie where things just happen to look cool. If it happens, there's a reason for it, for characters to grow, and for us to feel attached to them. For me, it worked.I went in expecting to appreciate all of the Dwarfs, but not single anyone out. Turns out, I left loving Thorin, Kili, Balin and Bofur the most. Gandalf is still the sly, intelligent wizard he was in the Lord of The Rings trilogy, and Martin Freeman as Bilbo, is perhaps the single greatest casting decision I've ever witnessed. I was worried, I'll admit it, but having seen the film now, he was perfect to play a younger Ian Holm.The sets are another great aspect. It's all the same. The Shire, Bag End, Rivendell, and even the exterior of Moria (Won't spoil) A new set piece that was amazing was Dale/Erebor (The Lonely Mountain) which was incredible. The CG/Miniatures for all of the sets too work incredibly well, especially with the 48fps 3D, which brings me to my next point.I saw it in 48fps, and was blown. Away. Entirely. Oh my. I knew it was different, I heard it was bad, and heard it was good. But I like to form my own opinions. 48fps (or HFR, High Frame Rate) makes the 3D work so well, you forget you're even watching a movie. Every inch of Middle Earth was right there in front of me for 2 hours and 44 minutes, and was it ever gorgeous. I know people aren't fond of it, but for The Hobbit to be the first movie done in 48fps and to look that good, and then to improve on it, is incredible. I really don't know if I could watch this at 24 now because of how much I loved the 48 experience.The CG wasn't bad either, the HFR adds to it, making it smooth, and less noticeable as CG, which was amazing. The score? Well, it's Howard Shore, so it's obvious that it was perfect for the film.All in all, if you enjoyed LOTR, you will most likely enjoy The Hobbit. I'm off to my second viewing in a few hours, and it certainly won't be my last before it leaves theatres.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An exciting film that struggles to come out of the shadow of the Lord of the Rings,"I went into the cinema with a vague sense of weariness. I have heard many reports that this film is mediocre, too long and badly shot. In all three cases, the warnings were wrong. The Hobbit is a great cinematic experience and a cracking family adventure that is true to the original style of J.R. Tolkin's book.The most vocal of the complaints about this film, has been the decision to film it at 48 frames per second. At no point did I feel the filming technique was detrimental to the film. Unlike some, I never felt the film looked like a 'made for T.V' movie. Nor did the film ever feel too long, or bloated. The 168 minutes of this film passed in the blink of an eye, though some of the scenes did make me feel like I was watching the Directors Cut.The film also never felt mediocre, the vast majority of the film is terrifically exciting and fun. Peter Jackson has excelled in adding a few embellishments to the original story. The scenes with Gandelf, Saruman, Elrond and Galadriel were excellent, and have set up the possibility of an intriguing side story that chronicles the rise of Sauron. The inclusion of Ganadalf's cousin Radagast (ignored in the LOTR's trilogy) was also a worthy inclusion to the film.There is however, some disappointing aspects to this film. Perhaps most disappointing is the soundtrack. The score uses rehashed music from LOTR, and in the few cases that it doesn't, the music is instantly forgettable. There is also a lack of the stunning set designs that were so breathtaking in the previous trilogy. Scenes where the Fellowship of the Ring see the 'Great Halls' in the Mines of Moria, or the mammoth stone watchmen after they leave the Galadriel's realm, are sadly lacking in the hobbit. There are still some lovely panoramic views of the enchanting landscape however.Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this film is the scene with the goblins in the Misty Mountains. I feel that the whole encounter has been badly misjudged. Worst of all is the head goblin, his character belongs in a Harry Potter movie, not within the world of Tolkin. Although the Hobbit, as a novel, was far lighter than LOTR, I remember the encounter in the Misty Mountains as being eerie and exciting. In the film, the whole scene (apart from Bilbo's encounter with Golum) is just daft.The biggest problem the Hobbit has, is that it has been filmed after the masterpiece of LOTR. Had LOTR not yet been done, this film, I'm certain, would have received wholly positive reviews as a family classic. The problem is, The Hobbit cannot escape the expectation placed on it from the previous trilogy, which are considered by many to be three of the best films ever made. The Hobbit is not a classic, but it is almost three hours of terrific fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Subpar to the Nearly Perfect Original Trilogy,"There are two separate things I want to touch upon in this review. First is how it feels to return to Middle Earth and sit through yet another epic 2 hour 50 minute journey. The other is my reaction to watching a ""film"" in HFR (48 frames per second). I have not read the Tolkien novels, and didn't find that a problem when watching the original LOTR Trilogy. First of all, it was pleasant to feel that I was watching a production that was in good hands. The pacing (except for about two spots) was energetic, the dialogue and acting successfully avoiding cliché. The period of time spent with Bilbo reluctantly setting off on an adventure was drawn out way too long. I'm sure it is verbatim to the novel, but is obvious that a lot of this slow story development would have been streamlined with a more agreeable running time in mind (save it for the special DVD release). Not being familiar with the novel, I was finding myself being whisked along for the ride (once it gets started). There is intelligence in the creatures they encounter, and consistent backstory with all the elves and dwarfs and orcs and so on.There are a few more extended dialogue scenes, that on a normally disciplined running time, would have been trimmed to avoid the dullness of exposition.As much as I was mildly interested in this prequel for the content, I was more eager to witness what may be the birth of a new era in film presentation. Digital theatres will sometimes feature programming shot and presented in video (Metropolitan Opera for instance), with a totally different look. For the first time since silent movies changed from 15 frames per second to 24, there is a new barrier being broken. Video runs at 30 frames per second, so this new 48 frame format bests even the 'live' look of normal video as compared to the look of film. I took a survey of movie reviews to find out the reaction to the HFR showing. Most of the reviews were negative. The look of video has a stigmatism to it, as 'cheaper' looking compared to film. To be sure, lighting as seen on video is generally more harsh than film, where film is known to have better contrast, the ability to see detail in shadows.I must declare that there was a moment of surprise as the movement and detail were much more crisp that any movie I have ever watched, even animation displayed on an Imax screen. Yes, the higher frame rate looks like video. But every other aspect of the image looked exactly like the same production style and depth as LOTR. More impressively, 90% of the digital effects held up to close scrutiny with the clearer image. There were the following few exceptions. The most major hindrance was the look of the sets that were supposed to be rock or sculpted stone. I guess because having seen the making of documentaries, I know that most of the fake rock is made of styrofoam. Also a sequence where digital wolves are running across the wilderness. I'm sure it was a challenging effects shot because of a moving camera along with moving digital animals in daytime combined with live action. Some of the background did not match in resolution to some CGI, but was forgivable. The look of video only became apparent during shaky hand-held shots. However, my mind's initial interpretation of watching this type of movement in a fantasy environment, was as if I was watching a high quality video game.It has become a real issue, because audiences need to be given more jaw dropping effects every summer as the bar continues to be set higher, with video games following close behind. One thing that is the most revealing technically with HFR is the lighting. For instance, I could notice the artificial light replacing the supposed candlelight on a table. There also is the perfectly lit miniature of a mountain or a foot bridge with the main characters seen from a distance. But they may not look any better in the standard 24 fps.So congratulations are in order for both the story and technical achievements as we extend our stay in Middle Earth. The filmmakers did not forget that one their primary jobs for these kinds of films is to make sure the audience is entertained. And entertained I was.Further notes summing up my first viewing of an HFR moviePROS Eye-popping clarity, incredible detail especially in wide shots. 3D benefits from brighter and more cleaner image CGI characters are more lifelike, but still only as good as the quality of the CGICONS Video look. Slower fps provides the film look. In higher fps, Animation looks like video game animation. Extra sharp resolution makes it easier to spot characters shot against green screenREACTIONS TO OTHER COMMENTS ""Some action looks sped up"" - I did not notice anything like that, perhaps they are used a bit more motion blur, or can't handle some fast motions without strobe. ""Notice costumes, make-up, and wigs"". I was actually amazed how all the production design held up under such intimate scrutiny. ""Soap opera, BBC television, stage play"". These are all mental associations that these viewers make when first witnessing a narrative feature that doesn't have that film look. But it is not because of the lower quality of the production.Update: I finally watched the film on DVD in 24 fps. All the effects in 48 frames that looked iffy looked just as fake in 24 frames. So ultimately that is a strike against the effects work for this film, especially to the almost seamless effects work in the original LOTR trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"""The Hobbit"" is still a fun movie.","One of the great literary works of the 20th century – largely considered the forerunner of the entire fantasy genre – received its first live action screen adaptation this past week. And like most adaptations, it delighted some and left other die-hard purists disappointed.Stepping away from the strength of the adaptation, ""The Hobbit"" is still a fun movie and Martin Freeman easily slides into the hairy Hobbit-feet of the tiny adventurer drawn from his comfortable home into a world larger than he expected.With the original work written before ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the movie created after the film series, there is a little bit of confusion and needless references back and forth.Fans of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy will likely enjoy themselves with ""The Hobbit."" While it doesn't quite capture the same magic as the original trilogy, it does present all of the same building blocks that appealed to audiences the first time around.The problems with the movie stem from some unnecessary additions from Tolkein's other works and an attempt to add the high fantasy and adventure elements of ""Lord of the Rings"" to this earlier work – which has an innately simpler and gentler tone. From a literary perspective ""The Hobbit"" is a fairy tale and ""Lord of the Rings"" is high fantasy.Jackson's additions to the script work in some places, but they often serve simply to slow down the pace of the story and distract from the human story going on with dwarfs and hobbits.Like many, ""The Hobbit"" has a special place in my heart stemming from grade school-aged readings around the breakfast table. And while my personal preference is for the book, finally having a decent movie version of this childhood favorite adds a level of nostalgia to what is already a strong film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit  trys to be something it's not.,"The Hobbit is a really good book, the Lord of the Rings is a much better book. LOTR is truly an Epic adventure having to do with the fate of all of Middle Earth. The Hobbit is an adventure about dwarfs trying to reclaim their home, their treasure and also kill a dragon. A nice big fun adventure, but not really Epic and not really on anywhere near the scale of LOTR.Having read LOTR multiple times I felt that Peter Jackson truly captured the feeling and spirit of the book. Yes, there are some things I disagreed with in his movie adaption, but on the whole the movies were an amazing achievement.Relatively speaking, Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Hobbit falls way short of what he was able to accomplish with LOTR. Jackson's efforts to make the Hobbit more epic are severely undercut by giving the action sequences a video game quality. In the Hobbit you are bombarded with too many scenes and actions sequences that strain credulity.Sadly, the action sequences in the Hobbit film that take away from the experience were not even in the book. Further, the film's efforts to be ""Epic"" by making the Hobbit longer results in extended action sequences and extra plot elements that really take away from the story.The result is a film adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the book that it is based on.In the end the film adaptation of the Hobbit falls victim to a movie studio trying to recreate the financial success of LOTR by trying to artificially pump the Hobbit up into three really long films and it just doesn't really work.Does this mean that the first of the three Hobbit films is is a bad film? No it is a pretty good film, but make no mistake that the Hobbit is not even in the same league as the Lord of the Rings.I give the Hobbit a 7 because it is a fun film with good special effects. If I were grading it strictly on being a good film adaptation of the Hobbit I would drop it to a 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A soaring triumph,"The Hobbit brings Middle Earth alive in ways not seen during the preceding LOTR trilogy. Peter Jackson seems to be getting better in serving grand spectacles with every iteration. At 48 GPS, the difference is clear - no more judder, no more awkward CGI transitions no restrictive camera views, the Camera-work never loses its fluidity through the entire breakneck pacing and gorgeously choreographed action sequences. Some of the vistas simply take your breath away. This is cinema meant for the big screen.The acting is absolutely top notch. Martin Freeman portrays the Hobbit's' spirit of adventure, their love for home and hearth, self-doubt, courage and above all, their hardiness well above what Elijah Wood could ever do. And the dwarfs are played to rugged perfection by the 13 actors with all their pride, toughness and merriment. Gandalf, Galadriel and Elrond are all splendid. Azog the pale Orc is truly menacing. IMO, though, Andy Serkis is the biggest triumph in the presentation, for he takes the challenge of meeting his own exceptional standards from movies past, and gleefully, malevolently raises the bar even higher. This is a Gollum far more visceral than you have seen before - more raw, more menacing, more confused, more playful and more vulnerable all at the same time.Hardcore fans of Tolkien's fiction would revel in the abundant references to races and legends of the Middle Earth - from Gondolin to Rivendell. Just this first part of the Hobbit trilogy deepens your appreciation of the LOTR saga even more.Strap yourself in, for this is the journey through Middle Earth that we have been waiting for ever since the movie was announced.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A beautiful adventure story that is good, but sadly didn't become great.","I watched the hobbit and The lotr movies when I was a kid. I loved it, and decided to watch them all again now, some years later. I remember a lot from the lotr movies but not s much from the hobbit triology.This movie was better as a kid, now a lot of the humor is really lame. I wouldn't complain if this movie was solely meant for kids, cause then it would be fair enough. But it isn't, they try in the weirdest way to make it. Mix of this weird cartoon vibe where the hero is nothing but good and will just save the day giving no sense of danger to the viewers. But then the next moment it will take a dark turn that just feels fake, it feels as if Peter Jackson thought to himself ""oh I hav to entertain the parents aswell"" every fifth minute. It just makes you fall out of the movie and it makes everything feel unnatural and scripted, and nothing like a real adventure. You don't feel like your following bilbo, instead everything is just chaos with one action scene after the other.This movie is a great action film, but sadly not much more than that, even though it could have been. A lot of the development and actions of the characters are unmotivated and the movie fails to establish a reason for the characters actions. You don't really feel change in anybody, not even bilbo, it just feels like some kind of ""it's in his nature"" every time someone does something, there's no deeper meaning behind.There's a scene between bilbo and Thorin at the end that is just made terrible, it could've been heartwarming and given a feel of development, instead its made corny with the casual way to entertain kids, thorin acts mad and then changes up. It's like they try to give some small twist but it just falls flat.The scene with gollum and bilbo is perfect the dark feel you get and the perfect acting is so good, bilbo feels like bilbo in the scene and gollum feels like gollum, I love that scene for so many reasons, but again not fitting into the movie considering that the minute after the scene they make a childish chase scene through the tunnels. The chase scene could have been great but they made it into some kind of Tom and Jerry chase where the hero's have no trouble at all.Almost every major scene in the movie that is meant to move you are underwhelming, you don't feel anything and a lot of the ""badass"" scenes are again underwhelming and cringeThe score, scenery, makeup and special effects are amazing. The pacing is great too and I must admit that the movies is over before you know it. Even though a lot of the movie is spent on nothing it still has a cool adventure feel and still is a great action/adventure movie, its just sad that the movie didn't get taken to the next level with more develepment and moving and touching characters. Most of the characters are just empty, approcimately 5 dwarfs stand out, the rest are just there to be there for silly comedic relief. The villains are one dimensional and doesn't really make sense except for gollum who is perfect, that scene carried the entire movie.I get the concern of making one book into three movies, but at least for the first of the three installments this wasn't bad, it's not that there was a lot of filler yet just more unnecessary stuff and a lot of scenes that didn't contribute to the characters where dragged for too long. A lot of the scenes felt like they were only there to give you nostalgic feelings of the books. I fear that especially the second movie will have a lot of filler though.To sum it all up this movie is a fun innocent action movie that will make you feel good and give you a good time, but it fails to become more than that. The movie is soulless and it wont move you like a good movie should unless you are under the age of twelve. A disappointing movie that had the potential to be so so good ended up being underwhelming and silly. I would still recommend it because of some good things, for example bilbo running through the shire even though his decision wasn't motivated and just happened because of no reason. He just woke up and didn't feel like staying, his speech to the dwarfs near the end after leaving the tunnels was so so good, the score is a masterpiece and the gollum scene is great. So you should watch the movie because its still good, just not great, its entertaining and beautiful, it has some great sequences and it still is an extremely beautiful story of a man who decides to go on a quest to help others, learn more about himelf and experience and feel the real world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hobbit: The Phantom Menace,"Okay, so it's not quite as awful as The Phantom Menace was, but it comes damn close to damaging the LOTR franchise in the same way TPM did to the Star Wars franchise.Let's review here:1. The story is damaged within the first ten minutes and never recovers at any point in the film. The fact is, simply, that Bilbo's character is never developed. We have no freaking idea why Gandalf chose him or why he's so important. We're given no reason to really care about him, and therefore it makes zero sense why any of the other characters should care about him either. The entire film suffers for this, because Bilbo is, essentially, the lead. And when you don't care about the lead, you pretty much don't care about anything else.2. The tone is WAY off. Yes, The Hobbit was a children's book. However, the film needs to fit into the already-established LOTR universe, and it struggles to do so. The first half is filled with bizarre slapstick and childish humor more akin to Sesame Street than a LOTR film, while the second half attempts to take a drastic turn for the dark, making everything seem completely disjointed. It just didn't work.3. CGI disasters. Yep, Peter Jackson seems to have taken a page from the George Lucas 'How To Ruin A Beloved Franchise' playbook, and leaned WAY too hard on CGI for this film. I know there was quite a bit of CGI in the original films, but it was truly abused in this one. Far too many characters were pure CGI creations, and way too many scenes were set entirely on a green screen. CGI is best when its working in support of practical sets and effects, not when it's the only effect being used. Jackson struck a near-perfect balance in LOTR, but The Hobbit just seemed like one big cartoon most of the time. Bad. And made even worse by the fact that we already know what Jackson and his production team are capable of.4. HFR is as bad, if not worse, than everyone says. Shooting this film in HFR was probably the single worst decision anyone could have made. Everything looks cheap and plastic. You can see the seams on the actors prosthetics, you can tell that the sets are cardboard, and the already-problematic use of CGI is exacerbated tenfold. HFR takes the magic out of films. Period.5. No attractive, human protagonists. This may sound superficial, but the fact is that without a strong lead that people can relate to, your film is likely going to fail. Especially in a film that is filled with monsters and weird creatures and other oddities. It's really hard for people to empathize with characters that they either aren't attracted to or can't relate to on some basic level. Nobody wants to be a dwarf or a hobbit. LOTR had several strong, attractive human leads, both male and female. And yes, Frodo and Sam were indeed beloved characters, but they were brilliantly written and developed in a way that neither Bilbo nor any of the dwarfs were in The Hobbit. As such, the audience simply cannot emotionally attach itself to anyone in this film.6. Completely impossible scenarios that don't even make sense within its own universe. This is a big one and it drives directly to the cartoonish nature of the film. There are several scenes, most notably during the escape from the Goblin kingdom, where the characters are put through a series of actions that are laughably absurd. Now, this is a movie and not real life, and nobody expects perfect physics. But everything still needs to work within its own universe, and the fact is that some of these stunts are just dumb and insulting. You'd never have seen this kind of nonsense in the LOTR trilogy, and this film should follow the same rules. Quite frankly some of the action scenes could have been cut out altogether and the film would have been better off for it.THE GOOD:A great scene between Gollum and Bilbo is very much worth watching. Highlight of the entire movie, and almost makes the rest of the nonsense worthwhile.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The best movie in years.,"This movie was everything and beyond what I had expected. I was actually a little afraid that I would have so high expectations on this movie, that I would find it to fall short. But the end result was the total opposite. Everything, the story, the execution and the actors are hitting the spot trough out the whole movie.The movie moves in a logical order, not too fast nor too slow. And it had an surprising amount of steady action trough out the movie. And for those that have not read the books, it will give you even more understanding to the story behind the characters. And as usual, the end of the movie could not have made better. But as I do not want to spoil it for anyone, I wont tell anything more in detail.However, I watched this movie in 3D, doing that was an honest mistake, I didn't check the details of the viewing before I booked the ticket. And as always I find 3D to kill the movie's beauty. I am more than convinced that the 3D actually took away much of the exceptional cinematics in this movie. And hence I will go back again, to see what I had been waiting for. So a warning from me, do not watch it in 3D. Especially if you also enjoy lovely cinematics and the art of a well filmed movie. The 3D distorts allot and sometimes made the movie feel more real than it should for being a fantasy movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
My Review - The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"I entered the screening of this film with anticipation but underlying tones of dread. After hearing so many negative things about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, I was sceptical as to whether I'd like it - let alone enjoy it.However, this is quite easily my favourite film of the year and, though I can comprehend the reasons people have criticised the film, the sheer magnetism of the characters and a beautifully crafted piece of cinema has eclipsed any flaws in my eyes.Firstly, I cannot list enough positive aspects of this film. There's a strong feeling of nostalgia for fans and a sense of scale that The Lord of the Rings achieved across its trilogy. By accompanying a great story and setting with magnificent acting, even the characters who are unlike their book-written counterparts are mesmerising at times. The effects are top notch, with 3D being used to immerse and create a depth to the film that's rarely seen in any other, and the innovative use of 48fps compared to the 24fps screening was something I consider a step forward.That being said, the movie is not without what some may regard as flaws. This is a long film, a lot of it may feel drawn out to some people. Unfortunately, I cannot agree as I enjoyed every moment of this film - even as far as the shots of characters travelling from place to place. This film just feels like an adventure and Peter Jackson has created nothing short of a modern-day masterpiece - in my opinion.As for any complaints about technological advancement in High Frame Rate - I have no quarrels whatsoever. Changing what we see may upset some people, but I personally congratulate Peter Jackson on an amazing film, incredible effects, brilliant storytelling and directing that is not comparable to anyone else. I would give it 10/10 if it weren't for the fact that I wish the film were more beloved and that this probably could've been achieved if a few things were different.9/10 10/10 (personal rating)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Hobbit Revisited!,"Watching this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. After LOTR, coming up with anything even close to it, seemed a gargantuan task, even for Peter Jackson! The book Hobbit doesn't give much scope to make it as epic as LOTR. But After watching The Hobbit, I realised i was wrong to compare the movies. LOTR was dark, brooding, everything leading to the final war for the Ring. Hobbit, on the other hand, is so much more about Bilbo Baggins. Its about how a half-ling faces everything. A bunch of dwarfs led by their displaced king. Gandalf leading them all to an adventure, whose larger purpose he doesn't yet understand. It all seems to fit in when u think of it in a larger perspective. Martin Freeman as Bilbo is fabulous! I dint think anybody could look more a Hobbit than Elijah as Frodo, but i was surprised! Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the brooding leader of the Dwarfs was amazing too! But this movie is not all about the ring or the story of the dwarfs or even Bilbo. Its about so much more. The cinematography is beautiful. The CGI is fantastic! The best part about the movie though, I felt was the music! Song of the Lonely Mountain and Far Over the Misty Mountain the song of the dwarfs leaves an impression like none another! A solid 9 pointer!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson has done it again!,"I watched this movie last night at our local cinema. I didn't see it in 48 fps 3d, but it wasn't necessary since the magic of Middle earth doesn't need 3d to feel real. I have always been a huge lotr fan, reading and watching the books/movies since I was a little kid. And I must say that Peter Jacksons interpretation of the hobbit is absolutely perfect. The fact that the movie contained more humour than the lotr trilogy, didn't bother me at all, since the hobbit book is more ""friendlier"" than the lotr book. The cast was great, Gandalf delivered, the dwarfs very funny and interesting, but the highlight was the ""new"" Bilbo, Martin Freeman. He made a big impression and was the perfect actor for the younger Bilbo. Definitely the best movie this year, go see it now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"A lengthy but riveting film, well worth your time.","At 2 hours and 49 minutes, this film is lengthy but well worth it in the end, although it does take about an hour and a half to get any real plot development.The acting talent of Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Martin Freeman (Bilbo) are particularly noteworthy. Most of the humour shown arises from the facial expressions of Bilbo. It's a dry humour that I'm particularly fond of. Thorin (Richard Armatige), I find, isn't very believable as a character, and the acting here is quite poor.I noticed that the size scale of the Hobbits and the Dwarfs are inconsistent. There's a point where Bilbo is shown to be only slightly taller than a fully grown pig, then later he's shown to be just as big as a pony.The graphics are incredible and realistic. Your sympathy for Sebastian the Hedgehog and hatred of the pale Orc Azog is dramatised via the graphics, and this is what they're for.The dialogue could be improved. Half of the plot movement is created through dialogue, but the information you need is not clear. Some information is missed out altogether - when you first see the Goblins I thought they were Trolls.I've always loved the Lord of the Rings score, but here it could be improved. At around 1 hour and 55 minutes, in a scene where the group are travelling across the mountains of Middle-Earth, the music could be a little more demanding, it should have more 'oomph.'The battle scenes are directed brilliantly. The camera shots are perfect; where in most films you'd go from fight to fight, and be unable to make sense of it, this film is a massive improvement. The gore is kept to a minimum, which I admire, but some horror is included. The horror isn't necessary but it makes the film more riveting, and would be worse without it.I loved the ending. It's a perfect way to create suspense for the next film ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
All the bad reviews were very wrong!,"This movie was fantastic. I was not disappointment at all. Absolutely LOVED the entire experience! All those so called professional movie reviewers are crazy giving this movie a bad review. They must have watched a different movie.One thing I loved seeing is more song and food. Feasting and singing was a big part of Tolkien's writings and was glad to see they added more of that in the Hobbit.It was also a nice surprise to see that they brought in a character from the silmarillion.I was not put off by the 48 fps at all. I rather enjoyed the higher definition, especially for all those amazing epic panoramas.I also loved the imaging of the Dwarf minds. Very, very well done!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Jackson fails to transform a classic into an action film,"I am so disappointed. Jackson turned this great classic story into 3 boring hours of meaningless conflict that dragged on and on and on. He could have told the entire Hobbit in one film! Why a trilogy? I fear the profit motive must have been more important than making a truly great film, because the potential certainly existed. In this film, the scenery was great and so was the singing. I loath the cartooning effects in this movie and found that just distracting. None of the characters were developed with the exception of our main character. We were given nothing about the elves which are as fascinating as any of the action. The elf queen had no personality; she was a like a paper doll, flat with no affect, and boring. The movie takes us from one pointless battle to another with only scenery for filler. In summary, Jackson took a well-developed, perfect story, and tried to modernize it as some action-packed thing with all the tricks of the trade. It did not work.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
An unexpected visual,"Just saw the Hobbit: an unexpected Journey. Most amazing visually and cinematic experience. Almost real in 48 fps which did take me 10 minutes to get used to but after that blew me away. Don't compare this to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Just like the book it is not meant to be compared. Of course some parts where a bit long and it felt like it ""ended"" three times, but the movie left me with a stomach feeling that I haven't felt before and the feeling was good. Going to see it again most definitively. As a fan you will get everything and more, you will most likely love it from start to finish and even after credits. None fans will probably think it is to long but yet entertaining or they might hate it all together. It is a adventure fantasy film and based on a children's book, which Lord of the Rings isn't.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
The Hobbit is a huge hit,If you liked The Lord of the Rings than you will fall right in love with The Hobbit. It is an incredible story that will make you wanting to ask for more. I never thought that this was going to be this wonderful of a movie. It is a wonderful movie to see in IMAX 3D. This movie is so good that all families need to see it to believe it. It is like a storybook coming to life in 3D it is so wonderful. The whole family will love seeing the charts most of all the kids will love this movie most of all. It is a little dark and it has a little stuff that maybe a little bit too much for some kids like talking about drugs and having wine and beer and stuff like that but besides all of that the kids and the whole family will enjoy this masterpiece. It is a funny and fun movie that will make you laugh and will have you talking about anywhere you go like if it is the doctor's if you have kids school maybe. I hope this review has helped you a bunch.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun adventure with some good laughs.,"First of all, I saw this is 2d, which slightly dampened the experience because I could tell that some sequences were shot for 3d. I also saw it at 24 fps, and it looked beautiful so no complaints there.As a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this movie is very light and fanciful, especially in the beginning. Some parts are very similar to Fellowship, with some familiar locations fans will enjoy. The beginning when the dwarfs all arrive at Bag End had me laughing quite a bit. However, it is quite a while before Bilbo actually leaves the Shire on his adventure, and this attributes to he movies length of 170 mins.Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are both great as Bilbo and Gandalf. Ian seems like he never left Gandalf and slipped right back into his wizard boots. The dwarfs are all given their own personalities, although some more than others, and they all help Bilbo out a lot. They give some great comedy relief too.Visually the movie looks great. The Shire is as beautiful as ever, as is Rivendell. Everyone's heard that Gollum is in here, and he has one extended scene that is probably my favorite in the whole movie. There is also a fantastic escape sequence near the end.My only real complaints are the movie's length and a couple of sevens that seemed unnecessary. At 170 mins. you will need to set aside an entire afternoon to go see it. But I still had a lot of fun with it. It might be a little to violent for young kids, but any other age should enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
A Trilogy's Average Beginning,"There are films that define a decade. Works of the seventh art that one must view in the future to better understand culture, taste and trends of a particular time period. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is an example of this. Having made close to three billion dollars all together, these are films that greatly influenced culture in the 2000s to the point that the fantasy genre was no longer one overwhelmingly followed by book worms but now one of high mainstream appeal. Even the Academy of Infinite Wisdom could not deny the last entry a much deserved Oscar in the year 2003.We are now in the 2010's and exactly 11 years after The Fellowship of the Ring first hit theaters, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is released. Most fans know of the long and tedious pre-production process that went on before this came to be and it is not relevant now how Peter Jackson ended up being the Director and not Guillermo del Toro. What is relevant is how this entry does little to capture audience's imagination.What was originally going to be two-parts has ended up being three, basically three hour movies which is extremely excessive for a 300 page book that is just an introduction to the masterpiece that is Lord of the Rings. Mr. Jackson himself has said that this was done so that the characters could be developed more deeply. Something which one does not see in this film. The reasons for Thorin's Quest are obvious and there is no depth.This does not make it a bad movie, it is still entertaining. Great costumes, a familiar score, the return of beloved characters, wonderful panoramas as always. But we are left scratching our heads regarding if three epics were necessary. After asking this question, the most resounding answer is no.While all three LOTR films have their own magic and could easily stand alone, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is nothing more than a glorified introduction. I sure hope that by next November, things are different.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
"Love for what it is, not what it isn't","First off, let me say that The Hobbit was a masterpiece. I have been following this film since I first heard that there was a possibility of it, back when there was rumors of casting Elijah Wood as Bilbo. I definitely had high expectations. Knowing and loving every detail of The Lord of the Rings, I knew that the Hobbit had to be just as good, and when Peter Jackson was announced as the director, what could be better? Admittedly, I knew it wouldn't be the same as Lord of the Rings, and that there would be things that maybe wouldn't suit me perfectly. But there was definitely nothing lacking. Now, don't write me off as one of those hopelessly gone fanatics who won't write a helpful review. Though I am slightly biased in that way, I will try my best to provide something helpful. When the New Line Cinema logo rolled in, I could not stop my restless excitement, but as the film began to play, I started feeling those pangs of disappointment. It wasn't just like Lord of the Rings, and I was sure that signified being 'not as good.' Elijah's voice wasn't exactly the same, and as a die-hard Frodo fan, I was ticked off;""whatisupwiththis? themusicisn'tlike...thecharactersaren'tlike...theeffectsaren'tas..."" I was wondering if I had seriously blown twenty bucks on another money- maker. But then I began to notice the skillfully done ""extra"" things that Peter had so skillfully woven into the film, the adorableness and naiveness of Bilbo, the beauty of the poignant and hilarious lines, and I began to think,""OH! Here's Lord of the Rings!! YAY!"" But then I was caught up in how awesome it was...without considering LOTR at all. It was then that I realized, that no, this is not Lord of the Rings. But it IS something just as good. Something that I can love as Middle Earth, as the Hobbit, another masterpiece that is definitely the Tolkien I love, but is the novelty I craved for. By the end, I was nearly in tears, because this was one of those films that made me realize that yes, there is still some good in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
I think this will be Peter Jackson's second best trilogy,"It was better than I thought it would be it was a very good movie though I cant help but wonder why they felt the need to take such a short book and turn it into a 6-8 hour trilogy. It does not make much sense but still I expect in all it will probably be a good trilogy and I believe most people will love it the special effects in the movie were amazing and equal to or greater than the prior trilogy's graphics although I was quite annoyed when the movie ended on a cliff hanger and sense I have to write ten lines to submit this review I will explain why I think it should be changed to five lines. It should be changed to five lines because not every one has ten lines worth of things to say about most movies this one specifically I can sum up in one word ""AMAZING"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Fantasy"
