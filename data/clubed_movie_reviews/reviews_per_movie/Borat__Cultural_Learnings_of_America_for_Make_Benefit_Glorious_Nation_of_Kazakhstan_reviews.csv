Dissecting Life In a Hilarious Way,"I didn't really think I was gonna like this going into it. It seemed like the sort of comedy that was just grating and would irritate me but I gave it a chance.It really surprised me. It's hilarious. I didn't realise that it was a sort of ""hidden camera"" for lack of a better word, movie. It used real people and puts them in these insane situations. I think it's so interesting to see how people react.It's also likes to dig into peoples life's and get them to expose the awful parts of them selfs. The part with the men on the bus springs to mind. It is truly disgusting and this movie Lulls them into this place where they expose them selfs. It's incredibly interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Appalling Masterpiece,"The laughter is genuine even when I was appalled at what I was laughing at. Is Sacha Baron Cohen a genius of sorts or the biggest smart ass to hit the screens in a long, very long time? He makes John Waters appear like an (old) Disney product. The nastiness works because it is immediately recognizable and his targets live next door if not with me between my four walls. It is a social-horror-documentary. The three guys talking about women between beer and beer was so horribly real that I wanted to leave the theater laughing and screaming at the same time. Borat is not tender about his own background either. He is an equal opportunity offender if I ever saw one. The world is a cesspool and nobody is immune. Even his innocence is corrupt. I've been considering seeing it again, as the whole thing in one single disgusting lump was too much to take but I'm not sure I want to. I'll wait for the DVD where I'll be able to select and discard. My only question is now, what will Sacha Baron Cohen do for an encore.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

America through the eyes of a Kazakh.,"This movie was probably most and the highest criticized from Kazahkstan itself. Unrigthfully so. The movie doesn't make fun of Kazahkstan, it makes fun of Americans, in a criticizing way. Kazahkstan is merely used as a platform to show the (of course exaggerated) contrasts between the advanced and 'civilized' America and the simplistic Kazakhstan and how a simplistic man, from such a simplistic place, such as Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is capable of pinching right through the advanced and civilized Americans and puts his finger right on the spot. The movie is about Borat learning from America and Americans. for the benefits of his country Kazakhstan but the question raises; Shouldn't America and Americans also learn from simplistic countries such as Kazakhstan, for their own good and benefits?Just like in Michael Moore movies often is the case, Borat knows to put his finger on the right place and manages to show America how it really is. An uptight, patriotic, homophobic, God fearing, anti-social country, in which minorities still have a hard time and not all rights are considered equal to some. It's funny, in the interviews it often is not Borat who says the most offensive things, it are the interviewees who do so, such as the rodeo-guy and the frat boys.But no, the movie is not all criticism. For most part it's just a fun and often also hilarious people about making fun of ignorant people.In all honesty it's hard to tell how much of the movie was actually improvised and how much of it was real. Obviously some sequences were scripted such as all the scene's in Kazakhstan and some other sequences will make you really doubt. Some of obviously planned the camera-positions are often too coincidental and also the fact that the movie had an actual professional director attached to it, makes you really wonder. It also is hard to imaging that all those people actually took this silly talking and looking character so seriously as they did in this movie all the time. When a person who wears his underwear above his pants and is talking slang is entering your hotel with a camera-crew following him, wouldn't you crack up, realizing that this just can't be for real? The movie is also edited in such a way that the emotions and reactions get exaggerated. It's also are the reasons why you can't really call this movie a fake documentary or mockumentary.What I loved about the ""Da Ali G Show"", in which Borat often made an appearance, was that it was improvised, real, often had no point and was all about the responses of the other person on the Sacha Baron Cohen characters. It was fun to see the peoples reactions and how they did respond to the character and its outrageous and often also offensive questions. This movie is overwritten in my opinion. The movie has a main plot line in in, in which Borat falls for non other than Pamela Anderson and makes it his personal mission to find her and marry her. In my opinion the improvising way of traveling through the USA and meeting and interviewing people would had worked way better, in both terms of criticism and humor. Now some parts in the movie feel planned and acted, which is definitely not Borat's strongest point. It also again raises the question of how much of the movie is actually improvised and how much of it was planned, though I definitely believe that most of the interviews and Borat with other people were for real. Ironic, since it was the screenplay that was actually being nominated for an Academy Award.But all this criticism aside, this is a very fun and also often hilarious movie to watch. Some of the situations Borat gets himself into are priceless and the reactions from the ignorant persons are even more hilarious. They often don't know how to cope with this odd talking and looking character from the far away and insignificant country of Kazakhstan.There are a couple of especially memorable sequences, such as when Borat and Azamat wrestle naked in their hotel room, after Azamat's 'hand-feast' and then start running naked through the hotel, elevators and eventually ending up wrestling naked in a convention room with hundreds of people in it. There are a couple of more hilarious and memorable sequences but no one really matches up to that moment, that totally catches you completely off guard.It's all fast paced, which makes sure that you'll probably laugh your way non-stop trough this movie.A perfectly fun and amusing movie that also has some striking criticism, that could had used some less story and perhaps should had been more like the show.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best films I have ever seen,"In terms of pure unadulterated cringe-worthiness, this film just about outshines them all. It is brilliant, horrific, hilarious, sad, outrageous, revealing, and incredibly clever. It shows up people's narrow-mindedness, their racism, their inability to accept or understand different cultures. It makes me scared for the future of the world, and delighted that someone actually sees most people for what they really are - blinkered and uneducated.Go and rent it, and enjoy. It will make you want to be a better person, make you laugh until you almost cry, and undoubtedly make you hide behind a cushion at times.Sacha Baron-Cohen is a genius.

"Totally imperfect, but packing one of the best character performances ever","For months, I could not go anywhere, see or read anything without hearing something about Borat: Cultural Learnings of American for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. It was being hailed as groundbreaking, and hilarious beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Everyone I knew wanted to see it, and I just stood back and could not understand what the big fuss was about. Yeah, it looked fairly amusing, but nothing more than that. Sacha Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show never impressed me when I watched random episodes, so I was not in belief that this film would.But with all of the hype, it made me want to see it opening weekend. Unfortunately, I never managed to. I caught it a few weeks later without the benefit of a huge audience watching it with me. And for the most part, I think my original assumption was correct.Basically for the two people who have zero clue what the movie is about (despite it now being on DVD), Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazak journalist sent to the United States to observe the American way of life. He brings his TV crew with him every step of the way, and begins to explore the country. But because of his origin, he is outrageously obnoxious in his behaviour. But for some reason, it only becomes more tolerated as he continues on, allowing for many surprising responses from the people he comes across.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is racist, misogynist, raunchy, and just downright vile in the way he acts. And the Americans he talks to either do not realize what is going on, or actually agree with him. The tour he takes across the United States involves a plethora of random, everyday citizens being duped in this fashion. The fact that the film was marketed so well in the US, and then further made millions, attests to the idea that this may just be the greatest practical joke every played.But unfortunately, it is a one-note joke. The film loses steam after thirty minutes, and can barely pick up afterwards. It strikes a pretty solid barrier, and just cannot recover no matter how hard it tries. Yes, the proceeding minutes had their share of laughs and shocks, but nowhere near as much as the first little bit. It just sets itself up far too well, and fails to live up to its original design. Its nifty idea and execution really should have told people from the start that it would not work for a ninety minute long film, but I guess they had more faith in the picture than I did.Another upsetting thing about the film was the grand amount of preplanning. It was continually being sold to the audience as being spur-of-the-moment, and very uncoordinated. But as the film progresses, you can tell that some moments are actually being filmed this way, and that some reek of being rehearsed. It takes away from the satire the film had built up for itself, and really brings down the genuine enjoyment for the film. I know it had barely anywhere to go from the start, but making it almost so that it was written unnaturally before hand, just takes away from the genuine impact that the film has. The fact that the writing was nominated at the Oscars also does an effective amount of damage to the final moments of the film, which otherwise would have been drop dead funny instead of just amusing.The film-making techniques on the other hand, are just magical. You really get a sense of the gritty and grungy documentary look the filmmakers wanted from the minute the film starts, right up until its finale. The hand-held camera works beautifully in every sequence, and the very personal diary feel that the film gains during the second act works very well. Just trying to keep up with Cohen in certain scenes seemed to have been a test of endurance on its own. The film is very low budget, and it shows in how unique the film looks. If it had not been so heavily publicized, I think I actually would have had trouble deferring whether or not it was an actual documentary if I saw it while flipping through TV channels.There are no proper words to describe Cohen and his schtick. It really is a sight to marvel all on its own. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind. He goes beyond transcending himself into the character. Every moral fibre of this character is ingrained in Cohen's performance. You do not see Cohen, and you do not see an actor. You see a rude and ignorant Kazak journalist. He never lets up for a second, and is always acting in character. This fictional character is brought to life with so much energy, that he actually forms into a real life person. The line between reality and fiction is just so thin here, that it really begs the question of how far an actor will go for his character. And he is absolutely hysterical to watch.Ken Davitian, who plays Borat's producer and sidekick Azamat, is also very good in his performance. He is almost always watching, and is so subtle. He never breaks a smile, and he is just so serious that he complements how perfect Cohen's character is. He is obviously not as strong an actor (and is barely understandable), but his valiant efforts do go rewarded.Even with its flaws, Borat is an experience everyone should take. Some may find it funnier than others, and some may not find it funny at all. There is a bit of a middle ground, but not much. And in the process of watching, everyone will be able to marvel at one of the greatest character performances ever committed to celluloid.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Its a classic, if you do not expect a funny movie","This movie is more deep than it appears to the general crowd expecting a laugh on a Sunday. Most people will go to watch it as a funny movie, but it is not a funny movie in that sense. It is a Satire about how people in many parts of the world still feel about homosexuality, equality of women, need for a woman's consent to a marriage, prostitution as a profession, racism, and so on. It also portrays how even some westerners feel about religion and Jesus. The scene may seriously bother you if you are too much into Jesus (It is supposed to bother you, if you really get it).People who say this movie is disgusting, just do not get it at all! If this is disgusting, then Charles Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" was disgusting, ""because it glorified Adolf Hitler, and expressed hatred against the Jews"".If you want to feel sad about how stupid, clumsy and ignorant still many people are in the corners of the world, you should watch this movie to open your eyes. But if you are too classy to understand how people live, think and get used to sufferings in backward countries, you may call it ""disgusting"".Watch it with a true open mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Don't believe the hype,"I can't believe how many people like this movie. Seems to me like Sacha Baron Cohen just compiled a bunch of Jackass skits in an attempt to get real people to give entertaining responses. That's why this man is getting sued.The film has the most basic premise as Borat's motivation: traveling cross country to hunt down his Baywatch beauty, Pamela Anderson. I think I saw a similar plot in Britney Spears's Crossroads movie (also not good).Borat makes a fool of himself in several social situations including dinner parties, feminist meetings, rodeos, church gatherings, mortgage meetings, etc. I don't find his brand of humor funny. Most of his antics would cause real people to get arrested and punished.***SPOILER*** There is also a scene with Borat and his large friend Azamat running naked through a hotel. It's perhaps the nastiest depiction of naked male anatomy I have ever seen. That's not a good thing and just another reason that this movie scores an abysmal 1.0.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat was a terrible film ...NOT!,"Borat proves to be the Python of our generation.I say this as a die-hard Monty Python fan  not because the humour is on the same level or follows the same guidelines (in fact, the common ground is here is that it follows no guidelines)  but because both comedy teams mask their sketches in a feature film, passing them off as a story when it becomes glaringly clear that the latter is an elaborate pretext under which to have outrageous, absurdist and side-splittingly fun in a series of genius gags.Yet for all of Borat's subsequent disorganisation and warped narrative, we are first served a gorgeously condensed introduction to our character in his village in Kazakhstan. This segment was possibly the biggest crowd-pleaser in my theatre and perhaps rightly so, for I would call it the film's goldmine in terms of sheer laugh-out-loud humour. Here we are introduced to Borat's sister (""She is number-four prostitute in whole of Kazakhstan.""), whom he kisses on the mouth, his main interests (ping-pong, sunbathing and ""watch ladies make toilet"") as well as a wide variety of hilarious native Kazakhs. Undoubtedly the success of the introduction stems from a combination of novelty and a culture shock.Once the sprawling surge of Kazakhstani culture subsides, Borat flies to New York City to make a movie-film about the glorious US and A. The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking' At Me"" and the film gets ambitious: it spoofs Jon Voight's incongruous cowboy character walking down Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy (1969). This I found a pleasant surprise, but the referential spoofs end here and the rest is all Sascha Baron Cohen  and we couldn't be happier.The second half of Borat is arguably less compelling. It is hard to tell why, for the humour remains consistently good and there is an almost exponential stupidity with our Borat character as the sets out to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. I would not go as far as to say the novelty ""wears off"", but we are a little more settled now and Borat has found his safe footing. Next, however, the film totally floors whatever safeness you may have with one of the most unspeakably graphic hotel room scenes I have ever seen. I won't give anything away, but rest assured that some viewers (*males*) will watch in horrified silence while others will literally cramp up from laughing so violently. I belong more to the latter category.As Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people  members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews  all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Sadly, it was not always directed toward Borat (but most of the time) but toward some truly idiotic hick Americans. When I was informed the film used many candid takes, I can only hope the unreasonably creepy Jesus convention was *not* one of them.In conclusion, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)"" is a towering comedy achievement. It is apparent that Sascha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an anti-semitic, misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited, which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags, spoofs, bizarre one-liners and graphic jokes.

Hysterical,"This movie is simply indescribable. You're gonna have hysterical fits of laughing until you bust a gut and your stomach literally hurts. The genius of it all lies in the improvised nature of almost every scene shot with real people in the streets, inside homes and at hotels. Some reactions are as expected; others absolutely dumbfounding. Are people really on board with what Borat is saying or chanting now, you'll wonder? Do they really believe that he's as stupid and unassuming as he pretends to be? Most crucially, are people really so kind, forbearing and open-minded to suffer a foreign fool like Borat so gladly?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You must see this movie-film...so my country can be free.,"Borat is sent to America with producer Azamat Bagatov to brush with American culture and help Kazakhstan move forward in the 21st Century. While there, he goes renegade and tries to hunt down Pamela Anderson for a quick marriage (with his 'wedding sack') after his wife Oksana is killed by a bear while walking his retarded brother Bilo.I will admit that this film is frequently hilarious, but it's not as good as I thought it could be. Sacha Baron Cohen recycles a lot of jokes and situations from the TV show. I've seen every Borat sketch that has been made available to the public and the easy targets are beginning to not be as shocking or entertaining as they once were. He aims all of his material at the idiots who fall for it or who have not seen him on TV. Bringing a (fake) hooker to a snooty High Society dinner, boozing with moronic college frat-boys or jive-talking to a stuck-up concierge is not intelligent comedy anymore. His method of exposing bigots, hypocrites and narrow-minded idiots with his special blend of Socratic irony and entrapment has been used to great effect in the past but it's getting old. Since this movie is probably the last we will see of Borat it's a shame he didn't come up with a new edge.Sacha Baron Cohen must have the biggest balls in the whole world to do what he does though. I could never keep a straight face while pretending to interrogate a yard sale lady/gypsy over a Barbie doll/woman she has shrunk. Nor could I deliberately, over-exaggerate a massive fall into priceless antiques in a store and not pay for it.There is one particular scene that pushes the boundaries of taste so far back that it could circle Pluto several times over. I will mention nothing of the content of this scene but I have to warn you, it is insane, teeth-grindingly funny and absolutely disgusting. You need to see it to believe it.Obviously there are some parts to this film that are totally staged but if you try to figure it out, Sacha Baron Cohen has to tried to make it as little-faked as possible and you'll realize how it's all done. Of particular note is the surprisingly emotional musical score to the film which really stood out and made an impression. Strange considering the type of film that it is. I must hunt down the CD.No one will fall for Borat's schtick anymore. This movie will make him too popular. He goes out with a predictable BANG instead of KABOOM!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant,"Hysterically funny - and tragic in it's exposing of ignorance and deep seated bigotries. For all of you who cry that America is better than portrayed - grow up and face the fact that ignorance and prejudice live everywhere. More importantly, learn to laugh at it if you are so offended by it. Ignorance is the worst and most dangerous situation for all human beings - it deserves only ridicule and repair. The current chic of political correctness is almost more damaging than ignorance itself.

huge misunderstanding (?),"I have seen the movie a few weeks ago, and i've just read a lot of the comments here... i see that a lot of you people think that this movie is anti-semitic. you've got it all wrong,sorry. Cohen is presenting us a fool and naive -and i don't know what else- character, who thinks that the so nice Jewish couple has turned into bugs and try to poison him with a sandwich, so he bribes them with money to leave him alone... come on guys? Cohen (who, by the way is a Jew himself) is obviously m a k i n g f u n o f anti semitism, or at least he is trying to... he wants to show how unreasonable the hate or fear of the Jews is... I agree with that, cause i don't have anything against Jews or Americans or kazakhs or anyone for all that matters. But i do think that Cohen should leave this job for someone who is not a Jew, (so it would be less of a propaganda) or at least, for someone with the basic sense of humor...i don't think that the view of Borat making a fool of himself(at most times) or making fool of others(at some times), with gags based on ,e.g, the nudity of his over sized partner is funny in any way... how much did this movie cost, i wonder? ten bucks? a hundred? a million? i do not know. all i know is how much better would this world be if all this money could be invested on something else, like the help of hungry, sick , orphan kids dying every day around the world, instead of being wasted in the making of such garbage...",,Anonymous,Comedy
Very Funny But Too Sleazy: A Lot To Like & Dislike,"Where do you start in describing this movie? Well, for some adjectives I say:""Sleazy, irreverent, shocking, gross, biased, dry humor, dark humor, slapstick humor, profane, innocent, sad, sex-obsessed, hilarious, crude, outrageous, disgusting, insane, sexist, entertaining, weird, different, sex-obsessed, crazy, depressing, shocking, obscene, stereotypical, absurd, excessive, satiric, etc., etc.I did find it generally funny and yes - shocking in parts - and was mostly entertained but there are some typical filmmakers' agendas in here, one of them that portrays America to be filled with mostly uncouth, stupid people and I hope the intelligent readers here from other parts of the globe don't buy into that. Also, to be honest, the sleazy overwhelmed the humor and after an hour of watching - even though it was entertaining - I felt like I'd seen enough. I have to admit was surprised at the end that the real Pamela Anderson was in this.Since I am reviewer number 1,000 on this film, there is no reason to go into details about anything here.

Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius,"I, too, caught this early screening in Marina Del Rey. Thought the film was great... the ending could have had more kick to it and been a bit more drawn out, but I was laughing so hard throughout that I barely noticed. Unlike the other comments I read, the nude scenes and the naked wrestling repulsed me. But there were so many other scenes where I felt like I was going to pass out from the pure ridiculousness of it all. Again, Cohen cleverly draws out the ignorance of so many people from the ""U.S. and A."" and we're left shocked, humbled, more aware, and having stomach pains from the hilarity of how he does it. He again proves what people will do for the camera and how people's true colors shine when they meet someone with more radical beliefs than their own. I left the theater saying ""wow wow wee waaaaa""!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent synthesis of controversial character is nevertheless starting to show wear and tear,"Although worthy of nearly all the praise it has received, I must still confess that a torrential downpour of critical and public applause garnered with Borat's feature film debut left me asking where all the actual belly laughs were. Granted, being a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier HBO show does not help, as so much of the material Cohen uses, while admirably delivered and always uncomfortably topical, often recycles itself, usually to a point that fans of the comedic giant's past work would immediately recognize many of the lines uttered throughout this depraved travelogue.What separates the film incarnation from so many well delivered Ali G episodes does however justify a distinct appreciation. The well executed method finds loosely scripted, fictionalized plot setup running side-by-side with real world outings in which our Kazakh hero traverses the American landscape, brutally and unabashedly holding up reflections of ignorance for a general viewing public to revel in. These shocking, tension filled improvisational spats Borat engages in with all facets of the American public make for the most substantial segments, although in all honesty I was hoping for more subtle awkwardness then brash vulgarity. For too much of the films brief length, Cohen tries to shock viewers into contributing to the whirlwind of controversy the movie became, and by and large the excessive graphic nudity detracted from the flights of brilliance; what could have became one of modern film's most offbeat and unusual fight scenes became a cheap and blatant attempt at gross out theatrics.Though the pseudo-documentary may play the cheap cards a little too often considering Mr. Cohen's immense comedic talent, the foolish emotional arc that drove this tiny plot added a needed angle to Borat's film incarnation, helping flesh out much of the one-dimensionality. Strict fans may be a little disappointed with constant references from previous jokes, but the rest of the nation should continue to echo the praise this movie has garnered for being one of the most daring, relevant comedies to challenge society in years.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Attended 1st Ever Screening,"Many would probably agree... this film has the potential to either be amazing or absolutely awful. Last night I attended the first ever screening in Marina Del Ray. ""Borat"" is not only the hardest I've laughed in a theater since ""Wedding Crashers"", it may be the hardest I've laughed EVER. It it expertly handled, fusing fiction with non fiction and constantly testing the boundaries of taste and decency in the best, most socially revealing ways. In many ways, it is like a meeting of ""Breaking The Waves"" and ""Jackass"". It uses confrontational non-fiction set ups to create massive discomfort, and in the process, revealing both the light and dark of it's subjects.In fact, I found myself having a tough time labeling it. Although it is a definite step in the direction of ""Jackass"", it holds some of the same relevance as a Michael Moore documentary. Sasha Baren Cohen tears us apart with laughs, and in doing so, holds a mirror up to America in ways twice as revealing as any Michael Moore voice over ever could.This film, if Fox has the guts to really give it the push it deserves, could signal a dramatic shift and appeal to a very wide 20-30 yr old, left wing, educated demographic.This film is truly an incredible thing to witness.

I hope the final version includes the racier scenes and the MPAA doesn't pressure them to edit it (but they would surely be included on the DVD release). Basically it is a two hour journey following Borat across the U.S while he meets and greets all sorts of characters along the way. I don't want to give anything away but it manages to capture the hilarity of Borat from Da Ali G Show and hold it for the entire film. I was worried before I saw it because movies have a way of destroying all expectations brought forth from another medium but this film lives up to the challenge. Anyone who is a fan of the show will find themselves on the edge of their seats, trying not to spray urine on those close to them. We ran into Sacha after the screening and he gave us word that the release date was sometime over the summer, nothing specific but definitely something to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Racism and Satire aside.. it really wasn't that funny,"Borat has somehow managed to get a fairly high score. There has been much talk from it's critics of it being racist and needlessly offensive. The defenders of it claim it is all satire and people need to 'chill out.'The portrayal of Borat as a Kazakhstani is fairly generic. If you were to go into the film thinking Cohen is expecting you to see it is an accurate portrayal then the joke is on you. It's obviously exaggerated, as most of the movie is.On top of this (as in any movie showing 'how stupid Americans are') the people he interviews and their reactions have obviously been selected to accentuate this exaggerated approach. Some scenes are so exaggerated they would be considered slap stick, and then the slap stick moments are so amateur that it might as well be an episode of 'punkt' or 'candid camera' If you like Jackass, you might like this, but it's probably far too tame.The other thing that many have been mentioning is whether certain parts were staged or whether it was 'all real' Most people have caught on that the scene with Pamela Anderson is staged. The thing to ask is... was it all staged? I wouldn't be surprised. There are 'reports' of people in the movie taking Cohen to court, but whether these are actually part of the marketing and publicity of the film is yet to be revealed.The main thing you want to know is if the film is worth seeing. It comes across as an extended version of a TV skit. The first half hour is entertaining enough, the remainder of the movie is a bit flat.My Advice: Don't see it at the cinema. It might be worth hiring the DVD when it comes out if you're really bored and can't find anything else.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"If you are a fan of Borat/Ali G, you'll love it","I give the movie a 10 not because it is a 10 movie but it is a 10 Borat movie. Meaning, if you are a fan of Ali G and Borat you will find this movie hilarious. Hopefully you will find it funny even if you aren't. Tonight was the first public screening and the majority of the packed audience seemed to eat it up. I haven't laughed like that in a movie for quite some time. It is extremely crude with multiple full frontal male nudity shots which add to the humor of the film. I don't mean to say that it is inappropriate though. Those who take it for what it is will find it absolutely hilarious. I was surprised that so much antisemitism was included since it was a feature film. If a person didn't know that he is Jewish in real life I'm sure they would be truly offended. As for the format of the film, it is a blend between narrative and real footage. However it's very difficult to tell which parts are real and which are not and I will be very curious to find out if several of the bits were real or staged. There were times when I thought that I was watching something real and unscripted only for something to happen that seemed all too convenient for fitting into the plot thus prompting my curiosity. If you like Ali G or Borat (who is my favorite of his persona) then you have to check this movie out whenever it comes to theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a great example of American stupidity,"I am sure I am going to get comments on my summary name for this comment, but I don't really care.This movie was funny as hell, if you want a good laugh (and you are not sick of hearing people do their own Borat impressions) then go rent this movie and have a good time. There is a lot of really funny parts, a couple really stupid parts, then some parts that make you go ""if this wasn't planned ahead of time, they never would have gotten out of jail"".The reason I say it is an example of American stupidity, is that so many people IN the movie just didn't catch on. Once they did though, they were either angry, or too confused to do anything but go along with it. The fact that some of the people tried to sue Fox or any of the actors/writers just baffles me. If someone is filming you (regardless of what it is for) and you make a dumbass comment, you deserve to be exposed for the dipcrap you are. Suing them just draws more attention to you dumb ass.I laughed, I laughed harder, and I was mildly grossed out.All in all a pretty good time, just remember, some of it is only funny because so many people are so stupid.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An exceptionally funny movie,"Being a huge Borat fan, I went into the cinema with the highest of expectations. I was actually expecting to be let down by this feature film, but luckily Cohen kept the repetitions from his TV show on a very short leash - even avid admirers of his stunts will have a hard time not laughing, as he easily tops his previous endearments. As a matter of fact, the first hour is a non-stop laugh-fest: I have yet to see another movie that manages to blend slapstick & toilet humor as well as social criticism of the more degenerated states of America into a funny experience as this. Given, this movie doesn't even try to be PC, and part of the German audience was wincing during some of the stronger anti-Jewish jokes. But Borat, being Jewish himself, has no trouble at all with that - he generally just seems to promenade through the inadequacies and embarrassments of the North American societies. I cannot imagine the person that does not find this movie funny. I would go as far as to declare anyone not laughing at least thrice during the first half hour of the movie devoid of any humour. Yes, it is that good.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why does everyone think this is such a great movie?,"I just watched this movie and I have to say that it was not that funny...at all. Borat had some funny comments here and there, but overall I would classify it as dumb humor. I was actually getting irritated because Borat tried so hard to be outrageous and funny. I was definitely disappointed because I thought I was going to laugh so hard, but I only chuckled here and there. I guess I should have known it wasn't going to be that great because the actor who plays Borat is actually Ali G, but I didn't realize that at the time. I wish I didn't have to pay the movie ticket price, but I wouldn't mind getting this as a movie rental.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just not that funny,"This was the worst $9 I've ever spent on going to a movie. To me, it was completely lacking in originality and, well, humor. A few of the attempts at humor were based on a ""look at the unattractive naked people"" approach, but most was more of a ""I said something that's meant to be very offensive. Isn't it funny?"" technique or a ""Watch me make these people uncomfortable"" approach. I'm pretty difficult to offend, and I can't say that any of the movie really offended me. It was far too stupid to be offensive. The problem was that the movie just didn't entertain me at all. I held out hope that at some point, we'd get to see someone snap and really go after Borat/Cohen.

The theatre was going wild at several points during the film.

An unscripted mockumentary that ranks in the best of the genre.,"As far as mockumentary films go, Borat (2006) is at least in the top five. It may have not been as groundbreaking as This Is Spinal Tap (1984), but its use of real people's reactions to a parody of Eastern European stereotypes still shocks today. Perhaps having experienced some of the American sub-cultures that were mocked is what makes those parts of this film funny to me. It certainly has its gross-out moments, but Sacha Baron Cohen's performance is iconic.I think what makes Borat one of the best mockumentary films is its unscripted nature. Sure, they wrote Borat's dialogue in such a way as to provoke people (or get them to open up about their own racism/sexism/homophobia). However, the responses from these people feel completely genuine. The ones who accept Sacha Baron Cohen's bit and try to play their part straight are perhaps the funniest moments in the movie. Plus, I don't know if I can trust ice cream trucks after watching this.While a lot of this movie is funny, the sexual and scatological jokes haven't aged that well. I never cared for the extended sequence of two naked men wrestling through a hotel when I watched this movie the first time, anyway. For such a short film, some sequences seem to go on a bit too long past the point of being funny. I wonder if they just left the camera rolling long enough for these people to incriminate themselves and didn't want to cut anything from that footage. At any rate, this mockumentary borders on an unflinching documentary of cringe-worthy American sub-cultures. And if we can't laugh at ourselves, then maybe we're taking a movie like Borat too seriously.An unscripted mockumentary that ranks in the best of the genre, I give Borat 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It is funny but lets not pretend it is clever or has any wider social importance than providing some laughs,"In Kazakhstan one of the leading television personalities is reporter Borat Sagdiyev, who has covered the leading events in his wonderful country. However with many backward ways in their land, the Ministry of Information decide to send Borat to America with producer Azamat and a film crew. Their aim is to learn lessons from the US in order to return to make benefit Kazakhstan. However when Borat sees the television show Baywatch in his hotel room he becomes transfixed with CJ, aka Pamela Anderson and convinces Azamat that the documentary should be a road trip across the US, thus allowing him to get to California and find his love.Hyped to the point of hysteria, I joined a packed Saturday night cinema to see this film, wondering what all the fuss was about. Before I continue it is important to note that I'm not trying to be part of a backlash or anything here, because I did actually find the film quite funny at times. However, while some professional reviewers have praised this for being a wonderfully intelligent commentary on society and so on, I struggled to see anything going on here past Jackass-style humour and lots of easy targets. To this end the film is at its funniest when we are simply laughing at what an outsider Borat is. Whether it is the imaginative ways that his narrow-minded ways manifest themselves (throwing money at bugs thinking they are shape-shifting Jews for example) or the looks on the faces of those people shocked by his behaviour, viewers not easily offended will find something to laugh about here.And to me that is where the whole show begins and ends. Viewers keen to find it will claim that Cohen is using Borat to bring out the small-mindedness of others by using Borat as a trap to draw them out. However this only actually happens twice; once is a redneck with homophobic and anti-Muslim views (a redneck, what a surprise) and the other is a group of drunk students  neither very difficult targets and neither groups that I would expect much of in this regard. Conversely most people show how civil they are by being polite for as long as they can before eventually decided that they can take it no more  the crowd at the rodeo is one example but I could also cite the dinner party, the feminists and so on. With this the case I did wonder what the point was and concluded that there isn't one  there is no intelligent commentary to be made here and those seeing it are seeing it perhaps to justify laughing at racist etc humour. Because lets be honest, that what is so funny right? That Borat is so out of touch and shocking in his views and the way he is. I know that was what made me laugh many of the times, not because it was racist etc but mostly because he is imaginative with how he is. Of course this is not to say that the humour is still not racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and so on, because it is and I know that some sections of any audience will be laughing at it because of this. Likewise I know some will be uncomfortable with the humour and not care that it is done in an ironic, knowing sort of way. I fell somewhere in the middle; it was funny but I wish it had been a damn sight cleverer to justify the material.Overall then this is a funny film but it really has very little beyond the Jackass approach of basically doing pranks (in this case Borat himself is the prank) on ""unsuspecting"" people. It did draw laughs from me on this level but I was disappointed that it went for such easy targets and really didn't get much from any of them (some contributions are mere seconds). God only knows why it is so highly rated by my fellow users here but then that is why I give little or no credence to the top 250 list!",,Anonymous,Comedy

"Not constantly funny, but hilarious in places","I have to say, I went into this film with high expectations. Borat was always the funniest character on ""Da Ali G Show"" and Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a talented comedian, but somehow this film feels like an overlong sketch, and isn't as consistently funny as the segments on Da Ali G Show. However, that's not to say that Borat is in any way a failure - Cohen delivers his lines with brilliant comic timing, and there are several real standout moments in this film. Borat is presented as documentary made for Kazakhstan television, and the base plot is that TV presenter Borat is off to America in order to report on the cultural differences between the two nations. We are introduced to Borat first in Kazakhstan where he tells us of the seedy goings on in his local town. From there, we go with the Kazakhstan man to the USA, where he talks to various people before catching a glimpse of Pamela Anderson on Baywatch, and deciding to relocate the documentary to California; where he hopes to track down and marry the sinful Baywatch blonde.A lot of this film is like watching a train wreck waiting to happen. For example, at one point in the film; we discover that Borat is going to have a chat with a group of feminists, and it's not hard to imagine what's going to happen! Most of the humour focuses on the central character and the situations he gets himself into thanks to the fact that they apparently do things differently in Kazakhstan. The fact that the film relentlessly pokes fun at the Kazakhstan people means that I'm not surprised it wasn't well received over there, although I can't say it really bothers me all that much. The thing about Borat is that he's not poking fun 'his people', but rather poking fun at the world view of sensitive topics such as anti-Semitism, terrorism, homophobia and racism. Cohen's style of comedy puts the people being interviewed at the brunt of the joke, and half the time these people deserve this treatment for their extreme views (the rodeo sequence is of particular note in this respect). My main problem with this film is that it doesn't really leave a lasting impression on the viewer...although you have to respect the star for his willingness to constantly put himself in risky situations.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Uncanny, but suprisingly good","I wasn't sure what to expect when I first saw the film. I thought I would dislike it. With the poor filming and over the top sexual comedy. But as I watched it I soon became intrigued. The thought that this man actually drove around America filming this movie. Knowing the reactions of everyone but the two main cast members were real. Certain scenes such as the train scene was filmed with hidden camera's as Borat interacted with the people on the train. Or the Rodeo where the people were probably eager to beat him to death after what he said. There were so many times where I felt so bad for the guy and was cringing knowing it was not going to go well. I understand that the main point was to show how wild a certain culture can be compared to our ""modern"" one. The mockery was great creating a ton of laughing moments. But i couldn't help but feel bad for the poor actor with how everyone was treating him. It was a bitter sweet film that surprised me. Uncanny, but a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It attempts in a very childish way to extract some laughs, that's all. Any 7 year old can make fun of people this way.I cannot comprehend why the North American public likes this low and childish humor, other than to think that most regular citizen born on this continent live within some boundaries and clichés that make them narrow minded. Perhaps the people in this society that collectively attributed such a high rating to this movie have not been exposed enough to hardship and tragedy in order to be able to use real humor to laugh at itself other than using gross jokes.I was upset, angry and frustrated after seeing this movie and I profoundly regret every penny I spent on the ticket and if there was any way to recover them I would be first in line.

Overrated,"I liked the small clips of Borat I saw on Ali G, so I really was looking forward to seeing this film. However, after watching it, some of the gags worked, while others were plain terrible.Let me preface the following by saying I'm not adverse to offensive humor...hey, I love South Park. However, while South Park uses its humor to convey a (almost always) great message, ""Borat"" is filled with scatological humor that gets tiring after 40 minutes with nowhere to go. No doubt, the ""wrestling scene"" was hilarious, but with its multiple allusions to sex and body excrement, I got tired of it after a while. I think if half the sex/BE jokes were left out, and Borat was more ""gullible"" than his horny self and an uninitiated stranger to the American ways in a more realistic way (e.g. not presenting feces at a dinner table), this would have been a classic. But as some folks that I saw it with said...""in the end, the Americans won, because it showed them to be on the whole much kinder than the mind behind Borat"".

A revolutionary comedy,"Many years ago scientists created a robotic bee that got accepted into a real hive. The experiment raises a basic question: What was more notable? The device itself, or the fact that real bees accepted it as one of their own?That's the sort of question that crossed my mind when I watched ""Borat."" Even though Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as a fictional character, he takes this character out into the real world and films the reactions of people who assume he is for real. Part of the humor comes from the character himself, but equally important is the way that innocent bystanders are taken in by his antics. Out of this footage and some staged material, he spins a fictional story about Borat, a Kazakhstani journalist filming a documentary while traveling across the United States.At first, I had trouble formulating an opinion about the film, for the simple reason that it was so unlike anything I'd ever seen before that I had no point of comparison. Sure I laughed a lot, sometimes to the point of tears (the rodeo scene is tops for me). But usually when I'm watching a movie, I measure the experience by comparing it to other films. Here, my mind came up blank, because ""Borat"" is one of the few truly unique comedies I've seen. Not only is it one of the funniest movies in years, containing some of the most intriguing satire about racism since ""All in the Family,"" it takes comedy to an entirely new plane.I admit that I was slow to become a fan of Cohen's show. That's partly because his Ali G character was just a variant on something we've all seen many times before, even if the ""Candid Camera"" element offered a fresh twist on the material. Borat, however, is a highly original creation. If this character were to appear in a conventional movie, he would still be strange. At the same time, there's little doubt that his routines wouldn't be half as interesting if they didn't involve the general public.Borat is, to put it nicely, an ignorant buffoon. He has no social manner, thinking it acceptable to talk in graphic detail about sex and bodily functions no matter what the occasion. He's also a first-class bigot, putting down Jews, blacks, and women. Of all of Borat's traits, his garden-variety anti-Semitism has gotten the most press, because Cohen is in fact Jewish, and it's fascinating the way he gets people to accept his character and then to say things they wouldn't normally say to a reporter. In one of the more memorable bits from his show, Borat went into a redneck bar in Arizona and sang a song called ""Throw the Jew Down the Well."" How did the customers react? Why, by the third verse they were all clapping and whooping and singing along, making horn symbols with their hands on their foreheads. Is this comedy or investigative journalism?In the movie, Borat continues these sorts of shenanigans. Because the approach is so unique, even the familiar gags have a certain freshness. For example, we're all familiar with the cliché where a character eats a seemingly innocent food and then is told it's something gross. But I bet you've never seen a film where the star actually pulls the prank--for real--on an unsuspecting politician.Looking back on the movie now, I realize that there are some principles of comedy at work. One is that if you create a disgusting, vulgar character, you shouldn't try to soften him at the end. That's a principle that many Hollywood movies neglect (""Bad Santa"" comes to mind). Maybe it's because Cohen is British, not American, that he understands this principle. British comedy has long had a better grasp at how to handle unpleasant characters. Instead of half-apologizing for the material as American comedies tend to do, the British know how to take such material to its limits. One of Cohen's conceits is that his characters are static, never for a moment realizing their own idiocy. That's comedy.Perhaps what makes the offensive material easier to stomach is that Borat never shows any malice or ill intent. The man behind the character may be cruel, but the character himself is cheerful, friendly, and completely oblivious to the havoc he causes. He has horrible attitudes, but only because he doesn't know any better. The movie's purpose in springing this character on the public is to unmask the veneer of sophistication that so many Americans wear, to reveal the little prejudices we try so hard to cover up.There's a danger of something like this becoming a one-joke routine. ""Borat"" avoids that fate because the character is so multifaceted, finding so many creative ways to offend, shock, irritate, or just weird people out. And the movie spares no one. It isn't just an exposure of redneck bigotry. It also targets urbane, condescending liberals. One of the most hilariously revealing moments occurs when Borat sabotages an etiquette coach, who proceeds to shrug off his dirty, uncouth behavior as due to ""cultural differences.""Underlying the comedy are themes that some viewers might miss. Take the way that Borat is anti-gay but doesn't recognize his own homosexual behavior. He seems to oppose the idea of things without having a clue about their reality. He doesn't even recognize a guy wearing a yarmulke as Jewish. Only after the man's wife identifies as Jewish does he go berserk. (And not in a mean way: Borat is scared for his life!)Don't worry about the ""plot,"" in which Borat travels across the country with the intent of marrying Pamela Anderson (who I'm sure was in on the joke). It's mostly just a string-line for the gags, but along the way it satirizes various movie conventions, and the manner in which it incorporates the real-life ""stunts"" into the mix is rather brilliant. Comedy will never be the same again.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Could interrupt your breathing,"""Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan"" is genuinely ground-breaking cinema as the most gratuitously offensive work I have seen in over 40 years of film viewing - and yet it is brilliantly inventive in its politically-charged humour with endless visual and verbal gags that hit so many targets right between the eyes. I found it really funny and my wife thought it hysterical, at one point (the naked fight sequence) being in danger of stopping breathing.British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has a huge success here with his portrayal of a Kazakhstan television presenter making a documentary on his examination of American culture and his search for Pamela Anderson. Kazakhstan has no reason to object to this sending up of the nation which can only increase tourism and is as nothing compared to the exposure of the prejudice and hypocrisy of so many sections of American society ranging from fraternity houses to evangelical Christians.Footnote: Cohen - who is of course Jewish - seemingly makes a whole succession of anti-Semitic jokes while in reality exposing the ridiculous nature of ant-Jewish prejudice and (I am reliably informed by a Jewish friend), along the way, frequently spouts fluent Hebrew.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Cohen does this by being racist and sexist himself, however he is joking they are not. His brilliance shines in this one. An awesome movie and definitely worth seeing both for the comedic value and the insight into some racist and sexist American people.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hold on there Jethro--- this is OK, but great... NOT","'Borat' has some laughs. But how hard is it to ridicule a bunch of lower class Bible-belt hicks and rednecks, though? That doesn't take much imagination, and seeing their earnest adaptation to ignorance and poverty, over and over and over, wears a bit thin. A lot of the humor here was a 'cheap shot'. I don't object, I just point out that while this is a mildly amusing movie, and a bold concept, it is not a great movie. It is certainly not 'the funniest movie in years', as some are claiming. Maybe it was the funniest movie this month.It also has a lot of cringes too--- such as the naked fat man whose belly fat hangs down so low that his genitals are obscured from sight--- most of the time. He and Borat wrestle around stark naked, and mouths and anuses touch. Ewwww. But whatever.I kind of admire Cohen's boldness in making this movie, and I don't object to any of it. That's not to say I was thoroughly entertained at all times, either. I could have done without much of it--- especially the 'real life' candid-camera kind of confrontational humor. I HATE that kind of thing, personally. Preying on other people's basic good naturedness is a bit cruel, as is 'stealing' glimpses of their rather dreary and crappy lives, and holding them up for ridicule. We all have stuff we wouldn't want some smart-ass filmmaker to tape and put on the screen without our knowledge, or at least without our fully understanding what the joke is supposed to be. This was definitely a case of laughing at people, not with them. As the late, great Eudora Welty remarked, proper comedy satire is a tool for the weak to 'get back at' the powerful. This was the other way around. The 'powerful', the movie crew, exploited the weak, the dullards who got trapped in Cohen's 'jokes'. That's not proper, it's not nice, and it's not really all that funny. It's mean spirited and ugly at times.I would ordinarily not be so negative about a comedian I kind of like, because he does bend the noses of the Right-Wing Christians, powerful warlords, and even so-called Liberals, and the like. Except that so many people are hem-kissing and drooling and genuflecting in front of this movie, and it simply isn't THAT funny, nor is it THAT good.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny for some, mildly cute for others...","I must start with the fact that my wife LOVED this movie. She started laughing from the start, and didn't finish until we were leaving the theatre. I almost had to carry her.That said, I am afraid my enjoyment was considerably less. It was a very SILLY movie. I could ""see"" the humour, and understand what they were trying to do with it, I just didn't enjoy it as much.However if you like silly movies, then I'm sure you will like this one too. But if you're like me and prefer a different kind of humour (something along the lines of Mel Brooks), then you may be better off waiting for the DVD release, I suspect in a couple of months.Apparently there are videos up on youtube that you can watch as a hint to his style of humour. I only wish I had seen those ahead of time.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too many stereotypes,"Borat (Baron Cohen) is a reporter from Kazakhshtan (pictured as an undeveloped, savage illiterate uneducated country) that goes to the 'US and A' to make a documentary to import some of the greatness of America. The film shows the funny situations from the culture clash.The way the film is made is quite unorthodox because there are few actors and the main part of characters are people who really think they are talking to a reporter from Kazakhstan, just a candid camera. It is not surprising the huge controversy aroused as some of the people tricked into the 'documentary' have already sued Cohen.The film is funny. You will sure laugh at one stage or another. But there are many clichés and stereotypes that Cohen uses as he wishes presenting a subjective vision of society. First of all, he could have used a fake country instead of Kazakhstan. It would not been so easy to trick some of the 'victims' into the 'movie film' but the comical effect would have been the same without offending anyone. Just like Molvania from the guys of the hilarious travel guides from Jetlag Tavel (from which I think Cohen gets some of the inspiration).Then, there is the Jew issue. Although Borat (and all Kazakhstan according to the movie) is afraid of Jews and hates them profoundly, the film is not offensive to Jews at all. Jews pictured in the film are very nice people and the display of hatred against Jewish is so over stated and absurd that the irony is far from subtle. It cannot be any other way as Cohen is a Jew himself. However this is used as excuse: ""Look, I'm laughing at me making jokes about Jews... now I am legitimated to laugh at anyone as I wish"".The target of Cohen criticism is clear, the white Christian traditional southern people. He laughs at some evangelists in a church, high class republican southern people, drunk college guys, people attending a Rodeo... using sometimes hidden and sometime obvious insults, always protected by a camera and the ""I am from another culture, you should be respectful"". Some of the people pictured could be idiots but you can find idiots in every single community in the world. In fact, outside the USA the film has been taken as a opportunity to 'laugh at those stupid Americans'.Overall it is a really funny movie due to the absurd of the situations described and the hilarious acting of Cohen. Not very elegant and often rude but anus, penis and testicles are also part of humour. However, the rhythm of the movie is a little uneven getting more boring as time goes by making the short 80 minutes of movie a little bit too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Sick, racist, disgusting and boring","Sick, and racist. Everyone understands that the actor is a Jew, but that doesn't excuse racism anymore. Seeing an actual amputee in a poor Romanian Gypsy village with a gay rubber fist taped to his forearm - has exactly the same humor, as making a joke of the starving people of Nigeria.What we see in this film is that Cohen shows how much he hates Eastern Europeans, including Polish people, Romanians, Gypsies, and how much he hates Southern people, republicans, and Christianity, and virtually all American people. Only two positive characters exist in the film: the two orthodox Jews in the bread&breakfast scene. Cohen defended Borat as being a satire of how ignorant Americans are of other countries and their cultures, and even don't know where Kazakhstan is. I think this film is only shows how that he is very ignorant for all other cultures, including the American culture.What we see in this film, is the orthodox Jewish hatred, and Jewish racism. He thinks that he is superior, and while he hates every nation, he wants to condemn others, who don't like him. Furthermore he cannot demonstrate, or prove anything that he wants. In the gun shop for example it is just Cohen, who speaks loudly about killing the Jews, while the salesman doesn't say anything. Who were so daring to comment anything when a madman is shouting in the gun shop, about killing somebody in the presence of some cameras? The hatred is in Cohen's mind.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Painfully funny,"You know that feeling that you get when you've been laughing so hard and your side hurts? Well this is one of those films. Its a total shock fest!! I'd just like to say to all the people that rate this film badly, You have no sense of humor or you are from Kazakhstan.It is hilarious to the last. Its obvious that its pitched for a general Borat fan base new and long time followers as some stuff is repeated from earlier series episodes but the fun is all there. Its more of a tout at Americans than at Kazakhstan to be honest. How they react is what the film is all about! If it wasn't for their reactions it would not be as good so its not fair to say that this is not a good film.

A humor that can no longer exist,"Among all the comedy films I've seen, none has managed to make me laugh as much as Borat. Every scene is a masterpiece of humor. Sacha Baron Cohen delivers a remarkable performance, his ability to embody the character of Borat is incomparable However, it is unfortunate that this type of comedy is no longer possible today, given that it explores risky territories in terms of Borat clichés. Transcends mere entertainment to become a biting satire, brilliantly exposing the absurd prejudices that persist in our society. This film may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend it for those who appreciate intelligent and subversive humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"'Borat' was produced in Romania, not Kazakhstan","everyone talks about Kazakhstan, but the first part of the movie was actually shot in a small village in Romania called 'Glod' (='mud' in English). It is a very pour village, but it looks so real and so much better than the USA studios. And so much cheaper as well...the people only got 2-3 euro/day... And thinking of how much money the producers will make out of this...that's really shameful...everything looks so real and so cool 'cause they don't come from the imagination of a brilliant director, but they actually are the real thing. People's bedrooms, houses, clothes, car....everything. And they almost didn't pay a thing for all of these...I like the movie, but the way they used these people that are really simple and naive it's the real ugly part... That's the story behind the curtains of what it will be a major American box-office hit! success recipe: find a really really small village in the far-far away Romania and get inspired and rich (oh,...and don't tell anyone where you found it, so that you'll be the only genius around:))",,Anonymous,Comedy
"funny, hilarious","Not only is it a delightful and thoughtful comedy but it's also brilliant and conceptually intelligent. It flies over social satire films and documentaries I've seen so far; ""Borat"" is compulsively funny, ingenious and well acted by this English guy, who'll probably be a celebrity very soon. While making laugh, by means of gaffes, idiots and so on, Borat handles sexism, intolerance, transgression and wild racism. Tells very well about the way social biases are hidden, denied and encouraged, and it gets better and better the way the plot develops.

"A brilliant, original movie","This is one of the best, most original comedies I have seen. Yes.. it is rather offensive to the Jews.. but who cares??? I do have respect for the Jews and all other races on the planet.. but seriously, people need to get a life and stop complaining about everything. I'm Welsh.. if this movie said things like ""through a Welshman down the well"" or something like that.. I wouldn't cry about.. I'd be laughing my a$$ off twice as much! This movie isn't made to offend.. it's made to shock and entertain.. and that's one thing it definitely does, it's hilarious and so is the main character! If you think this movie is racist.. it's because you were looking for racism. Movies like this will only be offensive if you make them offensive. But enough about that.. it's a fact that this is a quality comedy. Borat is a brilliant character.. he's silly, crazy and very funny. There will never be a similar movie that can match the hilariousness of this movie, so please see it.. even if you are Jewish! I'm really shocked it's banned in most countries in the East.

Hilarious,"By far the best Sacha Baron Cohen movie. That isn't saying much considering the others are pretty mediocre, but Borat is absolutely hilarious. You can watch this solely as a silly comedy and there will be tons of great parts for you. However, the reason why this is such a good movie is because it's more than slapstick. The documentary aspect of this movie improves it so much more, especially since many of the scenes weren't staged and show real civilian reactions to Borat's shenanigans. The plot is fairly standard, but who's watching Borat for the plot? Instead of watching for the plot, watch this movie for the insanely quotable lines. Everyone knows at least one line from this movie, and if not then you at least know the iconic Mankini. Great movie that has been properly judged by critics but overlooked by the people, unfortunately.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A better move to the big screen than with ""Ali G""","A shameless remake of the vastly superior American movie ""Dubya: Cultural learnings of Iraqistan for make benefit glorious nation of U.S and A"", this movie was, in any case, perhaps the funniest movie of that year...or at least one of the two funniest movies of that year.Borat, like Dubya in the earlier movie, is one of those gormless innocent abroad types...always putting his foot in his mouth or acting inappropriately. ""Borat"" doesn't have a classic scene like ""Dubya"" has (who could ever forget that achingly funny scene where the military police come looking for the draft dodger Dubya but can't find him, as he is hiding under his bed? Of course, when Dubya comes crawling out from under his bed and utters his by now trademark catch-phrase ""Mission accomplished"", does the whole cinema fall about laughing helplessly) but it has many moments that approach the former movie's hilarity.For instance-when Borat stays at a Jewish American family's bed and breakfast and expresses patently absurd beliefs about them. For many people, the funniest scene is the gross out moment when Borat unintentionally engages in a ""69"" type position with a morbidly obese man.This is a very funny but provocative and ill-mannered pseudo-documentary about a bigoted foreigner in the US. Of course, that he gets away with his dreadful behavior reflects badly on the real Americans he encounters (most of the people in this movie are not actors but real people/dupes). In fact, the truly dreadful people are the ones Borat encounters, not him, as he's not exactly real, is he?This is writer/performer Sacha Baron Cohen at his best. I think he has brought his TV show (""Da Ali G show"") to life on the big screen with this movie. It's a real shame that his first effort on the big screen (""Ali G indahouse"") was a dud for straying from the elements which made his TV show so good...interaction with real people.This movie is hilarious but not for the squeamish or easily (or uneasily) offended.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The movie was ""Borat,"" a satirical masterpiece created in 2007, and I had seen its uproarious impact before. It stirred controversy by humorously exploring American culture for the supposed benefit of the people of Kazakhstan.The film had a clear mission-to playfully exaggerate certain aspects, especially emphasizing anti-Semitism and gender discrimination. Now, having watched its sequel, a 2020 production, I found it to be a concoction of politics, satire, and absurdity.

I loved the music and songs added to the movie, as they express the culture of different countries.. there are crazy hysterical scenes.. When he put his excrement in a bag and showed it to the family here, I literally died. When he recognized a group of rude people and then imitated them with the movement of his pants and entered the hotel, this was iconic. The acting performance was terrible, even though the actor was British, but he mastered the dialect as if he was new to the language and method. His pronunciation, his expressions, and the way he spoke were all original. There were moments that were unnecessary in the movie and were bad, like when he started talking to the cowboy and how he described Muslims as terrorists. I think this was a clear insult to Islam and I did not like it. When he started fighting. With his friend While they were in the hotel without clothes, it was very disgusting. I didn't like moments like this and they made me feel uncomfortable while I was watching.

Give Sacha Baron Cohen an Oscar!!!,"Over the years the Oscar award has been given to an actor or an actress who embodies their role, who become a character and have us convinced in their portrayal. Last year Philip Hoffman had me in complete awe with his mesmerizing portrayal of Capote, his voice, mannerisms, eyes, everything about him was convincing and whats more he held that for the entire film consistently. Other past movie characters that have done the same include Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Corleone, Al Pacino's Tony Montana and Anothony Hopkin's Hanibal Lector. But what one needs to understand is that these characters were in a controlled environment, not to take away anything from them, but what would happen next and what they would say next was right there for them... and they completely hit it out of the park!! Sacha Cohens character of Borat, one needs to understand, isn't simply a ""prankster"" or a ""funnyman"". Sacha Cohen considered a PhD before starting his show, he is cold and calculated in his writing and approach. This is pure satirism, he is, thru Borat, trying to get at the underbelly of the US and pull out a quivering pile of ignorance to show to the world. We laugh at him, we laugh at the jokes he makes, but we question through our laughter. We question the mentality of the American people, and by extension..almost all people.Holding the character of Borat is a HUGE feat!! the accent, mannerisms, Borat's walk, everything is extremely convincing, so much so that many many many people have fallen victim to him, put down their guards and said some fairly outlandish stuff.This is wonderful acting, and i pray it is recognized. i know many may not agree with his bashing of the Jewish population (although Cohen is himself Jewish) but we need to understand that he bashes the Jewish population to get a certain reaction, to create a certain familiarity with the people he is with, and that familiarity is shocking...can people actually...agree with Borat? I pray the best actor Oscar goes to Cohen, someone who has so dedicated himself and is so convincing in the role of Borat that we forget that underneath Borat is a British intellectual trying to figure out whats wrong with peoples thinking!! - Harpinder Soomal",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"To me,it was hilarious.I don't know why everyone hated it.","I've read loads of comments on IMDb that hated the movie for its strong crude humour,discrimination of Jews and Gypsies,and grossness. I don't care if lots of Americans didn't like it,I actually thought Borat,who was played by Sasha Baron Cohen,was a hilarious scream who was trying to prove to America that we all need to have a good laugh at something every now and then and learn to not take everything so seriously ALL THE TIME.Don't get me wrong,even I thought Borat was a freak at first when the movie came out in theaters.But when I got the film on DVD,I laughed so hard because everything in the movie throughout was brilliant though not intelligent.Borat was better than Jackass.The stunt guys in Jackass were,well,jackasses.Sasha Baren Cohen has incredible comedic talent, he's the funniest actor I've seen in years,though I liked Jim Carrey as well,I think the actor who played Borat was pure genius in comedy. The American characters in the movie weren't that amusingly funny,but so far Borat made the movie funnier.One thing that surprised me was Sasha Baren Cohen got hundreds of lawsuits from people in the movie for being filmed unexpectedly and humiliation of Kazacstan,and there's also been a controversy about Borats comment in the movie about the war in Iraq.But Borat is a character who in the story is politically incorrect in a hilarious way.So I say it's okay to laugh at an un-PC movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Funny American Adventure But Poor Kazakhstan!,"'Borat' is both a comical and offensive movie that tackles the 'American' way of thinking with a touch of humour. The title character's take on pretty much every sensitive issue such as Judaism, homosexuality, feminism, prostitution, racism, fanaticism and ignorance. The film balances its portrayal of Americans quite well: There are the kind hearted who treat Borat with kindness (The Jewish Couple), there are those who threaten to use violence when he attempts to hug them (The New Yorkers), those who look down upon him (The Texans), those who in a split second turn against him (the rednecks)... But, Borat's interaction is conducted with a sense of comedy. The humour is crude, explicit, disgusting and even brutal at times but there are a number of sequences that had me laughing out loud such as Borat's experience with the 'gypsy', the feminist group, the well-meaning Jewish couple, the bear... The Borat-Luenell track is among the sweetest moments. I think what the film tries to remind us is that people should lighten up and not take everything too seriously. While I enjoyed most of the American adventure, I did not like how poor Kazakhstan was 'torn to shreds'. A make-belief country could have easily been done with instead of having to offend an already existing country. As stated earlier, some of the 'comic' tracks are a bit too far fetched till the point of being revolting like the hotel nude fight between Borat and Azmat. Thus, this brings the film down a notch in my view.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Amusing Yet Overhyped,"Borat, known for its controversial humor and unique approach to comedy, receives a 6/10 from me. While the film has its moments of genuine hilarity, I find myself somewhat at odds with the overwhelming hype it has received.The movie's strength lies in its boldness and the willingness of its star, Sacha Baron Cohen, to push boundaries. Borat's character is outrageous, and his interactions with unsuspecting people bring a level of unpredictability and shock value that can be quite amusing. The film's satirical take on cultural differences and societal norms is clever at times, offering some insightful commentary through its absurdity.However, despite its comedic value, Borat doesn't quite hit the mark for me in terms of being a standout comedy. The humor, while unique, is not consistently engaging, and at times, it feels a bit too forced or over-the-top. This aspect might be why I don't fully connect with the hype surrounding the movie. It's funny, but it doesn't consistently deliver the level of entertainment or the comedic impact that I had anticipated.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Wildly uneven and a bit cruel,"This is a very difficult film to review since there is absolutely nothing like it. Sacha Cohen perpetrated a hoax by traveling across America claiming to actually be a visitor from Kazakhstan. However, instead of begin a documentary, it was a comedy in which Cohen acted like an obnoxious idiot and filmed how people reacted to him. In other words, most of the participants had no idea it wasn't a documentary and most of those on film appeared to be exceptionally patient with Cohen--even when he behaved like a boorish idiot (such as when he and his 400 pound friend ran naked through a hotel or pretended to become ""born again"" at a Pentacostal revival meeting). In some ways this was very funny and in others very cruel. Because of this, at times I laughed loudly but others I was just too uncomfortable and felt sorry for the people who were tricked into being in the film. As far as the humor goes, it was wildly uneven. Some was extremely funny and on target. Other portions were exceptionally crude and really seemed intended to make idiots laugh.Sadly, despite being rated R and having LOTS of adult content, kids at the school where I teach saw it in huge numbers. I am NOT one to blame the movie, however, as it made no pretenses about being a family film. It was crude, offensive and very adult and this was not kept a secret when it was marketed. However, parents just didn't bother exercising reasonable judgment and many pre-teens were taken to see a movie I would have been embarrassed to take my teens to see. Bad parenting should not be blamed on Fox Films or Cohen. So my advice is to see it--but DON'T let your kids. It's just too jam-packed full of crudeness. It's definitely an adult guilty pleasure.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Wildly overpraised,"It seems to have become somewhat of a trait for Sacha Baron Cohen's creations to fall in their quest for big screen stardom. Ali G's limp ""Indahouse"" followed the characters phenomenal TV success, ultimately failing as Cohen removed what is his greatest asset, the reactions of members of the public to his overblown stereotype. Having taken a bit of a lull from the limelight, Cohen returned with news of an upcoming big screen outing for his lesser known, but arguably even funnier creation ""Borat"" the Kazakhstani news reporter. The swarm of media attention certainly built up a huge audience for the movie (and secured it as a financial success), but ultimately only enhanced it's failings by revealing what turned out to be among the funniest sketches again, and again, and again.Yet it all seemed so promising, far from a carbon copy of his previous venture with his other character. The trailers suggested a film crammed with hilarious candid camera gags as the hapless Kazakh fired his extreme views and racist jibes at members of the public, exposing the shocking cultural prejudice that exists in today's American society while simultaneously delivering gut crunching laughs. Finally Cohen playing to his strengths, surely the film is one big joyous extension of the razor sharp TV sketches? Unfortunately not, while efforts have been made to maintain the public reactions (which are at times as funny as ever) the attempted ""plot"" is still present in full force. Not only do these scripted sequences fail as a whole, they also undermine the great public sketches that form the meat of the comedy. By inserting them into the story, with Borat's overweight producer never far behind, how ""real"" the reactions are come into question. This is something that doesn't (and certainly shouldn't) occur to you in his TV work. Instead of monologue followed by sketch followed by monologue, we have a thoroughly unconvincing story that lessens the weight of the character.As a larger than life stereotype in the public domain, he is ceaselessly amusing. In the film it is almost as if Cohen is trying to emulate himself sometimes, subtlety lost in favour of cheap, obvious laughs that aren't particularly clever. Plain and simple, Cohen has overdone the character, simplifying him and losing something along the way. Even in publicity interviews it seems he is trying too hard (Wow-wah-wee-wah, High Five) Our awareness of his clever ""acting"" is dulled, giving way to a scripted character that just isn't all that funny, at times even bordering on the offensive. Yes, most of us are aware that the comedy is without seriousness, yet you begin to wonder whether some people are laughing for all the wrong reasons. It is this that proves a little sad. Controversial as his methods are, Cohen is still trying to drive home a point about prejudice and cultural understanding. There are moments in this movie world where Cohen's signature becomes a little lost, some particularly cheap gags giving you the feeling that the racism is the joke and their necessity is called into question.How successfully Cohen's ulterior motive translates to modern audiences is debatable. Has the success not really been built on the hilarity of ""that Kazakh guy who hates Jews and women""? However it is not all bad, certain scenes showcase Cohen at his very best, with clever, biting satire, a reminder of why we really love Borat. Even some of the scripted scenes come off rather well, slapstick maybe, but successful none the less (the naked fighting scene is so wonderfully outrageous and distasteful that it forms perhaps the best scene in the entire film, the one moment where the scripted Borat meets the public reaction spectacle entirely successfully). Cohen is a talented comic, though it is clear that his true domain is in television. An improvement on ""Indahouse"" most certainly, but in the end here lies a merely average comedy film in the place of a potentially outstanding one.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A very funny movie film,"I like the fact that so many people tried to get themselves removed from the Borat film. Look, you got caught being a sexist, or a racist, or a gigantic pussy  just live with it; that's the whole point of Borat, to expose people's prejudices and idiocy with a sly wink of complicity. Sure Sacha Baron Cohen helped put the noose round your neck, but you chose to hang yourself.The scene that makes me laugh the most in Borat is the dinner scene where the Kazakh reporter is invited to a posh Southern dinner party. At first he embarrasses himself in a minor way by asking whether one of the guests is a retard and by questioning the attractiveness of one of the women, but despite this the hostess is still optimistic. When Borat excuses himself to go to the toilet, she confidently states that it wouldn't take much to civilise this uncouth individual  he could be Americanised in no time. But then Borat returns with a pile of poo in a bag  his poo. This causes red faces aplenty, but still the hostess tries to muddle through. She even shows Borat how to defecate properly. But it's only when a black prostitute comes a knocking at the door that the hostility begins. Somehow defecating in a bag, calling someone a retard and calling a guest ugly is acceptable (albeit in an exasperating kind of way), but the presence of a black person in this Southern haven is beyond the pale. Nothing is more offensive than this.Another scene that jabs at America's dark underbelly is the rodeo sequence. Yeah, Borat's cries of jingoistic encouragement are amusing, but it's the exchange between Borat and the cowboy that's more revealing. This fool spouts nonsense about killing all the Iraqis and then suggests that all of America's homosexuals should be removed too. He even says something along the lines that 'they' (he takes it upon himself to speak for the country) should all be strung up. And this is what makes Borat such a great character. By acting like such an idiot he puts everyone at their ease. And it's only when people are comfortable that the truth comes spilling from their mouths.Another painful truth is the misogyny that is present in certain sections of American society. The frat boys, for instance, spout nonsense about men being better than women. Indeed, after the tearful revelation that Pamela Anderson is not a virgin, they tell a distraught Borat that he's better than any female. For all the progress that Western society has made, it still hasn't really got that far. And also in the frat boy sequence, the drunken idiots claim that the minorities have the most power. What the hell have they been smoking? Doubtless, later in life, when their marriages fall apart and their careers go nowhere, they'll blame the Jews, the gays and the blacks for their failures. They'll do anything but take a hard look at themselves.A less insightful sequence that had me chuckling was the one on the New York subway. I just love how willing New Yorkers are to tell someone to go f*** themselves. Here in London, Borat's acts would only be greeted by looks of bemusement and the odd muttered insult. New Yorkers, though, are perfectly happy to get in someone's face. And there's an even funnier bit on the streets where a New Yorker, backed into a corner by Borat, tells the Kazakh to get out of his face, that he'll pop him in the balls if he doesn't back away (?!?). Quite why this individual would chose to pop Borat in the balls, I'm not sure (there are so many easier places to pop), but the humourless 'get out of my face' aggression that is particular to New York never fails to put a smile on my lips.Something else that put a smile on my lips was the naked wrestling scene. There are few things less joyous in life than two men fighting in the buff ('my moustache still tastes of your testes', says Borat later on). And I love the way that Borat's penis is obscured by a massive black letterbox. You just know that Borat has been in the editing room, trying to make himself look as good as possible. But although the homoerotic grappling garners laughs aplenty, there's a wonderful little moment that is easy to miss. The fight spills out into the hotel and they even get into a lift. But while most of the people run out in horror, one man remains  he stares passively forward, desperately trying not to lose his dignity.But although the film points its finger at the numerous freaks and idiots it encounters along the way, it also points its finger at the audience. Just how willing are we to buy into this myth of Kazakhstan  a place where old ladies are 34, where cattle live in houses with their owners and where men snog their sisters (and who are also prostitutes). Few things give us greater pleasure than a false sense of superiority. Our lives may be rubbish, we think, but at least we don't have it this bad. Therefore you can't help but ask yourself why you're laughing at some of these jokes  am I really that far removed from the homophobic cowboy or the misogynistic frat boys? My excuse is that I'm a jerk. What's yours?",,Anonymous,Comedy
A swipe at political correctness more than a comedy,"Fans of Ali G and Bruno are likely to be disappointed.Borat seems to aim to shock at least as much as to amuse. While the film contains enough occasions for hilarity, it also gets increasingly baffling as the delirious storyline achieves a pitch. A number of questions suggest themselves to the mystified viewer. Why does Borat greet people in Polish? Are the antisemitic fantasies really meant to be funny and, if so, who are they poking fun at exactly? Americans, Kazakhs, anti-semitism in general? In many of the scenes whose victims are unwitting, who is meant to be holding the camera? In fact, while some of Cohen's targets exhibit the customary tendency to put foot in mouth, even degenerating into pure crassness, others seem rather polite and patient with his antics.Perhaps this is simple mystification, after all.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The outrageously funny Method Acting ever reigned on screen.,"Sacha Baron Cohen went everywhere with his ,somewhat,split personality character,BORAT.He has promoted his film by staying within the character.He has been applying method acting to its most extreme.And I can't think of any other actor,if I can recall any,who could play Borat with this kind of genuine hilarity.Welcome a new kind of Comic King,one that is more winier and Divine than Jim Carrey.I can't remember a single moment in my life when I laughed this hard.It's perhaps my first time that I laughed out really hard and loud in a public place,that is in the theater.I couldn't help it.It was unbelievable.Every scene,every joke,every gag just threw me laughing until I heard a crack in my ribs.And believe me ,if you will,I guarantee you with everything that you will laugh your hardest.You have my word.You won't laugh any harder or louder anywhere.No movie, I can make sure of that, will make you laugh this insanely hard. My head was hurting once I stopped laughing,and my cheeks gave me severe pain. But mind you,this is the most offensive and racist comedy too.Its remarks and its suggestive content is gonna make at least someone in the crowd angry.The TV Reporter of Kazakhstan,BORAT introduces his country and all the great stuff you can do in his country.He shows you his hometown around.You can play ping pong,disco,have sex,curse,offend,sun-bathe,and all that,while introducing the #2 or 3 or 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan,who happens to be his sister.He is then assigned to go to the country he loves, US&A,to discover the cultural and social world of the ""Best Country in the World"".He gets his documentary crew and heads to the States,and then begins his wild,insane,and silly encounters with the natives and their world,as a cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.But instead of doing what he was suppose to do,he goes off searching for Pamela Anderson and to propose to her so that he could take her back to his glorious country.It's a merciless,shameless comedy.And I think this is something more original than anything I've seen in the last passing years.A comedy at 80 minutes plus,with every single minute worth a laugh.I say save all your money for this graphically offensive,explicit and the most insanely wild laugh riot.Because you may have go back and watch it again and again until you give up laughing.I've already planned to watch it again once it's officially released.And boy,what moolahs it will make.It's a phenomenon of a new kind.And you thought JACKASS was funny?Forget that,here's something that will not only come to you as a racist film but as a film that you won't find anywhere else,cuz no film will make you laugh this hard and be as daring and original as this. I think I'm going crazy.I've gotta go watch it again and I can't wait for it to release.Any more free screenings or festivals and I'm there if it's showing.The Dialogues are ingenious and utterly laugh out loud hilarious.It's phenomenal work.I loved the script.It's main purpose is to make you laugh like you've never laughed in your entire life watching a film.It's a miracle of a comedy.Cohen is ,I don't know,unbelievable?I see of no reason why he should be overlooked at the next year's Academy Awards.If not that,he will surely win the MTV awards for the sake of the audiences.Whatever's gonna happen to this film at the box office,one thing is for sure,it will break a bone or two after it ends.I know I broke a few while laughing my butt off.Truly original comedy with method acting at its best.So,please for the sake of Borat,look/see his movie-film or else he'll be execute by his government.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Crude and gross but with some telling satire,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Although superficially this mockumentary would seem to be a satire of the people of Kazakhstan or the citizens of any country thereabouts, it is really a satire of America the beautiful. Surprise! It makes some good points and there are some laughs. Mostly though I think the average viewer would be grossed out about half the time. But that's okay. For the average movie-goer or DVD watcher, getting grossed out is a lot better than being bored.Of course you might be bored too. Personally I don't think I could watch the naked mock fight between Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitan) again. I wasn't so much grossed out as made to feel that really I ought to find better ways to waste my time.Yes, we're bored in America. Our neurons are sated with violence, pornography, and crude, boorish behavior toward our fellows (both real and on TV and in the movies). Which is why, to be successful, people like Sacha Baron Cohen have to turn up the crude volume to get the old laugh-o-meter activated. A glimpse of stocking used to be looked on as something shocking, now, heaven knows, anything goes.But should we care? Yes, your preteen sons are going to find out who in the neighborhood has this DVD and they're going to watch it. Will they be scarred for life? Will they ""get it""? Will it make them uncouth? Will they watch it more than half a dozen times? One of the interesting things about this movie is the publicity it got and the controversy it engendered. Kazakhstan initially was greatly offended and protested loudly at this misrepresentation of its people. But then they thought it over and realized that maybe this isn't necessarily such a bad thing. In Hollywood any publicity is good. They probably figured out that what is being made fun of is the average American's provincial attitude toward foreigners. Cohen goes a long way toward proving that with the scene at the rodeo, for example, where his line, ""We support your war of terror!"" gets a nice round of applause. And the guy who thinks that somebody with a moustache looks like a Muslim who looks like a terrorist adds a little to the impression that Americans, when they think about foreigners, think superficially.Actually, they don't do any real thinking. Xenophobia reigns supreme in the heartland--but that would be the heartland of any country. The frequent anti-Semitic shtick throughout was originally aimed at Europeans, I understand, who despite the embarrassment of the Holocaust are apparently as anti-Semitic as ever. But Cohen, who is Jewish, makes fun of the antisemitism of Muslims as well as Westerners. And he makes fun of the uneducated and uncouth as well as the superficially sophisticated--witness the scene at the Magnolia Fine Dining Society.Some people sued or threatened to sue. Some guys from the University of South Carolina who were caught off guard and drunk, mouthed some stupidities for all of the world to hear. They sued but lost the case, I understand.Larry Charles of TV's Seinfeld fame directed. He achieved some tension with the simple plot of Borat coming to American and making a road trip across the land to California to meet and hopefully mate with Pamela Anderson. That was pretty funny. I understand that some of the scenes were staged and scripted, for example the book signing scene with Miss Anderson was at least partly staged. But other scenes were play-as-you-go with Cohen just making up stuff and saying provocative things to get reactions from the innocents. The scene in the bathroom with the woman from the Magnolia Fine Dining Society was pretty funny as she explains to Borat so seriously and so sincerely how to wipe himself.Bottom line here is, should you bother to watch? My answer: maybe if you can stand the crudities, and maybe if you don't squirm at satire directed at Americans. On the other hand, this is not in my opinion in the same league as some other famous comedic movies. Certainly it is not nearly as good as Blazing Saddles (1974), which I was watching the other night. Finally, the techniques used by Cohen and Charles are interesting in their own right because of the reaction of people who were taken in, or somewhat taken in, and so that they ended up saying some outrageous and embarrassing things.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

OVERRATED but still funny,"Starring Sacha Baron Cohen of ""Da Ali G Show,"" Borat! is a roaring upbeat and different comedy to the contemporary world of cinema. Larry Charles, co-creator of television hits, ""Entourage"" and ""The Tick"" directs this hilarious documentary-style picture.Cohen stars as the hilarious goofball from the great nation of Kazakhstan on a mission to learn about American culture. Along with his friend Azamat, (Ken Davitian) they go on wacky adventures and educational expeditions. All changes until Borat catches an episode of ""Baywatch"" and sees Pamela Anderson. His agenda then becomes to travel to California to capture the lady's heart.Sacha Baron Cohen inhabits Mr. Borat with his famous antics and even more funny wit. Being touted as one of the best performances of the year is a bit of a stretch, the film lacks a lot of the flavor I presumed based on word of mouth. Cohen holds it together most of the time without going over the top, the film's lack of smart comedy in lieu of slapstick, grotesque comedy is a little overwhelming.As his overweight friend, to say the least, Davitian brings an different element to the film but he is the main reason for the grotesque humor stated earlier. Not as clever as Cohen, the performance is an admiral turn nonetheless.The perfect way to describe this piece is overrated. Funniest film of all time? Definitely not. Oscar-worthy? Not a chance. The surprise screenplay nomination? Are you kidding me. Popcorn movie, that's what this is. It didn't raise the bar for comedic films, it kept it exactly where was before.Grade: ***/****",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Let's be serious...,"Honestly, this film isn't that great. I've been a long time fan of the Borat sketches, going back to Da Ali G Show in Britain years ago. The material shown in the Borat movie is almost all a stale rehash of what he has done in past years. Although many people may not have seen previous Borat sketches (and therefore might be more inclined to laugh during the movie) that does not help this film where it fails the most: The majority of the screen time is spent on pointless scatological, sexual, and otherwise juvenile jokes. It's awkward, its painful, and yes, it is funny, but it hardly merits the raving reviews this film has been getting. Except for a few scenes --Frat boys and Rodeo-- there was very little of interest in this movie. I also had the distinct impression that much of it was made from unused footage from Baron Cohen's HBO series with the ""plot"" scenes tacked on to give some justification for Borat's antics.

I like.,"Sacha Baron Cohen brings his best creationthe Eastern European TV presenter Boratto the big screen in 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', a movie which follows the (somehow) likable Jew-hater (accompanied by his friend Azamat Bagatov) as he makes his revealing documentary about life in the USA.Cohen cleverly (and rather bravely) uses his naive, racist and sexist Kazakhstani character to expose the bigots and idiots that often give the US a bad name, whilst simultaneously delivering some of the funniest cinematic moments in recent memory.Whether it is an average Joe on a subway train, a group of frat boys on a road-trip, or a room-full of people at a seminar, absolutely no-one is safe from Borat as he reveals a country brimming with hatred, distrust, and intolerance: it's a sad moment for the human race when Borat politely introduces himself to a stranger, only to be met with threats of violence.Of course, Borat's style of comedy is not going to be to everybody's taste: the more conservative of viewers may balk at the toilet humour and bad taste gags; rednecks and religious extremists will more than likely froth at the mouth at particular moments; and many Eastern Europeans probably won't like Cohen's portrayal of one of their own. The rest of us, however, should have a whale of a time.Some of Cohen's schtick might seem a little old hat to those familiar with Borat from UK TV, and, occasionally, the film has the tendency to feel somewhat staged (the Pamela Anderson segment is rumoured to have been set-up), but the movie's outrageous highlights more than make up for these minor quibbles.And if you're intending to watch this film on DVD, make sure to catch the hilarious deleted scenesone word: cheese.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Is it because they is American?,"The majority of critics, with the noble exceptions of Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday and Phillip French in the Observer, have been wetting themselves over the Borat movie, which opened last week, although from the mountain of press it has received it seems to have been with us for months. The effect of all this hype has been to deflate most of the gags  seeing it this weekend, it all felt awfully familiar.More importantly, the film fails in what was surely its main aim  to ridicule any American unfortunate enough to fall into Baron Cohen's trap. Other than some chilling scenes at a rodeo, and a crass fraternity party which was obviously set up, all the people he meets are unfailingly polite, non-judgemental and open to him as an outsider. In particular, a group of feminists show quite remarkable restraint in the face of imbecilic provocation, and a dinner party group similarly behave with the utmost civility even when faced with the character's unspeakable rudeness.So the joke  hey, look at these dumb Yanks  rebounds completely, and in an odd way, ends up at the expense of the European audiences watching.

"Crude, boorish, offensive... and funny!","This is one funny film. Those who just want to revile it for breaking all of society's taboos just need to get over themselves and laugh.Borat comes across as an anti-Semitic, racist homophobe, but remember, folks, Cohen is ACTING! He's an actor, people. And he's a comic. He's supposed to tell dirty, offensive jokes. That's his vocation.What's really offensive, yet hilarious, is the way the people in the US are exposed as the racist, homophobic rubes they really are.And when I saw Borat and his traveling companion Azamat get into their hotel room wrestling match, I almost laughed myself sick. I'd never seen a display like that before, and I hope I don't again, but at the time I saw it, I thought my heart would stop. When this encounter spilled over into a real estate brokers convention, well, that was all she wrote.Don't bother with this if you're an uptight airhead. You won't enjoy it.

"Striking, hilarious and courageous","Here we have what is probably one of the best comedy features of the last twenty years and for me without a doubt the best film of Sacha Baron Cohen's career.
The film tells the story of Borat, a reporter from Kazakhstan who travels to the United States to make a documentary on American behavior.
One of the points that most catches my attention is the script, which, however simple and without major surprises, is still great and with excellent jokes. One point that I need to emphasize is that it is definitely not a film for everyone, because the feature presents jokes with basically all ethnicities, religion, lifestyle, etc. and for some people it can be a type of humor considered ""offensive"", but it is a humor that pleases me is why I like the movie so much. After all Sacha Baron Cohen is in one of the best performances of his career (perhaps the best).

You could consider these jokes as being likewise to the Jackass or any other gross-out comedy, but this has intelligence & a style all of its own. Cohen touched the screen with a marvelous comedy that I don't think he can ever do again because of infamous popularity & cult status. Granted he was sued many times over, had the cops called on him nearly 100 times during production & caused an enormous amount of controversy in the press, he succeeded in making a cinematic classic & deserves his film to watched for years to come.

Sacha Baron Cohen Is Hysterically Funny and Yet Moving,"This rude and raucous faux documentary is hysterically funny, scarily penetrating in its look at American culture, and oddly moving.First off Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely fabulous. He's got to be the bravest actor who ever lived. He goes basically ""under cover"" as Borat and braves some of the ugliest Americans I've ever seen. All the time he is in character, he probes and cajoles and insults a wide spectrum of Americans who I am afraid mostly come off (in turn) as a batch of crude, smug morons. The view we get of ourselves as a culture is quite, quite chilling.This is a film that could be deconstructed and analyzed for ages and always come up with something new. The nicest characters Borat meets on his journey across America are the black prostitute and the black street boys. The others are a pack of bigots, humorless drones, and people terrified of him. Borat uncovers an underbelly of mainstream America that is every bit as ugly and filthy and ignorant as the third-world village he so proudly shows us at the beginning of the film. And this is exactly the type of humor that many American viewers didn't get. The humor is always what is seems to be.For all the anti-Jewish ranting in the film, the fact is that Cohen is a devout Jew. The British comic turns everything upside down but the condescending dolts he meets along his journey only see him as he presents himself. They can't get past the accent, the rumpled suit, the bad hair, the stereotype, etc.The film is not politically correct and is filled with hilarious bits, sight gags, slapstick, word play, etc. and Baron Cohen is very, very funny. He constantly catches the audience off guard. Just the sight of Borat and his sidekick (Ken Davitian) zooming across America in a 1950s ice cream truck is funny. That they also have a bear as a passenger adds a level of absurdity that goes beyond inspiration in the same way the Marx Brothers did in the 1930s.Sacha Baron Cohen won a Golden Globe and certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his incredible portrayal. But I'm afraid this inspired comedy, even though a box-office hit, went over the heads of the establishment.The ending of the film is surprisingly sweet after the ride Borat has taken us on. Not to be missed!d",,Anonymous,Comedy

If you haven't seen much of his character on the Ali G show you will probably think otherwise and enjoy the fresh humor. Some parts are hilarious though...off the wall. Too bad they are few and far between for a long time fan. Obviously if you are offended by misogyny, racism, bigotry, homosexuality...um...any other big words then do not go see this movie. Borat pokes fun at Christians, Jews, Muslims, blacks, whites, gays, feminists, animal rights activists...Luckily I love laughing at our differences so these parts were funny to me.

Jagshemash...,"He is Borat and he is in town. If you have not heard of Borat by now, you are probably one of the people living under rocks in Uzbekistan. Borat Sagdiyev is just one of the multiple personalities that is Sacha B. Cohen. This should all be familiar from Sacha's HBO show, Da G Ali Show. If you aren't familiar and happen to be one of the rock-burdened people from Uzbekistan with access to a computer and the internet, then by all means please read on.Borat, heir of Boltok the Rapist, is a reporter from Khazikstan, sent to the US, along with his producer - Azamat Bagatov, to document American culture (under penalty of death). For those who don't know Borat (and as a way to show the before, before the after.) we first are taken to his home town of Kuczek. As a funny sidebar, this was actually filmed in a Gypsy shanty town north of Bucharest, Romania and not in Khazakstan. As a second sidebar, the things said in the town are even funnier than the subtitles. After a long, long and circumnavigating Indiana Jones-like plane ride, we arrive at JFK.The premise of Borat is simple. A caricature simple foreigner (anti-femanist, anti-semitic, anti-gay, sexual deviant,etc) travels to another land, with all the faux pas as comedy and critique. For the magic to work certain criteria must be present. For one, the people Borat meets must not be familiar with Borat or his country. Next, the illusion of foreign documentary must be maintained. Thirdly is the air of spontaneity. For example, Borat singing the national anthem at the rodeo could have cost Sacha his life if it had lasted a few minutes longer. The actor was evacuated from the building for fear of his safety and/or a riot. At times the humor is quite physical and quite graphic. I personally could not stop laughing while others in the theater were wincing or just plain looking away.You know you have made something meaningful when you upset people. If no one is upset, it means that it is universally acceptable or not important enough to justify a meaningful contradiction. This movie has upset a lot of people and with good reason. Borat instigates and often the second party fills in all the graphic and quite colorful, unscripted, personal nuances. It isn't that Borat is critiquing Khazakstan or the third world (which of course he is to an extent). He is criticizing our culture through our biased perceptions of ""foreigners"" and through our own instigation.The movie reminds me of John Wilmot's Sodom, in terms of open critique, except without the monarch. Sic semper tyrannis, or something. The only problem I had was with all the previews and show appearances. A lot of the jokes could be seen there prior to ever setting foot within a theater. Even with all this ""hype"" I highly enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to others.

Travels into the Heart of America,"This movie includes both straight comedy and a kind of candid camera (the kind where the camera is visible, but the victim is unsuspecting). The comedy is merged with the candid-camera segments so well, that if you do not pay close attention you might forget that some of the people are not acting.Before going on, a few words about my background: most of my interactions with American people have been academic - meaning, I mostly interacted with American students and academics. As a consequence, I have come to see America as the land of political correctness and moral relativism. No doubt, mine is a biased point of view, but it's the point of view from which I saw this movie, and it must be mentioned.So this why this movie is interesting to me: there is this Borat character who pretends to be from a country that few of us know much about; he talks to a number of Americans from different backgrounds, in different contexts, and everything he says and does is very un-PC, if not plain offensive. How are Americans going to react? are they going to be PC and tolerate Borat because of his background? or are they going to reject him because he is not PC? or are they going to reveal their own un-PC prejudices when it is safe to do so?The answer is a bit of all three, of course; but, on the whole, the people meeting Borat make the best of a difficult situation. Usually they explain, politely but firmly, that certain things are not done in the USA. This is what the self-defined ""veteran feminists"" do, for instance. Of course, it helps that they are ""veterans"": modern Taliban-supporting American feminists would not dare to contradict a non-westerner, even if he says that women have small brains.In a way, it is disappointing that Americans behave in such a civilized way: Borat himself is always funny, but his victims are a bit too predictable. However, sometimes we see reactions ranging from the funny to the outrageous. For example, the scene in the gun shop is a hilarious double-act, with Borat as the comic and the shopkeeper a brilliant straight-man. Better than any single scene in ""Bowling for Columbine"".On the other hand, I found most offensive the attitudes of the college students who gave a ride to Borat. That's a relief: there are no more outrageous people in America than I met on campus! (update 2006.11.11: apparently the students sued the film studio.)There is much more in this movie, but I'll just give a warning: pay attention to how New Yorkers are much more wary of physical contact than people in other parts of the country.In conclusion, Borat put the American people to a harsh test, and they came out reasonably well, but not too boring. How would Europeans come out? I am not sure that I want to know. I take one star off the rating because the movie could have been even better with more candid-camera and less straight comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Success.  Yes.  It Nice.,"Those who have called ""Borat"" a ""Jackass"" with a higher IQ pretty much have hit the nail on the head. This is low-brow humor for the high-brow set with enough offensive posturing and crudeness to appeal to a broad audience. Those claiming it's one of the funniest movies ever made and a brilliant satire are grotesquely overstating the appeal of Sascha Baron Cohen's creation. On many levels, as a mockumentary, it succeeds in making people laugh out loud (especially in the opening moments in his hometown), but to call this satire is an insult to pure satires like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Network.""The extended nude wrestling/chase scene in the hotel that people have hailed as a film classic was far from it in my mind. The funniest bits I found were instead the not so obvious subtexts (like the fact he spoke Hebrew in many of the Jew bashing scenes) and throw away moments like when he threw down his bag in despair and the chicken was still inside. Still, a subversively clever movie that seemingly exists to only push the envelope certainly has its place in this increasingly sensitive, politically correct, and censored society, which is why I feel this has become a cultural phenomenon. For Cohen and his alter ego, success, yes, it nice. Very nice. We like.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A bit more bite?,"The problem with ""Borat"" is, while it's certainly very funny, it's never terribly original nor is it as dangerous as it could be or thinks it is. The usual targets are on hand, (gays, blacks, any minority really, people with disabilities, mental and physical and so on). Some of these gags hit their targets while others completely backfire. The anti-women jokes seem to me a bit close to desperation and perhaps the only real surprise is Cohan's blatant lampooning of the Jews which is about as daring as the film gets. Posing as a rabid anti-Semite Cohan, in his persona of Borat, actually manages to blow apart the whole notion of anti-Semitism and the film's best 'sketch' is where Borat and his producer find themselves staying at a guest-house run by a sweet old Jewish couple. For the rest it's mostly toilet humour, in every conceivable sense, (Borat seems very obsessed with his 'anoos'), and jokes about masturbation. The first time Borat does a gag it is genuinely funny, the second time, less funny, the third time ... well, you get the idea, and the improvised 'candid-camera' style sketches work far better than the staged ones.As an actor Cohan is genuinely creative and Borat can be a wonderful comic creation but the material here never really finds him at his best. It may have seemed like a good idea to go to America and lampoon the Republicans, (and it's these scenes, set mostly in the American heartlands, that really hit the mark), but Cohan doesn't seem to be able to sustain these jokes. Just when he might be getting close to the jugular he pulls back and goes after some other easier option instead. The one time he does sustain the gag is when he cross-cuts between an organized dinner party and an etiquette lesson. For a while this is a really funny scene, (even the toilet humour in the scene is funny), but Cohan doesn't know to end it so he brings on a black hooker. Funny? NOT! (And we don't want to see Borat's sentimental side either).Perhaps not surprisingly the film has become a big hit in America, (its frat-boy humour will certainly appeal to a younger audience). But if Cohan really had the courage of his convictions he would have given us something like ""The Aristocrats"", which really was in bad taste, and risked alienating just about everybody. Fans of his British television series ""Ali G"" knows he can do it. Perhaps next time?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fast forward a decade and a half later, almost seems like a lifetime ago as far as comedy relief goes. I'm guessing you can already imagine that a good percentage of the most recent reviews are offended by this movie, probably a bunch of vazhins that hang like sleeve of wizard's robe. As for me, I laughed just as hard as when I watched it the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Anti-American?,"NOTE: I'm reposting a message board entry regarding alleged anti-Americanism in Borat. It wound up saying pretty much how I felt about the film, so I think it's worth posting as a comment, as well.------------ Yes, a lot of the hapless victims in the film are just ""being folks,"" and people anywhere would respond the same way. When you consider it in a piecemeal fashion, there's no need to see this film as particularly anti-American.However.For one thing, I think people like to watch others doing what they do best. Cohen has an undeniable gift of comic verite chutzpah.I think this film is a kind of Rorschach. When you collide the aforementioned unmitigated comic cheek of Borat against all these features of ""normal"" society, trinkets spill out. This film then lays them all out for our delectation, like a comic garage sale; everyone is going find something they'll want to ""take home"" i.e., laugh at. For instance, I thought Borat's infiltration of a modern, ""charismatic"" megachurch was priceless. We get to take it all in; the hint of twisted antiprogressive politics (ex. the church/state nexus), resentment of science, the bogus speaking in tongues. The film takes us places many of us will never go, and we get to bask in the experience.There are little ""inside"" gems, like Borat's meeting with Alan Keyes. You can't really savor the situation unless you have some background on Keyes; his ""in-crowd"" status with the fundies, his de rigueur doctrinaire stance on homosexuality, and his daughter having come out as a lesbian. There's a lot in this movie that rises like a heady aroma from the fecund loam of middle American culture. The scene at the rodeo is probably the basis for claims of an anti-American subtext. I've been to large social gatherings of staunch, nationalistic Americans, milked for patriotic fervor by play-to-the-crowd ""entertainers."" Given that, how hilariously cathartic and timely to see that scene with Borat.His scene in the civil war antique shop is either a bludgeon or a scalpel. You're going to love it or hate it. It's either poorly sublimated aggression, or it cuts the Gordian Knot. Your call.In short, if you analyze Borat, scene-by-scene, you'll miss something. Sort of like the Old Testament: If you analyze it scene-by-scene, you may conclude it's a load of rubbish (many do). But I feel that when you take it all in, the connections are made, and wisdom can be obtained. And real wisdom obtains you real benefits.There's something wise in Borat. That's the important thing.----------- Writing again, 12/16/2008I just realized that I think I can explain the wisdom and overall genius of Borat.It's a film fantasy on The Idea of a ""Great Nation.""That's all there is to it; really. Borat does to national pride what Python's Meaning of Life does to the search for life's true meaning.If you just keep that idea in the back of your mind, you'll see every scene weaves together into a larger brocade. If you stand back and look at the finished brocade, you'll see the clever hidden message, ""Wake up, America; the laurel branches dried up and all the leaves fell off, a *long* time ago.""And *that*, my friends, is the wisdom of ""Borat."" I presume he will take this distilled wisdom back to his home country to, uh, make better it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Borat Is Much Funnier then Ali G.""","Borat is a Kazakhstani television personality who heads to USA, the so called ""greastest country in the world"". In an attempt to learn more about the country to bring to Kazakhstan, Borat manages to upset almost every single person he encounters. While in America he develops an unhealthy obsession with Pamela Anderson and begins a quest to become her husband.I have to say this right off the bat, I hate Ali G with a passion. That character is not funny one bit and every time I hear his voice I feel like punching a baby in the face. Now, Borat is another story. I've seen some of his skits on television and guess what...no punching of babies. In fact I smiled every once and while I yes a chuckle did happen. Once I saw the trailer for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, again a smirk or two and a chuckle. Then all these reviews came pouring in: Funniest Comedy of the year, A fearless comedy, Riotously funny, and so on. So does BORAT make it as one of the funniest films of all time? Is it full of side-splitting laughter? Or is it just over-hyped?Much like Snakes on a Plane, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, has you laughing at the title alone. Without even seeing the film you knew it would be funny and it is, although I do have to say that hype killed it. It is nowhere near the funniest film of all time. Of the last five years maybe? Well, I would put it high on the list, but I still find The 40 Year Old Virgin to be funnier, maybe because it was a smarter comedy.The one problem with Borat is that while it claims all be set in ""reality"" it's quite obvious that some scenes are staged, the best example would be the final ten minutes of the film, with Pamela Anderson. While it is indeed funny, it takes away from the rest of the film because it immediately takes you out of it's reality. Yes, it is a film with a story to tell, even if that story is buried deep under it's randomness, but the feel of the film goes all over the place.It's offensive, but in this day and age almost everything is. At no point did I think anything in the film was over-the-line or in bad taste. The film is on the heels of Jackass II for being crude. It's one more step towards what is excepted in the eyes of the movie going public. Both films contain male nudity, and in both cases they get laughs. In Borat, the nude wrestling match had me on the floor. It was definitely the highlight. Whether or not THAT particular scene was staged is debatable, if it were, you might ask yourself is it still as funny.I found myself laughing off and on with Borat, more times it was a chuckle that a gut buster. Cohen does a good job at staying in character throughout the entire film, which is a short one by the way and ends faster then you can say the whole title. It does make for an entertaining watch, just don't go in thinking that it is the funniest thing ever cause you will be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Thoroughly entertaining!,"The current top review for this movie talks about various American issues that supposedly exist, that it ""reveals"" something... oh f*** off with such nonsense. You missed the whole point and so did everyone else who thinks so.The movie has a DELIBERATE ""documentary/diary"" angle to it as to portray that what happens there is ""real"". Trough this supposedly serious setting the dark humor shines even more - showing Borat as an anti-semite, Americans as some hicks or just racists, that he is ""unintentionally rude"" and what have you... which all adds to the total obscenity that makes this movie the entertaining dark comedy that it is. And in it all that naked hotel room scene and other (pick your favorite!) are just the icing on the cake.All in all the movie does a very good job being an absolutely disgusting, rude comedy, and for those that like this kind of thing it will certainly have an appeal just like ""Brüno"" and ""The Dictator"". Sasha Baron Cohen follows trough in those movies much the same way he did with Borat, without ripping off anything or recycling old jokes. I think his approach to all these movies is the fact that slowly but surely the audience of ANY entertainment gets numbed by copycats, reboots, remakes, re-everything... so to construct this movie he had to use a tank instead of a hammer, and that's the point: something new, something totally obscene to spice up the already present originality and ultimately that all boils down to first- rate entertainment somewhere down the line.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Very nice...?,"'Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan (2006)' works best either when it's simply being goofy (an absurd naked fight scene first comes to mind) or when the butt of the joke is a bigoted individual. It occasionally exposes the blatantly racist, sexist and homophobic nature of some of its on-screen players - or, I suppose, prompts them to do it themselves - and, in the process, mocks their small-minded attitudes. The trouble is that it also feeds into some of the stereotypes that it, in theory, opposes. This is because the protagonist himself is racist, sexist and homophobic; though this makes the film's true targets more comfortable in sharing their insidious yet laughable views, it often creates an uncomfortable sense that the film is evoking laughter in the wrong places. I'm not saying that Baron Cohen himself is bigoted, don't get me wrong. It's just that the satire is sometimes so subtle - and, once or twice, practically non-existent - that it almost doesn't count. Basically, a large portion of the audience will be laughing with Borat and his closed-minded acquaintances, not at them. Plus, the pseudo documentary style of the affair almost feels irrelevant when you realise that not only do the filmmakers pick and choose what they want to show (obviously), they also resort to straight-up trickery to score some of the bigger locations and interviews. That would be fine if the target was just, for example, a few misogynist frat boys (who were chosen prior to filming their scene, by the way), but making an entire village feel like they're participating in a legitimate documentary only to mock them in a language they don't understand for an audience who already has many misconceptions about them just feels wrong. It's a complicated issue, for sure. The film is constantly skirting the line between sharp satire and tone-deaf bigotry. It's hard to know where I stand on it, really. It's unconventional and occasionally fairly funny, but it's also somewhat troublesome. It's uneven, to say the least. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It doesn't get much funnier than this!,"This movie is disgusting, vulgar, racist, graphic, and crude in every sense. And it couldn't be any funnier.Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a reporter from Khazakhstan (sorry if I spelled that wrong) who travels to the U.S. to learn about American culture, and of course, marry Pamela Anderson. A ridiculous plot, I have to say, but somehow, it works.The interviews are the best part of the movie. Just listening to the questions he asks are so hilarious, and if you want to see more of these interviews, be sure to check out Da Ali G Show. But the scene that made me gasp for air was the nude scene halfway into the movie. It was disgusting in every sense, but you have to admit, fat naked people are funny.What I didn't like about the film was the near-constant racist remarks. I admit that they are funny, but it soon becomes to be too much. I think that if Cohen was not actually Jewish, he would not have gotten away with all of his jokes in the movie.Other than that, Borat is a must-see comedy. Unfortunately, I was not able to catch it in theaters, but it is just as good on DVD. If you have not seen Borat yet, walk, no, RUN now to your nearest video store before all the nerds take the last copies.A must-see, and strongly recommended to purchase.P.S.

This quote regarding the movie is so true!! I laughed my ass off half the movie, but i also gasped about the same amount of time. I mean being a 20 year old i guess the raunchy humor would make any college student laugh hysterically, however any intelligent person may also regroup for a second and realize that what they were laughing at is in some way offending themselves. I mean while some of the anti-semitic remarks and scenes were humorous, i was also quite offended by some of them being Jewish myself. I mean idc if Cohen is Jewish, it's still pretty offensive. I'm kind of disappointed at myself for laughing at anti-semitic jokes. I mean i can't lie, i liked the movie to a point. I mean stupid teenage boys probably loved all the stupid nudity and wrestling and perversion, but in my opinion in was disgusting and unnecessary. It was like watching Jackass or some other stupid reality TV show. Again, overall this movie is hysterical, but it really makes you rethink your own beliefs and possibly even regret laughing at things that are actually offending you.

More a satire on the US than on Kazakhstan,"This film does what it sets out to do  make an audience laugh. They laughed here in Helsinki on the opening night  not uncontrollably, not immoderately, but they did laugh consistently and there was indeed a great deal to laugh at.If there are targets for satire here, they are first and foremost the Americans that Borat meets, and secondarily western stereotypes of emerging nations such as Kazakhstan. It's perhaps a little hard on the Kazakhs that their homeland was chosen to give birth to Borat, and their government is reportedly up in arms about it. They might do well to reflect on the old adage that all publicity is good publicity, and on the fact that the treatment of them is affectionate in its way.What did surprise a little is how well many of the targets emerged. Some elderly bigots were neatly and rightly skewered on their own prejudices. Various ""experts"" on this and that were shown up to be vacuous, as you would expect. I found one scene, set at a family guest house, unnecessarily cruel, and I'm knocking a point off for that. And some groups and individuals came out of it really well  such as the Pentecostalists and the driving instructor  and I'm putting a point back on for that, for taking the smooth with the rough.A good evening's entertainment, and Sacha Baron Cohen is surely one of the world's greatest comic actors and I hope he will continue to find outlets for his immense talents. But overall there were too few surprises and too many jokes with only one dimension for it to become a classic  though the dinner party and the nude wrestling will linger in my mind for a long time to come.Seven out of ten.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Otherwise, people reacted how you would generally expect them to in relation to what was happening to them and other times extremely politely.There is no social commentary or insightful satire in this movie. I know it is cool to be anti-American and whatnot at the moment...I hate the current U.S government as much as any central European does (note I say GOVERNMENT).I was expecting this movie to be rude, which is completely acceptable and sometimes necessary.

"The joke's on us, and Kazakhstan is in on it.","Java Man Reviews ""Borat: Cultural Leanings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" (2006, R). Directed by Larry Charles. Written by Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham & Don Mazer. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian & Pamela Anderson. Running Time: 83 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Borat (Cohen) is a Kazakh TV journalist who has been assigned to come to America and make a documentary about our people and culture. He also happens to be a sexist, racist, chauvinist, and any other ""ist"" one could possibly imagine. In his NYC hotel room, he sees an old Baywatch episode, becomes smitten with Pamela Anderson and decides to head for Hollywood--in an old ice cream truck--in order to make her his bride.On the way, he and his crew, including his slovenly producer Azamat (Davitian) encounter a cross section of everyday Americans, upsetting and insulting every one of them as they go. He bickers over women's brain size with feminists, parties with drunken frat boys and visits the home of southern conservatives with a prostitute as his date. When invited to sing our national anthem at a rodeo, he is at first greeted with cheers, until he revises the lyrics and the audience viciously turns on him. He barely escapes.REVIEW: 3 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS""Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own."" Jonathan SwiftWhen this film first came out, there was a lot of talk about how the nation of Kazakhstan was displeased about being the victim of Cohen's unkind cuts. We laughed. But as we file out of the movie, we realize that it is America, not Kazakhstan, whose face is discovered in Cohen's Swiftian mirror. I suspect that the central Asian nation, with its recent increase in tourism, may have been in on the joke.In fact, the British Cohen (who is also Jewish) is following in a great satiric tradition made popular in the coffeehouses of early 18th century England in the stories of Addison and Steele, as well as Swift. It is called the ""Innocent Eye"" or ""Fish out of Water"" technique, where an outside observer innocently reacts to the absurdities of the predominant society. Cohen takes it to its limits, and thus the well-deserved R rating.There are many gross-out moments, especially when Borat nude wrestles with his fleshy producer; but there are also huge laughs, as we look on while people just like us become Borat's victims. Cohen stays in character even when he is about to be pummeled. In fact, Borat--and not Cohen--has traveled the movie's promotional talk-show circuit. His appearance on Conan O'Brien's late-night show was especially disgusting (and, of course, funny).Director Charles deserves a lot of credit here. No stranger to comedy, the Seinfeld veteran somehow convinced all these people to cooperate, shot the scenes with a straight face, and got each set-up done in one take. (Once the marks knew they were made, the crew would have to wrap the set and make a quick getaway). The American location work is engaging, but the opening scenes in Kazakhstan are wonderfully bizarre. (They were actually shot in Rumania).Suggestion: When the nude wrestling sequence starts, take a trip to the refreshment stand.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hilarious Toilet Humor Movie-Film Masquerading as Satire,"This movie is not, I repeat, NOT, a satire of anything. It is about as intelligent and finessed as anything Tom Green and the ""Jackass"" boys could churn out, and just as funny. Personally, I think this stuff is the cream of the crop; I love no-brow, sick toilet humor as much as the next Tom Green fan. I consider ""Freddy Got Fingered"" a veritable masterpiece, and wish Steve-O would sign a ten-picture deal with Warner Brothers. With that said, I must express serious misgivings about the ""Borat"" movie, namely its attempt to show itself as something more than what it is: a disgusting gross-out comedy that relies on shock humor for laughs.Sacha Baron Cohen's admirers would have you believe that this film merits plaudits from critics and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its searing mockery of American racism and prejudice. Such victims of Cohen's venom include the promoter of a Virginia rodeo and drunk frat boys in an RV. Both make blatantly homophobic and sexist remarks, with Borat apparently nodding in approval. Now, other than that, what more is there to this? The comments of the prejudiced people are buried in a sea of graphic nudity and scatology that overwhelm and over-awe anyone who tries to find anything remotely redeeming about this movie. Cohen's attempts at satire and mockery of prejudice are hollow at best. This film isn't about making the world a better place; it's about humiliating unsuspecting people with gross antics, and cashing in on their humiliation.Cohen is no more brilliant than Tom Green or Johnny Knoxville, who do candid, reality-TV antics very similar to Cohen's ""Borat"". His ""foreign-man"" character hearkens back to a long and shopworn tradition trod by such luminaries as Andy ""Latka"" Kaufman and Bronson ""Balki Bartokomos"" Pinchot. Cohen even directly imitates one of Green's least-funny antics: breaking the merchandise in a shop. Cohen is less likable than Green, who also targeted innocent bystanders, in the mean-spiritedness of his humor. Green never relied on anti-semitism or blatant sexism to make a point. Cohen does seem to have a mean streak about him. I felt very sorry for the shop owner who had his merchandise trashed by Cohen, and was rewarded with some of Borat's national---ahem!---""currency.""Still, as an admirer of gross-out humor, I did enjoy this film for what it was. The best scene was when Cohen wrestled with the morbidly-obese Azamat, and when he cheered the messenger for informing him of his wife's death by an animal attack. Cohen was very creative in forming a story-arc of searching for Pamela Anderson, and using unsuspecting people as characters in that fictional plot line. He did do some good in lampooning Pamela Anderson's status as an international sex symbol, as well as ""Baywatch's"" alleged international appeal. Of course, the ""not"" joke with the joke instructor was actually quite clever and humorous, and ironically much lighter and sweeter than the gross-out antics that proliferate the screen.In short, I have very mixed feelings about this film and Sacha Baron Cohen's standing in Hollywood. I enjoyed the gross toilet humor, but was irked with Cohen's attempt to make this film into something more than a variation on the ""Jackass"" variety of reality TV shock humor. The critical praise for this movie is suspect, as this movie, quite literally, is the emperor (and his obese assistant) without clothes.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The movie contains some key elements of Kusturica's other movies mixed with some Michael Moore documentary, some Jackass. A strange mix, but not so impressive that it might seam. Boran's village is, I can say for sure, a typical Romanians gypsies one. The poor people really envoy being joked at. It's funny for me to listen to the Romanian taking on the background. Many Romanians were outraged by this movie, but I'm sure not of them. If you what carefully, the joke is on the American style of life. It's a movie to see, it's not a good movie, it's just a movie. It's better then watching the news.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a movie,"I recently saw this movie and couldn't stop laughing the whole time! The whole movie was funny, from the beginning to the end. All the jokes and reactions of the people were great, especially when he goes to the rodeo and tells everyone that he supports the war and sings the anthem! Also when he is taking the driving test and makes stupid jokes that the instructor doesn't really get. The end maybe was too ridiculous, Pamela running in the parking lot....funny but a little dumb. This character Borat is the best Sacha has ever done. Some times I didn't know if it was real or staged, but still hilarious! I like him as Ali G but now I love Borat even more!I hope he'll make another movie like this soon!You rock Sacha!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Most people get it. High five!,"Just wanted to make a short comment about the comments themselves (the hundreds of reviews have pretty much covered all aspects of the movie.) There is a fairly small group of people who, after watching ""Borat"", have stated that they hated it because it's racist and anti-Semitic.I'm really, really surprised at them! Most people who have seen Borat GET IT. They get that we are supposed to think the RACISM ITSELF is stupid, and that people who buy into Borat's racism are the butt of the humor.It's difficult to believe that educated, intelligent people (and those who hated the movie's ""racism"" do like to point out that they are educated, intelligent people) would not understand this. What a shame that they don't...humor can be a powerful tool for positive change.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
First movie I've ever walked out of.  Awful.  Just awful.,"With movie tickets being as expensive as they are, I hate to waste them, but after 40 minutes of watching slapstick, tasteless toilet humor, not to mention the most appalling and offensive anti-semitism I have EVER seen in a film, I walked out. How anyone can think this is funny, I just don't know. Comparing Jews to vermin and cockroaches, telling the audience that they are killers and are to be hated, had the audience guffawing out loud while the group I was with sat in silent horror (horror at the content of the movie and even more horror at the audience's hysterical reaction to it) - the audience shrieked with laughter every time a body part was mentioned, or at any even mild reference to a bodily function (most of them weren't mild references, they were outright explicit which had the audience chortling proudly) - I mean, how juvenile can you get? Is this what American audiences are coming to - that you only need to mention the word ""anus"" to have people rolling in the aisles laughing? What a hideous, vulgar movie - Sasha Cohen should be ashamed of himself for putting a movie like this out there, it is a disgrace. People: BE WARNED.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If you're familiar with Borat from TV, then you already know what's coming in the movie and will laugh your a$$ off anyways. The movie is much more over the top than the television show. I admit that I hid my eyes during the naked men wrestling scene, cause who wants to see that? The audience was hysterically laughing through all this so it worked. I only rated it an 8 because let's face it...it's not a life changing cinematic adventure, but it is an EXCELLENT way to get away from reality and laugh until your cheeks hurt.

Borat Visits Crazy U.S. of Americas,"I've seen a couple Borat episodes on Ali G and I thought they were OK. Nothing special, just a talented comedian acting like a weirdo foreigner. Well, this movie is pretty much the same thing. If you love his show, you'll love the movie. It's that simple. I saw a 10:50 am showing of this movie hoping the crowd would be small. Because I really hate being stuck in a theater with a bunch of retards that laugh at every single thing. Unfortunately the theater was packed, and I sat next to two fat kids who laughed nonstop, both having wheezy, spit filled throats, mixed with a dash of nerd. Then I have a dude that snorted like a pig to my left, but that was actually funny. I thought the movie was amusing, fast paced, pretty funny and surprisingly smart. There is a whole lot going on this movie - it's full of satirical jokes, scat humor, and ridiculous situations. But I just didn't find it really, really funny like how everyone else is. I would say I laughed out loud a handful number of times. Don't get me wrong, I get it, he plays a slow foreigner with little common sense. That is funny, but it's not ""one of the funniest comedies of all time"". Personally I found Jackass 2 to be much funnier. The movie is easily recommendable and my main reason saying that is that Sasha is a really talented comedian, performer and actor. The movie has displayed our society in a crazy eye opening way that I haven't seen before. That was definitely the most humorous part of the movie for me. Watching how crazy our country is. I never realized how nuts these religious types are. Those dudes are probably exactly like the fanatics overseas. It's definitely one of the better comedies to come out in a long time. It's much better than any recent Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell movie. I give it a 7 1/2 outta 10. Most likely will rise after another viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Incredible comedy satire,"Borat is an incredible comedy satire that's shocking, extremely funny and unpredictable. Sacha Baron Cohen gives a perfect lead performance and Ken Davitian is great. The majority of the jokes are extremely funny and shocking whilst avoiding dragging on which makes up for the couple that do. It's extremely well paced and Larry Charles' direction is excellent. The music by Erran Baron Cohen is fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Entertaining,"Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a leading TV journalist from Kazakhstan (formerly part of the Soviet Union). We start off in Borat's home village which is full of white-trash dressed in clothes they believe are ""cool"" in the West and where anti-Semitism is regarded as a participation sport.Borat travels to the U.S. to make a documentary and takes a road-trip from New York to California in an ice-cream van he buys for $700. Borat uses the pretext of the documentary to meet real people and we observe the reaction as he attempts to shock them. Borat's victims are keen to appear on Kazakhstani television and most Americans he meets have no problem in believing that the citizens of his country are stupid peasants.Borat breaks many of the taboos of polite Western society by making outrageous statements or behaving disgustingly. It's like a revolting re-interpretation of Candid Camera. Cohen's technique is to extract idiotic remarks and the audience is asked to laugh at the brainless dupes. His antics include: defecating in a flower bed in the middle of New York and telling a group feminists that women have smaller brains. One of the strangest scenes involves an extended bout of vigorous nude wrestling with his producer, a fat, ugly hairy man. Cohen literally has his head up the guy's ass.Most of the U.S. movie review I have read see the movie as a hilarious satire about America. The aim of satire is usually to ridicule the follies of humanity or poke fun at the rich and powerful. As a Brit, my view is that Cohen is simply ""taking the p*ss"" out of America's great unwashed. In every country in the world you will find people prepared to say ridiculous things for their 15 minutes of fame.Most teenage boys will enjoy its sadism and find the movie hysterically funny in the same way they enjoy the Jackass movies. I'm not sure what to make of the exaggerated claims for Cohen's brilliance but some of his antics are very funny. I know my wife and mother won't enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sacha is funniest,"I'm a hard core Sacha Cohen fan. I'm watching Ali G / Borat long before this movie was made. This movie imports many ideas from the Ali G show, e.g. pubic joke, learned etiquettes, using his sister etc. etc. He still added some new jokes and movie is hilarious. That's the point.I don't see movies to get educated. I don't see Borat as a documentary. I don't care if it is politically wrong. I don't like overnight experts of Borat who watched his movie only. It made me laugh, just like Ali G show. I don't care what any body think of me or him. I like Borat humor, how offensive he is and how he can say just any thing.I'm from a Muslim family and I was taught, subtle and not-so-subtle way that Jews are ""very bad people"". Maybe Borat drive little close to home? Maybe I see myself in Borat (what I could've been, if I didn't get educated), Maybe I see my relatives in him. Whatever, I find myself laughing uncontrollably when I saw Borat.Sacha remains my favorite comedian. And this DVD goes in my collection, along with Borat clips in my youtube account. Sexy time.

Funny and smart,"I saw this movie yesterday with its dubbing into Spanish which takes away half of the fun. Despite this, the experience was pleasant since the extreme, unusual, delirious and extraordinary situations are the work and grace of this unusual film. Sacha Baron Cohen has given us some of the best comedies of the last two decades and this film is a demonstration of his genius and skill. Humor is based on playing with extremes or twisting the everyday. Baron Cohen is a great artist in these areas and this film is one of his most important contributions to popular culture. The conclusion of the film is that we can doubt the North American capacity to distinguish the real from the murky; the fate of the United States is therefore quite doubtful.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The downside of free speech,"I am amazed that anyone with any understanding of film or good writing could rate this film as a 10 (the most common rating!). It's obviously a groundbreaking film but not in any positive way. It got cheep laughs by tricking real people into embarrassing situations and didn't show any real film-making skill.The film always chose to get the easy laugh rather than try to say something meaningful or help the viewer to see the world from the perspective of another person. It was pure exploitation and its unfortunate that others will try to copy its formula before we all get sick of this kind of film-making. Comedy can be a powerful tool for good, but this film probably left most people feeling guilty they contributed to its huge economic success and probably assured a sequel.We would only see a film like this in a free speech world, but it takes the right to make a movie like this as more important than the value of a movie like this. Sasha should be ashamed of himself for creating a film that so clearly is based on hate of every culture including his own. Its easy to make a film that makes people look stupid, its much harder to show that other perspectives are valuable. I hope Sasha will take some of his dirty money and spend it to repay some of the people he has hurt.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Rarity,"Borat is a rarity. A character so repulsive and completely lacking in sense, you can't avoid laughing at his foibles. From the improvisational mastermind Sacha Baron Cohen (Da Ali G Show, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby), comes his most controversial character, Borat Sagdiyev, the clueless anti-Semite from Kazakhstan. If you have been fortunate enough to catch ""Da Ali G Show"", you're probably already familiar with his antics. As it is with Cohen's other characters, Borat goes across America, shocking unsuspecting Americans with his socially, as well as politically, incorrect behavior. One graphic example is showing strangers pornographic pictures of his wife and sister. Being on HBO, Borat has had the freedom to be all he was meant to be and his barely R-rated film is no exception. In what is basically, several Borat segments combined into one 90 minute mocumentary, we see Cohen as his mustachioed alter-ego raising havoc on a road trip across the ""U S and A"". What was the purpose of this voyage you ask? Why to locate and marry Pamela Anderson of course and if there's time, shoot a documentary on American culture. And American culture he finds while discovering feminists, embarrassing rodeos, and finding Jesus along the way. If this movie does anything, it proves that Cohen will do anything, no matter how disturbing or illegal. I'm not sure, but if a few of these scenes weren't staged, he should have been arrested several times for some of his comical mischief. I'd give examples, but it might not be as shocking so I'll leave it up to you to find out. So among all this chaos and slandering of an already angered Kazakhstani Government, is there a film worth paying for? No contest. Borat has a tremendous chance of being the funniest film of the year. It's clever, outrageous and most notably unapologetic. Of course, I enjoyed the film myself, but I've never seen an audience laugh and applaud on so frequently. I doubt Cohen will receive any Oscar buzz, but it isn't a stretch to say that his performance is some of the best comedic acting in a long time. But don't think I'm soft, this being my first review and all, but I had a very difficult time trying to find a reason it suffered. Borat also manages to do something that many films before it have failed to do; be insightful as well as funny. Though mostly absurd, Borat sheds a floodlight on how people from other nations can be viewed in America. Despite a few exceptions, it was almost refreshing to see some Americans be so tolerant of a supposed foreigner who was intentionally meaning to anger them. I predict this movie will do well. This based on the ticket sales of R-rated comedies and the massive cult following Cohen already possesses. When I said barely R-rated at the top of the review, I didn't mean almost a PG-13. Borat is extremely graphic, profane and obviously went through many cuts before avoiding a NC-17. If you are over 17 (or have a fake ID that says you are) and don't offend easily, you won't be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Comedy
I liiiike!,"""Borat"" is a brilliant movie, even if you've seen and loved the ""Ali G. Show"" before. In a lot of ways the Borat from the show is superior to the one in the movie, though: Sacha Baron Cohen's main goal used to be to confront people with Borat's vulgarity and his special views so that all their bigotry would be uncovered. In the movie he only really does that once or twice (namely when he talks to the Rodeo guy and the fret boys). There is also a lot of obviously (and then some rather secretly) staged material here, but you can't always tell. When Borat's comedy is scriptet, however, it isn't half as funny, so when Baron Cohen walks around and introduces his country in the beginning, it's not that hilarious.Anyway, the movie really gets into gear in its second half. Mr. Baron Cohen takes the whole thing to such extremes you won't be able to believe your eyes. This man is absolutely unafraid of anything. Faux interviews for comedy purposes have been done millions of times before, but never as effectively as here. Borat is just a weirdly lovable, if sexist/racist guy. Speaking of which, to enjoy this you should definitely bring along some understanding for not so politically correct-humor and some mindless slapstick! If you do, there's no way you're going to want to miss this movie. It's a riot (and I've never used that expression before). The absolute highlights include a nude wrestling match between Borat and his overweight manager, and the very final scene, which I'm not going to give away.Sacha Baron Cohen is doing something here, that's never been done before, if you think about it. He's starring in a movie he's written and everyone else around him is starring in it, too. Only most people aren't aware of it. Even with this kind of setting there's still so much love for detail here that although a lot of key scenes may be staged the whole thing is still adorably well structured and inventive.""Borat"" brings Sacha Baron Cohen a success that's long overdue. Unfortunately, it also marks the death of this character since a) Borat will be commonly known throughout the world after this and b) this movie is unsurpassable, anyway. Bring on the Brüno movie, then!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.,"So last night I was one of the fortunate to get into the myspace screening of Borat in Portland, OR. Amazingly I can see 20th Century Fox continuing this Black Carpet screening with their other films. Anyways onto the movie. Within the first ten minutes you will begin to laugh and not till the end will it end. From beginning to end Sacha Baron Cohen aka ""Ali G"" will take you on his journey to marry his ""Pamela"" and document it all the way. The gags are just spot on, although if your easily offended by naked men wrestling, gay jokes, anti-semites, and overall just offensive humor this movie is not for you. If you love offensive humor, and just great comedies than check this film out when it's released in November hopefully by then they don't take out the nude fight scene.

Funny not too funny and legitimately offensive and not in a good way,"I laughed a number of times during Borat, which was a funny film. A number of scenes are inspired, and I dig the whole clueless foreigner shtick. The film, done in a semi-documentary style, where the people don't know it's a movie, is about Borat, a Kazak newsreporter that comes to the United States to make a documentary only to have chaos ensue. Being based off a character on the Ali G show, I always thought that the character, Ali G had more funny scenes on that show, and this one disappointingly recycles gags from the show, but overall the gags remain new and enticing the way through. However, the biggest creative problem is that the character of Borat, himself, is one joke, and that joke starts to become thin. In fact, he is so one-dimensional that it kind of brings down the movie by making it too one-note in that department, but the strength of the supporting material keeps it afloat. It's a sure 7 out of 10.I must also say that while I do not mind the cruelest of humor in fictional settings, the fact that this deals with real people, who are speaking without knowledge of the joke, adds an unnaceptable edge to some of the humor. The things they do to some of these real people are simply mean and disrespectful. I always felt that in the television show, there was always an element of warmness to various fake interviews and sketches, but I only got that in a few of the bits here. This doesn't affect whether it's a good movie or not, but I just want to say that I don't approve of humor that hurts real people, without their knowledge.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The worst movie I've ever seen. NOT!,"I cannot remember where I first saw Rhona Mitra, but I knew I wanted to see much more of her. That is why I watched Ali G Indahouse. Big mistake! Even Rhona could not make that film worth watching.I never looked at Sacha Cohen again. There was nothing that he could do that would interest me. However, when I saw him win a Golden Globe and saw this film nominated for an Oscar, I knew I had to watch in the interest of finding out what the interest was.I did not laugh one time during the film. Not once. I do not find his demeaning of women, Jews,gays and others to be one bit funny. Yes, I know he is a Jew, and I know it is satire, but there are limits. he crossed those limits and it diminished the film and it diminished him. For the Golden Globes to put him in the same class as Aaron Eckhart or Johnny Depp is beyond my comprehension.Yes, the concept was good, the performances worthwhile, and the satire was excellent, but I just can't get over the subject matter and I do not like potty humor. I just feel that this film has no place at an awards show.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
must not have gotten the humor in it,"I know I'm quite a bit in the minority on this one but I just didn't seem to think this movie was much more than some obnoxious mockery of third world countries and some fraternity-type humor. I don't think Borat does much at all for pointing out bigotry or antisemitism as much as he simply sensationalizes those same problems at the expense of blind sighted participants being told this was a real documentary. Never liked Ali G. either. Sorry to say I really believe all the critics are wrong. It's not a satire or black humor or much more than crass foolery to me. I think he should cough up some hard cash to Glod, Romania and be a sport about it too. My apologies for possibly appearing self righteous but I do believe there are much better ways to approach the obvious societal problems presented in the movie. Look at Woody Allen or Lenny Bruce performances for example as ways to tackle these issues.",,Anonymous,Comedy
The most I've ever laughed during a movie!,"With Borat Subsequent Moviefilm coming very soon, I thought I'd revisit probably the funniest film I've ever seen and to this day I think Borat is one of the greatest pranks performed.Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (yes that is actually the title) follows Borat, a Kazakh reporter who is sent to America to document their society and culture. During his journey, he finds out about Pamela Anderson and tries to locate her.Borat is absolutely insane. What Sacha Baron Cohen was able to pull off with this film is seriously impressive. Having him go across America and meet all sorts of people who had no idea of this entire prank led to some of the funniest and cringeworthy scenes I've ever seen. If you're someone who is easily offended, Borat is not for you. This film is riddled with outrageous and offensive jokes and someone who's not a fan of this type of humour is sure to hate Borat. However, if you understand that this film is a satire and is actually making fun of the extreme viewpoints, then you'll realise just how clever Borat is.There have been other movies like Bad Grandpa that try this style but are ultimately unsuccessful but Borat takes these real situations to the extreme. The reactions Cohen was able to get from the people he met were hilarious and a large part of that is due to Sacha Baron Cohen's incredible performance. His quick thinking and witty improv managed to fool every person involved and his ability to not break character at any given point made Borat seem like a real person leading to hysterical situations. Even some of the staged scenes were handled so well as they put just enough unscripted elements to them to maintain the realism.Apart from being an absolute laugh riot and containing ridiculous scenes, Borat is one of the smartest films I've seen. As mentioned before, this film is a satire and if you're on board with that then you'll see what Sacha Baron Cohen was really trying to do. The way the movie commentates on American society, politics and their culture is genius and puts America in such a bad light.That's why I love Borat. Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius and was able to pull off one of the greatest pranks ever performed. No matter how many times I've seen Borat, my opinion has remained the same. If you understand the humour and see what the movie is trying to say then this is a film you have to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Marx Brother,"A very funny movie using a classic comedic structure: disorienting word-play, getting the best of the bourgeois, zany and shocking - George S. Kaufmann (writer for the Marx Brothers) would be delighted. Sacha Baron Cohen is hysterical, and what a great moustache! But I prefer Charlie Kaufman. I think Carrey and Ferrell and Stiller are far more original and adventurous with their work, every bit as anarchic, and far less predictable. I found the hooker with a heart of gold especially disappointing. And I know films are now made to be ugly, but I can't resist the rant - Gondry makes beautiful images, Peter Sellers appreciated the artistry of what he was up to, and look at the Mr. Hulot films - very, very silly - yet stylish and masterfully shot. And then there's the magic of Chaplin and Keaton.

You knew what you were letting yourselves in for...,"I just had to post a comment after reading some of the comments from the 1 star brigade slating Sacha as a racist and how the movie portrays various races/countries. If you think along these lines then you really have no sense of humour or irony whatsoever and shouldn't really go and see or comment on a movie like this in the first place. Anybody with half a brain realises that Kazakhstan may not be 100% as portrayed (in the same way any US movie portrays the UK as all country houses and toffs speaking posh) and that being a Jew, perhaps he is trying to make a statement about anti-semetic people in general rather than slagging off his own religion....The only people who came out of it badly for me were the ones who deserved to, ie the college jock and the guy at the rodeo. The dinner party people and the antique shop owners came across as genuine people, and because of this there reactions were all the more amusing.

Don't watch Borat just because they say its 'funny',"I watched this movie for two reasons: 1) I was on a movie watching spree and when I arrived at Loews this Friday, it was the only movie I hadn't seen AND 2) Everybody seemed to think it was a great movie. It was rated in the top 150 on IMDb at one point. The trailers looked completely idiotic and senseless. I knew I was going to watch it to figure out what the hype was all about but I was delaying the inevitable. The lack of new releases on Friday night did it for me and I bought a ticket to Borat. My intuition was absolutely right. Borat is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I was watching it with two of my good friends, one of whom I literally forced in. The other was genuinely excited to see the movie. When we left the movie theater, not only did we share our dislike of the movie, we were also left wondering how anyone who left the theater with us could have possibly enjoyed this movie. Granted the movie did have some funny moments, but nothing made me or anyone around me crack up. This could be due to the ever present disgust that accompanied the Borat humor. I don't see how people can find two completely naked guys wrestling for 10 minutes straight funny. Mentally scarring is a better way to describe such 'humor'.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

C'mon people, lighten up. They're just words, and it's COMEDY. It's supposed to be shocking if it's going to be funny. If you want to be outraged, try dealing with religious fanatics sawing off heads of westerners or stoning adulterers to death or perhaps even Chinese repression in Tibet. No, no, no, that requires actual thought; it's easier to just take cheap shots at a comic genius like Sacha Cohen.This movie kicked ass and made no apologies. That's a welcome change, and I hope to see more like it, provided the religious nuts and left wing pantie-waists will ALLOW it (it's still a free country, isn't it???).",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Politically Incorrect, rude, ignorant and one of the funniest things i have ever seen","in my life.The film follows insane Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev and his friend Azhamat travelling across America in the hope of making a film that would help better Kazakhstan. In the film, Sacha Baron Cohen tries to insult everyone, including Americans, femenists, gypsy's, gay's, the country of Uzbekistan and last but definitely not least - Jews.His trip is amazingly funny, masturbating publicly in a New York street, kidnapping Pamela Anderson, and running through a hotel stark naked.The people who took offence to this film should be shot. Its not meant to be taken seriously and the people who did take it seriously need to lighten up and see the funny side. This film blatantly pokes fun at America and its people, as well as Russia and Kazakhstan.Bravo to Cohen (who is Jewish himself) for making this cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan (Larry Charles, 2006) **1/2","I wasn't into Sacha Baron Cohen's previous alter ego, rapper Ali G, at all; I didn't think I'd be drawn to this character (who has garnered as much admiration as contempt either), given his sexist nature  but, at least, it provides a wider range of targets and opportunities for controversy. Incidentally, the head-shaking reaction which usually greets Borat is ultimately more of a comment on his ostensibly cultured 'victims' than the unsophisticated hero himself.The film itself is patchy but mercifully short  and, surprisingly, I found it to be genuinely inspired at times (even if its brand of savage no-holds barred satire has been more stylishly explored by Monty Python 35 years ago); besides, the dinner-table defecation was much better done by Luis Bunuel in an unforgettable scene from THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)! Anyway, it generally plays like a live-action version of ""South Park"" (that series' creators, in fact, receive a special thanks during the end credits here).Some scenes are undeniably uproarious  his rendition of the national anthem of Kazakhstan at a rodeo; the dinner sequence in a Southern household (mentioned above); the mayhem at an antique shop; and the lengthy nude fisticuff between Borat and his heavy-set manager (which is where the film really oversteps the threshold of grossness). However, other 'sketches' fall miserably flat  in particular, the entire Pamela Anderson episode (which actually takes about half the running-time!) is an embarrassment: this section includes Borat's meeting with a group of wasted kids in a trailer (which is how the hero gets wise to Anderson's marital status) and his eventual brush with a community of revivalist Christians.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Borat, Cutting Open The Belly Of America","The latest full length adaptation of one of Sasha Baron Cohen characters is part gross-out comedy and part social satire on American society, as the charmingly clueless Kasakhstani reporter travels across the country to learn how to make his home town more like ""the greatest country in the world"", along the way falling in love with Pamela Anderson and beginning a journey across America to find and marry her.The joy of Borat is the total cultural incompatibility combined with the easiest aspects of American culture to mock. (You notice how he travels through the southern states, not the north) And sometimes you find yourself unsure which is actually funnier, Baron Cohen's activities or the reactions he draws out of the American public. Some of the people he meets, especially at a rodeo in Texas, really do defy all belief and/or any faith in humanity.Of course the big question when watching films like this is exactly how much of it is done live and how much is staged, and how much the director had to manipulate to get the reactions they wanted. And of course when they want to make sure they get away with it. (Apparently the police were called on the actor 91 times during production) So sometimes you feel that people had to have been briefed on how to act to move the plot along/prevented being arrested, and sometimes the people say such horrible things they just have to be truly and deeply held beliefs. And the fact that so many people are currently trying to sue the production for the way they've been portrayed in the film, from drunk frat boys to a Romanian village, really proves that people are quite happy to say how they really feel to someone they think they have to be superior to.Despite all the things that he says and does you can't but help but like the character, because Sacha Baron Cohen manages to imbue the character with such innocence and charm that not once do you ever suspect any of the things he does or says are meant in malice, only total cultural misunderstanding. Especially as you just know there aren't people in the world who are really like this, and if you do well then the joke appears to be on you.The only point I felt slightly uncomfortable with is the fact that Baron Cohen uses a real country to use as a stereotype, when that might offend real people. But the whole point is that Borat is a collection of stereotypes that people will believe. A mixture of all the different beliefs that people have about poor eastern European countries. (Conversations you see in the film between Borat and his producer actually consist of a mixture of Russian, Yiddish and Armenian with the two actors speaking totally different languages to each other.) Deep down the underlying joke with Borat is that people are so uninformed that they actually believe that Borat's really exist somewhere in the world.But the main point that underlies all of this is the however offensive Borat is, or however much you cannot believe what you see on screen, you are laughing far too hard to care. There were times it hurt I was laughing so much. You can go into the film consciously acknowledging all the points that could make the film could be politically incorrect or possibly cause offence, but once you're watching it's impossible to take it seriously, and that's the whole point.I wouldn't say that this movie is to everybody's taste. Avoid if you take offence easily, but if you do remember that that you are missing one of the comic highlights of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"No real Kazhaks here,just gutsy comedy","English comic-actor Sacha Baron Cohen takes one of his famous stable of characters,Kazahkstani journalist Borat Sangdiev,and sends him on a cross-country odyssey of America that is as scattered in its logic as it is wildly funny.Kazhakstan is fictionalized to the point that I have no doubt that any real native of the country will be less-than-pleased with this portrayal. Here we have a fourth-world country of abject poverty and warped social values(for examples:evidentally,prostitution is not only tolerated but is rewarded,and the town rapist is as common as one would consider a town doctor or sheriff)where the customs include such barbaric practices as abusing animals for sport,killing gypsies and collecting their tears(to ward away AIDS,one reasoning)and their fear of Jews,as demonstrated in their ""Running of the Jews"" festival(similar to Spain's ""Running of the Bulls""). Borat leaves his homeland behind(not to mention his angry,abusive wife,his jealous neighbor,his grown son and the large Holstein cow he lives with)to do a report for the one television station,one on that great glorious nation of the U.S.of A.Once in America,the tour-de-force picks up as can be inferred by the ads. From his inability to get anyone in New York to warm up to his lack-of-personal space mannerisms,to his crusade to win over ""The Virgin Pamela Anderson""(for whom he falls in love with while watching a new and mystical television show on his first day in NYC:""Baywatch"")at a Virgina mega-store signing in Los Angeles. Along the way,he busts up everything from a bright redneck rodeo in the deep South to a gentile dinner party in Mississippi(?),finding a way to fraternize with inner-city black kids and some USC drunk-boys returning from Spring Break. All the bits are quite funny and a nervous stay at a Bed&Breakfast run by Jews that has Borat and his producer(Ken Davitan) scared enough to believe that the roaches in the room are the hosts transformed and a knock-down,drag-out fight Au naturel being uproarious as well as painful to watch simultaneously.Director Larry Charles,mostly known for his work on TV,particularly ""Seinfeld"",makes this look as seamless and mockumentary as possible. A review(it was either Rolling Stone or Entertainment Weekly)described this as(and I'm paraphrasing)a socio-political version of ""Jackass"" and that may be the most accurate way I could encapsulate it. Cohen's seemingly innocent yet crass foreigner is as able to draw out the awkward,unplanned funniness out of mostly innocent folks(a dumbstruck drivers'Ed instructor,a ""gypsy""woman holding a garage sale)and skewer those who are far,far from innocent(a sleazy car dealer;a racist,pig-headed rodeo exec;the drunken frat-boys mentioned earlier). I'm not sure there's a clear reasoning or moral to this show,but I do get the feeling that the filmmakers were only hoping to give you a broad idea of how bigotry and ignorance is as much domain of the U.S. as it is any backward,poverty-stricken,culturally backwater country. Otherwise,this is mostly a comedy of cultural disconnect. Cohen(a quiet,educated Jewish gentleman,BTW) is excellent here,as his commitment to character is brilliant.I won't recommend this movie to just anyone.Those who have a wicked,dangerous sense of humor with brains,though,I would highly steer towards this.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Chaplin of Modern Times,"I must say I'm a great fan of Borat, despite the fact that i came to see him only recently. I liked the Movie despite the fact that I expected myself to laugh all the time. Instead, some parts of it made me really sad- - i still think that he is a genius in terms of understating the nationalistic and ego-massaging nature of state propaganda (""all other potassium is inferior"") in the Newly independent states. On the other side i liked how he plays around with the 'ingorance' of the west about the 'backwardness' of the east. What makes him funny is that he drags it to the extreme, yet being earnest but not brainwashed. Cohen tries to establish himself as a contemporary Chaplin and in many ways the parallelism between the characters is there: like both are Jewish comedians portraying a totally naive character and his adventures.The character has a very specific, almost idiotic body language. The only difference is that Chaplin was mute and black-and-white.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I am a person who is pretty conservative on the whole and actually (the few) a George Bush supporter ... but you know what? This stuff is still hysterical.

The only part that bothered me was trying to decipher between the scripted and the unscripted scenes. Let me tell you, if it was all NON-scripted as the producers claim, it's even funnier. Sure, some of the gags are cruel. Sure, some of the stuff sort of laughs at a ""stupid"" America. But it's still funny. Does the anti-American stuff bug me some? You bet. But is it inaccurate or unfunny? Absolutely not. You've got to be able to laugh at yourself to appreciate this film, but if you can, it's funny, and it's unique.

the worst movie I have ever paid to see,"I laughed out loud a couple times, and chuckled mildly at several more points. That is all that can be said positively about this movie.I find movies like Super Troopers, and even deliberate gross-out movies like Date Movie, quite funny. This, however, was so patently offensive, I only stayed because I refuse to walk out on any movie. The nudity was bad enough, but the unrelenting mediocrity and lack of style was far worse. Perhaps you have to see the show first, but I simply found it to be awful.If it was meant to be a social commentary, it is an incredibly crude one - intelligent analysis should be the standard, not shock value. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it was still a failure - deadpan delivery works for a short time, but if used continuously, it loses the ability to surprise.

Sacha Baron Cohen does a fantastic job at playing Borat and making the character and the whole movie absolutely hilarious.

Nice swimwear - NOT!,"My husband and I went to see this last night in part being fans of ""Da Ali G Show"" and also carried along with the hype with the marketing campaign. My verdict is that this movie is a somewhat mixed bag of great satire, uncomfortable humour, completely crassness and plain bad taste. Some of the scenes had me laughing hysterically, some shifting uncomfortably but still laughing and some shaking my head as too extreme and bad taste to be funny.The film is extremely creative and original, is well filmed and scripted. It is probably a very good case study on social tolerance and opinion across a broad demographic. The most interesting scene for me was Borat making a guest appearance at a rodeo and the crowd reactions to his speech and then to his singing.It is worth seeing in part for humour, but mostly for social observation. How would you react if confronted with those situations? Plus the image of Borat's swimwear is unforgettable! 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Only for broad-minded individuals willing to look in the mirror and laugh,"I think the reason this movie has been so polarizing, is because it is so in-your-face. The reason Cohen is so rude is to get reactions, either from the unwitting participants in this masterpiece, or from us the audience.If you are not prepared to look at yourself and ask yourself what your reaction would be to scenes in the movie (and possibly learn, god forbid), then don't watch it. Rather go and get yourself a traditional American comedy that won't challenge your flimsy beliefs.By the way, it is not an assault on any particular culture, it is an assault on various weak points in many cultures (and your abdominal muscles).This is purely brilliant, out-of-the-box thinking from a very intelligent and brave comic.10/10 red-hot chillies.Is nice, I like, High five!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not just a comedy but an excellent study of people's behavior,"Like he did with his character Ali G, Borat is filmed with Cohen (The Dictator, 2012) moving around real life people as the character Borat Sagdiyev without people knowing he is an actor. This gives a brilliant and very interesting insight into the diversity of the American people, as well as a one of a kind social criticism as Borat's unconventional behaviour brings out the best and worst of people. It's quite interesting and thoughtful to observe that people in social groups often looked down on or judged easily actually are the ones best at accepting his differences as opposed to the higher social groups that reacts with horror, hate and dislike. Anyone who are familiar with the work of Cohen knows not to expect political correctness and this is really the case here where a wide range of types are victims of Borat's incorrectness. The rare real insight into the different social groups are a variety of pleasant (Luelle) and almost frightening (the audience that keeps clapping at the rodeo), you just can't make this stuff up!

Good remedy to cure self-complacency,"First of all i was unable to find reason for Kazahstan people to get pi**ed off about this movie and i guess they are not, because only nation which could get angry about this film is Americans and, as we see from comments, they do so. However, the jokes at the beginning were not quite successful, because they sounded like they were intentionally prepared and the visual image was added after, thus they became technical and reason-in-it-self like.The good parts were those episodes similar to Bunel's masterpiece ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" where Borat shocked well tuned bourgeoisie society and mocked their numbed customs and lifeless attitude. The same was with feminists - the only reason why Borat so successfully mocked them was because they took themselves too seriously. It doesn't mean, that feminism is wrong or something, it just showed how funny people can become when they are so righteous and assured about the relevance of their ideas.Generally Borat project resembles the idea of Southpark - whether we make fun of everything or nothing at all, so it's kind of hypocrisy to laugh at the beginning of the movie but then after you see reflection of your nation, refuse the film by denouncing it as unethical.So this film could bee seen as another call for stop being so self centered and finally being able to laugh about yourself and about the ""sacred"" things like country, god, nationality and many others. Because when people or nations are unable to laugh about themselves war, hatred and other social malfunctions can emerge and it's good when someone reminds us about that.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst movie I have ever seen and ... NOT funny at all,"Until a few years ago you could depend on IMDb scores to be really dependable. The top-250 contained milestones of film worth seeing.

I have never ever walked out of a movie before, but this time I did. Borat is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. And it is NOT funny. There were a few times I laughed, but even then I found that the jokes could have been better. It is not that I can stand jokes about Jews or women. But I really rate Benny Hill as far superior to Borat.Seeing people giving this film 10 stars makes me wonder if the rating shouldn't at least be moderated a bit.Borat better than 12 monkeys?

The work of a real improvisational genius - try this on Will Ferrell!,"I loved Da Ali G Show, bought him Indahouse and own a couple of Ali G Show DVDs, one of which heavily features Borat in several hilarious bits, so why the change of heart? I'm not sure, but when pressed (by myself) I admit that I enjoy the concept more than the films, and I felt uncomfortable knowing that Sacha Baron Cohen was manipulating what were often good and innocent people so that they would feel themselves uncomfortable and unsure of themselves.Yes it showed that Americans are often critical, unthinking and hypocritical idiots, but surely by now that is shooting fish in a barrel.So since checking it out the first time I never bothered with it again.I certainly admire Sacha Baron Cohen, in any of his Ali G Show incantations he never varied from character and directed the chats back to where he wanted them to go regardless of the interviewee's intent, but when things did go astray his ability to work and ad-lib on the fly was nothing less than incredible. Even in Borat guise, he apparently remained in character at all times to keep sharp and was so focused on keeping things authentic that he never washed the Borat suit, and those that have seen the film know that there is only one outfit that he wears in what must have been a multiple week shoot.The Borat plot is irrelevant, a Kazakhstani reporter goes to the United States with the intent of making a documentary on US customs, only he gets sidetracked by an episode of Baywatch and decides his new goal is to marry Pamela Anderson, (if he had chosen Paris Hilton it would have been a fait accompli). The laughs come from both Borat's view of society, gender relations and his lack of political correctness (all of which p*ssed off the Kazakh people who rightfully thought that the less intelligent viewer might swallow the shtick lock, stock and barrel), and from the reactions of the unwitting Americans who feel they are being interviewed by a clueless hack and open up to their true attitudes.There are a million quotables in the film, most of them involving the society taboos of incest, rape and bestiality, among others. Again this elicits the shock response from well meaning people, but more disturbingly it signals to those with less than pure thoughts to go nuts and espouse their own ridiculous ideas. An example comes where Borat asks a car dealer how fast a car needs to go to kill Jews, and the dealer calmly gives not only a blank stare, but a thought out answer! I think realistically if anyone takes offense at what Borat says, they shouldn't be watching the film in the first place, or they at least didn't see the preview. It is the responses that should trouble society, as so many interviewees casually toss out racist and homophobic comments with precious little prompting, only because they thought it would never be seen.Borat has been criticised for being largely set up, and the scene with Pamela Anderson is clearly a set up. The scenes involving the rodeo organiser, the car dealer, driving instructor and Idiot college kids must embarrass the participants and anyone ever associated with them. The College kids in particular earn the right to be publicly shamed, (thanks to Anthony, Justin and David's parents!) I won't go into any other scenes here, the movie is only 80 minutes and watching it is almost as quick as reading this. In essence I feel the charm of Borat is that he is largely ego-less and ignorant, his apparent innocence is endearing to those he comes across, so their attempts to help are endearing, which is why I feel awkward watching them get screwed over.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Extra points for being the first and going the furthest.

"If you like-a this movie film, you get a high five!","It's-a very nice. Performer Sacha Baron Cohen keeps character comedy alive with this ingratiating, sometimes utterly outrageous film that does do more than just deliver belly laughs, as it takes its title character - a clueless, well intentioned TV personality from Kazakhstan who travels to the U.S. and A. to study its cultures so that the great and glorious nation of Kazakhstan may learn a thing or two. It exposes a variety of prejudices as lovable Borat interacts with a great many average Americans, finding that things aren't so ideal in his host country. Cohen is absolutely incredible as he stays in character no matter what the situation is, and priceless as he displays his ignorance of so many aspects of American culture. Among his travels, which do take on an episodic nature, he learns about American humour (NOT!), antagonizes the audience at a rodeo as he does his own version of the national anthem, makes friends with a prostitute (Luenell), and spars with his curmudgeonly, corpulent producer Azamat (Ken Davitian). Granted, Cohen does go to some pretty crazy lengths to get laughs, especially when he and Davitian have their climactic physical altercation. Still, he does generate some honest guffaws, which is more than can be said for some comedies. The best moments come when Borat is meeting with the assorted American citizens, and their reactions as they try to decide what to make of him are priceless. Part of the plot revolves Borat becoming infatuated with actress Pamela Anderson and travelling across country, from NYC to LA, with the intention of making her his wife, and this adds to the wacky appeal. One of the most refreshing elements to ""Borat"" is its dispensing with anything resembling political correctness; too bad more mainstream comedies don't have this level of brevity. Cohen is a lot of fun (it's hard not to crack up simply seeing his face on the DVD cover), and Davitian makes for a great comic foil. While his brand of humour may not be for everybody, some viewers are sure to appreciate his dedication to his craft and love his go-for-broke, anything-goes attitude. The action moves along very well, and the film wraps up in record time, coming in at a very reasonable 84 minutes. It gets off to a great start, and remains amusing right to its appealing wrap-up.

A Priceless Comedy From Sacha Baron Cohen!,"Making a complete mockery of everything in its path, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (simply known as Borat) is an absolute riot that's offensive, shocking & hilarious in every possible manner and despite the controversy it caused during its time of release, it remains one of the finest comedies of its decade.Borat tells the story of its titular character; a TV reporter in Kazakhstan who's sent to the ""U, S and A"" by his government to make a documentary about American society & culture. Once there, he interacts & interviews numerous people in order to understand the American way of life and after watching an episode of Baywatch, falls in love with Pamela Anderson.Written by Sacha Baron Cohen & directed by Larry Charles, Borat works only because of Cohen for the actor is truly committed to his role and does a terrific job in bringing to life one of the vilest characters to ever grace the film canvas. Many segments present in the final print are unscripted & improvised on the spot and the hysterical reaction it is able to garner from its unsuspecting subjects is truly priceless.There are multitudes of rib-tickling moments to be found here for we witness Borat taking a course to understand American humour, mocking a panel of feminists, irking a rodeo crowd, insulting his hosts, making numerous anti-semitic, homophobic & sexist remarks, and many more situations that soon escalate into total madness. And yet, as the film nears its closing moments, it goes on to show that it has a heart of its own.On an overall scale, Borat is an insane exercise in crude humour that spares nothing & no one over the course of its runtime, captures the ignorance & tolerance of American society quite effectively, and benefits a lot from Sacha Baron Cohen's swashbuckling performance which single-handedly elevates this mockumentary to an instant classic status. Enjoyable, entertaining & filled with moments you can't help but laugh despite being aware of its utter offensive nature, Borat is definitely worth a shot and comes delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,Comedy

A history major from Cambridge would suggest the former: an uncanny ability identify social stereotypes, generalizations and fears and exploit them for comedic purposes.Cohen, who made the Borat character mildly famous on his HBO program ""Da Ali G Show"" reaches his broadest audience by daring to make an entire movie, effectively posing as his character in real life situations and catching it on film along with the reactions of all those he has involved (or has duped, in other terms).The character Borat is a reporter for Kazakhstan's national television network who travels to America (the best country in the world, right?) to learn things that he can take back Kazakhstan. He is an embodiment of ignorance and prejudice (Borat is terrified of evil Jews and deplores womens' rights) posing as a foreigner who doesn't know any better. The results are genius and sometimes even sad in the pathetic way depending how you see it, but definitely over the boundaries of what we're used to. It's sort of an intentionally misleading documentary. Borat might be fake, but the reactions to him are real.Tying the plot together is Borat's discovery of ""Baywatch"" and adult film star Pamela Anderson and his decision to travel across the country to take her virginity. That is the through line, the rest of the film are scenes addressing all sorts of social and religious groups/classifications, or even just testing Americans' basic aversion to closeness with strangers in public or excessive nudity. ""Borat"" and Baren Cohen basically take all the things that we censor in America and put them right up front to see how we handle them.Truthfully, ""Borat"" is not a forgiving comedy, nor is it very mature on the surface. The male nudity is gratuitous, references to female genitalia are frequent, excrement is popular and anyone who doesn't immediately connect with the satirical purposes would find it racially and ethnically offensive in about every way possible. In other words, you have to be highly cognizant of Cohen's purpose or simply love all that stuff at face value to recognize ""Borat"" as one of the best and most original comedies in a long time.For the intelligent viewer, it's completely impossible to ignore all the genius put into this film. The film seems to be hardest on Jews, yet Cohen is Jewish and actually speaks in Hebrew frequently when he's ad-libbing in Kazakh. The Jewish couple he meets are the two cutest old people you'll ever see and he claims they've shifted shapes and throws money at them. In these scenes the humor comes from Borat's reaction, not the people he's 'duped' and the intention is to point out our blind prejudices. When Borat comes across a Gay Pride Parade in D.C. he says they're the nicest and friendliest people he's met in America -- because there's no fear of personal space invasion. On the other side, he gets some serious responses of bigotry from Americans just by prompting them in subtle ways that bring up homosexuality or the War on Terror. You can call Cohen un-American, but the British actor is only provoking and not stooping as to make the people in the film look bad by editing the film a certain way.Cohen and his incredible characterization talents far and away make ""Borat"" cutting edge and audacious comedy. Straight up ballsy. There might be debates elsewhere, but there's no question about how daring his comedy is. It also happens to be one of the most memorable and quotable comedies in recent years -- the scenes in this film will not leave you because this is such stand-out work.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
wildly funny first half. after that---not so much,"this movie is hysterically funny,at least the first half is.the problem is,after that it just gets silly and old and pointless.to me,this is one example of a TV show character which doesn't quite make it in a full length feature.some of the things Borat does are done merely for shock value,but come across as being inane at best.there's only so much of the same thing you can take over and over again.some of it is undoubtedly in poor taste,but that's not the problem here.the problem here is trying to do too much with too little.i nearly peed my pants several times in the first half,but after that,nary a trickle.so,fora riotously funny first half,i give ""Borat"" 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It is quite scary cos i depend on IMDb for a lot of the feedback before seeing a movie, mediocrity should not influence the ratings for movies on a site as exhaustive as this.Borat...is a novel effort at the most, though i think he made a mess of an excellent opportunity with over the top humour that you have to strain hard to find funny.6 out of 10 for the effort. about 3000! if i were to rank it among greats.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Boring.,"Not a very amusing premise. One not very funny joke that just goes on and on long past its expiration date. I'd like my time and money back.Many of those in the apparent target market won't realize the real joke is on them. Several of the unwitting 'stars' of the movie are now suing, but I have to believe that they were only exposing their true feelings when they said and did what was shown in the movie.Some of the others featured in the movie were trying to be nice and helpful, but were cruelly insulted and embarrassed.It really isn't funny to keep pushing people to see just how far you can go before they stop being polite to you. Especially when that doesn't end the rudeness.Humor doesn't need to be Politically Correct, but it does need to be funny. This movie was not funny.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"It's nice, great success!","'Borat' is one of my all-time favourite comedy movies and is one of the few films that never loses its humour, no matter how many times you watch it. This is, in my opinion, Sacha Baron Cohen's best film by far - I don't dislike his others but they just don't come close to 'Borat'.This film is thoroughly entertaining from start to finish and there aren't 2 minutes that go by without something to make you chuckle. It's difficult to think of another film that manages to mock and offend so many different people, but it's the complete lack of giving a sh*t that makes it so special!'Borat' is a classic and Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedy genius, a must-see for anybody with a sense of humour!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great movie,"And I mean the actual definition of ""literally."" I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening and I wish I could see it 100 more times.It's hilarious. It's offensive. It's actually pretty smart as well. Sacha Cohen is so ridiculously consistent and never seems to break character, even when he turns an entire rodeo against him in less than 5 minutes.I really don't want to speak anymore of the film, because part of the beauty of it is being surprised by what you see on the screen. I only hope they don't edit the hell out of it, because it really was a joy to see as it wasBTW you can watch this movie for free at http://goo.gl/bfExpHaha",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An issue filled film,"Sacha Baron Cohen, is he the British Robin Williams or what (this isn't a question.)This seemingly low budget film was made in the manner of Candid Camera, except this had a visible camera crew keeping straight faces shooting an unsuspecting unpaid uncontracted non-union supporting cast of thousands. The question raises its ugly head, did they all sign releases? SAG minimum perhaps for those whose voices were clearly heard speaking meaningful words, but what if they refused the bait? Can't be. Ordinary-people ignorant, but isn't that risky? Are the producers and distributors open to a class action suit? We'll see. This, too, is America.Oh yes, I thought that all these kept-in-the-dark people delivered first class completely believable performances aka natural behavior, no actory shtik to be seen anywhere. Ensemble performances professionals should envy and audit. Indeed, we have already learned that anyone can act in this age of digitally made movies, and the trick for those without training is to find out what's stopping them. Professionals be warned!2 questions: Why does one have to be rich educated Jewish to get away with anti-semitic comedy bits? And how did this movie deal with all of these to me more interesting social and business issues, with the grosses going well into nine figures worldwide?",,Anonymous,Comedy
Not the perfect comedy but not the worst one either.,"Most people that you talk to will be on either extreme when it comes to Borat. They will either be throughly discussed that such a movie was ever made or they will hail it for its perfect comedy and wonderful situations. To be completely far, neither of these people are right. Borat is as quotable as Airplane or The Holy Grail but the film itself is nowhere near what those films are. Brorat quotes are more like Napoleon Dynamite Quotes. If you want to think that there funny then you will but if you want to be offended then you will. At the same time though Borat is not the to crude to be funny movie that the other people have been calling it. yes some scenes are crude. Some jokes are too crude to be funny for some people. There are varying levels of crude jokes and just as many of them hit as miss. Borat in short is made up entirely of trailer jokes. Jokes that don't carry a movie but are funny enough to make people see the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life,"This movie had nonstop offensive humor and jokes that fit my tastes perfectly. I can acknowledge that's not for everyone, but this film is near perfect. Only downside is that I didn't laugh as much as expected but still a great amount. Sasha Baden Cohen was absolutely excellent in his role as Borat, and so was everyone else in the movie. I'll definitely watch this again by the time the year ends!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
offensive and funny,"With a wide eyed innocence Sacha Baron Cohen plays the Kazakhstanian reporter Borat. Borat is shockingly offensive, but what is far more shocking are the feelings and beliefs of the people around him. Cohen is unflappable and though some of the stunts are clearly staged, you have to wonder how this actor actually had the fearlessness to run around places like New York city and make such a total fool of himself. From the very beginning, when Borat/Cohen attempts to ""greet"" bystanders on the subway, several people threaten to physically attack him. In our theatre, the laughter was loud. Only one moment went too far for me--but be warned that moment goes so far over the line you might not recover.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, but Over-Rated and not for the Easily Offended","A pretty funny film, but certainly not the ""10"" many give it. Moments of brilliance (the dinner party scene) offset by some crude visuals and humor. More fat, old male gonad shots than I ever need to see again. Rumored to be totally unscripted, part of the films brilliance is the uncertainty of what is spontaneous and real vs. what is contrived. While the film allegedly makes Kazakhastan look bad, it is Americans that come off looking the worst - gay bashing, Jew hating, and cheering for the death of Muslims.The theater we saw it in (a very liberal Californian venue) had a pretty mixed reaction. 1/3 howled with laughter, 1/3 quietly chuckled, and 1/5 were shocked and dismayed. About 10 people walked out but another 20 sneaked in.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Or, Democracy & Porno in America by Alexis de Toiletville","Darwin's Rule of Moviewatching #57: Anything in which an ugly hooker is the most sympathetic character should not be watched while eating. For proof, see Woody Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry,"" South Park's ""Chickenpox,"" and ""Borat."" The long, broken-English title accurately describes the premise: inept, degenerate Kazakh state TV journalist Borat (Cohen, from the character he created) and his long-suffering producer Azamat (Davitian) go to New York to conduct interviews with real Americans, to get a snapshot of American culture as well as some sex, if possible. Borat first introduces us to his village, including his hateful neighbor, his massive wife, the town rapist (""only humans!"") and the mechanic/abortionist. The highlight of his New York visit is his interview of veteran feminists (""Give me smile, baby!""). After seeing ""Baywatch,"" he dragoons Azamat into a quest to California to find & marry CJ (Anderson). There's absolutely nothing new to ""Borat,"" since the premise follows that of Hunter Thompson's ""Fear & Loathing"" & Christopher Guest's ""Spinal Tap,"" as well as French historian Alexis de Tocqueville's first-person survey of America in the 1830s. The ""Kazakh"" language is patterned after Charlie Chaplin's ""Tomanian"" lingo in ""The Great Dictator"" and the gags are lifted from comics from the Marx Brothers to Benny Hill to the creators of ""South Park,"" these last noted in the credits. Cohen & director Charles nevertheless picked proved winners & their pacing is good, never letting the film get dull. Like Guest's characters, Borat skewers American traditions, presumptions & prejudices by blindsiding people with his, shall we say, very different characteristics. These include: kissing men in greeting, strict & subjective sexism, virulent anti-Semitism, a complete lack of toilet training & admiring the US for being a mighty military dictatorship. To say that ""Borat"" is scatological is like saying ""Hoosiers"" has basketball in it. Some scenes, including Borat proudly bringing his feces & a fat hooker to a genteel Southern dinner party & his protracted, nude chase & punch-up with Azamat in a hotel are probably hard to take for most people, although Cohen's sheer comic talent & timing make them really, really funny. Borat's driving lesson & his shopping for a ""pussy magnet"" to drive across the US are a hilarious satire of modern America's most cherished & most delusional cultural institution: the style, freedom & machismo of automobiles. It would be hard to top Leslie Nielsen's rendition of the National Anthem in ""The Naked Gun,"" but Cohen scores, singing the ""Kazakh"" national anthem to the tune of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" at a Texas rodeo while dressed in red, white & blue (""Kazakhstan is the greatest nation in the world/All other countries are run by little girls""). ""Borat"" is actually rather highbrow, requiring a knowledge of American history & tradition, as well as some idea of how the rest of the world views the US, to be fully appreciated. Unfortunately, the thought required also exposes inconsistencies in Borat's background. If Borat is so utterly clueless about America, how did he learn to speak English? Since American-pattern TV shows have long been available worldwide, why would Borat assume that CJ is a real person? And if he's a neo-Stalinist stuffed shirt professional, why does Borat live in a dumpy but colorful village instead of a bland Communist high-rise? Borat's Kazakhstan evokes no sympathy or understanding, a missing-link dump populated by toothless, incestuous primates content to wallow in their own feces. Indeed, the film's biggest flaw is that Borat & Azamat are too filthy & perverted--and Borat too moronic--to evoke sympathy, even allowing for ""cultural"" differences. Nor does Cohen really try to humanize Borat until the second half. The closest he comes is when Borat, after hitting rock bottom, accepts ""Mr. Jesus"" at an evangelist service--yet another comic triumph brilliantly balanced on the edge of a knife. Luenell, as the hooker, provides the only really human touch as she has a ""good time"" with Borat at a honky-tonk (their scenes on the mechanical bull turn a sappy scene into a laugh riot). Anderson, appearing as herself & listed in the credits as such, never comes across as anything but a micro-shallow, self-serving sex object & inadvertent porn star, so let's not hear anything from her--ever--about how there's more to her. In the end, ""Borat"" winds up laughing at America and the fictional Kazakhstan, not with them, since everyone ultimately comes across as either irredeemably degenerate or inexcusably hypocritical. Still, it has to be seen in its entirety to appreciate the many funny parts--and those are very much worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
SHOCKING - Only reason it got 1 is scale went no lower.,"Worst movie I have seen in a long time and I have seen some shockers. The plot was terrible and most of the best bits were seen in the previews. Will not recommend this movie to anyone at all, maybe the producer should make contact with either working dog in Australia or Happy Madison in the USA on how to make a comedy. The grouse factor was there and it made me sick in the stomach. Sasha, you can keep that kind of humor, I should have realized that you would find it hard to make a good movie from a bit sketch from the Ali show. I must be out of touch with the public seeing I rated this movie so low.

Genius,"I saw this movie today for the first time and I am very impressed. It is a movie which has complexity and has indeed many levels of reading.1. Funny: I started laughing on the first scene and stopped after the end credits. Sure, there are many instances of ""gross"" humour, but also important, a layer of satire.2. Disturbing: Some scenes are horrifying, the fight scene, the racist scenes, and I think also the anthem scene. They constitute a shock perfectly apt to bring us to the next level,3. Deep: This film did make me think a lot. It brings forth considerations to what is the meaning of social conventions to us. What really makes us ""feel at home"" or not. I have read many comments about the satire ""against"" the United States. I can agree to these, generally. But while knowing the American culture, we are more prepared to understand the cultural differences, I think the movie could have depicted an Indio from Paraguay visiting China, or whatever, and this message would be much the same.And the last thought.. this film is not suited to an audience under age 3. Of course I laughed. Then I thought, OK I wouldn't show this movie to someone under 14. Then I thought: and why wouldn't I? (Because there are two naked men? Because I'd have to explain what is a prostitute?) And I realized this was _exactly_ the point of the movie.I really didn't like the comments saying that this movie is ""racist"" or ""sexist"" when in fact it is exactly the opposite.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst Movie ever,"This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. This man doesn't know when to stop. He has no concept of respect or responsibility for ones actions.

The people in this film are unwitting participates in the awful excuse for a movie. I am sorry that I even spent money to see this movie and if I were able to see it again for free, I wouldn't waste my time.It is completely fine to make a satirical film and pick on everyone, which Cohen did, but there is a line between satire and complete and total distaste. This movie was so uncomfortable to watch I wanted to leave it and despised the fact that I was in there the whole time. I'm not sure how long the movie is, but it seemed to last an eternity. The only reason I stayed is because I was with a friend, and he had the keys.Please do not waste your time or money on this terrible excuse for entertainment and film.

"Not that shocking, not that funny","Rushed out to the cinema after hearing this is one of the most shocking, offensive, and hilarious movies ever made. I thought it was far less offensive than an average South Park rerun, and about as funny as a weak Seinfeld episode. Oh, it's a decent movie, but after having my expectations pegged that high, it was a HUGE letdown. I think this is perhaps the most over-hyped movie ever. I think I'm pretty unique in giving this movie a 7 - it seems like everyone either loves it or despises it, but the reality is it's just OK. Additionally, the movie has been so hyped, I felt like I was already familiar with every gag before it transpired. Decent movie, just wait for it to come out on video.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"One Part Practical Joke, One Part Social Commentary","Borat is one of those things that is so hilariously immature, if you didn't have a context for how the movie was filmed it might seem a bit childish. But it resonates on a much deeper level, and as i'm sure Sacha Baron Cohen intended it, the character of Borat brings out the ignorance in people around him like a magnet. He's not meant to be taken seriously, but instead more of a trickster disguised as a fool to expose the foolishness of men. Borat was filmed documentary style, and people actually believed it was a socially awkward kazakh guy with no understanding of American culture. He and his ""producer"" are the only actors in the entire movie, everyone else are actually real people. The fact that it was so easy to convince people that his character was real should inspire Americans to expand their close-minded worldview, and as a kazakh girl i dated told me, real Kazakhstan is nothing like the one from Borat. But as i see it, Borat is not parodying Kazakhstan, it is parodying America.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Entertaining, but 'could do better'","I've been familiar with the Borat character from Cohen's Ali G shows in the UK, so knew what to expect. He's at his very best with unsuspecting members of authority, from small gun clubs through to government figures, where he can cajole them into saying things they'd rather not, or certainly wouldn't say on national TV. There are some Borat clips available from his time in the US which were not included in the film and I wondered why, because some of these were much funnier than what was included. However, the confrontations with the unsuspecting were still good and worth watching. Maybe not enough of them for me.There are pieces which are obviously set up, and this is where it falls flat because you know the 'unsuspecting' are actually in on it. OK, it needs a rolling story, and the hotel naked fight with his adviser was funny/ridiculous and parts of this made me wonder why on earth he'd put his naked frame up against the anger of a big hotel security guard who may not have had the opportunity to bash someone in a while. He does suffer for his art in places here.In one of early encounters with a genuine 'unsuspector' it's funny that he gets the guy to state that he wants homosexuals hanged! This is the art of making ordinary people be free with their outrageous prejudices, and his TV show was centered completely around this. Here, we don't get enough.Overall, there are some laughs, certainly a lot of laughs if you love him to bits, or have never seen him. I for one, am glad to see such non-PC outrage back on the screen, and it would only be a fool to take him seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
My name eh Borat!,"""Borat"" is known for its bold and boundary-pushing humor. Sacha Baron Cohen uses the character of Borat to expose and satirize various aspects of American culture, highlighting stereotypes, cultural misunderstandings, and social issues. The humor is often crude and relies on shock value, which can be divisive. Some find it hilarious and thought-provoking, while others may find it as a bit of unnecessary toilet humor.One of the strengths of ""Borat"" is its ability to provide a commentary on cultural differences and preconceived notions. Through Borat's interactions with real people, the film sheds light on societal prejudices and challenges the audience to reflect on their own biases.A significant aspect of the film's success is Cohen's ability to improvise and generate real reactions from unsuspecting individuals. This lends an authenticity to the film's comedy, as the reactions of people encountered by Borat are often genuine and unscripted.""Borat"" generated controversy due to its provocative content, including offensive stereotypes and inappropriate situations. While some argue that the film's intent is satirical and aimed at exposing societal flaws, others criticize it for crossing boundaries and perpetuating stereotypes.The film had a significant impact on popular culture and introduced the character of Borat into the lexicon. It also sparked discussions about the ethics of satire and the line between comedy and offense.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Over-the-top quasi-ethnic comedy with a keen eye for the ridiculous,"If you hate ethnic jokes, you really don't want to see this movie. Two things set it apart from the average ethnic stereotype spiel though. The first is Cohen's spontaneity and timing as the main character, Borat, and the second is the way that the ethnic ""stereotypes"" being ridiculed are often actual people. It's hard to argue that the ""drunken college boy"" is an unfair stereotype if they're filming real drunken college boys. The single funniest thing I found in it is Cohen's brilliant send up of anti-Semitism, which is all the funnier because it is so close to the mark on the absurd way Jews are often mythologized, as if they're mysterious beings from another planet. I think a lot of people who were really put off by this film were put off by it because they don't realize how much of the off-the-wall ridiculous stuff in in it is perilously close to reality. There really are people in this world who believe that Jews have horns, for example. There are also a lot of instances where at first glance, it might seem as though the movie is making fun of a particular group of people (urban black youths or charismatic Christians for example) but really the humor is not so much in what they do in their own social context, but in the way that Borat interprets what they do. It is often not gentle humor though, and it intrudes on the boundaries of a lot of comfort zones.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat: Not Boring At All...,"The film Borat is the story of a young ambassador from an Eastern European country in the United States. It follows his path along from New York City to Hollywood, and all the pitfalls along the way. It is an extremely edgy mockumentary that hearkens comparisons to many films of coming to age in America, but without the sappy side stories, excluding Borat's obsession with Pamela Anderson which fuels his journey across the country, by way of a Baywatch magazine and eventually as an unwitting saboteur in the form of a DVD. It is a story that makes little sense, but brings attention to many stereotypes we take so easily for granted when living here in the U. S. A. Borat and his manager of sorts, a chicken, and a bear are all that we get for main characters. But the amount of laughs more than make up for any shortcomings that one might foresee. Much of the humor is very dry yet jolting. You will probably actually find yourself wondering how a man could be so under cultured, and totally lose track of the fact that this is indeed a comedic character portrayal, and not a real human being sent from Kazakhstan to learn the ways of American life. The best scenes are back-to-back, and the wheels keep rolling, even while our eyes are. His inept fear of Jews and Gypsies alike, are fairly unsettling, but his reactions are so outrageous that we can almost overlook the prejudice inherent in much of his ""foriegn"" viewpoints. My personal favorite scene is towards the end at a Church where Borat finds himself stumbling in to be redeemed and saved by an overzealous evangelist. But everyone will more than likely have their own moments of complete comedic satisfaction while being entertained by this film. The acting by Cohen is phenomenal, as stated before we can easily subdue our objective view and find ourselves as lost as he is in not only the plot but dialog of the film. The dialog is undoubtedly the stronger point of the picture, even amidst the tom-foolery of an overgrown man with a child's heart. Borat actually caught a big bit of flak from the actual government of Kazakhstan when he toured the States for interviews in character as Borat. On the white house lawn, Cohen threw an impromptu press conference touting the downfalls of the Kazakhstan government, which they retaliated to with a spread in The New York Times that intended to shoot down statements made by Sacha. However, despite these factors Borat managed to break records at the box-office.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, but vastly overrated","Ali G & Borat have been on the British TV for quite a few years. Ali G in particular was hilarious when it started, Borat was a close second. The charm of all these characters is how people would take them seriously, and how the characters would get away with almost anything.This kind of comedy is ideal for the small screen and much funnier in small doses. On the big screen, particularly when you try to stretch it for 80+ minutes, it starts to get tedious. I would highly recommend this movie to people who have never seen Ali G / Borat before - to the others I would suggest buy the DVD of the first series of Ali G and watch it again and again, and I promise it will be the funniest thing you have ever seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
IS IT FOR REAL?,"It is probably foolish to write about a movie that already has over 1300 reviews here at IMDB, but I want to talk about some of its PR. We have been told repeatedly that most of the people in the film that Borat encounters were average Americans, duped by Sasha Baron Cohen into making themselves look foolish in unscripted encounters. We have been told many lawsuits have been filed by those who were hoodwinked. But is this all true, or carefully planted PR stories?I'm calling BS on most of this. We are asked to believe the supposed victims of Sasha Baron Cohen's pranks were completely oblivious to the presence of a camera filming them----or cameras! Some of these scenes are shot at multiple angles and edited together, showing there were multiple cameras. Now think about it, if suddenly cameras appeared and started filming you while you were talking to a crazy man, wouldn't you realize something was up? (I have had similar reactions to genuine documentaries too, where people do stupid things, seemingly oblivious to the presence of a camera).That said, BORAT is still pretty funny for the most part, though I do not understand how it got by with a R rating, when films far less graphic have been saddled, or threatened with, an NC-17.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Portions of it should not have been allowed into theaters. I am surprised at how leftist a lot of the reviews of this movie have been. This movie contains a lot of hilarious moments, but the average viewer should keep some things in mind: The film making process was deceptive and contained a lot of exploitation of certain people in it. Some of it legitimately pointed out problems with American Society, but a lot of it was just crude.The graphic nature of certain scenes was unnecessarily excessive. It could be very offensive to a lot of people, and that has been ignored in the rating process.The racial comedy smashed walls that people died to build. On a day that marked the ground breaking of the MLK Jr Memorial on the National Mall, it is important to recognize that.Taking those things into consideration, it was not the intention (in my opinion) of the film maker to be overly offensive. However, the finished product definitely can be seen as offensive. A lot of this movie was just not needed; that takes away from so much of the comedic genius. This movie gets a soft 6 for good comedy--not great comedy--and the sense of confusion it will leave you with when you walk out of the theater. It doesn't raise the question of what is wrong with our society like it should have, but rather the question of how did this film get onto a big screen?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat for President,"""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" is a life-changing cinematic gem. Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as the illustrious Borat, ruler of Kazakhstan and our cosmos, is simply brilliant. His escapades across the USA reveal the comedy of cultural ignorance in the most surprising ways. This fearless satire transformed my perspective on society and kept me laughing uncontrollably. Borat is undeniably the king of humor, a Kazakh hero, a wrestling champion, and an icon whose influence spans the universe, leaving a legacy that will endure for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not as enjoyable as it should be,"Sacha Baron Cohen is a very unique comedian in my opinion. He is undeniably intelligent, can be very very funny and he seems to have no single ounce of shame in his whole body. While that is his strength, it's also his Achilles heel.For those who have watched the Ali G-show and other Baron Cohen-outings, Borat is not a new character. I have often found the Borat-segments to be among the funniest in his shows. The happy and easy-going, but always misunderstanding, Kazak brings out both the best and worst in the people he meets. Cohen does a good job of bringing out peoples prejudices and strange (and often ""forbidden"") opinions through the seemingly ignorant Borat. In this movie we get to see him provoking people at a rodeo, at a dinner party and at several other public events.The thing with this movie is that i don't know if most of it was really that funny. Most of the time i was just shaking my head in disbelief. Sure there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but most of it is just so embarrassing it's hard to watch. He does so many ""forbidden"" things that he soon becomes a walking faux pas. Which is funny for a while but becomes more painful after a while.In the end this becomes one of those cases where i can see what they were thinking, can appreciate the effort, but in the end the result is not as enjoyable as it should have been. After all, there are just so many times i can hear him call people retards, bashing homosexuals and Jews before it becomes old. Borat is a funny character but i think i prefer him in smaller doses, this becomes almost overpowering. For those who can't get enough of the embarrassments this should be a treat though. For the sensitive people it's, as always with Cohen, best to stay away. I rate this 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"worst movie I ever watched, I'll never get that 2 hours back",This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe I actually paid for it. If you are Jewish do not go within miles of the screening! I could not believe there were not people protesting outside. There were people who walked out out the theater and I would have too but I thought that the movie would improve it did not. This is not comedy. The audience even gasped at certain scenes. There were kids in the audience who appeared to be younger than 14 years old and the rating should have been at least 18 years. Three young boys I seen entering the theater before the movie started could not have been any older than 12 years old. The movie rating people made a big mistake on this one. It was just plain awful.

Weird but funny,"I don't know what the hell I just watched......but I enjoyed it. A couple of people have told me to check it out. I decided to grab my family (except the mother), which was an interesting experience.The middle part was the best part of the film. So many odd things happened that made me burst out laughing. I don't think I'd watch it again, but It's one of those films you must watch at least once. The parts you could tell were unscripted and quite funny.I also saw on Amazon that there is one of two shows of his. I might check them out along with the sequel.Overall I give this movie an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More than meets the eye,"Generally I enjoyed the film Borat. I was glad it was not longer than it was. Once one dramatizes humor about cultural differences one, I think, can take it only so far. At the end I kept saying alright already I get it! Having said that, however, I think the film has something poignant to say which belies the prevailing humor of its content.Some in the Jewish community, I have read, have refused to see the film because of its explicit and continuous anti-Semitism. Admittedly, some was hard to take. I am Jewish. I am extraordinarily sensitive to the history of anti-Semitism and the Jewish historical plight. It is because of that, I think, those who were offended by that element of the film miss the point of what the film was about. I think Sasha Baron Cohen, who is Jewish, was making a serious contention about cultural relativism. It doesn't matter where one comes from, hatred and ignorance is what it is no matter how you dress it up  or down.In part, I believe he was taking aim, too, at those in America who pride themselves as being an advanced western culture. Some in America have things in common with those in a seemingly backward country such as Kazakhstan. However stupid you may think those people are, there are those from an advanced society who will have many of the same attributes.Eastern Europe, Russia and the west have had virulently anti-Semitic histories. Anti-Semitism, has existed, too, in countries which have not had a long history of it. Anti-Semitism and racism, in general, know no cultural boundaries. It merely takes on a different face. The Jew as ""the other"" has faced demonization nearly everywhere. Ancient canards about the Jew as the devil still incredibly prevail where people have not even met a Jew and where no Jews or few exist. A documentary film called ""The Longest Hatred"" about the long history of anti-Semitism once said ""you do not need Jews to have anti-Semitism."" Three positive characters exist in the film. Two were orthodox Jews and one was a black prostitute. This was not accidental. Sasha Cohen tried, I think, to say something to defend those whom the majority still often think  for the most irrational reasons are the indefensible. People are still just people after all and one can find humanity in people and in places where you think none would exist.If others who are not Jewish take away from that movie the idea that Borat and the characters he meets are right about their world view, then there is little hope for those of us in this world who would like to extricate ourselves from the sewer of its stupidity and ignorance.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Jagshemash!,"BORAT is a film that I had been heavily prepped for. I had been told it was one of the funniest films ever made. I had also heard that it was pretty much the most offensive thing ever made. Well, both counts are wrong. Borat is a funny movie, there is no denying this, but it isn't the funniest movie ever made. In fact, it's not the funniest movie of the year (which, in my opinion, was Clerks II). However, it is very original and enterprising, two qualities that movies recently have very little of (Employee of the Month, I'm looking in your direction), so I have to appreciate it. If not, we might never get more of those kind of films! The plot (if you want to call it that) consists of this. Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a minor Kazakhstani TV personality. He is sent by the government of Kazakhstan to the United States in order to learn more about the prosperous country in the hopes that the lessons he brings back could transform Kazakhstan. Once in the United States, Borat sees Pamela Anderson on a rerun of Baywatch and decides that he must make her his bride. So he sets off on his way to California, with his camera crew and producer. That's all there is. It's pretty much a way to set up uncomfortable situation after uncomfortable situation featuring Borat as interviewer, talking to everyone from a feminist women's group to a dinner party of conservative southerners.Now, if you consider yourself a ""blue-stater,"" you'll find a lot here to laugh at. If you're a ""red-stater,"" you might find yourself the butt of a couple of jokes, as Cohen skewers many of the midwesterners he comes across, satirically pointing out racism, homophobia, sexism, conservatism, hatred, bigotry, etc. Granted, he probably used the best footage (as he stays in character and much of his ""on the spot"" interviews are not scripted), but it still certainly leans in one way. You have to give him credit though, because it is very funny at times.My friend, upon exiting the preview screening, summed up the film like this: ""That movie was out of control,"" he said to me. ""But did you think it was funny?"" I asked him. ""Yeah, but it was out of control."" Cohen is not afraid of anything, and that's certainly to his benefit - he pretty much has to be fearless to play this character. As for the ""is it funny"" part - yes, it is funny, but it isn't as funny as I had hoped it would be. The set-ups are great, and the satire is spot-on, but often times I found myself smiling more than laughing. When I did laugh, it wasn't from the gut, but more a chuckle. But I'm nitpicking. This film is so much funnier than any of the ""frat-pack"" movies. The problem is, I think I'm a little too hooked on Cohen's fellow Brit Ricky Gervais's THE OFFICE and its brand of humor. Yes, they share a lot in common, but THE OFFICE is less satire and more character humor. DA ALI G show had more of this character humor, but with Borat Cohen aims more towards satire, which is funny in its own way, but not quite as much as it could have been.In the end though, I would gladly pay $8 to see it again. I shouldn't be so picky. Perhaps the amazing quality of DA ALI G show and the advance reviews gave me too much hope. BORAT is a ridiculous film -- it is indeed out of control, as my friend said. And don't believe the hype -- it's not nearly as offensive or controversial as some people might want you to think. They just don't get it.Review by Ross Putman, written for http://www.boxofficefanatic.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Kazakh who?,"We must begin by saying that this movie's director was surely never in Kazakhstan nor has he ever seen a Kazakh in his life. The character impersonated by Sacha Baron Cohen shows only the stereotype that Americans imagine when they think about Mediterranean popular characters, from his physical appearance to his way of talking and behaviour. This movie is only a succession of gags of which a few are funny indeed but whose majority is not funny at all and sometimes even disgusting. The story of the Kazakh journalist who went to USA to learn about American way of life is poor indeed. The best parts of the movie are those episodes where some idiosyncrasies of American society are shown like for instance a religious meeting near the end of the movie and the behaviour of white and black young people. But even those are almost only commonplaces we have seen much better treated in lots of other movies. This movie is a real disillusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Borat make big disappointment,"I had very high expectations for this film. Many of my friends have seen it and loved it, and I'm not at all offended by racist, sexist, and crude humor -- hell, I own a copy of ""Team America: World Police."" I knew I would probably not be offended by ""Borat,"" but I truly did not expect to be bored. Halfway through I found myself looking at my watch, wishing I would have spent my $10 and two hours on something, anything (well, almost!) else. ""Borat"" is the same joke over and over and over again -- the same set-up with slightly different people. Yes, Mr. Cohen, I see how Americans can be racist, sexist, ignorant, homophobic ""ass hole."" I see how by pretending to be an anti-semitic, naive, uneducated reporter from a backwards country whose name most Americans can't even pronounce, you induce your interview subjects to reveal their own prejudices.So what?The fact is, I've seen this done many times before -- to much greater effect and without the blatant mean-spiritedness demonstrated in almost every frame of the film. Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles,"" Steve Martin's ""The Jerk,"" almost any Monty Python flick, and the real documentaries ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Roger & Me"" -- all of these comedies attack the same serious social issues with blunt-force trauma. All of them ""make fun"" of prejudice, thereby forcing the audience to recognize their own prejudices. All of the above-mentioned films artfully and interestingly expose the underbelly of American society. Borat, however, is a second-rate Latka from ""Taxi"" -- an unfunny, repetitive Tony Clifton with a funny accent. We've seen it before, Mr. Cohen, and we've seen it better. If you're going to tackle such important subject matter, have something interesting to say about the subject.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Tasteless and Offensive but FUNNY,"Anyone who is likely to be offended by sex jokes, anti-Semitic and other ethnic jokes, or scatological humor would be well advised to stay away from ""Borat"" -- make that far away. But for those with a suitably twisted sense of humor, the movie is world class fun.""Borat"" achieves a level of inspired nuttiness I had not seen since the height of the Monty Python oeuvre. There is something about British humor that allows thorough silliness but (seeming) earnestness and seriousness, too.Our protagonist, Borat Sagdiev a Kazakhstani TV reporter, comes to America to report on ""the greatest country in the world."" During the course of his adventures, Borat learns about the intricacies of indoor plumbing and vows to marry Pamela Anderson  to whom he later proposes at a book signing, promising Pamela her own plow if she will have him. And so it goes.Some reviewers have found high minded messages in Borat. I, in stark contrast, thought that it was simply a very funny guy  Sacha Baron Cohen, the star and co-writer of the piece  creating some very funny situations of an earnest but naïve visitor to our shores dealing with culture shock of a high order in a raunchy but inspired way. Messages aside, it's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Highly recommended, 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The Hype Was Real, This Film Will Be Legendary","Combining a fictional man (Borat) with factual events, this film shows America to Americans from an outsider's perspective. Sadly, what we find is distressing in the modern era. A country full of people with biases and prejudice, or as my friend put it, ""Borat made fun of all the things that people think matter, and actually really, really don't."" Sacha Baron Cohen continued the ""Candid Camera"" pranks he was pulling on ""Da Ali G Show"", only stepping up the offensiveness to a whole new level. While this will scare off certain people (jokes about Jews, blacks and 9/11 aren't always well-received), those who are mature enough to understand the context will appreciate the presentation.Borat comes from a world that fears Jews (with their ""horns"" and endless greed) and the audience is left to think he is very backwards and a relic of unenlightened days. But by touring America -- and the scenes are all real people, not scripts -- we see that people still hate people for superficial reasons. Religion, orientation, class, gender and race are all held as the keys to what a good person should be. But these are those things that Americans think matter, but don't.The humor is not just a decloaking of America. There's also some fun ""Baywatch"" and Pamela Anderson references, and a lengthy scene of male nudity that is both hysterical and revolting (but in my opinion the hysterical far outweighs the revolting). Another scene of male nudity is perhaps even more shocking from the themes it implies. I cannot really say more here without ruining the jokes.The ""great films"" each year are dramas or documentaries. Rarely do comedies get remembered as being ""great"" critically. But this one might have broken a barrier we haven't seen in almost forever. ""Borat"" is not only endlessly funny (the hardest I ever laughed in a theater) but timelessly important.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If this was for real...,"The Kazakhstan government is not happy, nor should it be. Sasha Baron Cohen's movie 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' depicts Kazakhstan as a misogynistic, anti-semitic, handicap bashing backwater of impoverished villages. Borat arrives in the US to learn civilization for his country and we follow his journey from New York to Los Angeles with stops at Richmond, Dallas, Atlanta etc. Borat is played even bigger and better than his character on HBO's Da Ali G Show. My husband can't stand Borat. I think his dead pan politically insane comments and attitudes are hilarious. Never-the-less, even as I laughed at Borat 's goofs and spoofs in this 80 minute film, it was a very uncomfortable 80 minutes--the comments about Muslims and gay people and the anti-semitic jokes turned my stomach. But in a searching way. There's a scene where an old Jewish couple are figuratively turned into cockroaches-- not funny. To me. Yet much of the audience in the cinema laughed. I kept having to remind myself that Sasha playing Borat is Jewish himself-- you know, I can call my mother what I want but you better respect her. Which is a troubling notion. If people do think this way, is it only a problem when they think this way out loud? Does political correctness curtail freedom of speech? Am I now advocating thought police? Some scenes were downright frightening: a group of white frat boys bemoaning the end of slavery, a Christian revival where Borat is encouraged to talk in 'tongues', Borat at a gun store where he's happily shown a gun perfect for killing a Jew. And some scenes were gross-- hair and fat coupled with nudity is not necessarily funny. That the film's most touching and protective relationship occurs between Borat and a prostitute speaks volumes for the social satire this film is, and for the goodness that deep down Borat's heart is capable of. Or maybe I'm giving Borat too much credit. At the end of the film one wonders that, were this actually real, what 'learnings' Borat would have returned to Kazakhstan from the US with. One thing is for sure though: there are many Americans who have a bit, a lota bit, of Borat living within their souls.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Enjoy the outrageousness,"Sacha Baron Cohen creates a mockumentary about one of his characters. Borat Sagdiyev is from Kazakhstan mesmerized by Baywatch character C. J. Parker. He vows to find actress Pamela Anderson and take her from California back to his home in Kazakhstan.The humor is edgy, offensive, and rather mean spirited at times. Most of it is directed at Borat. But many people in this film become collateral damage. There are multiple stories of people who got filmed thought it was a real documentary. And they were edited to make them look ridiculous. Those parts are not always that funny. They're usually too obvious. Anyways self deprecating humor is usually the best. Sacha really excels at making fun of Borat.

"Great acting, overrated comedy of its day.","When this film released to theaters, reviewers were literally falling over themselves to give the picture a ""two thumbs up"", check Rottentomates.com for an impression of the critical response to the movie. You can also find TV interview segments on Youtube where Sasha Cohen, the star of this comedy, admits freely that the film is overrated.Why? Well, for starters there's a tendency to put too much gloss on everything in the world of Hollywood, as if production technique is as important (or clearly, more important) than having an original idea. Also, much of the sentiment and emotion in US cinema is generalized at best, or grandstanding propaganda at worst.""Borat"" the movie follows a Kazakh TV journalist on a voyage around the United States, discovering American lives via interviews that often derail or become awkward due to his apparent foreignness. His real- life interviews reveal the cultural inconsistencies, classism, racism, sexism, religious bigotry in modern society, an image that's often ironed out so its 'best view' is on display in cinema etc.That said, ""Borat"" just isn't very good comedy. His acting chops are great, and there's clearly a number of memorable situations, but I personally only actually laughed two or three times during the film. It seems like the daring, no-holds-barred nature of the comedy and its underlying social critique are what film critics held up as great comedy, regardless of its actual humor value.With a title like ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" and such an almost-iconic character that Cohen created for this picture, I very much wanted to like the film, but felt it often reveled in awkwardness and bad taste rather than any deeper sociological comedy. Commendably the film does put in a very touching moment on the senselessness of war, also the film makes some point about the inherent 'not-grown-up-ness' of popular culture. Much is made of the films 'mercilessly un-PC' approach, but to be honest I just thought the jokes were kind of gross.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Critics, comedians and cinema lovers alike heaped praise on this film for being the funniest thing in 2006. So did it deserve the hype it got or was it just sheer over-rated fodder. I can tell you it's neither. Whilst being outrageously funny the film does repeats its jokes a bit like sexytime. Also if you are easily offended this might not be the ideal comedy for you as the laws of political correctness are completely thrown out the window as it makes the likes of Team America the patron saint of being polite. Hopwver if you think rules are stupid then you will love this film. For me personally it did push my boundaries and I am quite sweary so it's basically a two way street.

Borat - a bad example or comedy gold?,"Ahh, yes. What can be better than a mockumentary? A mockumentary with Sacha Baron Choen. This is the hit movie Borat.Borat is a fictional character who lives in Kazakhstan, along with his wife, sister and mother (and the village people) and works for a TV station. After a brief introduction to his village and its ""charming"" inhabitants, the primitive fellow explains his task: he is being dispatched to the US to report on the country. That, he hopes, will help Kazakhstan become a better country, by having an example. But Borat doesn't fit well among the Americans, always causing trouble or behaving improperly. The report turns into a journey across the US when Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching Baywatch.Borat is a hilarious character, the image of a village man, who doesn't know much about manners, high society and life in general. With his accent, conversation skills and goofy moustache, Borat became a symbol of comedy.The movie is anything but flawless. First of all, the village doesn't resemble a Kazakh village at all, none of the villagers look Kazakh, not even Borat. Well, believe it or not, the village is Romanian. It's funny (if you understand the language) to listen to what the people are actually saying, since the translation is different. The movie is controversial, Kazakhstan is not populated by Borats, but the movie wants us to believe so. It creates the image of a country populated by anti-semites and unintelligent brutes.Most explanations are in Russian – most of the word are spelt wrong. Apparently nobody proofread the script It's a daring movie, it's hilarious, it's clever, it's controversial, it's not a perfect cinema piece, but it still is great.

It is nice...I like,"The lead star in this cross culture docu-comedy is Borat, an energetic yet clueless moustached Khazakstani reporter. Borat is Sacha Baron Cohen's more appealing alter-ego, and this film is much funnier and wittier than the crude, cringe worthy 'Ali G Indahouse'.The Ali G film was a failure as it took Ali G outside of his familiar mock interviews, which were humorous, and gave him a 90 minute film in which he had to operate on a higher level amongst a league of people very different to his bewildered guests. It relied too much on childish toilet humour and basically hammered a nail into Ali G's coffin.Anyway, enough about the past. I am glad to say that Borat is a lot more amusing and smart than the fore-mentioned. The film is done in a mockumentary style, in which the reporter travels to USA for 'cultural enrichment' as he believes it is the greatest country in the world. He is accompanied by Azabat, a short fat grouchy sidekick who only speaks in his native Khazak, and helps provide the audience with a grotesque naked fight scene with Borat in a hotel room. The strange relationship between these 2 never lets us down in terms of entertainment, as a kind of Laurel and Hardy connection seems to happen. I would say the humour arises in seeing the blatant culture difference between Borat and the mainly middle class, middle aged Americans he comes into contact with. However, it isn't only that social group he encounters, there are the young African-American ""gangstas"", the drunken Leary guys in a campavan and the hand waving pentecostal Christians-all encounters are amusing in their own way.His startlingly backward attitude to taboo subjects like animal cruelty, incest, mistreatment of woman and even rape raise afew eyebrows along the way, as Borat goes about his business with his own un-westernised attitudes and beliefs never far from the surface.The humour can be offencive, such as the constant anti-semantic references (this is probably only allowed as Cohen is Jewish himself) in the form of Khazakstani village games and Borat's sudden fear and distrust upon discovering his kindly Guest House hosts are both Jewish. Then there are his comical reactions to being told women are equal to men and should be respected. This is NOT a film for the easily offended, but if you can appreciate the humour which arises due to the vast culture difference which is at the heart of this comedy, then you should be in for a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Americans aren't so bad. *Gasp!*,"I hadn't planned to write a review of this movie. But when I noticed all the very negative reviews from all the people who didn't seem to get the point, I had to chime in.Cohen is parodying what the rest of the world believes to be America's bigotries and views of the rest of the world. He's letting the world know that America isn't the ugly, bigoted, bullying place they think it is. Cohen takes the stereotypes Americans are believed to have, throws them in American's faces and shows that Americans aren't really that way. He shows the great majority of Americans in the movie to be perfectly nice, decent people who don't buy in to the stereotypes he tries to stick on them.Do Americans think third world eastern European countries are so outrageously backwards and Soviet? The outlandishness of his portrayal shows we don't. If for no other reason, we've seen too many travelogues to believe any of it. Do Americans fear and hate the Jews? He tosses it out as a given and never gives an iota of evidence. Look at Borat's fear of the old Jewish couple running the bed and breakfast. A wonderful juxtaposition of fear and reality. Who wouldn't love to stay with that couple? Are women inferior? Look at Borat's encounter with the feminists. Are Americans jingoistic world dominators? Look at the crowd at the rodeo, how they slowly cooled to his jingoism and turned against him.Most of the movie's humor is gained from the fact the the people he dealt with were too dim to realize Borat was a faker. Can we laugh at ourselves for being that way? There's your test. I'll bet there were plenty of scenes where people did catch on, but those scenes didn't make it into the movie. That would have ruined everything.If you were offended that he poked fun at nice, innocent people, then OK. If you were disgusted by the movie's toilet and sexual humor, well, I'll grant you that criticism. But get beyond that and realize the message he's sending to the rest of the world about America. You might appreciate Cohen a lot more after that.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How was this movie created?,"Surely some of this movie was staged. The question of course, is, how much. It is awfully hard to believe that the participants in this movie were not aware of the presence of cameras and cameramen and/or camerawomen. How much of it was scripted? Also, is a release not required to show the people Borat is interacting with on film? Why would some of these people sign a release if what they said on film cast them in a bad light? Do they not realize what they sound like? Did they sign a release beforehand? Then how could they be unaware of what was going on? I might give as an example, the dinner party talking behind Borat's back while he was upstairs. However, even if it was staged, I definitely killed myself laughing.",,Anonymous,Comedy
offensively funny,"I have to admit this movie had me LOL a lot. It's so wrong but yet so funny. Before even coming to America Borat describes the ""running of the Jew"" in his home town. We see these ridiculous goblin looking costumes. You have to admit that was funny; it's not right, but it is funny. Borat comes to America and basically offends everyone. He says women's brains are small, he insults the national anthem. He brings a hooker as a date in a conservative southern home. He even hangs with some homeys in Atlanta. It was pretty good when he tries to check into that hotel in Atlanta. The guy immediately goes gets security.Last of all, the naked wrestling. Need I say more, or should I say ""see"" more.FINAL VERDICT: This is a comedy, satire, it's not meant to be mean spirited. Enjoy it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Why of The Sudden People Become So Righteous?,"Well I finally see what the fuzz is all about. It is truly a laugh out laud experience for me, after all I really have nothing to get offend by it but I can clearly see why some people will really hate this gag.I guess the name of the movie already summarize the movie so I don’t have to explain. The story is actually much better than I thought it would be, I thought it going to be like another stupid movie full of stupid gags like “Ali G In Da House”. But there is more than that, it was like a case study plus humor, and it has been written really well, very well cinematograph. The dialogue is also very funny at time, but it was the acting that brings out everything.Sacha is practically Borat so what else is there to say, he was awesome, his acting and confident is very believable, and his accent is brilliant. He makes Borat standout like anything, making him a very iconic figure.Well most of the gag is very much controversial in nature tacking topic such as racial, religion, female, social status, homosexual, and so on. I guess because most of the time Hollywood don’t really have the gut to bring those topic to lime light so when it finally came out it is pretty funny. Just like South Park. But unlike it this movie doesn’t seem to hold on anything and just go ahead with the gag; and that making it pretty refreshing.If you’re not the one that gets like offended (Jew, gay, etc) then I see no reason of complaining. People need to loosen up. This is all for humor. I see some people take this so seriously, I was very surprise. They should have known this is ain’t that type of movie that one can take it seriously, still they watch it and complain about it. Why of the sudden people so righteous? Last Words: I would recommend that people would loosen up and try to enjoy the movie; I still understand this is absolutely not for everyone taste. Do not expect any sophisticated joke.Recommendation: Yeah, It Worth a DVD.Reason To Watch: Awesomely Funny From Time To Time.Reason Not To: Very Offended Jokes.Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B+)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still in Shock,"""Borat"" is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time - probably since ""Blazing Saddles."" This is acting to the ultimate extreme, as Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a Kazakhstani reporter sent from his government to learn about the culture of the ""U, S, and A."" And what's truly shocking about this film is not the content (although some of it is ridiculous), but the fact that Cohen did not break character once; in a story in Entertainment Weekly it says the crew was pulled over by the cops more than once, and even then did Cohen stay in character. Although I don't think Cohen should get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, he should get his own category. Because this film - the message, the execution, hell, the whole idea of the thing - is completely original. No one will say this is the best movie they've ever seen - and it's probably not. But what everyone can say is that it's the most impressive feat in the film industry any of us have seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Still pretty funny and as long as all copies of films like Beerfest exist, still relevant.","I like the Borat film, I like it a lot. In some regards, it is anti-thesis to all those crass, American produced 'comedies' that usually, often predominantly, rely on limp portrayals of Europeans as a source of humour. This might come in the form of the endless disregarding of people from many-a nation in 2006's Beerfest; to the loose, sexy Eastern European girls in the American Pie films and even onto the weak, intermittent representations of Europeans in EuroTrip – which may have had a lot of good stuff going on around all the sloppy other content, but that doesn't excuse what it presents us at the worst of times. Borat is the film that presents a similarly shocking Eastern-European-come-Western-Asian stereotype in Borat Sagdiyev (Baron Cohen) and exploits what little knowledge genuine Americans really have about the places, indeed the continent, that they lampoon so often.I suppose it is a fighting fire with fire, a using of a stereotype or a negative representation in order to actually uncover the larger levels of tunnel vision some American's have on the world around them. But rather than just produce an out-and-out film in which American characters are presented in a typically naive or even stupid manner; the makers here have used real people, saying unscripted things, to act as characters instead and it is infinitely more funny than any low-brow, crass and desperate visual joke-come-representation as seen in the said films.Borat and his film-making partner Azamat Bagatov (Davitian) travel through America, specifically to California from New York after Borat realises someone called Pamela Anderson exists, getting into mis-adventures, scraps, scrapes and undergoing a brilliant mock-journey of self discovery. Borat is the ultimate fish-out-of-water, and yet he dominates his respective locations when interviewing and speaking to other Americans. If the Kazakhs find offence in Borat, than it would have initially been born out of Borat's naivety to his surroundings in mistaking an elevator for a hotel room and a toilet for a wash basin. The specific size of a room and purpose of everyday-for-us appliances act as reasons to chuckle at Kazakhs. There is also an opening ten or so minute segment in which Borat's supposed home-land is put across as less-than desirable.But from a certain point on in, the laughs snowball at the expense of Americans: a desperate car-salesman really wanting to unload an automobile on a seemingly unsuspecting foreigner; a gun shop salesman trying to offload a gun by exclaiming it's especially good for killing Jews; a rodeo gathering that express grossly mis-judged statements on the world and those around them whilst quite clearly in the presence of rolling cameras and an R.V. full of kids, the very audience the films mentioned in the first paragraph are aimed at, equally displaying a shocking disregard to most things around them.While the things and statements most of Borat's victims come up with are deeply offensive, it is the very notion someone would be willing to utter these things on camera to complete strangers that is the most distressing thing. If we laugh, we laugh at the audacity more than the statements; if we laugh at the feminists, who themselves might well be victims of discrimination or prejudice in the past, we laugh at their reactions that someone would be so-bold as to say the things Borat says to them; things that I would not assume, in any way, reflect personal feelings on the author's behalf.The important thing is that the author's are additionally able to laugh at themselves when, in a particular interview with a coloured politician who is introduced rather unnervingly via voice-over, uncovers a homosexual encounter Borat recently and unwittingly engaged in. Interestingly, the few locations Baron Cohen is unable to force reactions are in the form of a motel run by an elderly Jewish couple that quickly turns into a bit of a horror parody as they dare eat the offerings given to them by the couple, as well as an extremely tolerant group of individuals in the Deep South that Borat has dinner with. He manages to insult the host's wife and mistake a 'retiree' for a 'retard' before finally facing the fact he must flee on account the authorities are called. As very raw and very real moments of situation comedy, they work an absolute treat.The film's final third revolves around a would-be romance with a certain Pamela Anderson, someone Borat is so dense that he initially assumes her Baywatch character to be someone of real life flesh and blood. When Borat does hit the skids and the chips are down, the film reels off into a mock sense of 'where one belongs' and that friendship is actually a really important thing and, despite being in the most powerful nation in the world, it's important to remember where one's roots lie getting across a sense it's easy to be seduced by surroundings and short-term goals when you have so much riding for you, initially. The pastiche is a wonderful send up of other recent comedies' final acts, After School Special and Superbad in particular, in which the characters realise their goal is elusive and that they must respect what they have.Borat is a much better film than Ali G Indahouse, a film that takes rude, crude and low-brow material and turns it around so that those making an absolute packet out of it can be sent up. With the imminent release of Brüno, Baron Cohen is gaining in confidence and taking his characters out of more Western Euopean nations before unleashing them at Americans. The very effeminate personality of the character twinned with that very distinct but very deliberate German accent could spell trouble for some, cracking entertainment for others.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Funniest Movie Ever,"Borat has officially pushed movies like Airplane and Office Space out of the way for the title as funniest movie ever, in my mind. Cohen plays the confused foreigner trying to find the real American life, while hunting for the girl of his dreams. Borat takes racism to a new level of funny that so many other movies have failed at.I'm 18, and I was seated between an elderly couple, and a veteran who had lost the use of both of his legs in Vietnam. The four of us, along with the other several hundred attending the premier were in tears we were laughing so hard.And it's not just the racism or the gross-out humor that makes this movie. It's the confusing little quips that Borat drops along the way, showing his misunderstanding of the English language.I'm still trying not to laugh as I type this, so sorry if my review sucks, but the movie was really beyond funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Possibly the funniest movie EVER,"Yes that's right folks - I'll go there. Borat is not the funniest movie of the year, of the millennium or of the past ten years - it is the funniest movie ever. I have never laughed so hard and so often as I did watching this film. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius, and should be commended for his work here. Go to this movie expecting to be offended, because I simply can't think of a group here he doesn't poke fun at. Jews, gays, women - all are touched on, but in such a way that the offensive nature of the film reveals the bigoted nature of his (I can only assume) clueless co-stars. Cohen himself is orthodox Jewish, so for him the jokes are purely that - jokes. However, you'll see that such is not necessarily the case for those around him. Even if you align with a group that is targeted, if you can see the fun intended by the movie, it will keep you laughing for hours. (Being Jewish myself, I still found the Running of the Jew and ""cockroach"" scenes to be among the best in the movie.) Folks, this is one movie you must see before you die.

not bad but needs an editor,"Cohen comes up with some superb scenes here-- the ""polite"" Southern racists who live on Secession Drive (really!), the wrestling match, and of course the religious scene near the film's end-- but the film is unfocused and often playing for little more than body-humour laughs. Cohen's very thoughtful satire makes the familiar very foreign, but troubling questions remain: skewering people who don't speak English and who have no experience with the uber-irony of Western media (the film's unwitting Romanian village stand-ins for Kazakhstan) lowers the bar hugely, and there is the cardinal offense of attaching a moral to the ending of the film. Fun, but Cohen could certainly do better.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Candid Camera for the 21st Century,"The pseudo-documentary ""Borat"" resembles nothing so much as a ""Candid Camera"" episode on crack. Like Allen Funt, the originator of the format, Sacha Baron Cohen - along with his co-writers, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer and director Larry Charles - generates laughs by tricking unsuspecting people into making complete and utter fools of themselves on camera. Only, in this case, Cohen ventures much further into the realms of vulgarity and crudeness than Funt could ever have imagined or the television censors of his time would ever have permitted.As embodied by Cohen, Borat is a fictional character who hails from the very real West Asian country of Kazakhstan. Convinced that he can learn some valuable lessons from the West that he can then bring back and share with his own people, Borat says goodbye to his impoverished village and heads to the United States to experience first hand the accoutrements of American culture. The film chronicles the many absurd encounters he has with the folks he meets, mainly in Middle America, as he wends his way westward across the continent in search of his dream girl, Pamela Anderson.Some of the ""skits"" the filmmakers have come up with are sidesplitting and hilarious, some merely amusing, and others downright offensive (and all the funnier for being offensive, I might add). The movie is least successful when it breaks away from the strict ""Candid Camera"" formula and shows us Borat on his own, out of sight of anyone not in on the joke, still carrying on the fiction. In other words, the more ""scripted"" the movie appears, the less authentic it feels. It should also be noted that there are times when one gets the impression that the people on whom the deception is being played are not quite as ignorant of the ruse as they appear to be, primarily because the placing of the camera often feels illogical if the spontaneity were truly real and genuine. The one element that made ""Candid Camera"" utterly believable was that it was careful to keep the camera completely hidden throughout the course of the bit. Here we wonder why it takes people so long to realize that they are indeed the target of a colossal joke (a prime example is when the old Jewish couple is walking up the stairs to bring food to the visiting Borat and the camera is filming them from OUTSIDE the room rather than sticking with Borat and his cohort within).However, what gives the movie its gravitas and heft, and takes it far beyond the level of mere ""Jackass""-type gimmickry is how Cohen manages to use his shtick to expose the bigotry and xenophobia that lie just beneath the surface of a certain segment of American society. Yet, one should also point out that quite a number of these people are actually more tolerant and indulgent of Borat's inane antics than one might except any reasonable person to be (or than we ourselves might be if we were put in a similar situation). Indeed, there's a certain cruelty to the film in that the individuals and groups he is mocking are actually treating him rather nicely at times. The audience is allowed to feel superior to the people on screen in a way that might not be entirely justified. ""Candid Camera"" always seemed innocent and harmless in its intentions; ""Borat"" definitely does not, which is both the strength and the weakness of the film.Still, love him or loathe him, one cannot help but sit back and admire the sheer courage and chutzpah Cohen displays in placing himself in what are, in actuality, some pretty hairy situations. That he isn't ridden out of town on a rail, the outraged citizenry chasing close behind him with torches ablaze, is, perhaps, the most astonishing aspect of the movie. It's the bald-faced audacity with which Cohen throws himself into his work - rather than the quality of the individual sketches themselves - that ultimately makes ""Borat"" so much fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

High Five!,"I came into BORAT fairly unfamiliar with the work of Sacha Baron Cohen. I had downloaded a few ""Ali G"" clips but had never experienced Cohen's other characters. I was delighted to make Borat's acquaintance.The host of a wildly popular show on Kazakhstan TV, Borat acts as a cultural ambassador when he and his producer, Azamat (Ken Davitian) land on American soil, determined to document this strange country for his government's glorious cultural ministry. All goes well as Borat takes a course in understanding American humor and interviews a group of feminists but when he discovers the beauty that America has to offer in the form of C.J. Parker / Pamela Anderson; he begins an errant quest to make her his wife. High five!The humor of BORAT is one not of cultural snobbishness where we mock a ""fish out of Kazakhstan water"" protagonist but where the fish is making fun of the waters he's in. Poking fun at rednecks, fratboys, fundamentalists, and gun nuts (among others), no one is safe from his cockeyed observations and probing questions. Some patrons of the earlier BORAT screenings admitted to feeling guilty for laughing at parts of BORAT. I imagine that the rampant political incorrectness of Borat's ""culture"" has and will make some viewers squeamish (with some to the point of being incensed) but I always admire comedy that plays against conventions in a smart, funny way.

Funny,"Borat (2006)*** (out of 4)Well, I finally caught up with this film after skipping it in theaters after seeing ""Borat"" on several television shows. I thought the TV show appearances were all hit and miss and feared the movie would be the same and it was but there were a lot more hits than misses here. For the most part this was a one joke film and thankfully they kept the running time short even if the 80-minutes started to drag towards the end. Sacha Baron Cohen is very believable in the title role but I wouldn't say he was a very good comedian. I think, like the Jackass crew, he does a great job of making an idiot out of himself but the real comedians come from the regular people and their reactions to Borat.

Could have been better,"Borat: Cultural Learnings of American for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan was fairly amusing, but nothing more than that.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is racist, misogynist, raunchy, and just downright vile in the way he acts. And the Americans he talks to either do not realize what is going on, or actually agree with him. The tour he takes across the United States involves a plethora of random, everyday citizens being duped in this fashion.But unfortunately, it is a one-note joke. The film loses steam after thirty minutes, and can barely pick up afterwards. The proceeding minutes had their share of laughs and shocks, but nowhere near as much as the first little bit. It just sets itself up far too well, and fails to live up to its original design. The execution really should have told people from the start that it would not work for a ninety minute long film.There are no proper words to describe Cohen and his schtick.

Themes that are polemic are treated in such a way that it can result in a constant challenge to moral sensibilities. It is not surprising people can see in a movie like this nothing besides an exercise in bad taste.Directed by Larry Charles, the movie follows Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen), a TV reporter from Kazakhstan, going to the ""U. S. and A."" to make a documentary about American society and culture.Once there, the mustached journalist goes from one place to the other, interviewing different people and making sure no one leaves without being offended or thinking of him as a peculiar character. The cultural differences are vast, and this is utilized to create a character whose customs and worldviews greatly differ from what is commonly considered as respectable. For instance, he laughs in the face of a group of women-rights ladies, he shows a picture of himself with his son, where the latter is naked, etc.The sight gags and dark comedy are really successful and will make you wonder how Sacha Baron Cohen can act like that without ever breaking character.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

funny but not worth owning,"Despite all the hype this movie is very funny in parts with a not so new approach to making a movie or comedy sketch- the unwitting victim or the inside joke. Candid camera did a solid job most of the time while others like Andy Kauffman failed miserably (I found Kauffman uncomfortable to watch). Saccha Cohen does a much stronger job of the put on, some visuals are in fact inspired, however I don't honestly think many of the people on the screen were out of the loop in terms of the punchline. There were too many camera angels in spaces where a camera would be too conspicuous. Also many characters are in fact character actors and the entire scene with Pamela Anderson is unrealistic if it were not a put on. Now the fact that it is not completely unscripted is fine with me (just as Blair Witch was not really a lost student film) however because of this Cohen turns a film seemingly about American culture vs third world culture into a long journey about finding real love over infatuation. It is just so uneven- so much of the film is about culture clash that he completely missed the point of his own premise. Yes this is a funny film yes some parts are very funny but after you've seen it there is nothing extra to make you want to see it over and over. Cohen could have added a bold observation like CRASH or taken us on a journey for love (instead of Americans looking for internet brides we have a 3rd world man looking for an American bride) but instead he takes us from 60 to 0 in 2.1 seconds. It's not that I didn't like the film I just didn't love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A strange mishmash of disconnected languages and events. At times funny - mostly tasteless,"I did not like the movie but have to admit that it so eclectically combines so many different things that pretty much the only remaining option for the viewer is to laugh.For example, of the two ""Kazakhs"" who came to the US, one speaks predominantly Hebrew (when the ""Kazakhs"" are alone) and English (with some strange fake Russian-Arabic accent), except for the word ""thank you"", which is almost always said in Polish. The other ""Kazakh"" speaks Armenian only (except for a couple of curse-words in Russian on just one occasion). Both of them, of course, do not look like Kazakhs at all. The inhabitants of the ""Kazakh"" ""home village"" speak Romanian. The majority of textual information is in Russian, some of which is heavily twisted.The reason I described the mishmash of languages in such detail is because all the views and situations in the movie are mixed in pretty much the same way as the languages.In short, this movie left an impression (on me, at least) of a donkey with a head of a lion, elephant ears, peacock tail and hummingbird brain who claims to be, say, George Bush.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Health warning!,"This film should come with a health warning. I have now got the worse headache in ages from laughing at this movie.Sure it's crude, rude and offensively funny.(The wrestling scene was so painfully funny, I thought Iwas going to explode) but I haven't laughed so hard and so much at a movie since, I guess, Airplane!Having not been a great fan of Ali G, I guess I wasn't expecting much from this, but it delivers in huge amounts, from the embarrassing subway scenes, where Baron Cohen must have been playing with death, to the dinner party scene (which was brilliantly handled). Relentlessly funny from start to finish, if you are easily offended, or shallow-minded, then avoid. If not, run to see it. A better time you will not find anywhere else.And now I am going to have to lie down in a darken room. Sheer genius!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I saw Borat last night. It was unbelievable.,"This movie was gut-split-tingly amazing. I saw it last night at the Toronto Film Festival and will never forget it. I won't give too much away, but the entire film centres on Borat coming to the United States to learn the culture and report back to his home country.I think this movie may have an impact on future films is that this movie unique as it is shot with real people as extras not knowing they are appearing in a movie, or that Sacha Cohen is in character. You get the feeling sometimes that people may suspect it, and perhaps a couple are even in on it, but it doesn't really matter at all.It is almost as if you are watching a documentary - and ironically, Michael Moore was at the screening, and one wonders if this film is inspired slightly by some of his documentaries.Other times it is extremely similar to ""reality"" movies like Jack-Ass - but as opposed to quick disgusting gags, this film has a story-line and characters you get to know and love and cheer for, (even if at the time of the shooting of the film they were unaware they were one).All of these elements are packed into a movie that is about an outsider trying to fit in, and reminds you of the old eighties sitcom Perfect Strangers (Is it just me, or is Borat not a more fleshed out Balki who has yet to find his cousin Larry?).It begs the question of how he gets away with it, and showing the faces of people without being sued. My only guess is that he has them sign a waver before he begins shooting... but that's another topic altogether.All and all, see this movie, as I would put a lot of money on the fact that it will be the most talked about film this year, shatter many records, and make a mint.See it first and feel like the cool kid - like I do right now.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat: The international conspiracy,"Are you sensitive to offensive comedy? Are you offended easily? Then don't see Borat! That is a warning! I am not sure if I have ever witnessed something that made so many people laugh, and make so many people walk out. I remember while seeing it, the girl next to me had her hand over her mouth in shock the whole movie. Of course she laughed a few times, but she was more shocked that this movie was released to the public.Further more, offensive to other country's. We find Borat in his own country as he exposes you to his own home life and culture. After you get to know his country of Kazakastan, we find him getting shipped off to New York. Here is where the movie gets good. He interviews all sorts of people from African American hoodlums, to a women's rights activist. This is where he watch's a repeat of Baywatch to find his new found love in Pamela Anderson. He finds out through a book store that Pamela will be having a book signing in California, but he's in New York! He some how talks his producer into going cross country to meet his love. There is a whole mess that contains: Bears, ice cream truck, Baywatch guide line, Bed & Breakfast, and frat boys. You have GOT to see the movie for the ending, it will have you rolling the whole time. I honestly don't think I laughed this hard in a while. 10, no doubt.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

my opinion,"This movie is so hilarious and funny in general. but they show us portions of culture humiliation of different religions and cultural differences. Also, When borat and his friend Azamat were fighting on the bed because he was jerking off and that was a bit pornographic.

I felt angry because that's not acceptable to make the old woman act because that's firmly humiliated.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is the equivalent of pulling food pranks on starving African children,"I presented several screenings of this for various audiences comments. None of the audiences were willing to sit through the entire movie due to the unrelenting offensiveness and brainless antics. Twelve year old children act in the fashion Sasha Cohen displays. It is not insightful or creative or unique, rather it is lazy, unimaginative, and mean. If he was trying to trip Americans into saying or doing things that he could point his finger at, for the most part he fails. If he was trying to point out racial stereotypes that exist and use humor to combat them, his insistent offensiveness prevents that.This seems to be a classic example of critics saying ""it is a great movie and if you disagree you are not intellectually capable of seeing the nuance"". Well, making an ass of yourself and fools of others so that you can sell a movie without any worthwhile take away is not worth wasting $5-$10 dollars. This is an awful excuse of art and any self-respecting critic should be ashamed to try an label it as anything other than trash.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Glorious in many different ways,"With a film such as this, almost every definition of what the movie is about has been posted by someone or other. Some see it as sharp political satire, others stupid toilet humour, a few not even any humour before. Truth is, what you laugh at in this film, why you find it funny, will vary from person to person. The reason is that Cohen and Co have fitted a large variety of humour types into the 90 odd minutes of film. There is satire, and there's toilet humour, and also slapstick, spoof, cringe humour, everything really.The one thing you can say universally about it is that it's outrageous. This outrageousness present in almost all the scenes elevates what ever humour is present at the time to new heights. The satire is bold and without a hint of caution, the toilet humour is as clear and graphic as you can imagine, the slapstick genuinely hilarious and shocking at the same time, the cringe humour takes us to places never seen on a big screen before, everything goes that one step further. To describe it in terms of any one form of comedy is missing much of the point of the film, it's funny for a large number of reasons. This certainly goes some way to explaining the near universal acceptance of the film, as everyone sees a slightly different reason to laugh till your cheeks hurt.Personally, the part of the film that got me the most was the sheer balls of Cohen. He does things I would never imagine someone having the nerve to do, especially someone who does have something to lose. I won't go into what exactly, but the film makers show such dedication to the cause, even at the expense of their physical wellbeing, to get that one shot, you find yourself applauding simply for the lengths they went to.On a more serious note, many people are finding this film deeply offensive. But, really, that's the point. It is offensive, but it's so silly, so ridiculous, so over the top that you can't take it seriously. You KNOW Cohen isn't really anti-Jewish, you KNOW he doesn't really hate women or think 'retards' should be locked up, you KNOW (or you should know) he's only joking, so getting wound up at the horror of it all is completely useless, as most of the none PC stuff is made up. True it's placed in the real world, and there are some real world opinions that will make your toes crawl, but most of the offensive content is from Borat himself, and you can forgive him anything, as he's made up. For those finding the film too offensive to watch, I can understand why, but for the vast majority of people, the bad taste certainly won't stick in your mouth.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fairly entertaining but far from Baron Cohen's best work,"I was always a big fan of the Borat skits on 'Da Ali G Show' and loved the shockumentary style humour. Borat doesn't have the same incisive ability to destroy his subjects as Ali G but his clumsy slapstick act is very witty and strangely charming. Overall though, the film fell a bit flat. It kind of felt like Baron Cohen had used all his best jokes on the TV show and, as a result, the movie felt a bit stale and repetitive.I appreciate the fact that there was an attempt at an actual storyline (however flimsy) rather than just presenting a collection of unrelated clips like in the Jackass movies. I found some scenes to be highly entertaining, particularly the naked fight with Bagatov in the hotel and the Jewish bed-and-breakfast escape.What Sacha Baron Cohen does best is to humiliate deplorable people in a wonderfully subtle manner. The scene where he travels with the repulsive frat-boys is probably the best example of this, but the Virginian Rodeo and the Pentecostal church intervention were also quite shocking. I generally found these scenes more uncomfortable than entertaining, but I guess if the goal was to expose bigotry and stupidity, this is perfect execution.I must say I strongly disagree with the idea that this movie is bold, daring and outrageous. The people Baron Cohen goes after (religious nuts, upper-class toffs, feminists, frat-boys etc) are low-hanging fruit for an act like Borat. There is a certainly an element of danger when it comes to potentially being attacked in public, but there is nothing edgy or outrageous going on here. It's not a problem for me (I'm just here for the comedy) but it irks me that people think Baron Cohen is some kind of taboo-breaking social anarchist.Borat certainly provides a good laugh but it lacks ingenuity and gets a bit tiresome in places. I would rather re-watch the original TV clips than watch the movie again.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny on every single level,"I just caught the matinée....perhaps the funniest movie i've ever seen. Definitely the funniest in years....what's best about it is that it is funny on every level (utilizing physicality, satire, race, topical humor, sexuality, malapropisms).If anyone out there is under the impression that the guy is just doing a Yakov Smirnoff impression, trust me....it's a lot closer to Andy Kaufman meets Dave Letterman in their primes. When you see Sacha Baron Cohen at work, you'll see why people consider a Tom Green cheap imitation (even if he was in the mainstream first).Another beauty of Borat is that people with overdeveloped and underdeveloped senses of humor will find this equally funny. I was actually sitting near some people who were laughing hardest at the simplest of jokes, as well as the more subtle social commentary implied through the documentary style.Its only weakness may be the thinness of the ending of its plot , but Hitchock referred to that phenomenon as the Maguffin - meaning that if something can be successfully used to propel a plot most effectively, it should be used even if it ends up being discardable.Of course Borat gets uncomfortable at many moments, but that's a huge part of the fun. It may definitely not be a great idea to bring little kids, but it may be the finest example of comedy in years.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, funny, and then some not so funny","Sasha has mixed many moments of humorous genius with some that should have been taken out of the oven and thrown onto the editing room floor as just too much...the hotel room wrestling scene and some others.

Repetitive,"If this movie was created from scratch, I'd give it a 9. However, I've already seen virtually every joke from his TV show, I knew what he was going to do from the start of every skit. There were no new catch phrases or scenes that didn't strike me as being very similar to a scene from his show. It feels like Borat is basically selling out, he is giving up the innovation you could see from episode to episode of the show to a bigger budget film with nicer camera shots, editing etc... One could say that this is simply the evolution of his style, people often use this argument to say that Miles Davis never sold out, but I digress.

A very funny and for some aspect brave movie.,"Comedies are not really my cup of tea, however Sascha Baron Cohen is one of the few actors that makes me actually laugh, it happened with ""Ali G inda House"" and it happened with ""Borat"". I have never watched the original movie that was released more than 10 years ago and as I want to watch the new and fresh one just released this year, I have decided to recover it and I am satisfied. I mean, the movie has a lot of extreme jokes that may be considered offensive, sexists or homophobic, but it is this kind of extreme humor that keeps me entertained. Cohen was always quite ""extreme"" with his jokes, but who knows him and his career knows already what to expect.There are a few scenes that were shot with an hidden camera, showing the real reaction from normal people, but most of the scenes are actually prepared and acted and you can easily detect them.

Borat! Funny and alarming!,"Jagshemash! Here a come film review to you! OK, OK, let us leave the comedy mimicking of a central-Asian nitwit to the man who does it best: Sacha Baron Cohen. In his second feature outing following the regrettable 'Ali G Indahouse', Baron Cohen brings another of his comic creations to the screen in Borat, a riotously funny mixture of bigotry, buffoonery and bad taste.Where Ali G failed back 2002 by taking the Staines legend out of his usual chat show set-up and surrounded him with fictional characters, Borat succeeds by retaining the formula that made the show so ridiculously hilarious: making real people look silly. What little plot the movie has (Borat sent to the 'US and A' to learn cultural lessons for Kazakhstan government) is made up for by the sheer amount of gut-busting laughs. As Borat, a naive journalist with tremendously backward views on matters of sex, religion and race, makes his way across the US, his confrontations with the American public, be they real or staged, cannot help but entertain.We get anti-semitic jokes, naked man wrestling, a bear in an ice cream van and so much more it would be rude to spoil your fun. Some conservatives have decried the film as offensive and crude but Baron Cohen is doing something more than mere gross-out humor; revealing that racial bigotry and deep-rooted sexist beliefs can still be found not only in Borat's fictional 'Kazakhstan' but in the very real, United States of America.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The scenes depicting Roamnia are far from reality,"For all those people who have not seen Romania, I must say that those images are completely not realistic.

I don't believe it's fair to see that as the image of Romania, especially since if you see the country, you would definitely see the difference. Evereyone who's seen it has definitely changed their mind. I believe this movie creates stereotypes. It's OK to laugh, but this kind of generalizations can be harmful.

You'll laugh hysterically,"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, is becoming one of the most talked about movies of the year. Borat, one of the three characters from Cohen's Da Ali G Show, is a completely naive and moronic character that Cohen plays with so much conviction that it's actually scary. One even wonders whether Cohen is a genius or a madman.Borat is directed by Larry Charles, whose previous efforts were the disappointing Bob Dylan vehicle, Masked and Anonymous, and several episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. All these projects had major creative input by their respective stars, Bob Dylan, and Larry David, as does his new film.Shot in a mockumentary-style, the film chronicles Kazakh reporter Borat and his overweight producer (Ken Davitian) in their adventures in the ""U.S. and A."" They are sent to create a documentary about our globalizing culture. However, Borat quickly falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on a rerun of Baywatch, and the plot ultimately turns into Borat's quest to California to marry Anderson. What's interesting is that Cohen, a Jew, is actually speaking a combination of Hebrew and Yiddish with a Polish accent in his subtitled mumblings. The film's plot is very weak. However, it's extremely doubtful that anyone in the audience would actually care, as they would be too busy laughing hysterically.Cohen finds humor in the reactions of everyday people in response to Borat's antics and candid inquiries. Cohen seems to never stop, as the movie is basically funny the whole way through. Cohen and Charles even accomplish the unthinkable in this film by creating sympathy for such a repulsive and clueless character. Completely broke, lonely and out of gas, Borat creates a fire for himself outside a building, and one actually feels sorry for him. Though Borat appears like such a despicable character, in reality, he is far too moronic to hate.Cohen might actually be making a statement concerning racism with this film, because beyond his tongue-in-cheek shtick, Borat unknowingly reveals what kinds of people are actually out there, the nice, along with the bigots and sexists.Even Borat himself proclaims he hates gays and Jews, but it becomes apparent that he has never even met either until his voyage into America. The bottom line is, no matter how stupid the plot is, and how politically incorrect it may be, this movie is completely hilarious all the way through.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"You will go to work the next day with blood-shot eyes and cracked-ribs, but will never be able to stop giggling.","It almost seems like a million years ago that Sacha Baron Cohen's first ever insemination of the mock-interviewer, Ali G, was born out of the sporadically humorous ""11 O'Clock Show"". His 'yoof' approach to asking a former CIA operative question like ""Does you ave to be intelligent to be in da CIA? Ain't dat a bit racialist dough? What if you're thick an you wanna get in?"" was arguably his funniest period with the character, as his spin off shows, and subsequent movie, over-fed us the increasingly waning joke. The movie in particular, Ali G In Da House, had its moments, albeit very fleetingly, but was overall a complete washout compared to the riotous nature of that characters interviews with real people. Inside a fictional world, Ali was as crazy as the rest of it, and didn't seem like such a moron any more. Cohen's American takeover, at first, simply seemed like a cynical way of milking the cash cow even further, as most Brits had worked out by now that they were NOT being interviewed by real people, but by the creations inside Cohen's head. Granted some people still found his persona's intriguing, and the introduction of both Borat, the Kazakh reporter and Bruno the Austrian homosexual, managed to keep the fire going a little bit longer. But it still wasn't the laugh riot Cohen had us in at the beginning. So why then, is Borat the movie such a head-spinning, vain-popping, rib-cracking laugh-riot? Well there are two main reasons: America is quite a weird place after all, and instead of creating the weak fictional world that he did for Ali G In Da House, Cohen and friends have stuck with the documentary style of film making to capture the genuine and riotous reactions of all our fictional interviewer's hapless conquests.It would be easy for me to say that this film uncovers home truths about certain American ways of thinking, but it would hardly be fair, since Cohen & Friends would never keep the duller interviews. The story of the piece goes: Borat, a television reporter from Kazakhstan, decides to up and leave his hometown for a huge report about the United States of America. His goal is to hopefully discover and incorporate all that makes America great, interviewing the locals, politicians and workers in this glorious nation. Among his problems include his blatant anti-Semitism, which gets him in more than a spot of bother on at least one occasion, and his unapologetic misogynistic views, that come to the fore in a hilarious interview with a group of feminists. As he delves into the Deep South, he is accused of ""looking so conspicuous"" by a cowboy rodeo-attendee, whom also advises him to ""shave that darned moustache off"" since it makes him look ""like one of them Muslim fellas"".When one actually considers whether this film has achieved greatness or not, it is appropriate to examine the source, and value, of its comedy. There is at least one sequence, which I shall not give away, that was so pain-inducingly funny, that it literally had me gasping for air. The rest of the film could have been completely worthless and I would still have paid a worthy a cause, because of this one particular sequence. Much of the comedy is not so much witty, as it is gross or just bravery on Cohen's part. Who else would do things like try to enrage an entire stadium of cowboy hicks by singing a putrid version of Borat's own national anthem? But I have to be fair and say that Cohen is not a great comedian, yet sometimes, great comedy doesn't necessarily take all the great laughs. Watching Borat is, at times, a poignant experience about how certain members of the world's only superpower genuinely think. It is only a fleeting thought, mind you, as the creation of Borat is, unto itself, none-too-less racist a man then one who doesn't like the look of those ""darned Muslim fellas"" Mostly though, it is toilet humour done in an extremely funny way. It is hard to fault a film, which has been praised by the right wing as an indictment and eschewal of political correctness, and by the left wing for being an indictment of the prejudices and unsavoury opinions of ""Middle America"". For the rest of us, lets praise this for what it is: Unadulterated, non-PC sidesplitting hilarity.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A cutting edge that's pretty soft,"Borat is a film-length foray into character-driven shock humor. From reports, in real life there's something quite harmless and sweet about its star, Shasha Baron Cohen, a tall, thin Jewish comic from England who adopts satiric personas. But once behind one of his masks, he acquires enormous chutzpah. As Borat, Cohen becomes a mustachioed, in-your-face TV reporter from Kazakhstan who naively and freely pursues pornography and sex and indulges his taste for scatological humor and his sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism. Needless to say, Sasha Baron Cohen doesn't share these ideas and tendencies. He's an Oxbridge history man who did graduate work on Jewish involvement in the American civil rights movement. In this movie, Borat goes to America with a fat aide (Ken Davitian), and presumably a cameraman, and has a series of filmed meetings with locals.What's additionally of note -- and this is essential to Cohen's working method as a comic --is that these sequences involve real people in actual situations who've agreed to appear on camera but are unaware they're being used as the butt of a joke. Many of them are good humored or clueless about being duped but some are not. Strangers on the New York subway repel ""Borat's"" efforts to kiss them on both cheeks and a group of polite diners disburse rapidly when he brings a black prostitute to the table uninvited. But Borat shows that in today's America a bigot with weird manners can seduce you at first if he has a tidy mustache, a glib smile and a prepossessing appearance. Revivalist Christians speaking in tongues welcome him, and so do some drunken frat boys, who agree they want to wipe out all homosexuals too. At times his feigned bigotry brings out the bigotry of others.Cohen's Borat is a boor-naïf, probably the only kind of boor this basically gentle comic could assimilate. The mean, knowing ones are more dangerous. Cohen lacks the 'savage indignation"" of a powerful satirist like Swift. But what Cohen may be getting at is the danger of apathy and passive ignorance -- the way a person without an awareness of malicious intent can do harm by being a conduit for bigotry, or just looking the other way. He's said in an interview that he's fascinated, if horrified, by the idea that ""the path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.""The path to Borat the film is paved with the best of intentions, and to judge by the extremely positive critical reaction to his (and Larry Charles's) movie from public and critics alike, those intentions have been well received. But though Cohen may be sensitive, intelligent, and sophisticated, his humor is crude, made up of things like talking about excretion at the dinner table; soul-kissing a woman who he then announces is his sister and the best prostitute in town. The way homophobes and Jew-haters are made fun of makes you wonder if anybody intelligent enough to watch this movie and grasp its ulterior motive -- to agitate for compassion  needs these messages. Along with the laughs comes an easy self-satisfaction. Does this take us anywhere? And Cohen's depiction of Borat's home village in Kazakhstan is heavy with its own bigotry and condescension.How does Kazakhstan feel about all this? Unless the New York Times and other big media are victims of another one of Cohen's hoaxes, a top Kazakhstan official has just declared the country indebted to the movie: ""any publicity is good publicity,"" he's said, inviting Cohen to visit his country (to which the comic has never been). Ultimately the movie, though widely celebrated as ""hysterically funny,"" isn't very smart. It's bold, and numerous lawsuits against the filmmakers by their previously willing dupes are a tribute to that; but its ""originality"" is restricted to saying the unmentionable, like a pubescent boy trying to impress his buddies, or all the post-pubescent boys who enjoy Jackass or Ashton Kutcher's ""Punk'd"" or the National Lampoon. The whole idea goes back forty years or so to ""Candid Camera."" Maybe the reason why Borat has been so well reviewed is that this isn't a stellar cinematic year. The critics are just a bit desperate. But the peculiar circumstances of Cohen's and Charles's film-making are something one would like to know more about. It appears they're making fun of the naivety of Americans, not just of bigots, but his working method simply takes advantage of how polite people are  especially when then know they're being filmed.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I haven't laughed so much at the cinema in years.,"I got free preview tickets to the showing in Southampton last night. I have to say, it was just hilarious.I saw the trailer ages ago, and had been looking forward to the movie for some time, being a big fan of the Borat short films on the Ali G show. I was worried that perhaps my expectations for this film were too high, having read the many good reviews here on IMDb, but I have to say, they were spot on.There is a general back-story of Borat travelling across America to meet (and marry) Pamela Anderson after seeing her in an episode of Baywatch. Along the way though, he stops off in various places to continue his documentary on America for the people of Kazakhstan, which is where the film really comes into it's own. Each piece is like the short films in the Ali G show, and just as funny, if not even funnier.In true Borat style, it was totally cringe-worthy in places (I'm remembering the national anthem at the rodeo, and the etiquette party), but as usual Sacha Baron Cohen did an excellent job of making the people he ""interviews"" along the way show just how stupid/racist/homophobic/bigoted (delete as appropriate) they can be. The chap at the rodeo proved just that.I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend anyone see this movie, it was 1h 20mins of laughs. Although there were a couple of scenes that came across as staged (B&B and Pam Anderson scenes), they were still very funny. The hotel wrestling scene was both horrifying and hilarious at the same time :)I have to wonder if anything will be cut, or of the version I saw last night was the final cut. It was only a 15 certificate after all.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Borat is unfiltered irreverence, but it's also a largely effective and clever satire of American culture","I really wasn't sure what I'd think of Borat, a comedy critics love but many friends have told me is simply stupid humor. I don't think it has quite the depth some critics did, but it is definitely a smart movie and plenty funny. Cohen is great and completely committed to the character, which is very impressive given how many of the scenes the characters didn't know he was acting. Borat comes from an absurd depiction of Kazakhstan as a country with no modern technology, outdated social norms, and sex omnipresent. Then, as he comes to America, he's learning about American culture with a completely blank slate - no preconceived notions beyond the ways of Kazakhstan. That is the idea that worked best for me in the film, and I think it would've been even better had they committed more to it. Borat does learn about plenty of groups in the US with an open mind, including frat bros, gays, and black men. However, he also came into some situations where the problem wasn't him seeing a problematic view as normal, but using his Kazakh norms as the baseline, which I find a far less compelling storyline. The best example is when they stayed in a Jewish house and he makes many assumptions about them, and while his acting still makes a couple dumb jokes work, they don't resonate in the way most of the other creative situations of the movie do. If he had come in with a completely open mind and then we see him blindly adopt the views he sees Americans hold (for better and for worse - maybe he supports feminism, but also is anti-gay due to his rodeo experience), that would have been a more resonant message to me. We still see some of those ideas come through, but along with that we get scenes that seem more like silly throwaways, like the naked hotel fight. I was laughing for a lot of the movie because I do love the way Cohen manages to tackle so many social groups in America and generalize from them, and his physical comedy is excellent. I am extremely curious to see what Borat 2 seems like, but this was a solid comedy worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat was a bore,"It was amateurish and immature - more like a high school project than an actual movie. I laugh louder at your average Budweiser commercial than I laughed at 60 minutes of Borat. It was so unfunny and bad that I just got tired of it and took out the DVD - just stopped. I do not know if it was top 10 worst movie material, but it was close.Combine that with the fact that my expectations were high, since everyone was raving about how hilarious it was - I heard many people saying things like ""funniest movie of all time"". To me, it was so unfunny, I do not even understand how someone could think it was funny. Possibly, I laughed out loud once, and chuckled a couple times, but mostly, I just sat there waiting for it to get funny instead of stupid.Again, for some reason, people vote for a ""trendy"" movie that was really, really bad.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
High Five it's Borat,"I have never been the greatest Ali G or Borat fan, however, I have strangely been looking forward to this film for some time. I think due, in part, that's it's at least original in an otherwise poor summer of movies. Went to see a screening this evening (opening night in the UK) and it was absolutely packed. I don't think I have heard so much laughter in a cinema auditorium. I cannot recommend this movie enough. It will make you laugh and it will make you cringe. It's going to be a huge hit across both sides of the Atlantic and deservedly so. In fact I bet there will be many who will go see it twice to take friends or indeed witness for a second time what they couldn't believe they saw the first time round. I have never seen a cinema audience stand and applaud a movie before at the end credits. Excellent, High Fve!!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"I got to see an advance screening of Borat last night. Let me say this right off, Borat is hilarious. I laughed from start to end. The interviews were outrageous as hell. I don't want to give anything away because I want everyone to be shocked at the things Cohan does in this movie. Cohan does a suburb job and earns my respect for how far he is willing to go to entertain.There were one or two things that were a let down. I wanted more interviews and the movie felt a bit short, but that doesn't spoil anything.Overall I give Borat 8/10. One of the best movies this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

When he was sitting by the fire and took out his pet chicken about to kill it, I turned the movie off and never saw the ending. Killing a chicken for the movies is not my idea of entertainment. His nude scenes were interesting as the fat guy was totally naked and yet Borat had censorship on his penis. What was that all about? Or was that just Netflix? Sorry Borat fans, it didn't impress me one bit.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Just don't call it the best comedy of all-time,"Borat is funny. But to say it's one of the best comedy of our time or even of the last few years is just over the top.

We learn nothing that we didn't already know about the extent of the bigotry of some or the stupidity of others. But again, Borat is funny. Put your brain in neutral and just enjoy. Don't get influence by the fact that you could be the victim of the guy's antics.

"US-and-A ------- Light, Unique, and Hilarious","Before I watched 'Borat: Cultural Learning of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (I don't know why the title is so damned long), I expected it'll be similar to his previous movie as Ali G. It however turned up to be very enjoyable and exceeding my expectation. I could feel that the audiences were also enjoying the ride and picking up all the jokes easily.When the movie started, I was rather worried as I saw its format. It is using a classic-film format, in which you normally find on the 70's movies. Surprisingly enough, I was wrong again as the format itself became a really good selling-point. Together with the comedy itself, Borat has occupied my mind for few days - trying to figure out how could a person have those ideas.Simply put, this is a unique movie offering a different perspective to the audiences. Story-wise, you shouldn't expect too much as well as the usual aspects from a movie (e.g. sound or graphic effect), but if you'd like a one-and-a-half hour non-stop good laugh, this is the perfect course for you.The story line goes as following: Suggested by the title, Borat is the representative of Kazakhstan with a mission to learn any cultural aspects of America where they are to be implemented in Kazakhstan. The movie therefore covers Borat's journey in learning the American culture while chasing his first-sight love - Pamela Anderson.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Still better than ""Brüno"", but not as funny to me now as it was in the theatre","It's been nearly five years since this movie, starring Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat (one of his three alter egos from ""Da Ali G Show""), came into theatres, turned out to be a great success, and sparked a lot of controversy! I went to see it on the silver screen in November 2006, and that was definitely the biggest movie-going crowd I've ever been in! I found this extremely raunchy and politically incorrect comedy to be overall very good at the time, both shocking and funny. I watched it again on the small screen a few months later, when it was new to the home video format, and still thought it was overall funny, even though I knew more about it and how it was made by this point. However, another viewing of ""Borat"" last year (my first in three years), followed by one this year, have proved to be a bit bland in comparison.Borat Sagdiyev is an extremely sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-homosexual man from Kazakhstan, and is a very popular television personality in that country. The Kazakh Ministry of Information sends him to the United States of America with producer Azamat Bagatov to make a documentary film about the country which will benefit Kazakhstan. The two of them fly to New York, and initially, the intention is to shoot the entire documentary in this city. However, as Borat flips through the channels on his hotel room TV, he comes across an episode of ""Baywatch"", sees Pamela Anderson in the role of C.J. Parker, and immediately falls in love! After finding out that Pamela lives in California, and that his wrathful wife back in Kazakhstan has just died, he decides to convince Azamat to take the filming project to California, but doesn't tell him the real reason why he wants to go there, which is to marry his new love interest! As the two of them travel across the country, they face numerous complications!The vast majority of people who appear in this film are not actors, but people who were pranked into believing that Borat really was a man from Kazakhstan. Knowing this was probably a reason why I didn't find some parts as funny with subsequent viewings, such as the part with the title character at the dinner gathering, where he bluntly considers one woman's looks inferior to those of the other two women at the table, and then shows that he doesn't know how to use the toilet! However, this definitely isn't the only reason. Some parts still gave me a thorough laugh, such as Borat taking driving lessons and then going to purchase a car, asking about the ""p$#@% magnet,"" but most parts didn't make me laugh as hard as those. One part I remember making me laugh hard in the theatre was the naked fight, but I definitely found that far less funny the last two times. If I had thought the drunken frat boys were actors the last two times I saw the film (can't say I have much sympathy for them if they really meant what they said, even if they were drunk), I would have thought they were trying to be funny but failing. Even if I didn't usually laugh that hard too many times during my last two viewings, I still at least found a lot of mildly amusing parts (Sacha Baron Cohen's talent obviously helps a lot in the film), but I also found some mediocrity or lameness.After the release of ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", Sacha Baron Cohen followed it up in 2009 with ""Brüno"", featuring the only character from ""Da Ali G Show"" he hadn't made a movie with yet. I didn't see that one in the theatre, but saw it on DVD last year, and with just one viewing, I thought it was below average. My last two viewings of ""Borat"" were after that, and I still found this film to be better than Cohen's follow-up, but certainly not as funny as I found it several years earlier. I was not there to witness any of the filming process of this hit 2006 comedy, so I obviously don't know exactly how it was done, but knowing how few people were acting did make some parts a little awkward to me with recent viewings, though not everything, since it didn't seem ALL of them got it so bad, and I doubt absolutely EVERYONE who was pranked deserves sympathy, but it still can be at least somewhat cruel. Also, even if the entire film had been staged, I think I still would have found it to be hit and miss during my last couple viewings. So, I still don't hate this ""Borat"" movie like some people do, but I do think it is overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious,"Outrageous and very funny, Borat is able to propel the mockumentary comedy format to new heights with its sheer brilliance and daring nature alone. Sacha Baron Cohen provides a terrific comedic performance as reporter Borat, and his charisma on screen is undoubtedly hilarious. The gags throughout the film are timeless, and the situations so insane, that you can't help but smile as you watch and think back upon them. The film is very memorable, and does a good job of not taking itself too seriously, and focusing on trying to make the audience laugh. The film can take a bit of a dip towards the end with pacing, but for the most part, Borat proves to be a very enjoyable comedic effort, and a pretty original comedic work as well.

Borat: The Moviefilm,"With the release of Borat: The Subsequent Moviefilm, I decided to watch the original. It delivered in the comedy aspect, but only kind of. The comedy was completely overshadowed by the running story. While it did lead to hilarious moments, it wasn't worth it. And often my gripe with movies is that they're too long. This is another one. 1h22 isn't too long, but it is long enough to make me restless and just want it to end.

HILARIOUS movie....for the right audience,"Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius. He presents a new form of comedy hardly seen by anyone in the western hemisphere. This movie is, in a sense, improv comedy filmed on location where only Borat knows what is going on. Borat, played by Cohen, is a fictional character from the country of Kazakhstan who makes fun of and makes up everything about the country and its culture. The whole movie is one giant skit.In a way, this is similar to all those Bloopers shows where the camera crew plays a gag on unsuspecting victims. The difference here is that this movie plays out along a plot, takes the gags about 10 notches up in some scenes, and the unsuspecting victims are never let in on the gag. Cohen's ability to improvise and adapt his performance to each situation is part of what makes this movie so darn hilarious.Target age for this audience should be around 15-40, and mostly male. Beware that this movie contains vast amounts of crude humor and makes many jokes that would ordinarily be considered offensive. So if you are easily offended by jokes made in comedies, please steer away. Otherwise, viewers of such comedy shows as SNL, MadTV, Family Guy, Simpsons, Adult Swim, etc. this movie is for you!!

Archie Bunker meets Latka Gravis,"I sit and watch this film laughing my ash off because it is so damn funny. It really is that. There are parts that are completely hilarious and qualify as some of the funniest moments I've ever had in a movie theater. But then as I head home, I stop and try and figure out why even that rarest of breeds, the entertaining new Hollywood film, leaves me wishing I hadn't enjoyed it so much. Borat, the absurd but hilarious tale of a bigoted chauvinist Kazakh immigrant's quest to marry Pamela Anderson while filming a discover-America documentary for his homeland, triumphs at the box office, and earns the raves of critics across the board. This in a society which has recently added diversity to the noble virtues of truth, justice, freedom, equality etc. But...this is now also a society where double standards of acceptability have become the norm when observing race relations. One group can at the expense of another make merry, where another group most certainly cannot. Herein lies Borat'a winning secret. For Borat perfectly demonstrates and even perfects this weird phenomenon of inequity and does it so well that at first glance, it's hypocrisy is virtually transparent. Borat's Archie Bunker like prejudices seem to be aimed at all creeds equally, and in fact, for Borat the character, it holds true. Yet, look closer and you see that this is not so for Borat the movie. The film is by no means innocent of prejudice any more than its main character is, as we see the same tired modern stereotypes lurking not particularly far beneath an 'everyone is fair game' veneer. The same groups we have become accustomed and even inured to see lampooned and actually insulted get their usual treatment in this film. While with equal predictability, other groups are elevated from misunderstood victims of prejudice straight up to goodness personified, which by this movie's standards is tantamount to beatification. Borat makes it quite clear that for whatever the reasons, racial and ethnic jokes can still be surefire laugh-getters even in todays politically airtight environment provided that said jokes are delivered by an ignoramus and also and more importantly provided that in the end, the 'right' people get the last laugh. Disagree? Why not ask Seinfeld instant has-been Mike 'Kramer' Richards, who's very own Borat impersonation and subsequent circus/apology/coup de grace public execution, was Hollywood's politically insane and all too expectedly difficult to digest contribution to the American Thanksgiving table this year. Yet the million dollar question remains; Just who exactly has the right of decision in this magnificent quandary we've built for ourselves? My guess is Kazakhstan for starters isn't afforded much chance for input.... Is Borat as funny as you are hearing? Yes and maybe more so. And that's what bothers me so much I suppose.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fantastic,The funniest movie I have ever seen. Cohen's accent and mannerisms are so masterfully done even if as a joke.

"It's because anyone can get offended by ""Borat"" that no one should ...","In the Holy Trinity of comedies with extensive titles, I name the Father: ""Dr. Strangelove or How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb"", the Son ""Everything you Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask), and finally, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", adapted from the titular TV character created by Sacha Baron Cohen.Like its glorious predecessors, the title wraps up the general idea of the film. Like Woody Allen's film, ""Borat"" is made of little vignettes, outrageously offensive and politically incorrect, like Stanley Kubrick's, it's one of the most brilliant political films. I use the word 'political' because the film delivers, beyond its gags, a brilliant testimony subtly denouncing the level of racism and bigotry that prevailed in the Post-September 11 era, fallaciously disguised as patriotism. If there ever was a film that defined the Bush-era, like ""Strangelove"" did for the Cold War, ""Borat"" is the most eloquent, endorsed –and it's not surprising- by Michael Moore, himself.But it's not just about America, there is the second titular country too, ""Kazakhstan"". If the merit of ""Borat"" is to have put the ex-Soviet Union Nation in the map and print an indelible mark in American Pop-Culture, should Kazakhs be proud of this tall and lanky mascot with a cartoonish mustache carrying a bag with a chicken inside? I guess not, but the alternative is no better. To attack Borat is to take it seriously, now, are we such naive fools to believe that Kazakshtan is such an underdeveloped countries women would win prizes of prostitution. If you're smart enough to get that it's a joke, then you should take it as a joke. After all, Borat turns into derision some aspects of America as well.The film follows Borat's journey to America, with his sidekick Azamat. His mission is to collect all the necessary information that can help to improve the standards of the glorious nation of Kazakhstan. The most appealing aspect in Borat is that he's physically odd enough to appear like a foreigner, even an Arab, and his accents made with Russian barbarism, 'very nice' and 'woowoowewa', complete the hilarious caricature. Yet his gray suit and quite affable nature is enough to inspire the benefit of the doubt and allow him to immerse in society. And in the meantime, we have one of the most memorable cinematic characters to grace the screen with an originality and speech mannerisms that would challenge any struggling imitator. After Forrest Gump, Karl Shilders, Ace Ventura, there is Borat, a new comedy icon.Among the interactions he has with American people, many of them are unscripted; he acts rather naturally, expressing his racist and misogynistic views in the most matter-of-fact way. He describes a feminist as an ""old man"", he brings his excrement on a plastic bag in a gentlemen's dinner, he randomly goes kiss people in the subway or during a yard sale, accuses a woman to be a gypsy who just shrunk the owner into a Barbie doll, these are some of the film's funniest moments. But, the fact that he could go as far in his 'act' is really a credit to American's open-mindedness, even though it sometimes confine to their most caricature traits: stupidity. Are they stupid enough to believe the man is only fooling them?Well, the film delivers some answers when Borat lures some Rodeo-participants to ill-speak about Muslims. The film offended Kazakhs, now were American opinions on Muslims that different from the opinions of 'Kazakhs' on Jews, keeping in mind, these were real.The film strikes a very sensitive chord in the way it caricatures the ugliest traits of patriotism and pride of belonging and translate them into laughs. The film tackles the racism of its character by respecting our intelligence and not trying to depict his people as malevolent but victim of their own prejudices. The gags are only the reflects of sadder realities in microcosm, and American audience laugh because it's still better than laughing at themselves.Which leads to one of the biggest issue of the film, Anti-Semitism, Borat informs us that in Kazakhstan, there is a problem"" social, economical and Jew"", he says it in such a casual way that it's already hilarious, even more than the cringe-inducing national sports made of the worst Anti-Semitism. I regard this aspect as a masterstroke of writing because it consecrates the total idiocy of Borat without condemning it, he's more a victim of himself and we look at it as a jovial imbecile. That he's taken seriously after that is one of the film's most exquisite delights. Indeed, it's not when he asks for a gun to protect him from Jews that is funny, it's that the owner doesn't react to it.The film avoided that Anti-Semitic criticism on the basis that Sacha Baron Cohen was Jewish. Although I understand the point, I don't think it's the right reason to justify it. Would the same film be made by a non-Jewish actor stop being funny? I don't think so, and if it had ever been proved that the actor was malicious, the film would never have been released. Cohen is not mocking people, but the way people are blinded by their own misconceptions. Borat's conception of gypsies, Jews or homosexuals is no worse than Americans' against Muslims. And remember the scene where he realized he played dirty games with a homosexual despite his blatant homophobia, this sums up the whole idea of the film, that sometimes, we're not necessarily better or different in our actions, than the people we accuse.If the Antisemitism of Borat can be taken like humor on the simple basis that Sacha Baron Cohen is Jew, then following the same logic, he should have been American and only an Arab comedian could have done ""The Dictator"". In my opinion, it's precisely because anyone can be offended by ""Borat"" that no one should.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Borat, Ali G, Sacha Baron Cohen to much but we want more.","Borat is wonderful; he knows where he's going not that we do in any of his short flicks. Truly a master of comedy in his own right with more than just a cult following. To understand him is to begin to know him. Someone to follow, someone who's unique. Get a hold of Borat when he returns to HBO with his cast of characters. If your quick and you understand the German language you can here Borat or Ali G as we know him use terms such as ""Juden"" when his guest show signs of anti-Semitism. His bang on being ""Gay"" offends all the right people. High scholars, professionals and grandparents are enjoying ""Cohen"" and for good reason.Manny Vider, Dix Hills,NY Email: Vider13@aol.com",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
More of the same stuff rolled into under 1.5 hours.,"I AM a Borat fan but this is pretty much the same type of humor he does with his smaller clips on Da Ali G Show. I did like the movie though. Scripted for over an hour's endurance, just think of some of his smaller clips with variances of Borat's humor rolled into one. The only real difference is that in the movie, he had a sidekick touring with him throughout the U.S. and A. Sascha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Borat/Ali G did a little better putting together his Ali G movie. New characters (plus more inside Ali G's character), gangsters, skits and an actual storyline is what made the movie. As for Borat? Come on Sascha. Put something together with a little more story and a little more shocking this time... I look forward to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A wonderfully funny film and sad indictment of our society...,"I finally saw this film today, after much anticipation and found it to be gut busting funny and frighteningly insightful at the same time. The jokes were raw and the kind that make you laugh out loud hard, however by the same token, this film showed some of the worst sides of human behavior. There is an old saw about what you do when you do not think people are looking is a true indication of your character. In this case, people showed their worst biases and prejudices and knew they were being filmed. I do not want to spoil this for those of you who have not seen the film yet, however Baron Cohen cuts deep into the underbelly of hubris, prejudice and mean spirited thinking that shows how in-human we have become. Thankfully, he leavens these painful scenes with very funny humor and placing people in very bizarre situations that force their true colors to show in a very humorous way. Baron Cohen and his team deserve all the positive recognition they have and will receive from this film, I am hopeful that those who see this movie learn some humanity from the lessons shown in this film.Additional comment: I have been reviewing the comments made by many IMDb members and am not surprised by the polarized views on this film; however, I am surprised at the self-righteous indignation of many reviews. It can be most difficult to look in the mirror and truly deal with what you see looking back at you.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good film but missing a little bit of atmosphere.,"I watched this film yesterday after a great deal of expectation and found myself laughing at a lot of the jokes because I felt I had to. I was slightly disappointed and the film just seemed a bit of an extension to an existing formula. A bit of slapstick and a bit of humour and several embarrassing situations for Borat and the people who he involves in his visit to the ""U S and A!"" I felt that the cause of this was probably because I had this expectation from watching the trailers and seeing Borat on TV a lot it would be a film that I would be constantly laughing as many of the reviews stated.However, this was not the case for me. It was a quiet cinema which lacked a lot of atmosphere, so it might have to do with the people you watch the film with. But overall I expected a bit more from the film.I would recommend that people go and watch this film, as it may just be the case that it is dependent on your mood and of those people around you!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolute Rubbish,"if i could vote -10 i would, but i can't, so i'll give it 1 star and believe me that's 1 star to many, the film starts out quite funny in ""Kazakhstan"" but slowly becomes nothing more then a hunt for Pamela Anderson.after thirty minutes i wondered if it was going to get better, sure enough, it got worse, the childish masturbation scene made me cringe more then laugh, not because i'm uncomfortable with seeing it, more because it signaled a total derailment of the film. I heard rave reviews and was bitterly disappointed, the end couldn't come soon enough. I fail to see the humour in drinking from a toilet bowl, how does that signify a cultural learning?",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Genius,"There's not much else to say. As Manhola Dargis says in the NY Times, ""the 19th-century German thinker August Bebel observed, anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools, a truism Mr. Baron Cohen has embraced with a vengeance..."" If you don't ""get it"", then it's not for you---but for everyone else, this is perhaps the most brilliant satire and raging comedy of all time. It took me a little while to settle in to the film, mostly because I was already familiar with Borat from HBO and frankly, the trailers on TV and the Web give away much of the introduction. As the story picks up speed and frenzy, Borat's clueless charm, if you can call it that, takes on full form. I am reminded of the late-great Peter Sellers' own Inspector Clousseau. The bumbling idiocy has that kind of familiarity. Borat isn't out to hurt anyone---he just wants to discover America. And discover it, he does. Marching through the South, Borat comes across all manner of insular, racist citizens going about their daily lives. He leaves a trail of comedic tears as he lays waste to the unsuspecting victims. What a joy to be along for the ride. You'll wince, you'll flinch, you'll gasp for air. Great comedy like this doesn't come around often enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant,"I went to see this film today, returned about an hour ago and am still laughing. This simply is one of the funniest films I have ever seen.Sacha Baron Cohen manages to stay in his role of Kazakh reporter Borat through an entire, absolutely crazy journey through America. Some of the things filmed most certainly are acted, but many encouters with people are not. There are so many highlights that it is difficult to name anything specific, especially without spoiling anything. Suffice to say that Cohen really had to do incredibly nasty (and hilarious) things in order to make this movie, and manages to make a funny moment from something as simple as entering an elevator.In addition, while making a total fool of himself, Cohen/Borat also manages to show deeply-rooted problems in Western society, for instance by provoking incredibly anti-Semitic and anti-homosexual comments from quite ordinary people.Granted, people from Kazakhstan might not like the way their country's lifestyle is depicted. And granted, many people will not like this (rather shocking) kind of humor. But admirers of absurdistic, ink-black and most of all insanely stupid jokes, go see and don't forget to wear a diaper ;)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The most important review available,"It never ceases to amaze me just how much tripe people will put up with on this site. They post their ill-informed, uneducated, so-called ""reviews"" on this site without so much as a week's proper film schooling (unlike myself).Therefore I shall post my review here, so you can benefit from my deep understanding of cinema without having to put up with other reviewers' trite and vacuous nonsense. Even young men who wear their baseball caps backwards might develop a slightly larger vocabulary if they pay close attention to my wise words. When you express your gratitude, feel free to recommend my advanced reviews to other people.The film I would like to review for your benefit is titled ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"".Clearly the film makers have gotten the title very, very wrong. It is far too long to remember easily and contains many childish grammatical mistakes. A far better title would have been ""Borat Visits America"", which explains the film content quite brilliantly in terms of correctness and conciseness. If the film-makers had consulted my vast experience on the subject of cinema, I could have suggested many other such improvements.The film is a documentary that concerns Khazakhstani journalist Borat Sagdiyev. He is assigned to visit the United States and study the culture there in order to gain ideas how to improve Khazakhstan's economy. Clearly the country of Khazakhstan is intellectually and emotionally impoverished. I found it profoundly upsetting when Borat introduced his sister, for it turns out that she is a prostitute. Thankfully, the inhabitants intellectual and cultural development is so far behind that of the western world that they don't appear to exhibit any shame. I suspect their country desperately needs advanced critics such as myself in order to educate them culturally; it is tragic that I am unavailable to assist them since I am too busy educating westerners like yourself. The tragedy is palpable.Whilst visiting the US, Borat takes every available opportunity to interview Americans. Unfortunately he has not mastered the English language very well and subsequently he tends to be often misconstrued as being rude. I found this to be equally tragic. The film would have been much better if the film-makers had hired the services of a great reviewer like myself as a script consultant in order to make this journalist appear much more professional. After about an hour of the film I decided that I couldn't bear seeing a professional in such difficult circumstances any more, so I left the theatre.I would like to wrap up this review by noting that I understand the celluloid medium better than the film-makers (particularly Larry Charles who directed). They would benefit greatly from seeking my guidance in future.I would also like to note that this film currently has a very high IMDb rating of 8.4 out of 10. Whilst the film did indeed have many interesting moments and is fully deserving of such a high score, I was incensed to find out that Bertolucci's ""La Commare secca"" had a paltry IMDb score of 6.8. Furthermore, I believe that it would have exuded more greatness had I directed it. Therefore I gave this film 1 out of 10. I believe the IMDb quite rightly gives my scores much more weight than other reviewers due their considerably greater importance. Hopefully, this should bring this film down a little. You may now continue to read less important dirges about this film, now that I have finally educated you properly.",,Anonymous,Comedy
One Of The Most Idiotic Funniest Movie Out There Especially The Ghetto Attitude Hotel Scene.,My Personal Rating: 6.8/10You know what? i'm not gonna go further on this review here's what i'm gonna tell you. this movie almost kills me. of laughter. this is one of the few comedy movies that made me laugh my ass off that i can't almost breathe. and i'm not easy to make laugh. and i also think most comedy movies today are corny and i don't laugh at them as much as what i did to this borat. it might not be a high quality made film. but who cares! this film is all about borat and his stupid attitude that leds to hilarious scene. except for end i don't care about anything on this movie but borat. so is this movie bad?...

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"If you are remotely politically correct then this isn't for you. It plays crudely and entertainingly to just about every stereotype known to mankind and rather potently sends up the population of the United States. ""Borat"" is a local television presenter in Kazakhstan who has decided to go to the US in A and meet Pamela Anderson. Dragging his director ""Azamat"" (Ken Davitian) along, they take a circuitous route to New York and once he's realised that the hotel elevator isn't actually his room, they are on their way. He's a friendly chap who wants to say hello, shake hands and kiss just about everyone he meets. Needless to say, this elicits a variety of unfriendly responses and so he buys an old ice cream van with his pal and decides to take a tour of the country ending up in California. Along the way he meets cowboys, evangelicals, gays, etiquette experts and even manages some naked wrestling, but will he meet and get his gal? It's perhaps a little unfair to say this is anti-American specifically. I reckon if you travelled into the interior of many large countries where your mum, your dog and your canary might all the the same creature whilst ""Duelling Banjos"" is on repeat on the juke box, you'd get the same sort of insular responses, but somehow this seems exaggerated by some of the most ignorant and stupid people that he encounters en route. The condescension in which he's viewed by some of the population, the rudeness and violence he encounters as well as the humorous hypocrisies don't really show his hosts in a good light at any stage of his drive. Of course, he's an obnoxious man whose anti-Semitic views, causal approach to violent sex and, indeed, his clumsy attempts at English all reinforce an Eastern European stereotype too, but that country had decades of Soviet occupation to blame. What's the excuse of those in Texas whose intellect is only marginally greater than their cows. It's excessive at times and the joke does start to wear a bit thin, but there's something quite thought provoking about Sasha Baron Cohen's character here that shines a critical light at jingoism and nationalism amusingly but poignantly. Perhaps he ought to get himself a job as a fact checker in the White House now?",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat film,"I saw this a few weeks ago, at an exclusive screening, one of many taking place around the UK. I found many subjects particularly racist, sexist, homophobic and anti semitic however I still laughed at them. Not at the jokes however, but rather at the sheer stupidity of them.In one scene in particular, which must be described as a sex scene, I nearly wet myself with laughter just at the nastiness and humour combination, even though if I had seen the scene in any other circumstance, I would consider it to be a homo erotic act of pornography that would leave this speechless. In this film, the jokes just keep on running.Sacha Baron Cohen portrays Borat as an Anti Semite, however the words spoken and written by him throughout the film are all in Polish (which's culture is integrated with modern Judaism) and Hebrew. The film was genius and I would recommend it to anyone who is up for a laugh. I advise people, as I did, not to take the offensive comments seriously due to the fact that it is just a humorous film. If one criticizes Baron Cohen of his Anti Semitic actions, they should realise that outside of this act, he is a practising orthodox Jew.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The film highlights the American people's stupid views and to watch the way they react is both funny and very intriguing. The bit that amazed me the most was when Borat was at the dinning club and the snobby woman said ""i'm sure it wouldn't take long for him to be totally americanized"" y wud he want to b ""americanised"". y do Americans assume every1 wants to be like them and why do they feel the need to change every1 into them? the real joke is on the Americans and i personally though this was one of the funiest points in the movie.""I like you,I like sex, Is NICE!!!""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Watching glorious Borat movie yes!,"If you like side-splitting hilarity that's based on stuff happening to unsuspecting people (otherwise known as rubes or marks), then Borat (and its unwieldy full title) is perfect for you.Borat is a mockumentary starring the title character (Sacha Baron Cohen), a television reporter in Kazakhstan who journeys to the United States in an effort to explain the ""greatest country"" to his audiences back home. Zany hijinks ensue.Borat begins his trek in New York, but when he happens upon an episode of Baywatch in his hotel room. Ah, he spies the luscious Pamela Anderson in her role as CJ the Awesome Lifeguard. Well! That does it for the general-interest piece he was gonna do - he (and his cameraman, and his producer) is off to California! Let the sojourn begin! Now, bear in mind that (apparently) the interactions Borat has with various Americans, of all shapes, sizes, and colors, are completely unscripted on the part of the naive citizenry. Borat travels to a rodeo, where he ""sings"" the Kazakh national anthem to - get this - the tune of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and to the Deep South, where he receives etiquette lessons and attends a social gathering. He and his crew even get lost in Atlanta, where Borat not only gets directions but also some helpful hints on sartorial goodness from some locals.The jokes and jibs always seem accidental, as if Borat is simply this unknowing foreigner who is not wise in American ways. At the same time, the proverbial seedy underbelly of Americans (that is, unseen bigotry) is gleefully, manically exposed; one gets the feeling that those who are exposed have no idea what's happening. They're just being themselves.Everything about this movie hinges on Cohen's performance, naturally. If Borat's sexist, racist, anti-Semitic, boorish-yet-innocent persona grates, then the movie's lost to you. And there's Borat in a nutshell - he's all these ugly, nasty things, but he doesn't know he is. Why, he's just Borat, a typical Kazakh peasant. He can't be expected to know of our mores and rules, can he? Why, of course not. (In one memorable exchange, Borat is aghast that women in America can choose with whom they wish to have sex!) There will be some who simply won't like this movie. Those people either don't get the idea of the Borat character or don't have much of a sense of humor to begin with. If Bert from Sesame Street were real, he'd probably wander out of the theater after watching Borat with Ernie, shaking his head, wondering what it was all about. Whereas Ernie would be laughing his furry red ass off.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat only leetle funny,Reporter from Khazakhstan is sent to U. S. to film a documentary but becomes obsessed with finding Pamela Anderson. The film is nothing more than a series of jokes. The jokes are hit-and-miss and when they are misses the film drags because there is nothing else to sustain interest. It's too little crude humor spread out over the length of a feature film. The best bits have to do with Borat getting lessons on the English language and in social manners. Cohen has a field day as Borat and the British actor is quite believable as an Eastern European. Viewers will have a hard time purging their memories of Cohen and the very large Davitian wrestling in the nude.,6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest film of the year,"In terms of viewers of this film, there are two groups of people - those who get the joke, and those who are the butt of the joke.Sascha Baron Cohen doesn't actually believe that Kahakhstan is so backwards, nor that Jews are evil money grubbing killers (he's Jewish himself after all). He's making fun of Americans who do. Borat fits right into their stereotypes of how backward faraway nations are (and conversely how America's way is the only way). The Americans featured in the film were all too easily convinced that he's real.I think the central message of this film is that Americans are isolated and ignorant of what the rest of the world is like. It's spot-on and it's presented in the most hilarious possible way.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bursting the arrogant bubble!,"This piece of filmatography can not even be called a movie, but it is definitely breaking grounds in more ways then one.If you look at its surface it's a stupid attempt of making fun out of cultural differences, but if you look at it critically (which I'm afraid the vast majority of people - anywhere in the world - can not), you will get a very interesting profile of how a developed nation looks at a nation they believe to be undeveloped.OK, they could have left the naked wrestling scene out, as it is nothing else then pointless and grouse, but the rest of the movie is playing on stereotypes, which generally really do apply.The main point of the movie, which many fail to see, is the idea of American arrogance. Because the guy is from a foreign country, which once belonged to the Soviet Union and is still a poor country, not to mention that it is a country most people in US don't know anything about (except that it belongs to the less developed part of the world), they are prepared to believe just about anything. And here it the catch. Borat seems to be a complete idiot, but since he's from Kazahstan, the people he contacts with, find this to be perfectly natural (completely disregarding the fact that he is supposedly a journalist payed by their government to do a job - which would have to mean he is competent to do it and would need a quite high level of education to even get the job). This is the mirror this movie sets up for the US people - how they treat others, for whom they believe are poorer and less worth. And the higher a person is on the social scale, the less they think of the foreigner from an obscure country (they even believe he doesn't know how to use a toilet).It is true, the film is showing this in a abusing way, especially to the country of Kazahstan, but more over it is a film, which criticizes the arrogant US superiority complex towards the rest of the world (one which I have experienced many times to be true).The problem is, that people in US in general don't travel abroad all that much, yet they presume (even if they have no real grounds to presume that) that people abroad live a worse life and have less, thus they judge most of the nations outside the US based on the stereotypes they have at home (example: a German is a guy from an ex eastern Germany who was always oppressed by the communist regime and can't even have a radio or a TV, so every German would give a limb to be able to have an old B/W TV an American is selling at a yard sale). I know, it seems harsh, but unfortunately that's the picture many Americans have and that's the thing this movie was making fun of.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

And I Thought I Knew What Crazy Was  !!!!!,"Borat is complete insanity. It is intensely funny by way of the appearance of crudity...not of polish. He is an un-sophisticated, backwards character who means well, but always manages to screw things up just the same. The policy of the comedy is essentially ""no holds barred...nothing is sacred...and no one is safe or immune"". He exposes prejudices, phobias, racial attitudes, sexist attitudes...he just brings it all out into the open while you stare at the screen in utter dis-belief at what you have just seen, heard, or experienced. It is all cleverly orchestrated by Sasha Baron Cohen and his co-horts, and many a public figure has been suckered into falling for his gags and his persona. The movie...even the DVD...looks homemade, and the look is the look of film from the 60s or 70s...but the comedy is current, up to date, and you will need to fasten your seat belt...it's all funny and all fun, but it's bound to make people uncomfortable, and the secret is...that's exactly what the creator of Borat set out to do. The hand of Jay Roach, director of the Austin Powers trilogy, can be felt here and there in the production. Not for the feint of heart or the easily offended.

Cultural Differences,"The scene with Pamela Anderson (as herself) was hilarious. The scene looked improvised. Whether Ms. Anderson knew what was going to happen or not, the scene was hilarious. On the other hand, it is interesting how Borat's culture is different from ours. Borat Sagdiyev (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) assumed that Pamela would marry him. Mr. Sagdiyev was doing his ""documentary"" to learn about our culture. If I were going to a foreign country, I would learn all I could about that country BEFORE I would go there: it's culture, customs, lifestyle, etiquette, and protocol. I would hire a etiquette or protocol coach, who specializes in international customs, to help me be acquainted to the country's way of life. That way I would know the proper way to say hello.

Borat should not be missed......,"Borat is by far the funniest movie I have seen this decade.

You will be unable to believe some of the outrageous and totally over-the-top things they do in this movie. Another strength of the movie is that despite Borat being an idiot, he is a very endearing character. Borat is a biting satire, using Borat to show the idiocity of racism and hatred. The great thing about this movie is that it has something for everyone. It has intelligent satire, smart dialogue, dumb slapstick humour and everything in between. A word of warning though - do NOT see this movie if you are offended easily - it is easily the edgiest R-rated movie ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A mood we miss,"""Borat"" is a film characteristic of a period of humor cinema that does not exist today, it is outdated, but is it really that this humor would not work today? ""Borat"" is funny because of the absurdity, it is funny because of the embarrassment and the offense, with a great performance by Sacha Baron and a direction that simulates a shockumentary of comedy and manages to give a great rhythm to the feature, in addition to his loose camera being very well used , as well as very urban photographs and a striking track and completely unafraid to dare, either visually or through text, the feature film directed by Larry Charles still has a great script, different, risky and funny, even social criticisms are contained within the humor of borat that work better than a lot of dramatic film.Borat is a son of his time, a silly humor and a script full of black humor and visual aggressions, the film is remembered by many affection and was a commercial success, it is worth revisiting this work and be surprised how his humor still works , even today.

"I'm seemingly in the minority, I really don't like this movie","Sasha Cohen pretends to be a reporter visiting America and makes fun of people in the process.I understand the humor. I get the jokes. I just don't find them funny. Yes I'm in that seemingly small group of people who don't find Borat funny, or even particularly clever. No, I'm not a fan of Ali G, one of Cohen's other characters and who's show was the source of the Borat character. Forgive me the jokes aren't all that clever, it seems his jokes are low rent Monty Python malapropisms or jokes so stupid I doubt most cut rate vaudevillians wouldn't have touched them.Am I bothered by Cohen using these seemingly innocent as foils? partly because they were set up to look stupid and didn't fall into their own trap, then again my feelings are mitigated by the fact I can't believe that no one caught on (of course if they did we wouldn't see that). I am bothered by his ""I'm so much cleverer than you attitude that pervades the film.

Borat is a genius!!!!!!!,"Funniest film you will ever watch. From the very start to the very end you should be literally non-stop laughing. Sacha Baron Cohen gets the Borat Sagdiyev character spot on. He is totally convincing and NEVER breaks character no matter what ridiculous situation he finds himself in. As I said the laughter level is very high throughout the movie, but there are a couple of stand out funny moments that will make you laugh so much that you will be struggling to breath. I must also add that I was not convinced that I would enjoy this movie before going in. I have never been a BIG Ali G or Borat fan, but thought I would give this movie the benefit of the doubt considering the fantastic reviews it was getting (and rightly so!). A must see movie, but only if you are not offended very easily.

"Not as Funny as I'd Heard, But Has Its Moments","My guess is that if you've never seen the Borat character before (on ""Da Ali G Show"" on HBO or DVD), you'll probably think ""Borat"" is hysterical. However, as one who was already familiar with the character, the movie was a bit of a letdown, especially considering the hype around it.Yes, there were some very funny scenes, but there were also stretches of not-so-funny or I've-already-seen-this scenes. What really works is when Borat is interacting with ""civilians"" who *know* they're on camera and have *agreed* to be on camera. To me, that's always been the beauty of Cohen's comedy. What's much less amusing are innocent passers-by reacting to Borat imposing himself upon them. The staged scenes between Borat and the people of his village (including his producer ""Azmarat"") don't work as well, either. (A notable exception takes place in a hotel room, but I don't want to elaborate with a spoiler.) I rate this movie 7 out of 10. If you equate outrageousness with humor (as did, in my opinion, the people who *loved* ""There's Something About Mary""), you'll like it more than I did. I, however, was raised on Monty Python, so while outrageousness can be part of the package (e.g. the Black Knight scene in ""Holy Grail""), for me, there's got to be a little more behind it than simply shock value. Sometimes, ""Borat"" succeeds in this, but just as often, it doesn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Relentless Skewering of American Cultural Mores Yields a Hilariously Astute Comedy,"This is definitely a comedy that lives completely on the edge. Its sheer audacity and fearlessness against public rebuke are admirable to some, repulsive to others. Except for a few groaners, this is one of the most hilariously observant films about global perceptions of the U.S. and an incisive, unguarded account of the prevailing social attitudes and cultural taboos in this country. In a compelling Andy Kaufman-like turn, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a television commentator from Kazakhstan, here portrayed as the most backward of third-world countries. He has been assigned by his government to travel to the U.S. to make a documentary about American cultural mores.After introducing us to his country, Borat arrives in Manhattan accompanied by his hefty, worrisome producer Azamat. But there is a change of plan when Borat sets his sights on Pamela Anderson and sets out on a road trip across the country to meet her in L.A. There is no let-up of ridiculous sight gags and maddeningly funny asides during its quickly paced 82-minute running time. Unlike the Pamploma bulls, there is the ""Running of the Jew"" in which the Kazakh villagers attack a couple of giant, papier-mâché puppets, Mr. and Mrs. Jew, who in turn lays a giant egg which the local children beat furiously with sticks. Other scenes have Borat erroneously presuming that a hotel elevator is his room and being a semi-attentive student to amazingly tolerant instructors as he gets lessons on comedy, driving and etiquette.Throughout the movie, Cohen keeps upping the ante and yielding even more comic dividends - a question to a gun store clerk about the best weapon to kill Jews answered without hesitation; a B&B owned by a kindly Jewish couple which turns into a scene from ""The Blair Witch Project""; a conservative Southern dinner party that gets ugly when Borat invites an overweight black prostitute as his guest; an aging cowboy who lets his bigotry spew freely at the rodeo; a trio of frat boys from South Carolina who enthusiastically share their supremely sexist attitudes; and most infamously, an extended naked wrestling match between Borat and the grotesque Azamat that ends up in a convention of mortgage brokers. All these scenes expose a raw nerve which feels concurrently offensive, truthful and hilariously comic.Credit needs to go to director Larry Charles, who guides this venture with the same type of deadpan élan he showed with HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and the screenplay by Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, and Dan Mazer, which lends a loose structure to what seems to be a series of staged scenes with all the non-actors. But above anything else, it's Cohen's major accomplishment that he can make Borat an anti-Semitic, sexist homophobe and still have him come across as an amiable, cheek-kissing fellow full of innocently executed malapropisms. I'm sure the easily offended will continue to express their disgust, but for the more adventurous, brace yourself for a comedy that will make you roar with laughter while giving you that unsettling feeling of recognition. It's quite a trick which Cohen and company pull off superbly.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
pretty funny,"I'll be very brief on this one: If it wasn't for the unnecessary hotel room gay-like scenes, this would be a 9/10 for me; as it is there (without serving any greater purpose (I expected the manager to enter the room due to the noise or something, at least), it doesn't fit there very well and will probably chase away some viewers.Borat succeeds in revealing the hidden anti-semitism and bigotry in many of the victims; and surprisingly, even though the film begins with jokes about Jews, in the end it's exactly the old Jewish couple in the rent-a-room house that comes out of the movie totally unscathed by Borat's jokes.Since I'm from a country not that far from the supposed Kazachstan, I loved the supposedly Kazach scenes; because it very nicely shows how an average West-country-citizen thinks of Eastern European and post-soviet countries (even though we actually have better cell phones than an average American ;-) ) Thumbs up!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brilliant!!! If you are an idiot you won't understand this movie,"This is one of the best comedies i have seen lately and also one of the best documentaries about the American society today Indeed Borat might shock you but if you are smart enough to understand that this is the purpose of this documentary you will enjoy this 100%. The homophobic, antisemitic, missogine, sexist and so on jokes are made with a purpose: to show the common reaction of the people around and to show how far snobism, greed, idiocy and all the other human's spirit defects can go. Stupid people will be shocked by this movie and smart people will see it as it was meant to be seen: an accurate view from an outsider. All along you will observe through a magnifying glass how the different cultures are seen here, and how if you are different you will be ridiculed and seen as a freak.THUMBS UP!!!PS: The language spoken in his village is Romanian and the music is mainly from Ederlezi of Goran Bregovic (gipsy music from Serbia)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You will either have a love or hate relation with it!,"I do admit that ""Borat"" is outright discourteous with its parodies and satirical setup yet you can't deny its evident success. Taking the centre stage, creating a mass hype; I could only imagine how things could have turned out had it released in 2020!Quirky, erratic humour that would surely be divisive in terms of acceptance from the onlookers. Unabashedly making fun of sensitive things. Passing demeaning remarks on Race, Feminism, Religion wouldn't sit right for many people. For me, I always try to take a neutral frame of reference. And that's exactly what I did in here. More on this in the latter part of my review.Let's move onto our main guy...
Sacha Baron CohenWho has outdone himself in his implication of Borat.
He's the onliest reason, I had a smile on my face for the entirety.
Otherwise, talking from a comedic overview; this was a modest showing at best.
To be honest with you, looking at all the hype surrounding it; I was expecting more.The Screenplay lacks cohesiveness, seems like a montage of individual comedy stints put together. The jokes don't always land, it relies heavily upon the charm of Sacha & the extensive amount of talent he possesses.I don't mind contentious satires, I'm an wholeheartedly open minded person but there needs to be a distinguishable boundary laid down somewhere in between what's doable and what's not! Above all the comedians must adhere to such drawn lines. For the betterment of both the performers and the viewers.Do make fun on different things, have your liberty, take a bold statement, share your appraisal but restrain yourself and the words you speak out within a set boundary. To each their own!
And everything will be just fine.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
How many times can you watch Borat and laugh? Turns out MANY!,"How many times over and over can you listen to Borat and crack up.... turns out many! If you have seen him in HBO then you will literally cry of laughter. This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I am very curious in the way a helpless, innocent foreign man can underline the flaws and ignorance of American society. Several people ask themselves... is this real or staged? and the answer is.... this is all real, but so well executed that you have to wonder how can people be so ignorant.

"Limited, but Good, Hard Laughs ...","It's hard to tell someone else what's funny and what isn't.For me, I found that only about 15% of the movie got me to actually laugh. But that's not too bad because I almost never laugh in movies. Plus, in that 15% were some very funny and memorable moments.The movie is basically done as a travel log documentary of a fictitious Kazakhstan TV reporter (Borat) who travels to the United States. In the movie we watch his crude mannerisms and commentaries emerge with unsuspecting interviewees. This is where most of the humor comes from.Borat interviews / interacts with personalities ranging from evangelists and cowboys to etiquette coaches and gun dealers.For me, most of the jokes were misfires or familiar, predictable scenarios (esp. if you've seen the 'Ali G' TV series). However, in the areas where the skits did succeed - well, it's hard to put a value on a good laugh. I would describe the humor as crude - but creative and fresh as well.Be forewarned - there is a lot of material that deals with areas like racism, gender-bashing and homosexuality. Depending on how it comes across to you, it will be either vile and offensive or humorous social commentary.See this movie with a friend - sharing / recalling funny moments from the movie is a fun way to spend some time afterwards.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
a  A depressing indication that we really have become a hateful society.,"The real joke is audience reaction to this 84 minute ethnic joke. I am not certain if this is was intended, but this movie demonstrates that we really have not progressed beyond the < Polish, Irish, Jewish, Italian, ETC., > joke. The humor of the movie is really low and basically a continuous barrage of cheap humor.It is really pathetic that people still waste their time and money on this crap, but it seems that excrement, nudity, broken English and ethnic slurs are still funny to adults.While others may hail this as a great picture, I just find it a depressing indication that we really have become a hateful society that demeans anyone that is different.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Possibly the most obscene, definitely the funniest I've ever seen.","I don't recall the last time that I laughed so hard in a theater as I did in Borat. The sheer outrageousness of the movie, combined with the immature-but-still-funny humor than Sacha Baron Cohen is so good at made me nearly wet myself in the theater watching this movie. I'm still amazed at how the movie took in over 26 million dollars this weekend in about 800 theaters nationwide. That's pretty ""beastin'"" if you ask me. Some of the stuff that they did in that movie was simply unbelievable and I can only imagine being one of the people in that movie, watching yourself be humiliated on the big screen. It was the best $9.25 I ever spent and if the movie weren't sold out on every showing, I would go see it again today in a heartbeat.

A Comedy the World Has Needed,"I've just witnessed one of the most crude, unapologetically discriminatory films of all time....... and loved it!Borat is pure comedic genius. The fictional character (Borat) is a creation of British actor Sacha Baron Cohen who hails from ""Da Ali G Show."" Borat is a Kazakhstani television personality on a mission to the United States, the ""greatest country in the world"" to film a documentary so that his country may learn about the culture of the USA. Borat himself is a paradox; he greats us with a Polish ""Jak sie masz"" but his physical appearance is of Middle Eastern descent. It should not be difficult to understand that Borat does not represent anything remotely Kazakhstani, but rather, a clever manifestation of western ignorance of other cultures. How many audience goers actually knew he was speaking polish? All his hilarious quips and accounts of his 'beloved country' should be taken with a grain of salt - I highly doubt they have cars pulled by donkeys in Kazakhstan. Those who enjoy this film will see the political incorrectness of his opinions and crude behavior as the highest form of social satire in a time where political correctness goes hand in hand with western cultural dominance and civility.While America is far too easy a target in the film, it is also the most appropriate target. Here is a nation that touts itself as the beacon of truth and freedom, in a time where the war on terror is also a cultural war. A place where Christian ideologues criticize Muslim extremists, yet turn their gaze from evangelists and the 'revival movement' and their antics; talks shows discuss the prejudices against women in the Middle East and try to fathom how anyone could live in such a place, believing their society to be more equitable to members of the opposite sex; a place whose citizens consider themselves friendly and tolerant towards others, but ignite into a rage if you greet them on a subway train, let alone speak to them. What Sacha Baron Cohen has effectively done is turn the magnifying glass back onto ourselves: the movie no longer concerns itself with the crazy antics of Borat, but the cultural reactions and sometimes unsolicited opinions of some of the unfortunate people who found themselves in this movie. In this way, the movie really does become a documentary, showcasing Western culture at its worst.Critics of this movie will point to the multiple instances of discrimination, the anti-semitism, and other outlandish behavior of Cohen as hateful and morally degenerate; however, these moments are so completely ridiculous in their execution that you would have to lack any sense of humour, or even INTELLIGENCE to take anything seriously that Borat does. Cohen himself is part Jewish, so the anti-semitic claims have no basis here. It's not anti-Kazakhstani (for reasons discussed earlier). If anything, it might be anti-western but Cohen is British and apparently, lives in the U.S. This film merely pokes fun at some of the socio-cultural ideas and behaviors of western society.I highly recommend this film! The audience was laughing so hard at times you couldn't even hear the film anymore. The world has been needing a movie like this in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""That would not be funny in America, OK?""","Much water has passed under the bridge since ""Borat"" was released: America elected its first black president, before going on to reject his would-be heir in 2016 for somebody else...; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have somewhat thawed, with fighting giving way to elections, international cricket teams and would-be Islamic States. The economic situation tanked, social media exploded and the lines between men and women were greyed. Sacha Baron Cohen himself moved on to other characters in other productions - one of which, 2018's ""Who is America?"", even had its title double up as it hypothesis.Interestingly, during the closing montage of ""Borat"", the titular character himself even asks, having undergone a coast-to-coast trek across the United States, the similar question 'What did I learn?' Well, what DID we learn about America at the time of the film's shooting in the summer of 2005?Viewing it now, and forgetting one or two of the set ups and comedic beats, it is still at least a very funny film: Borat's haggling over the price of a hotel room; his belief that all people in the city of Atlanta speak like those on the poverty line; his interview with a group of feminists; the way the film plays with the long-since established musical cues of ""Easy Rider"" to reveal a very different method of transportation to that of a Harley-Davidson - each of these make me smile just listing them here.Baron Cohen plays the eponymous Borat Sagdiyev, whose very beginnings as a character made-flesh, I seem to recall from a documentary on the actor, actually began in the late-1990's as a Moldovan migrant who would walk around London asking people whether they were Cockneys. A few years later, he was the rounded character we all know now playing undercard to Ali G on British television before then making his first foray into America in 2004 with ""Ali G in da USAiii"". Sagdiyev is a television journalist living in a backwards Kazakh village seemingly characterised by incest; child soldiers; anti-Semitism and technological retardation. The village is a microcosm of the nation itself, so the government have Sagdiyev and his obese producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) traverse to the world-famous New York City to learn about culture and so-forth to try and boost the country's standing - hence the subtitle ""Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"". The results are to be shot on film and, it seems, conveyed in this very piece...What follows is, broadly speaking, a series of incidences consisting of Baron Cohen involving his character with a number of real-life people in a set of curious set-pieces which, I THINK, is trying to get to the bottom of what kind of place America is. To describe the film as a documentary; neo-realist or a piece of Dogme '95 cinema would be misleading, but it borrows heavily from each. Initially, the film takes a noticeably minimalist approach to answering its hypothesis: it depicts Borat, quite literally, greeting people on the train having just landed; unpacking his things in what he thinks is his hotel room in front of a bellboy and then walking around Times Square interacting with passers-by on his first full day.By chance, a conversation with a panel of feminists ('listen pussycat, smile a bit...') the night after accidentally happening upon a ""Baywatch"" episode on TV forces him onto the road and to the opposite end of the country to seek out actress Pamela Anderson for marriage. The manner about which the film incorporates Sagdiyev's innocent enquiry into the feminism conversation is both fascinating and hilarious: Who was the blonde on the television last night? Where does she live? Noting down Anderson's locality, one feminist quips 'Oh, he's gonna look her up(!)' Was any of this planned? Did the producers merely have Borat watch TV with the intension of filming Baron-Cohen's reaction, before pushing him off in that direction anyway?Many of Borat's interactions with an America his trek across to Los Angeles takes him through are cleverly woven into the film in this respect: initially, they refuse to fly and so must drive, and this leads Borat to, firstly, a driving instructor and then a used-car salesman. Later, an interaction with some Jews, Borat's mortal enemy, leads him to a gun store for protection and a terrifying conversation with the staff. In Washington DC, a gay pride rally suddenly becomes part of proceedings. Once on the road, and as the money dwindles and his friendship with Azamat is strained, the adventure turns into a bit of a nightmare...But what did anybody really ""learn""? Writing in Slate Magazine, Christopher Hitchens seemed to think the film, inadvertently or otherwise, more broadly exposed the tremendous tolerance America has of outsiders and how calm and understanding many often are in dealing with outsiders. For this, it was a success. Others lamented as to how it was too keen to attack conservative targets, while a more general gripe seemed to be as to how the film was little more, when all is said and done, but a few candid-camera skits.Seeing it now, we learn America is a diverse nation split by class and culture: at a rodeo, it is a place of bigotry; in many of its hotels and mansions, it is a place of affluence; in Atlanta, of poverty and potential hostility; at a Jewish run B&B, of immense kindness and whilst on the road with a crew of frat boys, of disturbing sexism. I think ultimately, the film tries to make a correlation between some of America and the village at the beginning - we chuckle at those supposedly living in the stone-age, but the joke is on us when the next 70 minutes reminds us of how some of this stuff is already in the West.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest Film Ever,"This has got to be the funniest film i have ever seen. I wasn't a big fan of Borat when he first appeared on the Ali G, but he grew on me as i grew out of Ali G and when the movie was announced i thought it would be funny, but i was mistaken, it was hilarious. I was thinking back to the previous films i laughed at so much in the cinema and South Park, American Pie and most of all Jackass spring to mind. I may of laughed more at Jackass because there were more jokes/stunts but i never laughed as hard as in one scene in Borat, the naked scene, i couldn't actually breath and had tears down my face and after the film finished i was still laughing at that.

The film's crude go-about-things is relentless in its hunt to abash and debase any and all social cliques, glorified unions and self-reputed organizations. However, beneath the barbaric slaughtering of all targeted by this film (which varies from Jews, Gypsies, gays and blacks to Feminists and cowboys and the American Fraternity) is concealed a furtively executed pearl of comedic cinema; one that will only grow in its likability, despite being anything but.

Not the least bit interesting,"The problem with Borat was not that it was offensive or that it inspired prejudice, it was clearly making fun of prejudice in a round about way. That's not what made this movie so bad.I personally find nothing at all wrong with getting a good laugh out of something which holds some truth, offensive or not. Personally I didn't find this movie very offensive though ti did have its share of non-politically correct humor. Borat wasn't a bad movie because it was rude, it was just a bad movie because it wasn't funny or thought out.With the exception of a few scenes, Borat just wasn't interesting. I felt like anyone over the age of 7 could have thought up a much more clever plot. Borat's character was an attempt to impersonate middle easterners while pointing out some of some of the flaws in their culture such as sexism. While there may be flaws in these societies, there is much more ignorance about their practices.Throughout the movie Borat attempts to to understand and become Amercian. The comedy is based around how Borat is an unethical middle-eastern man. The funniest part of the movie is that most Americans (admittedly including myself) couldn't tell Borat from a real Kazakhstani or anyone else from the mid-east.The same reaction of laughter would probably come from a Kazakhstani who was watching a French man dressed up like Micheal Jordan impersonating a Kazakhstani. The character could go around Kazakhstan eating Hot dogs and wearing a turban (or maybe wearing a towel) over a cowboy hat while running around in an army suit doing a horrible fake accent.. Wouldn't that movie be hilarious? Well the only difference is that we're watching an English man impersonating a Kazakhstani impersonating an American.The humor in this movie is based around the fear and misunderstanding Americans have over Middle Eastern, what we can't understand we fear or make fun of. It's the same mentality of bully's in school yards.The amount of praise this movie is getting makes me ashamed to be American. It could have been funny if done right, but it wasn't. I doubt that people in other countries would find this movie funny. Nor would anyone 15 years from now. It's timely and regional humor that is unfortunately very telling of America's current frame of mind -fear.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedic Genius.,"Let's face it. Some of those around you are not very bright.And given the public's ostensible preference for such anti-comedies as ""Dude, Where's My Car,"" and ""Big Mama's Barbershop House Party 5,"" it's wonderful to see a fiendishly clever movie like this. I just saw the movie tonight, and I can't say that I've laughed that consistently throughout a movie since Monty Python's Holy Grail. Sacha Baron Cohen is brilliant, and I hope he makes a truckload of cash for creating what is one of the most daring and ingenious characters I've seen in a long, long time. Mr. Cohen has precisely what it takes to make great satirical comedy: brains, a self-deprecating sense of humor, and lots and lots of chutzpah. He is exactly what we need right now.If you like Monty Python, or, more recently and more analagously, Christopher Guest's work (This is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), then Borat is simply a must see. Borat has taken the ""mockumentary"" format to wonderfully dizzying heights.Of course, if you are: easily offended, politically correct, not very bright, majored in Gender Studies or Multiculturalism, live in a nursing home, went to publik skool in Alabama, read self-help books, live in Portland or Denver, wear a hair net or name tag to work, practice yoga, take any homeopathic remedies, attend church or synagogue on a weekly basis, live in Kazakhstan or France, celebrate Earth Day, or attend U.C.

funny travel,"I'm just out of the theater near Sydney Australia. I came out of the theater with very mixed feelings about the movie. I had never been aware of this guy existence(character or actor) but usually I am open to most things. I certainly had quite a few laughs during the screening session. Just the same about half way through I really wanted to be somewhere else. My out-bringing (like my feelings)was quite mixed with a religious spell during my late teens with some relapse later on but somehow kept away from any during the second part of my life that is about three decades. I have rolled in the dirt many times and feel rather immune from it, yet something about this movie did not sound right. As the movie ran in Sydney perhaps for its fourth week the crowd on the day was reduced to 7 people in our session; this in my view did not foster the right atmosphere. We were 2 couples, my wife usually fairly straight, to my amazement had a reasonable good time; as for my mate, he had definitely a negative experience but a ""10"" for his wife of a totally different conviction (a passionate reader). So our conversation around our supper table following the screening was rather animated! Bakc home I got straight onto IMDb and read all those wonderful reviews and had to go through a few pages to see some negative feedback. No, I did not read 64 pages of reviews, but enough to see how divided people could be about this film. Many review seemed quite intelligent on both sides of the feelings. And I must say I was uncomfortable to situate myself in this debate. As some one said in one review ""you ""must"" like this movie to be cool"" or something to this effect. I must admit that today social issues demand a lot more examination as we live in an ever more mixing and moving population. Examination and willingness to accommodate each others despite very contradicting background and values. Therefore such confrontation of our feelings if we care to explore its implication may have very positive outcome. But the point here is to try to see beyond the impact of what we are dished out and that may be a thick layer of dirt over our eyes and mind to deal with! I did laugh I did get bored I did get nauseated I did talk about I don't want to rate it I do not regret to watch it I don't want to see it again I don't think it was a waste of my time Byt I don't want to recommend it to anyone And I don't think anyone cares whether I do or not.

If you look at the DVD cover and expect you are going to see comedic refinement in this film you really should have your eyes checked.

I rated this as high as I did for some fall down funny gags (that wrestling match with the censor bars had me crying-like Borat is John Holmes or something-I was crying)and for a weird kind of originality.

A Nutshell Review: Borat,"Borat is unapologetically vulgar. And it is no surprise that various groups, from the Kazakhstans, to the gypsies, gays, charismatic Christians, Jews, feminists, and even Americans themselves would find certain aspects of it distasteful. But I like, vair nice!I liked the shock and awe tactics used on unsuspecting folks on the streets and various other locales in this mockumentary, never mind if some sequences were scripted, versus the spontaneity of others. There's slapstick, witty lines, double entrées, sight gags, toilet humour, fact is, the filmmakers threw in everything from the humour genre, save for the kitchen sink.If there should be any semblance of a plot, it would be Borat's adventures to the United States and America, at first to learn the culture and good stuff that the Americans can offer, make a documentary for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan. From NY to Los Angeles, it becomes a road trip of sorts, with each city or town along the way made a pitstop for his madcap antics. Borat has a hidden agenda of course, and that is to track down and marry Pam Anderson, whom he fell in love while watching an old episode of Baywatch. That's all I will say, and I'll not even suggest anything in particular which I enjoyed for fear of ruining the pleasure for you. Word of advice: if you haven't seen the trailers, DON'T!I shan't attempt to go into supposed deeper insights as I refuse to believe that this was made with the intention insulting others or find wicked pleasure at laughing at ourselves, or laughing at our own inner prejudices, blah blah blah. It's a god-damned crazy movie, and you must admit that Sacha Baron Cohen had the guts and gumption to pull off something like this with his Borat character. The only gripe, if I should have, would be the pacing of the movie. It's rather jarring as episodes are presented one after another, and the pace naturally goes whacked, especially with the slower bits. Thankfully, they were not allowed to drag on for too long, before another lighter moment takes over.So if you're allergic to the sensitivities of the less fortunate, or cannot stand making fun of various self interest groups, then give Borat a miss.

Sacha Baron Cohen of Ali G fame has gone out and made ""reality movie"". I don't want to give out any spoilers, as I stayed away from them for many months before this epic comedy came out in theaters, but suffice to say you will be SHOCKED by Borat.At the screening I attended, parents (you idiots) brought their 8-9 year olds to the the flick. This is not a movie for kids, nor is it a movie for those who don't understand satire. Sure, there were a few chuckles during the toilet humor (mostly by the dunderheads who did not really understand Borat) but the real gut-inducing laughter came when Borat did or said something politically insensitive/incorrect. I noticed, the people who did not laugh during these parts, were most probably at the screening due to the all the hype the flick generated pre-release. Sacha thanks them for filling his pockets with $$$$ though.I'll have to re-watch this comedic gem again (multiple times) because at times the laughter was too much and I could not hear all the subtle jokes by Borat.The two major highlights of the movie are the wrestling match with Azamat and the dinner with the southern socialite. Get ready to have aching stomachs after those two scenes.I cannot wait until Sacha Baron Cohen makes the follow up the Borat, Bruno. Another one of his creations, that tests the morality of Americans and their so called democratic and freedom of speech values. I'm certain the Bruno movie will have less toilet humor and the Dunderheads will keep their kids at home.Only watch this movie if you value intellectual satirical comedy. Otherwise stick with garbage like Wedding Crashers.ChinKoee!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"awful, unfunny, uninspired mess","I chuckled exactly twice during this mess. I cannot believe it is rated as highly on IMDb as it is! The concept has promise, but the execution is just not at all funny. The concept that could work (and does... twice) is to see people's reactions to Sasha Cohen's outrageous ideation and behavior.The two funny scenes were both very short (no spoilers here, I will let you find them for yourself if you can stomach this movie). They each could have been expanded quite a bit. It's like the director's sense of humor is so crude that he couldn't see what was genuinely funny.Please save yourself some time and watch almost *anything* else.

great movie must see...,"I gave this movie a 10 because I have never laughed so hard in the theater in a while maybe since There's Something About Mary. But look I am writing this mainly for all the people who discuss the racism of the movie here on IMDb, listen this is in fact a movie okay it is not a political statement it is just comedy. I really believe that most of the people who discuss this movie like a political statement towards 3rd world countries are absolutely out of line. Leave it be to the fact that indeed this is a movie, and going into this movie you must have seen Ali G at some point in your life and if you watched Ali G and found it offensive, because lets face it this is 90 minute segment of Borat....

Refreshing Slapstick,"""The Christians who ""save"" Borat...treat him pretty nicely...You may disagree with their views, but what else is there to laugh at? The views expressed by the people at that church, to my memory, aren't offensive or racist, they are sincere."" - Jason EakenTo the people who feel this way about Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006), you missed the joke. This film is an American satire, or better worded, a satire about America that has been a long time coming. We deserve it. We need a good look at ourselves every once in a while. I am happy the majority of Americans understand this movie; in its opening weekend, it held the number one spot despite 20th Century allowing the movie to play in only half of the scheduled theaters, claiming that middle-America will not ""get"" Borat.This film follows Borat's (Sacha Baron Cohen) journey from his mud-for-floors third-world village in Kazakhstan, where his most prized possession is a 15 year old cassette player, to the technologically, culturally, religiously, ethically advanced Unites States, where the phrase, ""We don't do that here in America"" becomes all too common. Borat's goal is to become Americanized so that he can bring the sophisticated culture back to Kazakhstan in hope that they too will become more civilized.So for the middle-America that ""got"" the movie, you can stop reading here. If you think traveling across America to kidnap Pamela Anderson in a burlap sack is funny or if you were amused by Kazakhstan's annual ""Running of the Jew"", I would advise you to read something else. As for the people who continue: I hope I can clear up why this movie is funny, although I don't expect you to laugh, because I know jokes needing explanation just aren't funny.This movie works because as an audience, we know nothing about Kazakhstan. Everything we know, we learned from Borat. The technology is dated, there is no indoor plumbing (plastic bags: yes; toilets: no), medicine has seen no advancement, and even if it had, the residents are more than likely too poor to afford a prosthetic limb, they are anti-Semitic and homophobic. Their culture is much worse off than the almighty American way of life, or is it?There is a reason that you feel uneasy when you see Borat approaching a group of black teenagers in the middle of the night in an unknown location. We know the history of blacks and whites in America. This is surely a recipe for disaster. Why is it funny though? Maybe because we know that Borat has not exactly mastered the English language, and he is most likely going to say something that will be taken the wrong way. Or maybe it's funny because in the next scene, after the teenagers have Americanized Borat, he is calling a white man ""vanilla-face"" as if making his pants baggy has allowed him to supersede his own ethnicity to look down on someone with the same skin color as himself. Or maybe it's funny because Borat's ignorance of the prejudices in our society mirror the prejudices in his own society, say towards Jews and gaysAnd yes, Jason Eaken, the audience is indeed laughing at the views of the members in that church, but that is not the joke. We are not laughing because we think they are insensitive, offensive or racist, but because they are sincere: that is the joke. It is hard to imagine that those people actually believe what they are doing. You don't need to be anti-religious to understand that church members running up and down aisles with their hands in the air being moved by Holy Spirit is ridiculous. And you don't need to be an atheist to understand that allowing the Holy Spirit to then enter your body, which enables you to speak in tongues and heal foreigners of depression, is extremely ridiculous. These are the types of stories told after a group of preteens play with an Ouija board while watching The Sixth Sense. The funniest part of the church incident is Borat, who by the way in real life is a Jewish-actor, never misses a beat and goes along with the whole experience.As one who finds slapstick comedy childish, stupid, crude, degrading and filled with cheap laughs, I would highly recommend this movie. It is extremely clever, it is offensive in a way that makes us embarrassed of how people view America, and it is funny. This is definitely the best comedy of 2006.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny - but perhaps not for all viewers,"Just a few comments on the type of movie itself. You can read about the story from the many other commentaries. Please read to the end before you judge my comments. I had some younger friends of the family drag me to the movies to see this movie. They said it was the funniest they had ever seen and wanted me to see it, since I was a movie buff. OK, they are in their twenties and I am significantly older (enough said). I say this just to put my comments in perspective. Overall, I can say yes, the movie had a good number of funny scenes. However, I would hardly classify it as the funniest movie ever. Anyone who says that has not seen a broad range of comedies. Furthermore, it depends heavily on bathroom type humor (going poo-poo, etc - you get the idea), and a bit of slapstick such as Borat (Sacha Cohen) wrestling around the motel room with a naked, fat, hairy man. Were there funny skits? Sure, and I have nothing against such types of humor if, they are used sparingly to support the thought process involved in enjoying genuine comedy. However, the movie was overloaded with low brow humor. I think it was George Burns (lived to be almost 100) or some other elder statesman of comedy who said: ""anyone can be funny using bathroom humor. But if you have to depend on it, you are no comedian"". There was a scene, probably as a nod to slapstick, where Borat's friend Azamat (Ken Davitian) appears dressed as Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy fame). He tells Borat ""here's another fine mess you've gotten me into"". Borat says something about him looking like Hitler and it will escape most younger folks who have never heard of Oliver Hardy, once part of the most famous and successful slapstick comedy team in the world. We had a discussion as viewers as to whether the scenes in this movie were staged or real. Did any of these people actually think they were part of a real documentary, not a comedy movie? I honestly don't know. Some parts were obviously staged, but other parts had people on camera who would never want to be part of such a movie, due to their reputation. Were they knowingly part of it or will the company be seeing law suits from them? The scenes of Borat's home village were probably shot in Mexico, not the MidEast. My opinion of the movie is that it is a movie more for younger people (although older people trying to look hip may pretend to wow with it). Humor in the entertainment industry has been going more toward a base humor over many years. So it stands to reason that today's young people (having been less exposed to humor where one has to consider lines and skits to enjoy, versus the over exposure of reflex bathroom type humor) will find the movie funnier than those who have experienced wider types of humor over time. Today's youth is no better or worse than previous generations - give them quality entertainment and they will recognize and enjoy it. While this movie has some laughs, it is not a quality challenge to anyone's funny-bone. So - is it worth seeing? If you are easily offended, don't go. It is often the same humor formerly experienced only in night club acts. And yet, at the same time and in different ways, it offers an unusual approach to presenting humor on the screen. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. Regardless of what youthful viewers are saying, I don't see it as ""the funniest thing ever"". I don't think it will become a classic of comedy. I do think it might develop a kind of cult type status such as Rocky Horror. Although I doubt it will last as long as Rocky Horror (1975). Time will tell. Borat does not have the deeper quality of a Forrest Gump or scenes of the Griswold's vacations or Caddyshack. Still, having presented the negatives the question remains, should you go see it? I'd say yes, what the heck! Go see it, as there are many funny parts to be sure. You will come away with a good number of laughs and some great quotes to quip with your friends. That is certainly worth the price of admission. Enjoy!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Reservation on film,"A great comedy film, but there are many insults to the people of the East and a clear glorification of America at the expense of others",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The Next Generation,"Comedy is an ever-changing genre in film. From the early silent, slapstick pictures of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand to the zany and sometimes ""clueless"" comedies of the 80's and 90's, comedy refuses to remain stagnant.Each new generation of comedy has its breakthrough film. Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1931) introduced the romantic comedy; Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) showed the world how to laugh at war and gave birth to the political satire; and Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977) gave birth to a more artsy comedy, with originality and emphasis on the dialogue between characters. Now Sacha Baron Cohen has delivered the best thing to hit comedy since the banana cream pie: shocking cultural satire.I sat in the theatre expecting a movie with little rhyme or reason for being made other than simple entertainment and the opportunity to take a few cheap pokes at religion, America, and a host of unsuspecting victims. When the opening credits rolled, I knew I was in store for something completely different. I got what I expected, just not in the manner I expected to.Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Better Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is genius. One of Cohen's hit HBO series Da Ali G Show's characters is Borat Sagdiev, a Kazakhstani reporter who is sent to America to film a documentary about American culture and why it ""is greatest country in the world"". The mysteries of proper etiquette, rodeos, automobiles, and woman's rights are all revealed to Borat. Starting in Borat's hometown (more like village), he gives the audience an inside look on the inner workings of his town. After showing off his VCR and sister (the number four prostitute in the country), he gets ready to take on western civilization, or at least all that his country missed. His journey will be time consuming, tiresome, and under budget.The plot is simple. Borat travels across America in search of ""cultural learnings"" and his dream girl, C.J. Parker of Baywatch (a.k.a. Pamela Anderson). Along the way he encounters counselors, Evangelists, and a host of unsuspecting bystanders. It is rare to find such an entertaining film with such a thin plot line.Without Cohen, Borat would be another forgettable film. His dedication and fearless approach to the character, however, makes the film work. He is successful in getting the laughs no matter what the cost. No subject seems to be off limit. A man of the Jewish faith, himself, Cohen's Borat verbally attacks the Jewish community, which exposes one society's biggest enemies: ignorance. This gives the comedy edge and a real satirical bite.This film will undoubtedly offend those who believe that comedy has strict boundaries. For Middle America and those who appreciate crude, abusive, and hard comedy, however, Borat will satisfy. Some scenes in the film are almost embarrassing to watch and might be too ""intense"" for some moviegoers. A second look, however, will probably force a chuckle if not a belly full of laughter.Borat has a hard R rating for language, nudity, adult themes, and crude, sexual content. It has a lot of everything for a lot of people. Candid camera moments as well as some classic comedy motifs unfold into a sidesplitting joy ride. Borat will have ""Great success!""",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny yet the setups vs staged stuff was distracting.,"First of all I love mocumentaries (e.g. Spinal Tap, etc). This one is great in that it mixes in non-actors as real people reacting to the guys acting like he's from Kazakhstan. He does outrageous stuff and gets away with it because people think he a ""foreigner that doesn't know the customs"". I have to admit that I was rolling laughing at some of the stuff. Other stuff though fell flat. One thing that was distracting though was who were the suckers into thinking this guys is real and who are the actors acting a part. Spinal Tap didn't have this problem because you knew they were all actors. Spinal Tap didn't have the different kind of laughs you get when you watch real people confronted by this guys antics. I gave it a 7.0 and saw it at the $1 theater. I got my money's worth.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Cute,Borat is a funny film no denying that. The plot the camera-work and of course the character make some of the funniest one liners one has heard in a movie in a long time however the film offers very few new things that you haven't seen before. The plot itself and everything has been done gazillion times before and we see very few new things - the character does not go beyond his tiny little world of kakhastan and never shocks me once due to the fact that he does everything we expect him to do but nothing beyond that.

Well he almost did in the NY Subway.Strangely enough some of the funniest stuff is in the DVD Extras.

"Unintelligent, uninspired, and unbelievable that it could be liked by so many.","This movie is is just plain awful. I've been reading sites such as rottentomatoes.com and IMDb.com (especially IMDb) for many years, and i have yet to find anything disturbing enough to get me to actually make a comment, until now. There are many movies which seem to please a great many people that simply strike me as being, well, bad. Most people aren't very smart and don't know good writing when they see it, so how could they notice bad writing? But seriously, it seems as though people have reached an all-time low with Borat. It's genuinely depressing. Others have already pretty much captured the essence of its awfulness. I only wanted to let others know that there is at least one more person who realizes how awful this movie is. It appeals to what could only be described as degenerates.Studios have identified the lowest common denominator and are ultimately in it for the money, so it looks as though things are only going to be getting worse. One only has to look at the other movies that have come out recently to see that this is true. Case in point: Casino Royale. Easily the worst bond yet. But look at the ratings? And a movie that came out recently that is actually quite the reverse of these titles, ""stranger than fiction,"" being both intelligent AND inspired, receives generally poor ratings.Proof that we are devolving.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Total comic genius,"This film takes the 'comedy of awkwardness / embarrassment' to its ultimate limit. Can xenophobia, racism, sexism, toilet humour and hairy naked men wrestling be funny? Oh yes.You do need to know (as the girlfriend didn't...) that SBC's shtick is to interview unwitting (ideally stuffy and media hungry) people in character, as he did with Ali G etc. Doing this gets a laugh both because the character is so utterly crass and awful, and because the people he meets react a certain way with an apparently naive interviewer and a camera in front of them. Give some people enough rope and sure enough they'll hang themselves.On the whole I'd say America comes off well from the whole thing - though certain Americans make themselves look crass, ignorant and offensive. Time and again people are courteous, tolerant and patient to an unbelievable degree - eg the driving instructor and the politeness coach. Add to this that SBC is a master of physical comedy and has absolutely no shame and you have a superb comedy film.So much of the media is polished, predictable, corporatized, PC, gutless rubbish - look at the other releases this week, eg Santa Clause 3! - thank god someone can come along and produce a film like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat: So Good it's Arousing,"I went to the Black Carpet screening of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan in Century City. It was jam-packed with people wanting to relish in the majesty of Borat, but they only had room for 294. Even though I got there 3 hours early, I was near the end of the line when they cut it off, saying they were full. But still, people demanded extra showings as they lined up by the hundreds outside the theater. It turns out that there was much more people than 294 that they had let in, so there were two showings -- one at 9:00 and one at midnight. I was apart of the latter.The only word that could possibly be used to describe this movie is 'glorious.' Offensive to every race and only one gender, Borat is one of the funniest movies that has ever come out in the history of cinema, possibly the funniest. Sitting here, typing, it takes a lot of self control for me to keep all the good parts to myself, but then I realized there weren't any good parts. So I was thinking of telling you some of the great parts, but there weren't any of those either. The entire movie was just one f*cking fantastic film. I was laughing -- really laughing -- from start to finish. This is the best movie of 2006, and very likely the funniest movie of all time.See it.No, seriously, see it. I was at half-mast the whole time. Remember the first time you saw Scary Movie? Not Another Teen Movie? Old School? Caddyshack? Airplane? Combine all of those experiences into one, and you may have some idea of the pure and unadulterated ""win"" that is Borat.Maybe.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny ! Crazy !! Wild !!!,"Borat is a brilliantly funny film, one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. Sacha Baron Cohen carries it singularly on his shoulders with exceptional ease.It is said that most of the sequences in the film are real gags played out on real people at real places. I can only describe as amazing the end result that has come out of such experimental film-making. It takes imagination, conviction and courage to do something like that. The film does look like a series of gags but that does not take away its charm.There are many obvious ethical questions that can be raised on the film. The questions will make for interesting debate. But such a debate will be surely one-sided in Kazakhistan. However, I see Borat more as a film making fun of an average American's intelligence and awareness rather than of the Kazakhistani people or their culture.A must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Balky has nothing on Borat. I would be surprised if this movie does not open #1 in the box office as the word is spreading fast that this creation is well worth the ticket price even in 2006.

A truly irreverent mockumentary,"In this film Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakhstan native sent to the United States to film a documentary that will show his people the way to prosperity. As you might expect, Borat experiences a major case of 'culture shock', leading to numerous humorous escapades.Cohen demonstrates some sizable comedic chops as he basically carries this film on his own. The character of Borat has an endearing naïveté which causes him to repeatedly get himself into trouble.If there's one thing I can say about the humour in this film, it's that it pulls no punches. However, while no-one should take anything that Borat says seriously some of the 'enlightened' Americans come off as more disturbing than funny. Maybe it's just me, but unscripted statements endorsing misogyny, racism and homophobia delivered with utmost sincerity are not funny in the least.Most viewers will probably alternate between laughter and slack-jawed speechlessness like myself but if you can take it all with a grain of salt then you'll get a kick out of this unrestrained mockumentary.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I feel that he goes a bit too far when offending people who have invited him into their home in good faith. Where he goes to the southern dinner party he makes the assumption that they're racist without any evidence of it. Sure he gets chucked out when he brings along his 'lady friend' but this is probably due to the fact that it's late and she's unannounced! I also felt that the naked fight went a bit too far perhaps done for simple shock value. I'd go and see this film but it's not the funniest thing I've ever seen.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
False Advertising: Not About Political Incorrectness At All,"Sadly, this movie is not about political incorrectness because whatever humor it attempts to generate is at the expense of the unprotected classes  Christians, Jews, Whites, Republicans, etc. The protected classes that do appear  e.g., Blacks and Gays  remain untouched.Aside from that, there is nothing here that is even remotely clever or amusing. It is about a boorish comedian doing his best to get a reaction from supposedly unsuspecting ""normal"" folks with his bathroom humor and childish antics. I use the word ""supposedly"" because there are plenty of clues to suggest at least half of his victims know the script, and are probably actors. They play along a little too well (including Pamela).I certainly have no problem with the segment in the Christian church, showing those ""true believers"" for the brainwashed idiots that they are. But I got no laughs from it ... only concern for the future of our nation.At best, this is a poorly done SNL skit ... and certainly not worth the cost of a theater admission, in my opinion.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You'll never witness a movie created like this again,"Borat is a one of a kind film. It's like a one-man-show version of Jackass, yet instead of doing painful stunts, Borat commits to highly controversial and publicly invoking stunts of cultural misunderstandings. Many will be offended, but the open-minded will see that this film plays off of cultural misunderstanding, and how we as Americans react to that.Plot- Borat (a fictional Kazakhstani man portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen) travels abroad to America where he discovers culture. There is a fake disruption by his fascination of Pamela Anderson, causing him to chase her all the way out in California. Yet, his trip still encompasses alot of America, resulting in a cringe-worthy, hilarious, and overall crazy adventure.Characters/Acting- Sacha Baron Cohen is the main event. He pulls himself through such awkward situations without ever slightly breaking character- all while being in real situations- and manages to make you die from laughter. Whether you're easily offended or not, he will make you laugh in an uproar at least once.Writing- There may have possibly been minimal writing in terms of a screenplay, considering basically all of the scenes are pulled off in front of complete strangers, but I'd say whoever wrote whatever is genius. They play off of a simple factor- cultural confusion- and let it roll out like the red carpet. Every scene makes me laugh like an idiot.Quality- The film is essentially a mockumentary- including some cinematic scenes that are acted out- but the end product is honestly touching. The filming is amazing, even for being primarily in the reality television style. The situations this actor had to undergo (92 police discrepancies) as well as memorizing lines in public still makes it so uniquely hilarious. Nothing is more hilarious than a real reaction to indifference.Overall Borat is an essential Comedy film, at least of my generation. When I first saw it as an 11 year old, I laughed incredibly hard. When I saw it again as a 23 year old, every scene held me hostage. Just plain perfection in my eyes. Many people could be turned away by the religious offensiveness, but at the end of the day, a character is a character, and we must accept the fact that they may have offensive perspectives. That's why you watch a movie. Murder is repulsive, yet we go see every slasher movie that comes out- right?",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The last time I laughed that hard was when I saw the South Park movie. Cohen is brilliant. The real message behind the movie is just to show how racist and ignorant people can be. He tricks people into showing their true colors. For instance, when he went into the Rodeo and tricked some guy into showing how homophobic he was. People just make asses of themselves and he records it. As in his show, he puts people into potentially uncomfortable situations. I love that kind of humor. I love his show too, and Da Ali G movie.

Funny if you like this sort of humor,"'Borat' is a film about a man who travels to America and who ends up in all sorts of odd situations, fueled to travel to California to find and marry Pamela Anderson. Along the way, he ridicules America (without meaning to) and the American people, irregardless of ethnicity or religion. Some of the situations he finds himself in include singing the anthem (badly) at a rodeo, attending a meeting with feminists, learning (or trying to learn) etiquette at a dinner party, and trying to be cool with a group of black youths and wanting to be like them.The film is low-budget, and if you dislike 'offensive' humor or do not have the same sense of humor, then you will not enjoy this film. A lot of the humor is what I would consider very American, but there's also a lot of humor that some sensitive people may find offensive. (However, the film does not just pick on one group of people, but it makes fun of everyone, and it should be taken light-heartedly.) I found the film very funny. It's not a great film, but it serves its purpose in making me laugh. I wouldn't want to sit through another viewing, however, as I would know what happens and I don't think this humor would hold through a second viewing. (Some of the humor is 'shock value'.)

Disgusting!!,"From seeing scenes of this movie, it seemed to be hilarious. However, I was shocked, as was my family, by the gutter humor. The scenes between the 2 men was disgusting as it went on for a few minutes. The plot with Pamela Anderson was stupid as were all the sexual references. Any moments of genuine humor were forgotten as viewers were forced to watch and listen to things that seemed more pornographic than R rated. It's easy to see why Kazahks were offended by Cohen portraying them as boorish, sex-crazed idiots.Very disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who still has a sense of moral decency. This might be a good film for guys sitting around having a drinking party, but women will be repulsed.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
VERY NICE,"Well that was...something.Frankly, this was exactly what I needed right about now, at a point where most people's opinion of America is at the lowest it's ever been, what I needed was something to point and laugh at it with me, because it's better than crying.I was trying to guess the whole time I was watching it who was real and who was an actor, and get this: no one except Borat, Azamat, Luenell, and Pamela Anderson, was in on it.The rodeo, the being naked in an elevator, the marriage sack, and NONE of them had any idea it was staged. Sacha, you're a genius, but man are you an idiot. How easy would it have been for him to get shot by those security guards, or any random ""MUH CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS"" type at the rodeo?But the madman went and did it anyway, and that is some dedication I can respect.Obviously I wasn't expecting amazing directing or cinematography from such a guerilla film, but that is more than made up for by Sacha Baron Cohen and how perfect he is at improv. Not once does he break character while telling his victims that ""three years later, my wife turned 15"", or when he gets a guy to admit that they're trying to have gay people hanged, and by god that takes some spine.There's the odd scene that I don't find particularly funny, and some that just feel flat-out pointless, and yet it's still a work of genius in my eyes.VERY NICE",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat: The Perfect Balance,"If there is one thing that this film greatly succeeds at is balance. It is believably unhinged, joyfully cynicist, it has the ability to poke fun at things with out coming off as mean spirited. The list goes on. As someone who has never found poor grammar in the slightest bit humorous, Borat's is uniquely charming.The only thing keeping this film from becoming a perfect 10 is it's slapped together ending and overly long sequences and where Borat and his producer are talking in the Kazakhstanian language of which I do not have translations for.I believe Borat stuck a personal chord with me. This is because it appeals to an individual like me in a way mainstream media usually doesn't. So I really have to thank the makers of Borat for making such a move as counterculture as it is.My score: 88.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Slightly let down, but still very funny","I am a huge fan of Borat and all of Cohen's characters, and from the hype I was expecting a comedy masterpiece. I felt that the TV show's jokes were easily as funny as the jokes in the film, the best of which were all contained in the trailer.A few times throughout the film I felt myself cringing away at what I was seeing. I'd wait for the DVD release of this one in hindsight. One thing it did do was portray the American nation, albeit probably undeservedly, as a nation of naive, ignorant and egotistical people.I am not sure that it is the Kazak government who are the ones that should be offended on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
About How people reacted to Borat...,"My comments aren't going to be about the movie itself but rather about how it offended so many people. Personally i thought the movie was hilarious and I will certainly see it again. I think the reason so many objected to this film was probably because it hit too close to home. Much in the same way someone that doesn't believe in evolution would consider such a theory completely garbage. Another thing i find interesting is that around 7,000 IMDb members gave this film a rating from 1 to 3 (with 4800+ giving it a a lowest possible rating of 1) So that means about 10% percent of everyone that voted on Borat (7000 out of 71,000) hated it but 482 out of 1040 (around half) of the people that hated it bothered to comment on it.The film is not for the masses. Because the masses are exactly the people that Borat is lampooning. Good Job Borat !",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny at times, but offensive to Jews","Borat is funny at times, as he visits the U.S. from Kazakhstan to do a documentary on his experiences. However, much of the humor is gross and sophomoric, and hardly funny for mature adults. Most troubling for me as a Jewish person is the many scenes and statements that are offensive in the extreme to Jews, and include some of the worst stereotypes. I can't believe that other people, even of other faiths, have not picked up on these instances and denounced the movie for that reason. Can you imagine any film that included similar ""jokes"" about African-Americans? I cannot, which makes this one so intolerable. In his politically incorrect interview with feminists, at least they're given a chance to reply, unlike the JewsOK, there were some funny and imaginative episodes but they lacked subtlety, good taste or redeeming social value. Very few sequences made me laugh, since they were somewhere between amusing and mildly funny. I rated this film SEVEN for being creative and fast-paced, but would put it near the bottom of the scale if judged strictly for sensitivity to Jews.I realize Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish, but that does not justify for me how he portrays and characterizes fellow co-religionists.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This films main character is narrow-minded, racist among other things, but that is partially why it is so funny.

Absolutely and Utterly a Steaming Load of Crap,"Ever wonder why Paris Hilton is famous? Has she ever done anything meaningful with her life? Is she brilliant and talented? Is she funny or principled? Is she even modestly attractive? The answer is of course, no, on all counts. But Hilton is famous because somewhere, at sometime, some idiot in a PR firm created the image of Paris Hilton, Hollywood skank and party girl. Like Hilton, Borat is an embarrassing monstrosity of a movie (the worst I've seen in MANY YEARS) that has gained in popularity not because it is good, has a message, or is even slightly funny, but simply because it caters to the lowest common denominator- idiot teenagers. I have never walked out on a movie before in my life, even after seeing some true garbage, but I finally did in Borat (with about 20 minutes to go in the movie). Anyone who finds this mindless, tasteless, low brow, stinking, festering, corrupt, and offensive drivel funny really needs to seek the aid of a professional psychologist. Now, to be fair there are about 15-20 minutes of MILDLY humorous bits in the movie. The rest of the movie is just scatological and homoerotic gibberish devoid of any real meaning or message. One reason I went to see this rubbish was its billing as a political satire  well, it's not in any way, shape or form. The political messages, where they exist at all, are obvious and clumsily handled (for example, the war of terror bit at the rodeo). The movie is totally devoid of social satire, mistaking mean spirited and deceptive pranks for insight into the human condition. The movie is often blatantly offensive, racist, and just plain stupid. Finally, though rated R, this film really needs an NC17 rating- the MPAA must have been asleep at the screening of the movie and any producers out there that have the NC17 label slapped on their movie should be able to point to this train wreck as a prime example of how their rating system is fundamentally flawed. Especially egregious are the close-up photographs of the genitals of an (apparently) under aged male (ha!, that's so funny!). Finally, I'd like to close with saying that Larry Charles and Sacha Cohen are talent less hacks and dolts. With any luck at all these two blathering idiots will sink into total oblivion never to be heard from again to the betterment of the world as a whole (and take their mindless fans with them).",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Oh My God,"This had to have been the funniest film I have ever seen. It is over-the-top, confrontational, and 100% hilarious. Borat is by far the funniest movie I have seen this year, with Little Miss Sunshine and Jackass 2 coming in a close 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Borat does so many things that you realize how over the top this movie is. In fact, that is an understatement, Im sure many people will be offended by this film, but hey, all in the name of comedy. Borat shows the dark side of America, but in a very funny way, not in a cynnical way. This movie is perfect for anyone, but it is very inappropriate, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It is very crude as well, I think the youngest people who should see this film are maybe 13 year olds, depending on your standards.

"Borat,a hero of our time","You either love or hate the fictional,Kazakhstani journalist Borat.I love him.For all this character's ignorance and prejudice,his major accomplishment is to reveal the ignorance and prejudice of others-he takes us on a scary journey across western ""civilization"" where he's trying to make a ""movie-film"" about the ""best country in the world"",a.k.a the US,to show his fellow countrymen.The question is,who is really the most civilized/uncivilized?Or are all humans equally uncivilized,but in different ways? I admire the courage of Sacha Baron Cohen,I can imagine he stirs up many emotions,the negative are probably the most powerful.Borat is not just a laughing stock,his helpless attitude make the people he meet equally helpless,they can no longer pretend to be superior.

"Obscene, Offensive, Hilarious!","My expectation for Borat was for it to be an offensive,crude and adult humor oriented movie. It was, and then some. But that doesn't begin to tell how deep this movie actually goes down the well of American culture. This movie is beyond the good chuckle humor found in your average comedies, and it is far beyond laugh-out-loud humor found in the once in a blue moon gem comedies. This movie is downright hysterical; and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word. At times I found it legitimately hard to breathe and unable to see the movie because of tears in my eyes from laughter. The reason this movie is so funny is because of two reasons. Firstly most of the people in the movie don't know they are in a movie. The actors film in real life settings where people are unaware that Borat is a fictitious character. And when he does something outrageous the reactions of the non-actors are ones that even the best actors could not replicate. Secondly Cohen exploits some of Americas biases, prejudices, ignorance and stupidity. This vaults this movie onto another plane. One in which only a select few movies should even be mentioned. This movie has depth beyond surface humor and jokes. It makes you think.

This film shows the humor disconnect between adults and youths,"Anyone over 30 who enjoys this film is a very sick puppy, as it only should appeal to immature 12-14 year old boys and some very challenged older sympathetics who think that gross verbal and visual bathroom humor is the ultimate in funny. Borat was nothing more than a moronic fake documentary liberally doused with overt and base racial, sexual and toilet joke attempts and scenes that were meant to offend and were not even close to any real humor that takes real effort, thought and instincts to pull off. I didn't laugh once but sure did cringe a lot. I guess it's OK with today's youths to be a racist in the USA if you use a fake foreign accent and try(but fail miserably) to be funny as you slobber and mispronounce your racial slurs. No sale here.This gross, crass, and no-class experiment in very amateurish filmmmaking was impossible for me to watch(I left after 40 minutes of pure torture)as it added nothing to my storehouse of real humor, and added only to my sad awareness that the young people who liked it have a very different and much lower set of standards of ""humor"" appreciation that is way out of bounds for anyone older than 30. Ads stating ""The funniest movie ever!"" are a total trumped up shill/fraud by people who stand to gain from it and are as low grade as this scummy slime of a film.I know that mental children of all ages who liked it a lot(""Oh, my god!"")will read this and disagree, but this was not written for them but for older, smarter and much wiser souls who may be wondering about whether they should spend a couple hours of their lives on some movie entertainment by seeing Borat.

Positively Entertaining Beyond Belief,"Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the top journalist from Kazakhstan's very own television network. His latest assignment requires him to travel to the United States. While there he must learn about American culture and what makes it so ""great"". Along the way he encounters people from almost every walk of life, all the while shocking and amazing those very same people simultaneously.First off, I must warn you that 'Borat:' is not for everyone. If you can't take a joke or completely have no sense of humor, stop reading this review right now. Please then proceed to kill yourself. Okay, don't actually commit suicide, but at least hurt yourself in some way.Now, having said that, it must be known that 'Borat:' is hands down, without a doubt, no matter what, the funniest film of the year. Prior to seeing it I knew it would be hilarious. I figured though that once settled in and it ran for a little while the jokes would become annoying. Then of course there'd be a few cases here and there that were laugh-out-loud funny, but nothing major. How wrong I was. Wrong indeed. From beginning to end its outrageously hysterical. Each time you think it couldn't get any better, it proves you wrong over and over. Cohen deserves much praise for being able to keep a straight face through each scene.Despite being positively entertaining beyond belief though, there will still be those who insist on disagreeing. Its true, a lot of people probably will be offended by some of the things shown in 'Borat:', but don't let them deter you from seeing it. They're simply too busy trying to get the three foot stick they have up lodged up their ass out, that they can't possibly see its humor. My friend Clay put it best yesterday when he said, ""I think its too smart for Americans"". For the most part, that's correct. The irony presented won't be noticed by hardly any American because they'll be too busy laughing themselves to death over how they think Borat ""doesn't get it"". I'm not trying to say everyone in America that sees it is a dumbass either, but that's just the truth.Well I guess its about time I wrapped this review up.

"for the most part hilarious, if extremely base","Sacha Baron Cohen finally sees the success that he certainly didn't attain with his previous ""Ali G Indahouse"". Now when I use the term success, I mean in the world-wide term, as I'm quite aware he's been well known over the pond for awhile now and has enjoyed cult status in the States for a bit. However with the release of this film, he's a bonafide star overnight (well his alter-ego Borat is anyway) & with good reason as this mockumentary about a naive ridiculously bigoted, offensive foreign documentarian, Borat, touring America in hopes of wedding Pamala Anderson, of Baywatch fame, is utterly hilarious. Every time he interacts with everyday people it caused me to laugh and brought a smile to my face. The only thing that detracted from the experience of watching the film is that at one point it turned into very nervous laughter and I had to look away from the screen. (yeah,yeah, call me a prude.

Never laughed so much during one movie. Tears rolled. Sides split.,"Brilliant. Inspired. Ballsy beyond belief. Sasha Baron Cohen, the Evil Knievel of modern comedy, takes so many chances he's bound to miss sometimes but there aren't too many misses in this, his first starring movie. Gifted at the level of Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters or Steve Wright or Groucho Marx, Cohen possesses that rare ability to see the same world as we do, swallow it, and regurgitate back bizarre silly reflections that simultaneously make you laugh out loud, tickle your soul and show you the real work left for humanity. Some of the gags in this movie are so one of a kind, so sui generis, we might never see their like again. The only sad part is that BORAT becoming famous lessens the chance that there will ever be another BORAT movie with as much existential guerrilla comedy. BORAT in a hall or stadium of the unsuspecting is the finest example of asymmetrical comedic warfare that ever made the screen. I laughed so much tears rolled down my cheeks.

I don't see anything but the idea of ""we are civilized people, these are barbarians, so let's look how zanily they behave!""By the way, it's neither decent nor hilarious making fun of people who happen to be isolated from the entire modern world.

"Great fun, but....","I thought the movie was excellent in its own right. People who were never introduced to the character of Borat on Da Ali G Show will find originality like none other. Sure, it's basically a hidden camera gag show.. but with offensive, vulgar, and repugnant interviewing.That said... the film is hilarious. I'm quite familiar with Cohen's humor from watching most anything I can ever find on the fellow, but instead of complete laugh out loud moments, I just had a great smile and a chuckle inside. (Save for one scene that had me elbowing my buddy next to me and covering my mouth to prevent the Pepsi from dribbling out) The humor can and will be deemed offensive by people of all race, religion, or creed. All it takes is a sense of humor and the ability to laugh at one's own faults to see that Borat is not only making us slap our knees but also should force some to reach inside and maybe exorcise some sleeping demons of their own.Also, I was interested in how Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen were going to make a 7 minute segment of a TV show into a feature length film, and was very pleased with the outcome.

Goodbye Political Correctness - High Five,"(Synopsis) Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a TV reporter of a popular show in Kazakhstan. He is sent to America by his government to make a documentary about American society and culture. Borat takes a course in New York City to understand American humor. While watching Baywatch on TV, Borat discovers how beautiful our women are in the form of C. J. Parker (Pamela Anderson). He decides to go on a cross-country road trip to California in a quest to make her his wife and take her back to his country. Borat begins his journey and encounters a country full of strange and wonderful Americans. HIGH FIVE!(My Comment) The movie begins with Borat showing his hometown with all the great stuff you can do there, such as playing ping pong, dancing, sun-bathing, having sex with the #4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan, who happens to be his sister. You see that Borat comes from a poor and backward country, so you can understand the problems he encounters when he comes to America. Borat's strange customs are very odd to Americans, and he is like a fish out of water. One thing that you must understand about this movie is that most of the movie is about laughing at negative stereotypes, and it is not Politically Correct. Borat's slapstick and toilet humor takes on America's social ills. The entire film contains offensive humor and gags that are anti-Semitic, gay bashing, racist, prejudice, male nudity, and any other thing that is controversial. The two nude men wresting scene is funny and over the top, but you need to close your eyes when this scene comes on so you will not have that memory in your brain. The movie includes both straight comedy and segments filmed like a ""Candid-Camera show"" with an unsuspecting victim ""Punked show"" conclusion. You will find some of the reactions interesting. This is one of those movies that you will love or hate, no in between. You will either laugh during the entire movie or you will be so disgusted and outraged that you will leave the theater. I was one that laughed during the whole movie. The movie was rated R, but I think it should be higher like 3Rs (Rude, Racist, & Ridicules).

apolitically enlightening,"The genius of ""Borat"" is its creator's total willingness to explore and step across any boundary. You'll see things in this film you haven't seen before -- quite a feat in a media-saturated age. (Some will say there's a *reason* you haven't seen these things.) Borat himself is an innocent clown, one whose naivete draws responses from the other characters that illuminate who we are, for better and worse. But what sets it apart and makes it far funnier than the mindless ""Jackass"" and grim Michael Moore genres cited by the earlier poster, is the way ""Borat"" seems basically to like even those it skewers, showing the basic humanity even of all-too-easy targets of the drearily predictable Left (Texans, suburbanites, evangelical Christians). Brainless stupidity drives ""Jackass,"" and preconceived political viewpoints drive Moore. Heart and fondness guide ""Borat,"" and that makes it a lot more interesting and more significant and gives Cohen a chance to last a lot longer.It would be a shame, and missing the point, if a film as fresh as ""Borat"" were co-opted, as the previous poster suggests, by a ""left-wing"" demographic or even ""20-to-30-year-olds;"" its energy is youthful, but that places it in no particular political camp. There's a healthy self-parody even its parody of Bush supporters, and ""Borat"" rivals ""The Simpsons"" in the way it aims barbs more or less at everybody. Feminism and doctrinaire political correctness take hearty and long overdue beatings, for instance, along with seedy hotel clerks, idiotic gang-banger dress styles, frat-boy drunkenness and more. But the film resists stupid cheap shots at Southerners, shows in its goofy way the efficacy of some Christian beliefs, and in general seems to say that everybody's trying in his or her own way, and that that matters.Last but not least, it's refreshing to see an enormously fat man jiggling naked on the screen.

"Amusing, but shocking","The movie starts off with some quite shocking scenes which make the viewer wonder what society is turning into. Being a European I consider New York, or any of the other 'progressive' US metropolitan area's as liberal and easy going. The first half hour of the movie was like a shock and awe campaign. If this is how people react to someone acting friendly, how do they act when someone is not being so 'friendly'. And NY isn't representative for the US, this was quite a culture-shock to me. not wanting to generalize but when people in NY act like this how is it in the rest of the US (and Europe too, since society hardens to the point that even looking at someone might get you beaten up). The other part, luckily, focuses on comedy, but not enough comedy to get over the shock from the first part. Borat stirs up the debate about cultural relativism. you can just beat up anyone different, but also go too far in accepting anything weird or, as shown in one scene, go ahead with life and just ignore anything 'strange'. Thumbs up for Cohen, would love to see another movie like this but, on the other hand, this movie is a one of a kind, copying an idea like this will most likely result in a movie not as good as the original.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I found that after about 10 minutes my face muscles were hurting cos it was so funny. And afterwards i was still smiling for about 2 hours, it felt weird not to smile. This will be an absolute hit when it comes out. There is a lot of satire to Jews, gypsies and most of all the Kazachs, it is all clearly a joke, and Sasha Baron Cohen is a Jew himself so he is forgiven. This is a top film and a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The funniest and most non-p.c. film of all time. Superb.,"This film will have you crying with laughter, cringing with disbelief and then crying with laughter again and again and again. I literally didn't stop laughing all the way through and I'm sure it will be a classic comedy of our time in years to come. A truly original and genius piece of work.Some will call say bits of this film are vile and call for it to be censored or banned etc, etc, ....but just ignore them, it wasn't aimed at them. If you are really easily offended and can't take a joke this film is probably best avoided but for everyone else who understands the superb ironic humour of Sacha Baron Cohen, this will be the funniest film you've seen in many years!!!!For those that have seen Sacha's very funny ""Ali G In Da House"" film, this is a much more mature and better produced piece of work altogether.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hands Down Funniest Movie Ever,"I watch a lot of movies in my time. And a lot of television. Mostly, because I have no life. This is hands down... funnier than all of them.The movie plot is simple. Borat comes to America to make a documentary, and in the process searches to marry Pamela Anderson. But Cohen is so funny. Now, I heard many, many people talking about how 'anti-semetical' this movie is- and how offensive it is to the Jewish race.I'm Jewish myself, and as offensive as it was- the offense meant NOTHING. Why? Because Sasha Cohen (Borat) is Jewish in reality. And well, you're allowed to make fun of yourself. Granted, I'm also Russian, and therefore Borat's character becomes that much more relatable.There's a naked fight scene, yes. It was funny.The funniest parts of the movie has to do with Borat as a journalist. Not only does he mess with congressmen, but in the process he exposes them for being racist.How great is that?Go see the film. If you hate it- it's okay. Only then do you have the right to not like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What Colchester cinema thought!,"Well, i managed to get my hands on ""golden tickets"" for the advanced screenings of this film. i went with 4 friends...all of us students! When we took our seats, everyone was hyped up and we couldn't wait for the film to start. It was more like being at a football match! The crowd couldn't stop laughing and cheering! Every scene was hilarious! Especially the naked fight! Although the film is slightly racist, i don't care! It was the funniest film i have ever watched and i really hope he brings another film out! I swear, anyone with a sense of humour needs to go and see this...anyone without a sense of humour will have 1 after watching this film! It is what is known as ""stunning""! It even has a genuine storyline! I wont say anymore about the film itself because it will spoil it. However, i do believe that everyone, even if you don't like Borat, has to see this film! No one in the cinema could breathe properly!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Borat - One of the Best Films Ever Made,"I saw this movie last night at the premiere at Mann's Chinese Theater and I have to say that its easily the best film I have seen in ages. Sasha's hybrid comedic style is brilliant mixing staged as well as unscripted scenes together in what can only be called brilliant. The audience in the theater laughed extremely loud throughout the entire film. Some would conclude that nothing could top the edgy character of Borat on the HBO series ""Da Ali G Show"" but that could be farther from the truth. He takes his skills to entirely new level and has completely changed the landscape of how comedy is done. I haven't seen a film twice in a theater or had the desire to see one since the original Star Wars, but you can bet your last dollar that I will be there again on Nov. 3rd to see this amazing film again. Yitgamesh!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dreadful,"Far from showing Americans in an unpleasant light, or ""Kazakhs"" this film shows simply how much bad taste Sacha Baron Cohen is ready to perform to attract attention on himself.Publicity arising from ""debate""? The Americans portrayed in this film, even though some of them may have rather conservative or even racist views, are nothing compared to the crude pointless nudity, verbal abuse of this film, and derogatory statements about supposed ""Kazakhs"" or non-Americans (especially in the Middle-East in general). The underlying statements are, I feel more powerful even than the statements of the victims of this prank.As a supposed portrait of a Kazakh, it is horrendous, and although some scenes could have been a good candid camera, and some scenes recall Andy Kaufmann's humour, we are amazed at how good natured the people are, and how they fake not noticing his crude language, how much patience they show to him (showing him how to use the toilet, selling a car), or simply leave the room to cut the interviews.It is unfortunate though that some people find it funny because it remains in a wider sense offending.While some asks very pertinent questions as how funny it would be considered if Jews or blacks were portrayed, what is very clear to me is that this film does its fair share to spread hatred in this world.Ideally? Don't give money to Sacha Baron Cohen for his talentless work.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolutely brilliant,"You have to put aside any preconceptions before you see this movie. Yes it is offensive, but if you take the movie as such, it will be the funniest thing you see all year. From start to finish this parody of a Kazahkstani TV presenter named Borat is a barrel of laughs. I don't think I have ever laughed for such a long time. Between 30 of us, there weren't any dry eyes by the end of the film (yes it was that funny). In the same vein as the Borat shows on TV, Borat tours America and acts wholly inappropriately infront of the unwitting American population in order to see their reactions. It is these reactions which are often the funniest parts of the movie as you are left thinking 'did he/she really say that?!?!'This film has got to be recommended to film lovers everywhere!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolutely Histarical,"I saw this movie at the sneak peek showing at the University of Michigan. My friends were absolutely astonished that, while seeing and loving the preview, I had never seen Da Ali G show. They prepped me a little bit, but I was incredibly surprised and amused with what I saw. We were all jammed into one of the auditoria and the film projector started to the vast applause of all the students. The plot line reminded me a lot of Seth MacFarlane's writing style, with randomness and plenty of goofy antics that were staples in Da Ali G show (or the few episodes that I saw of it). Having known quite a few Eastern European immigrants and gauging their reactions in the theater was quite funny; interspersed with all of Cohen's antics and comedy, I was laughing so much that it hurt; I honestly did not stop laughing throughout the whole movie from start to finish. I would definitely see this movie again when it comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Borat, outstanding","This movie was poo your pants hilarious. I saw an advanced screening in Charleston, SC. I will not tell you why it is funny, you all already know why. Take the show, multiply it by 50, you might come close to the movie. It was so funny I came out of the theater in a daze. While some may think it's specifically anti-semitic (get over it) it also pokes fun at other kinds of people. You'll see, or at least, you should go see. Everyone already knows the premise of the movie, and if not check out wikipedia they have it correctly. I waited in line for 2.5 hours (even though the next people to show up was like thirty minutes after I got there) and it was absolutely worth it. There were points of tears, and some of the people that Borat encounters are great, because it shows Americans what we need to fix because there are a lot of screwed up people out there (some may argue Sacha Cohen is one of them) Go see this film as soon as you can. Do it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Go Kazahstan, go Borat",After a long time I've enjoyed this movie from the moment it started till the lights got on again in the movie theater and I can say I wasn't the only one... Man that guy has guts to film a movie like that and it's a very realistic movie too....especially the way he shows the Americans.. I heard that some characters from the movie want to press charges to the guy but I think that this movie only shows the real truth of the situation in the country. It would be great to have more guys to be recording stuff like that. I recommend everybody to go see this movie. You won't regret it!!!!! I gave the movie 10 out of 10 because I personally believe it deserves it,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie I have ever seen,"I was lucky enough to view an advance screening of this movie. Before attending the screening, I did a little background research. A lot of what I read about the movie pointed out that the movie was both extremely funny and controversial. Having seen the trailer, I thought of both statements as a little hyped up.They weren't. This was honestly the funniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was funnier than every other comedy I have ever seen in my life (including the Borat interludes in the Ali G show) - old or recent - thoughtful or commercial. Consider this in light of the fact that I am not greatly amused with most comedies I watch - I might chuckle and laugh a bit at the Frat Pack flicks, and smile at the Woody Allen works. Here though, I was literally unable to stop laughing from the very beginning of the movie until the end, at which point, I had to hold back because my cheeks had become sore.Two of my other friends who came with me agree with me in that it was the funniest movie they have ever seen - although they knew nothing about Borat or Ali G before the screening. The audience in the theater was also enthusiastic - besides the constant laughter, there were several standing ovations.I somewhat debated giving this movie a 10 but I ended up doing so because I do not think I will ever see something as funny as this. Looking back, it was a unique experience and if you think you can get past the ""offense"" you will probably agree with me as well as the thousands of others who watched and favorably rated the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
