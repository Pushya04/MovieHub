Still terrifying.,"What if..... imagine the unthinkable happened, and all of a sudden, The Birds attacked....You have to hand it to Hitchcock, he knew how to scare people, by taking the ordinary, the everyday, and twisting it around, and making it scary, he did that pretty much to perfection here.So the first half of the movie is slow, it's almost sedate, not a lot actually happens, however the second half is completely different, you can only imagine what audiences back in 1963 thought, as of 2022 it still terrifies.It looks really good, the special effects for the time actually hold up very well.Tippi Hedren is impressive as Melanie, it's a very sincere, strong performance.The next time you put some bird food out for the jackdaws and magpies.....just wonder what if, what if the unthinkable did actually happen!Great hooror from the real master of suspense, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Enigma of The Birds,"There is a kind of theory according to which a horror or thriller film would lose all its frightening effect if it did not have a musical support as a backdrop, and its greater or lesser intensity regulates the viewer's tension levels. And this is true, at least in most of these types of movies. But there is always an exception that proves the rule. In The Birds, an iconic film by director Alfred Hitchock (inspired by the eponymous short story by Daphne du Maurier), such musical intrusion was dispensed with, as the director wanted to give voice to these apparently harmless beings that terrorize the population of Bodega Bay (Bernard Herrmann appears in the credits only as sound consultant). The film, which dates from 1963, continues to promote an intense discussion about its meaning and the most varied hypotheses have been put forward, since the ending is left open, with the birds victoriously watching the removal of humans (of course Hitchcock knew that not giving an explanation would contribute to accentuating the mystery and interest that the film arouses, it is not his best film, but it is certainly one of the most enigmatic). Choosing the blonde on duty (one of my favorites) was also a winning bet. Tippi Hedren, the unlikely heroine, perfectly plays the role of the fragile young woman, who is able to stand up to the bloodthirsty bird though. Her image of scared eyes and disheveled hair covering herself with her hand is memorable. As far as I am concerned, the scene dominated by the couple of lovebirds always comes to mind, swinging along the curves, in the convertible on the way to Bodega Bay, inside a cage, without having the right to enjoy the landscape, as a trigger for the revolt of the birds.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scared me as a kid.,"The first and only time I've watched this movie was with my mom when I was a little kid. Back at that time, the movie frightened me to new levels, as it was horrifying to see flocks of birds attacking people mercilessly.I don't remember the actual plot of the story, which consists of a San Francisco socialite following a boyfriend to a small town, where all sorts of birds suddenly begin to attack people. I just remembered the birds viciously attacking the town's residents, people trapping themselves in buildings and gas stations blowing up, indirectly caused by the birds.Unlike conventional horror movies, where you would normally see ghosts, goblins, vampires and zombies, ""The Birds"" is a film that gives you a normal everyday creature suddenly attacking people in huge numbers, something you don't expect to witness. This, as a result, is a very interesting concept for a horror movie and definitely send chills to your spines.All the scenes of mayhem, chaos and people running for their lives are disturbing, yet suspenseful. One of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest works, this movie is a must-see for any horror movie fan.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds Are Here To Stay,"1963 was the year and they are still here, mesmerizing, enthralling, entertaining from beginning to end and no music. The sounds of the birds, the attacks, are the music the movie needs. Tippi Hedren, a Hitchcock blonde, head to toe. We follow her as if we knew her and Rod Taylor, well, we know we know him, so it all moves like a potential romantic comedy but there is something in the air that doesn't allow us that frame of mind. Jessica Tandy introduces another Hitchcockian character, the castrating mother and it's wonderful and suspenseful, her slow surrender to Melanie Daniels. It must be a sign of greatness when you can watch The Birds, 60 years after its debut and enjoy it as if was yesterday.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Birds"" has always been one of my lesser favorites from Hitchcock","I've been watching ""The Birds"" since I was too young to even remember, and when I was moving across countries once I even caught the sequel on television (which is just gruesome and lacking the suspense of this). However ""The Birds"" has always seemed slightly uneven to me, as if the premise itself is so absurd that I have a hard time taking the film entirely seriously.In my opinion the best Hitchcock films are ""North by Northwest,"" ""The 39 Steps,"" ""The Lady Vanishes,"" ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Rear Window"" and of course my favorite horror film of all-time, ""Psycho."" ""The Birds"" is a good film and very well-made but because its content is so silly in nature you may find yourself having a hard time taking it all as seriously as Hitch expects us to.So overall, it is a fine movie, but not one of the Master of Suspense's greatest.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tippi Feathers With Mother,"Seems silly to give a 10 to ""The Birds"" what can I give to ""Notorius"" then? Or ""Rear Window""? A 20? It doesn't matter, a 10 shouldn't mean the best but one of the best. Best as in degrees of enjoyment, best as in time of enjoyment, 10 for the kind of enjoyment. ""The Birds"" is a ten for all of the above. Hitchcock's world varied consistently, it depended very much on his travelling companions. Writers first and foremost then composers. There is no music in ""The Birds"" so most of my questions are directed to the eclectic Evan Hunter who dissected Daphne de Maurier's original story and transformed it into something that not even Hitchcock had attempted before. A lyrically surreal horror soap opera kind of thing. It visits many of Hitchcock's obsession's of course, an icy blond and a castrating mother. Tippi Hedren follows a long line of Hitchcock blonds, from Madeline Carroll and Ingrid Bergman to Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Eva Marie Saint and Doris Day as Jessica Tandy follows Madame Constantin, Jesse Royce Landis and Louise Latham not to mention Mrs. Bates. Evan Hunter was behind films like Richard Brooks's ""Blackboard Jungle"" and a semi forgotten gem Frank Perry's ""Last Summer"" As well as having Akira Kurosawa based his film noir ""The Ransom"" on one of his novels. Here, he follows Hitchcock's needs with religious reverence and at the same time comes out with something quite unique. I love the light weightiness of the heaviness. I've always loved the daringness of the pacing. The car trip to to Bodega Bay or the long shots of Jessica Tandy's truck driving away in horror from the farm. This movie is also a reminder to the filmmakers, depending in special effects, that effects tend to age a movie far too fast. The effects should be at the service of the characters and not the other way round. Rod Taylor, a charming, versatile matinée idol with a brain and the scrumptious Suzanne Pleshette ad to the many pleasures this 10 of a film will keep in store for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A highly innovative horror,"Imagine Hitchcock trying to sell this idea to the film studios: the lives of a mundane country family are shattered when vicious rooks attack. Why? No particular reason. And what then? They fly away. and then? They come back again and attack. And then go and then . .. It seems like an impossible plot to pull off, but Hitchcock does it, slowly building up the tension which spasmodically swells and subsides. Younger viewers may get irritated with the slow stealth of the opening scenes and may want to thrash the T.V. when the film comes to its beautifully droll conclusion, but form once those birds start attacking, every viewer is riveted. It was fine Hitchcockian innovation that took this very slim, cock-a-mamy story and turned in to a tense thriller. But the greatest innovation is the film score - there isn't any. No director is more closely identified with the music of their films, but in Birds, Hitchcock created a horror that is uniquely  quiet. The great man appreciated something that so few others do - the atmospheric potency of silence, and how, in different settings, silences can differ in character. Yet so many who watch the film seem to forget that the music isn't there. That's the film's greatest attribute.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Angry Birds,"I've been listening to a podcast about Alfred Hitchcock in the past few weeks, so I decided to take a look and see which of his films I could watch with minimal fuss. ""The Birds"" was, of all things, on regular non streaming television (I know!) last week, so I set the recorder and watched it for the first time in a while. I have to say that, despite a couple of flaws, I really rather enjoyed it.Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) heads to a small coastal town on the west coast of America, to connect with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). The pairs awkward courtship is interrupted by moments of unusual and violent behaviour from the bird population of the town. The scale of the violence increases with each incident, causing the Daniels and Brenner to barricade themselves in Brenner's farmhouse.Interestingly, watching it today what ""The Birds"" feels most like, particularly once you get to the farmhouse assault is a zombie film, with a mostly unseen force banging on the doors and desperate fortifications that have been hastily assembled. It does take quite a while to get to the bird attacks, but I did enjoy the slightly salacious romantic comedy drama that the film is, prior to the shift into becoming a horror film. Hedren and Taylor are a delightful pair, but there's intrigue afoot with his former girlfriend now the schoolteacher in town and his mother seemingly unhappy about any potential romance.Admittedly, the composite work on mixing bird footage in with the filmed pieces hasn't aged well and, though I don't need my films to each be tied up in a nice bow, the ending remains one of the most "". . . Wait, what?. . ."" moments in all of film. To describe it as anticlimactical doesn't do the term justice.I still enjoyed it though and, with certain caveats, would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perfect Example of why Hitchcock is ""The Master of Suspense""","This is one of Hitchcock's most well-known movies. Along with Psycho, it's the movie that most people identify with him. Many pages have been written about it and surely there will be more. I know that the superb technical aspects of the movie have been discussed a lot, so I'll try to focus on something I noticed yesterday when I watched it.It's scarier when there are no birds on screen. The tension, the silence, the uncertainty, the mystery. That's what suspense is about.I was amazed of how carefully Hitchcock builds the suspense in this movie. You watch the birds standing there, and they do not move, they are just waiting. Even when you think they are dumb something tells you they are thinking. They are analyzing your moves.This was possible with the aid of a top-notch screenplay, and great performances of the actors. This was probably the most difficult film for Hitchcock, specially for the technical aspects that were involved, but when you watch it, it really was worth the pain.The main plot is well-known: Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren),a young girl goes to Bodega Bay looking for Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor),a handsome man she met in San Francisco, when suddenly, the birds start attacking humans by no reason. Pretty straight forward, and by this date very outdated, but Hitchcock adds his magic and the script spices this with the very complex relationships between the characters.The complex relationship between Mitch and his mother Lydia(played by Jessica Tandy), and the conflict that she has with Melanie is very interesting and brings back memories from Psycho. Also, Melanie's relationship with her own mother and the bond that she creates with Lydia and Mitch's 11 years old sister Cathy(Veronica Cartwright) is fascinating.The scene when the four of them are trapped inside the house with the birds waiting outside is classic; not only is, as I wrote above, a perfect example of the use of suspense, it is an awesome study of the characters and how their relation grows. I think that this particular movie was main inspiration for George A. Romero's claustrophobic climax in his landmark film ""Night of the Living Dead""(1968).The technical aspects may be the focus of many studies, but the characters deserve to be praised, even the support cast with a few lines develop a personality of their own. The restaurant scene is Hitchcock at his best with witty dialogs that are both humorous and creepy. Very good ensemble.Overall, this is an awesome movie, many reviewers have said it, I know. But I wanted to point that beyond the technical advances this experimental movie features, it is a perfect example of why Alfred Hitchcock is considered, ""The Master of Suspense"".9/10. Classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seaside gulls go mental in Hitchcock's macabre masterpiece!,"Despite spending most of his career within the realms of the thriller genre, Alfred Hitchcock hasn't restricted himself where variation is concerned. Most of his best work represents a different type of thriller, and The Birds is no different. It is often said that Psycho is Hitchcock's first foray into the horror side of the thriller, and it is indeed; but it's not the complete horror film that The Birds is. Often cited as an obvious influence for Night of the Living Dead, The Birds follows Melanie Daniels as she travels to the seaside town of Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds for Mitch Brenner, an eligible bachelor that she met in a pet shop in San Francisco. However, while there the birds of the coastal town begin to attack the residents and so begins a terrifying tale of man's feathered friends waging a war against humanity...It could be said that the plot of The Birds is ridiculous, and it is. The idea of birds, a type of animal that isn't aggressive, attacking humans despite living with us for millions of years is preposterous and is never likely to happen. However; it is here where the film's horror potency lies. Birds live with us in harmony; we're so used to them that for the most part we don't even realise that they're there, and the idea of something that we don't notice suddenly becoming malicious is truly terrifying. Especially when that something is unstoppable, as the birds are portrayed as being in this film. The fact that the birds' motive is never really explained only serves in making it more terrifying, as it would appear that somewhere along the line they've just decided to attack. Of course, the film could be interpreted as having Melanie's arrival, or the presence of the lovebirds as the cause for it all; but we don't really know. This bounds the film in reality as if there was a reason given, it might be improbable; but there's no true reason given (although there are several theories), so it can't be improbable!The first forty minutes of the film feature hardly any - if any - horror at all. Hitchcock spends this part of the movie developing the characters and installing their situation in the viewers' minds, so that when the horror does finally come along, it has a definite potency that it would not have had otherwise. In fact, at first the birds themselves come across as a co-star in their own movie as there are brief references towards them, but they never get their full dues. However, once the horror does start, it comes thick and fast. Hitchcock, the master craftsman as always, uses his famous montage effects and never really shows you anything; but because you're being bombarded with so many different shots, you'd never realise it. Many people have tried to copy this technique, but most have failed. Hitchcock, however, has it down to an art and this is maybe the film that shows off that talent the best. There are numerous moments of suspense as well, many of which are truly nail biting. We see the birds amassing and ready to strike - but they don't. And this is much more frightening than showing an attack from the off. Hitchcock knows this. The final thirty minutes of The Birds is perhaps the most thrilling of his entire oeuvre. First, Hitchcock gives us an intriguing situation where numerous inhabitants of the town give their views on the events, and also explains the birds' situation with humans, even giving the audience an angle of expertise from an ornithologist's point of view. He then follows it up with a truly breathtaking sequence of horror that hasn't been matched since for relentless shock value.Hitchcock has made many great films, and this certainly stands up as one of them. Here, Hitchcock gives a lesson in film directing and creates a truly macabre piece of work in the process. I dread to think what the state of cinema would have been if Hitchcock had never picked up a camera, but luckily for us; he most certainly did.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Masterpiece,"Another film to prove that Hitchcock really was one of the most gifted film makers ever. His films are more 'fresh' today than any of current Hollywood megabuster.The screeching bird soundtrack in itself was chilling.The absence of backgound music added a sense of calm before the storm which made the bird attack scenes all the more intense.The film builds up slowly and that serves to build up the tension and edginess.The most chilling scene was definitely when Melanie (Tippi Hedren) was waiting outside the school while the singing was going on in the school. At each loop of the song, a few more crows would perch on the climbing frame. The site of them was truly grotesque. This scene is a lesson to all the ""subtle as a sledge hammer"" so called 'thrillers' that are churned out today.By the end of the film, there is no conclusion, no neat result. It is somewhat uncomfortable watching a film like this and not seeing a conclusion. How will it end? Why did the birds attack?Why spoil the film with an explanation?",,Anonymous,Horror
MY REVIEW: The Wings of Thrills!!,"The Birds. Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a mystery around a love story and some family drama. It has all ingredients required for a taut thriller but the level of satisfaction at the end might is questionable.The story starts as a typical love story where heroine chases down her hero to far distance in order to win him but gets stuck in his town when mysteriously birds start attacking people. Like a pure hitchcockian experience, there are consistently impressive performances by all actors, beautiful locations, mysterious conversations and delicious screenplay. The scenes of birds gathering before attacking and attacking from unlikely places are haunting enough to give you goose bumps.But The Birds feels like a betrayal at the end. With so much suspense built up in 2 hrs, you feel cheated when at the end no questions are answered and movie ends abruptly.I am going with good 7 out of 10 for The Birds. It is good in every sense but the unquestionable thirst for answers might irritate you at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Our Avian Friends Attack,"The Birds is one of the very few Alfred Hitchcock films that owes more to special effects than to any great story line or acting performances. It's those birds turning on mankind in Bodega Bay that you come to see this film and that's what you get.Those of the lesser species that mankind hasn't killed off live either in harmony with man or in an undeclared truce. What if a species all of a sudden, previously docile, decides to turn on man? Birds are something we may like or dislike but we do take their passivity in most cases for granted.It's not hunting or preying birds like the eagle and hawk that do the turning in Bodega Bay, it's scavenger birds like gulls and crows. And they're working together with a kind of unseen intelligence guiding them. That's what's most scary.The human players Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy and the rest are really of little importance. Everyone does their part well, but their little stories fade to insignificance. The Birds starts as almost a Doris Day/Rock Hudson type comedy as Rod Taylor comes into a pet shop and mistakes Tippi for a salesperson. They have their Rock and Doris like banter and she gets his license number and follows him down to Bodega Bay, a sleepy little California coast village.The way Hitchcock made Santa Rosa a part of Shadow of a Doubt, he does the same here with Bodega Bay. Unlike in Shadow of a Doubt though the town as well as The Birds dwarf the plot of the film.As Rod and Tippi do their Rock/Doris thing The Birds start their attacks and turn the place into panic city. As it probably would in any situation. What's really spooky about the whole thing is that Hitchcock leaves it totally unresolved. We don't know what the town will do about these aggressive avians. Or for that matter what mankind itself will do.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You are guaranteed to be terrified of birds after seeing this movie,"As a massive Hitchcock fan, I saw The Birds, and it is a great film, very macabre, suspenseful and terrifying. Those bird fights alone are so well done, that I will admit I have never felt the same about birds again. The cinematography is brilliant, and the direction as you would expect from Hitchcock is superb. The screenplay is well crafted too, especially with ""They're coming, they're coming"".The acting I thought was very good too, particularly from Rod Taylor and Susanne Pleshette, and Jessica Tandy and Tippi Hedren were excellent too. Even Hitch himself makes a ""canine cameo"". The atmosphere is terrific, enough to give you goosebumps. It is true, that there isn't much horror in the first forty minutes, but there is loads of suspense though, and the motive for the bird attacks never were explained. All in all, while not Hitch's best in my opinion, it is still a solid, perplexing and suspenseful horror/thriller, that may leave you terrified of birds. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting,"The Birds has the usual Hitchcock touches.  A chase, guilt, interesting camera technique and birds.  The story starts out innocently enough, with birds acting weird.  They soon start attacking people and gradually their attacks escalate in ferocity.   What I liked about the movie was the way Hitchcock built up the tension leading to the attacks.  He didn't unleash his villians until about half way through the film.  In that time we get to know the characters in the peaceful town of Bodega Bay.  Once all the introductions are in place, the birds start their rampage.  I enjoyed the way the birds lighted upon the playground equipment as Tippi Hedren sat on the bench.  The choice of no score was interesting.  The soundtrack is filled with the screeching of birds gone mad, and for a nearly forty year old film, it still holds up well.  I would like to see The Birds done as a special edition DVD, see if they can boost the sound up to what Hithcock would have wanted.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rocky Relationships,"Critics have wrung their hands over what this movie really means since it was released in 1963. So I may as well take a stab at it also (pun intended). On a superficial level, the movie is just what it appears to be - another Hitchcock horror film designed to scare the wits out of you and purchase large amounts of popcorn and soda to keep the theater going. After seeing how bad things can get in the movie, you are happy to resume your life. Beyond that, the movie seems to want to take us to a place suitable for comparing humans and birds, both similarities and differences. Like birds, humans tend to peck on an individual level and as a group. Human behaviors such as possessiveness and fear can also lead to loosing freedom and being confined to a cage. Both birds and humans are also territorial. Human characteristics like intelligence, planning, and vengeance are also imputed to the birds in this movie. All this could conceivable create conflict when the interests of birds and humans are at odds, such as competing for fish and roosting space in a seaside town. Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) starts to look almost like just another crow perched on the hill watching on Mitch whose hen-pecking mother apparently chased her off wrecking her romance with Mitch. Melanie is similarly attacked by a gull in her desperate bay crossing for Mitch's attention. She learns quickly that the bay is for gull's to hunt, not rich SF debutantes. The soap operatic-level plot with dysfunctional characters and town ultimately beg for resolution and that's when Hitchcock does what he does best - mercilessly dispatch them with horror and disaster that would school even the likes of Irwin Allen. As the birds really go on the offensive, and things start blowing up, we are shown the town from the crazed, fluttering bird's eye view. One can infer that the birds are fed up with humans occupying their town and living space. The movie reveals two completely different, but competing species, one a feathered descendant of the dinosaurs, and the other from apes. Thoroughly trounced, the humans retreat and the birds re-capture their territory. One is left to ponder whether two completely different species can ever co-exist and live in peace, or is it always a powder keg of age-old grievances just waiting to blow.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the Birds! Horror classic weird and wonderful,"No it's not my favourite Hitchcock film but whenever I start watching it I can't stop. This movie works on two levels which make the film so classic and mesmerising. One as a pure cliche but brilliantly scary Horror film. And two as an amazing journey into human behaviour both in and out of an emergency and surreal situations. Such classic and emotional scenes. Those who give this film only 1/10 I think have not really thought about the ins and outs and the underlying emotions and psychology that Alfred Hitchcock deploys in all his films. This is truly a frightening horror story though and because it's so violently scary and why - I have always been a little frightened around birds - is why I do mark it slightly down from other classically psychological Hitchcock films. But also due to the acting and characterisation by such veterans and newbies, still a masterpiece of cinema.I still to this day have to watch it through my fingers covering my eyes - worrying about eyes being pecked out by those Birds! This is actually a lesson to all horror film makers to study to work out just much to show and how much restrain to show when doing horror!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Sorry, Hitch, a real misfire here...","Unfortunately, the self-styled Master of Suspense is the Master of Pretentiousness in this one. The ""I'm an auteur now, as you can see by slooow pacing, the waxy, masklike stares of my blonde, and my deliberately withholding from any character the faculty of reason.""Main-character Melanie, the Paris Hilton of her day (did she or didn't she skinny dip in a Roman fountain? Oooh, titillating!) has absolutely no affect to her voice--in every line, she channels Lauren Bacall on barbituates. The women all hate each other instantly and are each fixated on ""Mitch,"" a hubba-hubba guy with no chemistry. The cute meet is stupid; the melodrama is boring; there is no suspense because, between deadly attacks, people seem to forget the trauma of the birds--after a harrowing encounter, the mother rambles on about missing her husband and not knowing whether she likes Hubba's new relationship, for example.In short, this would be excellent, excellent fodder for Mystery Science Theater--just the right level of movie-making competency and retardness to make for gleeful ridicule.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fable, a parable, an allegory...","Hitchcock bragged that The Birds was pure fantasy, with no connection to real life (as we know it).  I've seen this movie a few times and I still wonder what it ""means,"" if it has a specific meaning.  It might just be a horror film about preternatural killer birds, but I humbly suggest that it might, in a sense, be an allegory about the Nuclear Paranoia of the era. Not an exact allegory like ""Pilgrim's Progress,"" but perhaps a parable, or a fable if you like, with the birds standing in for all those forces ready to kill innocent people for no good reason.  ""The Birds"" is so richly suggestive that there's an Oedipal theme as well, and some hints that Mitch isn't a very admirable guy, and so on... very Kubrickian, but predating ""2001"" by 4 or 5 years.  It's a film that can simply entertain, or frighten, or hold one's interest, without begging for interpretation.  But it's fun to wonder what the writer and director were thinking, and how much the actors/actresses knew of the artistic intent of the filmmakers.  It's interesting too that after ""Psycho,"" with its classic musical score, Hitchcock made ""The Birds"" a 2-hour film with no music - except the squawks, clucks and cries of The Birds.  Wonderful picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The last movie Senator Gill ever saw,"An old friend, the late State Senator Ted Gill, of Holyoke, Colorado, once told me that The Birds was the last movie he ever saw. He gave up movies after seeing this flick...they were just getting too weird and disturbing for an old rancher like him. It's still pretty terrifying, even if you've seen it again and again. You know what bad, brutal scenes are coming and don't want to see the carnage again, but can't help yourself. It's ominous as the crows flock tighter and tighter, always more and more, on the schoolyard Monkey-Bars and it's also exciting to see the school kids chased down by the crows a few minutes later. Subplots like the pitiful neurosis of Lydia Brenner, Mitch & Annie's lost-love-affair, Mitch's indifference to the needs of others, and the poor-little-rich-girl Melanie, who still just wants her mommie, are all well-written and acted. Loved best by me is Hitchcock's humorous characters who are CHARACTERS! The old drunk at the bar quoting Holy Scripture, the nosy neighbor done wonderfully by Richard Deacon, the dowdily-dressed old intellectual in the cafe buying her cigarettes and evidently a scientific expert for any field. Sir Alfred's macabre touches of comedy are unmatched, even in today's thrillers. I'm repulsed and attracted by such scenes as the one in the farmhouse, where Jessica Tandy discovers an old friend pecked to death, with his eye sockets bloody and empty. I find myself still searching for gory details on the farmer's body because Hitch didn't let the camera dwell on the horrible face too long. But he DID give us two rapid jump-cuts with closer and closer close-ups, and we end up seeing just as much detail as Jessica just did - enough to know that ""We gotta git outta there!"" Overall, a fine time. 119 minutes of revolting fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I'm not (Gull)ible,"This film is mainly a drawn-out drama. It deals with two main protagonists who meet by chance but then swiftly become the love interests.Exactly why there is a developing bird onslaught is really second to the physical events themselves, and how the main characters deal with the attack, (in their own unquestioning fashion). Sure, there are some crackpot theorists in the diner, (as well as an unconvincable ornithologist, who in my view should have been the FIRST to notice any unusual bird behavior, not the last), but nobody really helps the viewer out.There are some good moments too. The first hints of unusual avian behavior are curious and quite unexpected. Also, the feeling of seclusion and isolation in Bodego Bay are sufficient and quite appropriate, even if standard film-making techniques.You get the feeling that this story is a complete dramatic cul-de-sac. Any meaning or grand scheme behind the ""climax"" of the film would only invalidate almost everything else that happened previously. I for one cannot think of any explanation(s) that would not make me regret the two-hour sitting. Can you?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Poor things""","An unusual picture this, one of the earliest examples of animal horror, and the only Alfred Hitchcock film with supernatural elements. Still, atypical as its subject matter is, the business of building up tension and thrilling the audience was by now simply a case of going through the motions for Master of Suspense Hitchcock.The line between horror and thriller was always vague in Hitch's work, since while most of his pictures are generally categorised as the latter, they always work upon scaring and unsettling the viewer. It is unsurprising then that despite the mysterious nature of the bird attacks the director still uses many of the same techniques as he would to build up suspense over a murderer on the prowl. There's usually a period of silence, or at least without dialogue in the build-up to each attack – this is in contrast to the extended scenes of discussion after the tension of a bird attack has been diffused. There's one scene where Veronica Cartwright is distraught after an attack, but she remains silent while there is still danger around, beginning to talk only once they are safe in the car. This switching between normal human chatter and eerie silence or bird noises is really effective in the pacing of the movie. There's also a great use of space, for example in the famous scene with the crows outside the school. There's a shot of Tippi Hedren with the jungle gym, as yet empty, behind her. The empty space is conspicuously against normal cinematic convention and we expect something to fill it. Later on we start to become nervous and suspicious of every empty spot as a potential source of attack.An honourable mention should also go to the amazing process shots devised by Ub Iwerks, the original and unsung genius of the Disney studios. His trickery with the layers of birds effect is more or less seamless in credibility, unlike the rather clunky-looking bluescreen shots that Hitchcock seriously overuses here.Evan Hunter's screenplay structures the bird war phenomenon around a story of love and jealousy, and if this is to work as a proper counterpoint then there need to be some decent acting performances amongst all the special effects and suspenseful technique. Although his is not often referenced, I feel the best performance here is that of Rod Taylor. He seems to react most plausibly the birds, giving a portrayal of a man who acts best under pressure. Suzanne Pleshette is very good too, subtly showing the audience her hidden thoughts on the situation between Taylor and Hedren. Jessica Tandy does a fine job as well, although unfortunately in her best scene (where she tells Hedren about her late husband) she is shot from a rather aloof angle and she isn't really shown to her advantage – perhaps because Hitch didn't want to unbalance the bird war theme by getting too maudlin at this point.And to be honest, the human side of the story could have done with some more work. The way Taylor and Hedren are initially set up does not make them especially likable, and in many ways seems a little far-fetched, in basically what amounts to stalking, with friendly locals all willing to give away someone's details to a complete stranger. And while the build-up to individual bird attacks is masterful, the bird war as a whole peaks too early, and there are some disappointments later in the picture. The Birds has a great idea at its heart and some fabulous individual moments, but this isn't enough. All in all, it's a technical picture, not a good piece of storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The reward is not worth the endurance test,"Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds would be a truly masterful exercise in slowburn tension if it had been about twenty-five minutes shorter. Even as a fan of slowburn horror, often relishing in the age-old ideas of buildup and surprise to accompany the shock and awe that horror brings audiences, I found myself exhausted and almost indifferent to the titular subjects of the film and whether or not they were ever going to show up or not. For about fifty-three minutes, we are given an uncompromising amount of development and methodical plotting centered around a series of bland and wealthy archetypes to finally get to the point where the birds invade that the entire film almost becomes a study to see how long the audience will sit still to see what they came to see.The film revolves around a young, pretty socialite named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who meets a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in her bird-shop in San Francisco one day. He buys a pair of lovebirds for his sister's birthday, but because the shop is fresh out of stock, Melanie will have to deliver them the next day. Upon arriving at his mother's home the next day, Mitch spots Melanie and invites her to dinner. While there, Melanie meets Mitch's mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy), his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright), and a school teacher named Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). The five meet and dine inside a small beachhouse off of Bodega Bay when they see a plethora of birds, particularly seagulls, beginning to attack them and their home. When this unexpected, and certainly unexplainable, event occurs, the family decides to combat it the best they can by retaliating with whatever is in immediate reach.The Birds has become a quintessential American horror film, largely because of the reactions its director's name inspires. Hitchcock had a wonderful way with his films that made them transcend horror films into elegant, decorated melodramas that frequently made you jump. His films always ooze class in the way they are filmed and colored, showcasing details and making every inch of the screen count, as a result. Hitchcock could almost sleepwalk and make a film like The Birds look as good as it does, though for me, nothing beats the true amount of meticulous detail in actors and events occurring at once than in Rear Window.The issue is The Birds feels like a generic 1930s serial overstuffed to reach surpass a two-hour runtime. The amount of filler and fluff we have to sit through before getting to what we came for is unruly, especially considering most of it is staggeringly slow and numb conversation by actors that feel like even they, themselves, are bored and disinterested in the lines they're reciting. By the time they titular villains actually take the stage, the kind of conservative narrative practices Hitchcock employed are abandoned in favor of a great deal of shock and awe, having countless crows swarm the screen at once, never seeming to really pose any harm to the characters, as if they're on a whole other layer of film that has been placed over another layer that has the actors and the set decorations.The peculiar and cheap-looking mise-en-scene and the dreary pacing are somewhat disguised by Melanie and Mitch's retaliation efforts towards the end of the film. This is the point when Hitchcock trades the traditionalist elegance of a melodrama and the slow conversation for something more exciting and energetic. The intensity of the film suddenly shifts when we realize that the main characters aren't even safe from the birds in doors, as the winged creatures can come through the fireplace and easily swarm the home. The final twenty-five minutes of The Birds is satisfying and suspenseful, precisely what this film should've been all along.However, the price we have to pay - about an hour of dreary buildup and hit and miss effects - to gets about twenty to twenty-five minutes of great entertainment is almost not worth it. The classic status of The Birds, something few horror films really get to relish in when compared to other genres, is undeniable; the worthiness is questionable.Starring: Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, and Veronica Cartwright.

The Bird's the Word,"**SPOILERS*** The film ""The Birds"" starts out like a 1930's screwball comedy with handsome and available criminal lawyer Mitch Brenner, Rod Taylor, getting under rich socialite as well as jet setting Melanie Daniels, Tippi Hedren, skin about how spoiled she is. That's when Mitch spots her at a local San Francisco pet store where he's looking to buy a pair of love birds for his 11 year old sister Cathy's, Veronica Cartwright, birthday. Annoyed and at the same time impressed by the handsome stranger Melanie find out where he lives and plans to buy him the birds herself as a present and at the same time give him a piece of her mind in the bargain. That's when the light comedy ends and the sheer horror begins in the movie.Traveling all the way up to Badoga Bay, to present him the love birds, where Mitch is spending the weekend with his mom Lydia, Jessica Tandy,and sister Cathy things start to happen in the little fishing town that there's no logical explanation for. The birds in the area, finches blackbirds ravens and seagulls, start to go on a rampage against the people living there! At first it's just one bird at a time being aggressive but as the days ware on they mass in the hundreds and thousands and attack anything in sight. Melinia getting a room from local teacher Annie Hayworth, Suzanne Pleshette, finds out that not only is she Cathy's teacher but had an affair with Mitch. There's also a side story in the film in that Annie's affair was broken up by Mitch's widowed mom Lydia in fearing that she's take him away from her and that also effects Mitch relations with Melanie as well. That all soon disappears when the birds come on the scene,by the tens of thousands,and start both terrorizing as well as killing the citizens in Badoga Bay!One of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest hits,it grossed well over 11 million dollars in the box office, with things in it that he's not really known for: The eye popping special effects scenes of the birds on the attack in the air as well as on the ground in the movie. There's that famous scene with Melanie sitting near a monkey bar outside the school where at first one black bird lands on it and then within minutes it swamped with hundreds more as an unsuspecting Melanie with her back turned is just enjoying the view! Not for once realizing that she's, and those in the school, are about to be viciously attacked by them! There's later in the movie the scene when Malanie is trapped in the attic of the Brenner house and attacked and almost pecked to death by hundreds of attacking birds that's even more terrifying and bloody, being shot in color, then the famous shower scene in ""Psycho"". In fact actress Tippi Hedren was so traumatized by it that she actually suffered a nervous breakdown and was sidelined for a week after living or acting through it!***SPOILERS*** With all the great scenes in the film it's the final one that really stuck with me. That's when the birds by now in the hundreds of thousands overrunning Bodaga Bay and now completely in control allow the few remaining residents to leave unharmed in a show, if you can call it that, of compassion. In what seems like the birds knowing that after what happened to them that they'll never come back there again and go tell those living outside of Bagoda Bay what to expect if they ever did!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
what the heck was the point of this movie?,"This movie is a complete waste of time! I rented it because I am a big fan of suspense/thriller movies, and thus far I have enjoyed all of Hitchcock's movies I've seen (Vertigo, Pshycho, Spellbound, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder etc.) I was very excited to see this movie, it has received very good reviews so I expected to be wowed like all the other Hitchcock movies.I was not only not WOWed, I can't even say this movie is mediocre. This movie was just plain awful. There was honestly no plot. The only thing that happened was the birds went nuts and attacked a town. We don't know why, we don't know anything about the characters who got attacked. It wasn't even scary! It was actually somewhat cartoonish, with the liberal use of obviously-fake bright red ""blood"", and the screaming children and towns people were pretty silly.All in all, I just can't believe this movie was made by the person who made Vertigo. That movie was EXCELLENT, it had a very solid and Suspenseful plot, great and complex characters, and it kept us guessing until the end. There was nothing mysterious about this movie. The only mystery was why did these birds go insane? But we were not even afforded the luxury of receiving an explanation. When the movie ended, I couldn't help myself and said ""That has got to be the crappiest movie I have ever seen."" You know when was the last time I said that? It was after watching Pearl Harbour.Don't waste your time! Just because it was made by Hitchcock doesn't mean it's worth it.Still annoyed ...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
If You Have Ornithophobia You Have Been Warned,"The Birds in my opinion is another underrated Alfred Hitchcock classic, Yes it doesn't have the outstanding suspense that is on par with Psycho but you can tell it is still very much an Alfred Hitchcock film all the same. It also got nominated at The Oscars at the year of its releasing for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects and rightly so as over 3,200 birds were used in this film and in my opinion they were robbed of this award. The cast had great chemistry together and when Alfred Hitchcock wanted to get down to it with the suspense he pulls it off with his own style that we all know and love.Overall as stated above this film is seriously underrated in comparison to Vertigo, Rear Window or Psycho, It is definitely one to check out, If you don't have Ornithophobia you could get it from this.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds Attack!,"""Have you ever seen so many gulls? What do you suppose it is?""After having surprised and shocked audiences with Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock followed it up with another horror film, The Birds, which is more straightforward and generic than the rest of his films, but he still did experiment quite a bit with some elements here. There are no surprises or unexpected twists in The Birds and it pretty much plays out as a standard thriller slowly building the suspense by introducing us to the characters so we can identify with them. He didn't use psychological suspense either like he did in so many of his films, he just let the narrative unfold gradually. This may sound like a standard horror film, but what Hitchcock experiments with here is the lack of a musical score to accompany the film. Most thrillers rely on eerie scores to help set the mood, and we know Hitchcock included them often such as in films like Vertigo and Psycho, but here rather than introducing music he uses the sound of birds to scare audiences. Many people complain that the effects are outdated, but it didn't bother me at all, I thought they were really well done and I felt the tension during some of these scenes that have become classic by now (such as the scene where Tippi Hedren's character is trapped inside a phone booth as the birds are attacking the town, and the climatic scene where the birds are surrounding Rod Taylor's home). Those were memorable scenes full of tension, but I did have some issues with the pacing of the story.Hitchcock made sure we cared for the characters and during the first hour of the film he spends time building a possible romantic relationship between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren. This is where I wished the main characters were played by more charismatic actors such as James Stewart and Kim Novak where the chemistry between them would seem stronger, and that would have engaged me more with a story I kind of felt was silly otherwise. The premise is kind of out there since I really never believed the threat of the birds nor felt their presence haunting, but Hitchcock still managed to build in a few scares despite it all. The bay near San Francisco where this film mostly takes place was a perfect setting and I actually enjoyed the fact that it took place in an enclosed space like this. It sort of made the audience believe these characters were enclosed and surrounded by the birds. Hitchcock can build suspense out of nearly anything and despite my disbelief of the birds being a real threat there were times I did feel that tension. The way in which he exchanges shots from one scene to the next like he did in the phone booth with exterior shots exchanged with interior ones really helps build the suspense and create a tense atmosphere. The Birds may not have much psychological depth, but it plays out quite well as a generic disaster film and slowly builds its way up to a rather interesting climatic scene (I mean switch the birds for zombies and you realize where George A. Romero may have got his ideas for Night of the Living Dead). The Birds isn't amongst my favorite Hitchcock films, but I still had a fun time with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Free as a bird!!,"The genius Hitchcock scared me indeed,i saw this thrilling movie when i was 10,my family and me stared a real horror:birds taking revenge against human race,several years of hunting,torture seemed to take a real shape,the FX considering those early years of the blue screen were amazing,some is not agree about that stuff,but there hadn't the high budget and the new digital effects of the present,a flock of outraged pigeons,gulls,ravens and more feather some beings were flying over our heads!!Yes,i felt in that dreadful situation along with Tippi Heddren,Suzanne Pleshette,Rod Taylor or the grinny Veronica Cartwright (she made us shiver in ""Alien"" spreading the fear 16 years after), although some kind of doubt left with the end:Did the birds take it easy again? or Was the end of the humans? I got to say something:UNTIL THE 60'S THE HAPPY ENDS WERE A DUTY,but Hitchcock puts a half formula between the happy or the unhappy,since i remember the 70's broke that repeated solution and the bad guys could triumph or waiting to live again to slaughter the ""goodies"".If you don't like Hitchcock,don't watch any movie,you'll lose your time it's for sure that you don't understand the good films at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A good suspense movie.,"This is one of Hitchcock's(director of the all time classic Physco) most memorable movies.Birds is not dought all about Birds.

Remains terrifying,"Of all Alfred Hitchcock's movies, many of which are classics, the Birds contains a scene that remains one of the most frightening in cinema.The film is unusual for Hitchcock as it is a horror film. He had often made thrillers but the Birds is distinctive in its horror content. His later film Frenzy would also contain elements of horror in it's presentation of violence.Another distinctive aspect of the Birds is that it is an animal horror movie. 13 years before Jaws and a slew of animal horror films that followed on from Jaws, the Birds was there flying the lead. But is it actually a good Hitchcock film?The first half of the movie is sedate in its pacing. Tippi Hendren's character follows the lawyer played Rod Taylor, presenting him with the lovebirds that he had been looking for in a pet shop. There are driving scenes in this section of the film which do not help the pacing. The meeting of the romantic leads is interspersed with the initial, isolated bird attacks. The movie picks up the pace in this section of the film.What follows is the beginning of what is most memorable of this movie. Hitchcock shows his skill in building tension and providing frights. Some of the special effects of the bird attacks have not held up well as they involve back projection. The physical effects do work.A scene from the barracaded house often appears in documentaries about horror films. While this is not Hitchcock's best film, it remains one of his most memorable and distinctive.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One Of My Favourite Hitchcock Movies,"""The Birds"" stands - in spite of a handful of problems - as one of the more frightening horror movies you're ever going to come across. It's frightening precisely because it's so inexplicable. There are no monsters, no mutants, no aliens, no diseases - none of those things that are usually used to create ""horror."" Instead, there are birds. Gentle birds that we see around us everyday who are usually so frightened of us that they back away if we even get close. Except in the small California coastal town of Bodega Bay, where the local avian population suddenly runs amok, and birds of all species gather together (for no particular reason that's mentioned) and begin a series of escalating and deadly attacks on the local human population. It's the very fact that the attackers are so common around us every day and that this is so unexplained and seems so impossible that gives this movie its greatest power.The first hour or so is a bit long. Hitchcock gives us an extremely lengthy introduction to the various characters that probably could have been done more quickly, although it's in the midst of this introduction that seemingly unimportant things begin to happen - such as Melanie (Tippi Hedren) being inexplicably attacked by just a single bird - at the time more of a curiosity to the townsfolk than anything else. Hitchcock builds the suspense around the bird attacks and also builds their intensity quite well. Some of the effects used in portraying the bird attacks are quite frightening and unsettling, especially the scene in which a huge flock attacks a group of young schoolchildren. I felt a bit of deja vu during that scene as I remembered an incident as a child when I was surrounded by a group of sea gulls who were after my french fries. They weren't attacking of course, but they were all around me and I remember how unnerving and even frightening that was for a young child. The movie leads to no particular conclusion - except for an escape by the main characters as the giant flock of birds look on, apparently having quite effectively taken over the town and driven the humans away, which is exactly as the movie should have been left. To offer a logical, rational, scientific explanation would have weakened the power of the story.The performances were good. Hedren and Rod Taylor as her romantic interest Mitch Brenner were quite effective, and I thought Veronica Cartwright entirely believable as Mitch's younger sister, who becomes gradually more terrified as time goes on. The final scenes, with Melanie and the Brenners seemingly trapped in the house while this huge flock of birds tries to force its way in is quite creepy. Well done by all involved.

On top of that the direction, pacing, acting, and screenplay are also phenomenal, with that being said, the ending is somewhat disappointing and a few character arcs are a let down,but those two things are the only things holding this film back from being perfect.

Dated effects but chilling and great fun is to be had with the subtexts,"Melanie Daniels meets Mitch Brenner at a pet shop where he has come to buy some birds for his young sister.  They have a conflict of words but he sparks her interest and she travels up to his small town to see him again. Daniels stays in the town for the weekend despite the tension between her and Brenner's mother.  However this is not the only source of worry as the locals begin to notice that the birds are acting out of character and showing signs of aggression.I came to this film because my mother mentioned she was scared of birds as a result of seeing this when she was young.  So I went for it with highs hopes that were not disappointed on the whole.  The basic plot is just that  basic.  But it allows plenty of disturbing scenes of bird attack as well as a nice slow build.  The effects have dated and it doesn't look as impressive now, but it still has an impact.  More importantly the film has a rich side-plot about themes that carry over from Psycho about mother's and sons. Not quite as far out as that film, this still has plenty of meat for anyone looking to analyse it further.Hedren is OK in the lead but I found her to be just giving the same performance as every `dangerous blonde' does in Hitchcock films.  But she is the predator of the film and she does it pretty well.  Taylor is a good stock B movie actor type but looking at him I couldn't help picturing Cary Grant doing the role and it took away from Taylor.  Tandy looked old even then, but she does really well with a complex role of the mother.  Pleshette is a little annoying but still okMost people see this as a horror film, but it is much more than that.  The ending is quite low key but it worked well with the overall feeling of menace in the birds, but it's worth remembering that this is not the ending Hitchcock wanted.  His first choice, the Golden Gate bridge covered in birds, couldn't be done due to a tight budget.Overall this is a great bit of Hitchcock that works on several levels.  The horror will have you sweating when walking through groups of pigeons in city centres and the subtext will keep you in the pub for several hours.",,Anonymous,Horror
"""They're coming! They're coming!""","""They're coming!

This is a terrifying story about what could happen if our fine feathered friends turned on man. ""The Birds"", like the Master of Suspense's 1960 masterpiece ""Psycho"", has the ability to give people the chills. I found ""The Birds"" to be just a tad below ""Psycho"" (it starts a little slow), but it's still a pretty scary movie. It features good acting by Tippi Hedren (in her most famous role), Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy (26 years before ""Driving Miss Daisy""), Suzanne Pleshette, and Veronica Cartwright (16 years before ""Alien""). Plus it has impressive special visual effects, and probably the scariest sound effects that I've ever heard. The sound effects alone give me the creeps.

"Thrilling, but oh so meaningless!","Okay, Hitchcock does know how to build up suspense. Long before the birds first started to attack I sat anxious waiting for it to come. It didn't...until later. This kept me on the edge of my seat.But: Characters are dull, uninteresting and simple. The love story between Melanie and Mitch couldn't interest me less. As so with the characters of Lydia, Cathy and Annie. Secondly; That birds should do something like that is just stupid, and I didn't find it scary at all. What was so very frightful about Hitchcocks earlier film, Psycho, was that that was REAL. Someone could end up like Norman Bates, actually people HAVE done so, and that scared me quite significantly. But, birds aren't psychos. It's just plain meaningless.Hitchcock made, as always, a thrilling movie. The main plot with the birds, though weird, was interesting to follow.

Besides the horror elements of the movie, the relationships between Mitch and his mother (who he calls ""Darling""), Annie Hayworth and Melanie Daniels and Melanie and Mrs. Brenner are plenty to keep the viewer interested.Although the movie did not have a musical score, there was one song in the film if you noticed.  When Tippi Hedren plays the piano in the Brenner home, the strains of a song familiar as the closing theme of the PBS ""Stargazer"" show are heard.I particularly enjoyed Suzanne Pleshette's performance as Annie Hayworth and the entire diner scene with the various viewpoints of the townfolk on the ""bird"" situation.  The overhead scene of the gulls swooping down on the burning gas station is incredible to me.

"Birds don't just go around attacking people, do they?","I still have quite a few of Hitchcock classics to see, but I can already rest assured that ""The Birds"" will remain my all-time favorite effort by this legendary director. Being primarily a horror movie junkie, I consider this milestone to be the pioneer in the delicious 'nature revolts' sub genre. For reasons that remain unexplained throughout the entire movie, birds spontaneously launch virulent and aggressive attacks against the inhabitants of Bodega Bay; a little seaside town 90 miles away from San Francisco. Still several years after the release of this film, clever and ingenious independent horror film directors borrowed this formula and used it as an excuse to manifest practically every species of the animal kingdom as vicious killing machines, usually because of the ongoing pollution by mankind. But ""The Birds"" remains the original classic even though the story develops itself very slowly and the script refuses to give any type of explanation whatsoever. For nearly a full hour, the film simply focuses on the bizarre love-story between the spoiled daughter of newspaper owner and an arrogant crime attorney. She drives out to his parental house in Bodega Bay, where he spends all of his weekends, to play out a practical joke. ""The Birds"" then subsequently unfolds itself as a strangely compelling romance between the two aforementioned characters, but also the embittered local school teacher and the attorney's frigid mother. The interactions between these four unusual characters are often downright eerie and there isn't even a bird in sight at that moment! Meanwhile, however, the menace of our 'feathered friends' is continuously present and noticeable. The attacks gradually increase in number and intensity, like the birds are putting up some sort of strategy even though there's no obvious motive. After the virulent attack during a child's birthday party, the thriller definitely shifts into high gear, with many sequences that are righteously considered as classic by now (the schoolyard, the phone booth, the exploding gas station). Hitch's nickname 'The Master of Suspense' is justified through many individual moments here in this film, like when the entire community seeks shelter inside the café and accuses the girl of bringing this mayhem upon them. The film's brilliant anti-climax, with thousands of birds just sitting and suspiciously waiting outside the Brenner house is legendary and imitated copious of times. ""The Birds"" is a perplexing Hitchcock landmark, with a couple of surprisingly shocking make-up effects and a truly ominous atmosphere that still manages to send cold shivers of fright down your spine.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"The plot is infuriatingly vague, but Hitchcock's got the goods of a semi-classic...","Any viewer might be forgiven for having mixed feelings at the conclusion of ""The Birds"". Evan Hunter's obtuse screenplay about a mass of violent bird attacks off the coast near San Francisco offers a situation with no explanation, no cause and no solution. This Alfred Hitchcock film is smoothly directed, but passive and a bit tentative. Tippi Hedren (Hitchcock's discovery, whom he hoped to groom into the next Grace Kelly) is an immaculate, impenetrable blonde Ice Queen who may be the one responsible for stirring up the birds, but this is never justified. Hedren's haughty manner is just as mysterious and implacable as the bird attacks (watch her in the elevator: her expression never wavers--she's like a mannequin). In fact, most of the women seem to be hiding some mysterious thought; Hitchcock holds close-ups of the female characters for so long, we wait for hidden subtext to be revealed and--despite a few telling lines of dialogue--it isn't. Rod Taylor is forthright and muscular as the lawyer who takes a fancy to Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette is a strangely contemplative, husky-voiced teacher, Jessica Tandy is Taylor's mother and Veronica Cartwright is Rod's sister (niece would've seemed more likely, or was Cartwright adopted?). Those are the only main characters, and even with so few the script can't iron out their stories. For instance, Tandy happens upon a man pecked to death by birds, she stumbles out of the house and passes a stable-hand but can't tell him what she saw; after she arrives home where Taylor and Hedren are, she butts them out of her way and takes to her bed! When Hedren phones from a diner and tells her father about a bird attack on the school, she completely forgets to mention a sparrow attack in Taylor's house the night before (she might've also mentioned the man pecked to death in his own bedroom!). ""The Birds"" is a very confusing picture from the viewer's side because we are kept at arm's length from these people. As for the birds, it doesn't help to hear everyone asking, ""why are they doing this?"" when we in the audience have absolutely no idea either. Still, it is one of Hitchcock's most stylish productions and there are several sequences that, while not without peer, are impeccably mounted and delivered. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Last Masterpiece,"Although not his final film, this was Hitchcock's final masterpiece, full of fascinating cinematic ideas, some realised better than others, but considering the difficulties he set himself in this movie, well before our time's all-pervasive CGI, most of the hundreds of trick shots work out amazingly well.The brittle female lead was given to a strangely brittle first-timer, who acquits herself well - certainly a great deal better than she did in her (and Hitch's) next picture, MARNIE, in which the title character's complexities eluded her grasp. Melanie Daniels in THE BIRDS is much less of an acting challenge, although the role proved to be an endurance test, especially in the infamous, dazzlingly edited final bird attack.The rest of cast do sterling work, with a substantial contribution from Jessica Tandy and a noteworthy one from Doreen Lang.The element of the film that still feels wonderfully experimental is the soundscape of bird screeches, wing flaps and tweets.

Meanwhile, children are sent home from school run by teacher (Suzanne Pleshette), townspeople (Charles McGraw, Karl Swenson, Chapman) take refuge in a lunchroom, a gas station is burnt, Melanie is trapped in a phone booth, and, finally, everyone hides in homes tightly closed against repeated attacks by the birds.Hitchcock's classic about a gorgeous woman who follows a gentleman until a quiet place where suddenly happens mass bird attacks . After frightening spectators of the 60s with ¨Psycho¨ director Hitch took one more successful outing at the terror genre with this excellent movie full of subterranean hints. Exciting scenes when birds attack with death dropping fiercely , its menace magnified similarly to crop-dusting images in ¨North by Northwest¨. Interesting screenplay by Evan Hunter based on Daphne Du Maurier's (Jamica Inn,Rebecca) short story. Al always, Alfred Hitchcock cameo, this time as man walking dogs out of pet shop. Wonderful Tippi Hedren as obstinate Melanie , she's marvelous and brilliantly dressed by Edith Head , but she had a tortuous involvement to Hitch, habitual issue with his leading ladies. Acceptable special effects by Ub Iwerks, Walt Disney's usual, and Albert Whitlock in pictorial designs and the future director John Bud Cardos as bird wrangler. And colorful and evocative cinematography by Robert Burks, also Hitchcock's customary. Rare and strange electronic musical score fitting to bird attacks. This delightful film is stunningly directed by the master Hithcock. Followed by a lousy and cheesy sequel in 1994 titled ¨The birds II : land's end¨ by Rick Rosenthal under ordinary pseudonym as Alan Smithee with Brad Johnson, Megan Gallaher and again Tippi Hedren. Rating : Not for squeamish but well worth seeing because it is an immortal classic movie. This is Hitchcock at his best.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Hitchcock.,"This is one of the old classic movies that I actually enjoy watching. Everything just seems to work well together. It is one of those things that I cannot pinpoint as to what I like about it. The cast are engaging, the location is eerie, the script is great and it just seems to work.I love the fact that something so simple like a bird can generate an idea for a great suspense thriller. Alfred Hitchcock really was an incredible director. Even if he didn't have the best technology he used what he had to create a movie that might make you think the next time you come into contact with a little birdie. Even more interesting was his personal relationship with Tippi Hedren. Sometimes real life can be more interesting than the movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic classic!,"Probably Hitchcock's greatest film ever released!! The Birds is a very creepy, well written and acted, and with good effects (for 1963 at least). Tippi Hedren really stole the show as the leading role here, along side Rod Taylor, who acted well here too. Then, there's Jessica Tandy, who I personally loved in the birds! Everyone definitely knew what they were doing with this film. Also, this movie has some pretty intense scenes that will keep you right on the edge of your seat! The script is very well put together, and really delves into each individual character, not that I expected anything less from Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. I enjoyed listening to the dialouge between the characters. I also liked the actiony edge of your seat intense scenes that Hitchcock sprinkled into the movie. Very well made likable movie! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I can't believe these nasty birds have bitten holes in my Edith Head suit!,"I love this movie and I watch it about once every couple of months.  The genius of Alfred Hitchcock is undisputed and has been well-documented so I'm not going discuss that.  If a viewer doesn't understand the subtleties and layers of meaning in this film, then it really wasn't for them.  These are the same people who like in-your-face scares, and can't understand a movie that doesn't beat you over the head with violence and bloodshed.There are enough things to be read into the characters and scenes in this movie, that it would take endless reviews to cover them.  Many of them have been touched upon in the reviews here, but I would like to add a few more comments about Melanie Daniel's character:Did you notice the coy simper on her face just before the seagull attacked her in the boat?  She's posing for Mitch, her head is cocked to one side and she has this annoying, fake look on her face and the bird swoops down and ruins it.  I wonder what her first words to Mitch would have been if the bird had not attacked her?I didn't feel sympathy for her when she was at Cathy's birthday party talking to Mitch about her mother and how she had abandoned her when she was a child.  Her voice gets this phony catch when she says, `I don't know where she is.'  She is so obviously trying to be the poor little rich girl and elicit Mitch's sympathy.  Why would she sound near tears talking about a mother who had to have been out of her life for at least the last 15 years? [Tippi Hedren's voice really got on my nerves too.]Melanie seems a little too smug and self assured in her attractiveness and she expects all men to find her enchanting.  The only reason she goes after Mitch is because he didn't seem to be impressed with her.  She is like a child who sees something she can't have and immediately sets out to try and get it any way she can.  She seemed like a selfish, relentless sort; buying the love birds, driving 60 miles to Mitch's home town to find him ostensibly to deliver the birds to Cathy in time for her birthday.And then, we have the famous scene where she goes upstairs by herself. Who in their right mind would decide that `Gee, everybody is asleep and even though this isn't my house, I think I'll just nip upstairs with this flashlight and see if the birds are gone.'  Wouldn't it have made more sense to wake up Mitch and ask him to go with her?  Why did she even care?  I think she got exactly what was coming to her.  No more did bad things happen to other people, here was the golden girl herself being assaulted like any other fool who blundered into a nasty situation that they couldn't control. I think the shock of the birds actually daring to attack her, shocked her so much that she couldn't move.  She couldn't believe it was really happening. Otherwise, why not swat a few of them off with that big flashlight and open the door and get the hell out of there?I think the ending was inevitable.  Melanie Daniels thought that she could do whatever she wanted in life because she was rich and attractive and felt that she didn't have to suffer the consequences of her actions.   She thought life would always be like this but her experience in Bodega Bay proved her wrong.I'd like to discuss Annie Heyworth too, but I'll leave it for another time.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Fearsome, Feathered Fiends","Hitchcock directed many suspense films.  In fairness to his impressive body of film work, only a handful is consistently cited as all 'round classics, and qualify as emblematic cinema 'templates' upon which modern filmmakers can draw much of the basics when it comes to putting together a practical thriller (of almost any movie genre, to be completely honest).  His earlier works are sometimes mentioned in conjunction with his more popular ones.The Birds marked a fixed alternate attitude towards B movies in general (until '63, they were not quite the marketable successes they are today), horror movies and even the more mainstream 'noir thrillers of the 1940s (such as those starring the likes of Jimmy Stewart, Ray Milland and Cary Grant; all of these actors starred in at least one Hitchcock film). Modern directors (like De Palma and Spielberg) owe a bit of gratitude to the late `Master of Suspense.''Birds' marked a definitive breakthrough in movies that dealt with the `Nature Gone Amok' thriller themes many genre fans have become all too familiar with in the past quarter-century.  Without this one, films like `Frogs' (a camp personal favorite of mine, which works on a few notable levels), `Jaws,' and the more recent `Bats' would have been only inferior products of entertainment, had it not been for the various filmmaking talents of those involved with the 1963 picture.The plot of Birds centers on a flighty, somewhat daredevil socialite Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner (an initial 'mama's boy') whom she becomes romantically involved with.  Together, this unlikely pair (she's beautiful and he's handsome, but there is no obvious chemistry to link them as an item) do their darned best to shoo away an awesome flock of dangerous birds (crows, seagulls and finches) that have chosen to repeatedly convene and descend upon Mitch's Pacific coast hometown of Bodega Bay.Overall the film is good. However, I would like someone to religiously do a remake and (in this rare case) benefit from the far better CGI FX we are more familiar with today.  The FX in the '63 film deserves a few refinements, and although they were breakthrough achievements for its time, they can do with a welcome improvement here and there.  Birds features a few interesting set-pieces, and any director willing to take the 'remake' challenge had better stick to them, if a modern version is to experience a grain of the original's success.The supporting, Secondary Plot (The Mitch-Melanie Romance; however incidental and inferior this plot may initially seem) should not be tampered with in any way.  It serves as a sort-of bizarre counterpoint to the truly unprovoked, concerted bird attacks which befall them and the Bodegan citizens.See Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" and analyze it thoroughly (Don't bother watching the belated and pointless made-for-cable sequel, ""Lands End: The Birds II"").  Film critics have not said quite the right things about this one... Maybe these professionals don't take kindly to having their 'feathers rustled.'",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Interesting, lovely classic","The colour palette and slice of 1960's northern California life are phenomenal, but both the lead actress and the director were too preoccupied with her looking flatly beautiful in every shot.

Classic Hitchcock,"One of Hitchcocks best came from the birds and when they say that he is the master of suspense the birds proved it well obviously other movies from him like Psycho north by north west and Vertigo they are by far the most iconic of his work and by far The Birds is one unique movie and i just love the building tension that is classic for all his movies 
The Birds follows a socialite from San Fransisco who follows a man who she is eyeing up a potential boyfriend and follows him to a rural town where birds begin to attack and slowly begins to attack the humans. The cast is Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner,Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner,Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels,Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth, Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner,Ethel Griffies as Mrs. Bundy, Charles McGraw as Sebastian Sholes,Ruth McDevitt as Mrs. MacGruder and Lonny Chapman as Deke Carter. The leading cast is amazing and the acting is amazing and it makes the story much much better.
I think that The Birds is a fun Hithcock movie that captures the essence of his style of movies and they make every part of the story he is trying to tell and the directing and cinematography is perfect and it was just another one of his moves that captured his magic that he can bring to his movies and the cast was well choosen and it's a movie that if your a huge movie fan or not you will still just love this movie and it is defently a must watch if you haven't seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unusual days!,"I have two birds and they are so cute, but I found that a group of birds was a scary in this film. Why did the birds attack people? I think human beings control birds and they are the lower class in our daily life. For example, they are basically in the cages. Their real symbol is freedom. Though they want to fly freely, they cannot do that because they are in their cages. It means that human beings violate their rights. Wild birds can, as a matter of course, fly like they want to. However, crows are poor existences because they are said ""the Messenger of the Dead"". There are a lot of people that hate the crows (But I adore them). However, if the birds became a band, they could control us, people. But it is impossible that the birds attack the people badly like that in reality. This impractical occurrence was interesting and fascinated me. Symbol of freedom is birds. Human beings dominate some birds. However, the birds revenge and dominate us in this film. The paradox is also very interesting for me. I like this movie because I love strange, horror and psycho thriller stories. Moreover old works' qualities of graphics are not clear rather than current that. It still felt me creep.",,Anonymous,Horror
"A classic, but not my favorite","I do like this film, but I've always been annoyed by the non-ending and lack of either scientific or supernatural explanation of the birds' behavior.

This doesn't exactly make me want to go on holiday to Bodega Bay,"Hitchcock's infamous film about a flock of birds randomly attacking the bemused residents of Bodega Bay, California, on a seemingly typical boring day.Film builds up slowly and methodically, tricking you into feeling the characters' own ennui with their own daily lives, but still holding your attention, making the audience feel like something of a voyeur while watching them. The lack of a proper musical score also makes audience forget we are watching a movie.The film never really climaxes so much as it just stops, but that was the perfect way to end the film. By not having any closing credits, Hitchcock didn't give the audience any time to linger at the end and ask ""What happened? Do they get to the hospital, or anywhere else safe? Do the birds ever attack again, there or anywhere else?"" until after we left the theatre. If we had been asking that as the closing credits run, its effect would have been lost. The ending is a hit-and-run, and it works perfectly for the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Seriously... not enough praise for this gem!!,"It's easily a TOP 3 Hitchcock film for me! PSYCHO is easily my favorite. With NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE BIRDS duking it out for 2nd place. Everyone raves about VERTIGO (way overrated) and REAR WINDOW (good but not great) but it's THE BIRDS which is easily the most underrated film of the Master of Suspense! Forget VERTIGO. THE BIRDS is a true masterpiece! What's really amazing about the film is that we're never told why the birds attack. They just do. And they do it in stages. No one knows why. Is it Tippi Hedren's arrival in Bodega Bay? Is it just some strange coincidence? Is it Mother Nature? Nothing is more terrifying than that which we do not understand. This film really delivers! Who can forget that scene where Tippi sits smoking on a bench as the birds slowly gather on the jungle-gym behind her? When she finally looks back she's terrified to see the jungle-gym completely covered in a black cloud of birds!!But just think about the sheer guts that Hitch must have had to undertake such a daunting task as this film! I mean how do you film a movie with a swarm of killer birds pecking folks to death? And all without CGI! Using live birds!! Sheesh... if I were a director I would have said ""no thanks"" without even giving it a second thought. How do you do a movie where the villain is a bird? Not one bird. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them.Sure you have a good deal of rear-projection shots. But you also have shots of real birds tied to the actual kids who are running for their lives. Each shot has to be carefully scrutinized. You have a combination of real birds & fake birds, rear-projection, various camera tricks and cuts, an exhausted Tippi Hedren who wound up in the hospital from all this, etc. The whole undertaking really does make your jaw drop! And it's not just merely a novelty item (just some ground-breaking special effects movie) it really has that genuine terror and suspense that Hitch's best films possess. Only PSYCHO is superior to this one in terms of terror/suspense!It's not something like AVATAR where it's all just a commercial to show off the latest in Hollywood SFX. It's a genuine horror film!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A little hokey for me - but it does make you wonder...!,"My overall impression of the movie is that it is , for lack of a better word, a little hokey. I found much of the plot and presentation unbelievable. And trust me, I am usually a big suspender of belief when watching movies. But somehow here, I found it a little more difficult.But don't get me wrong, I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and I do still like this movie, But I guess I have such high expectations for Hitchcock that this one comes up just a bit short, say a Vertigo, Rear Window or Psycho. But it is still a good movie, just not GREAT like I hoped.Tippi's character is a little too stalkish in the beginning, following Taylor to his hometown. Who would do this? Especially nowadays. And I guess I have never been a big Rod Taylor fan - he always seems a little neaderthal-ish Okay, enough of the negatives. I think the real beauty of the movie is that it takes something you never think of as a threat, i.e. birds, and suddenly has you thinking... ""It could happen?!..."" So it succeeds in inspiring fear. I wonder if had the same effect on people back then, that Jaws had on my generation?But the ending fell flat for me. I see it was meant to leave you asking ""So what happens...?"". And it doesn't answer any of the why questions as to why it happened or will they go away.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The birds were clearly the best part of the movie.,"Hitchcock was known for an ordinary, peaceful town being in danger once someone else arrives new to the town. Usually, that would be the villain, but since a nice, young woman is visiting and havoc follows, there's no real reason for danger except there would be no movie otherwise. The human characters were mostly so so. I do like Tippi Hedren, but not the other ones who seem blah. There also isn't an explanation as to why the birds were there once she arrived at almost the same time. There isn't really an ending either, but this is still an entertaining movie that works for the attack scenes, the camera angles and the anticipation of the violence or danger approaching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The movie lacks a solid story and an honest resolution.,"Having never seen the movie, I read the script first to prepare myself for the 'visual companion', in other words, for the film. I am a huge fan of Daphne Du Maurier's ""Rebecca"", and although I have never read ""The Birds"" novel, I figured it would be an interesting story as well.By the end of script page 161 I had not really learned anything worthwhile from any of the characters. Since the script called for ""insert information here from Dr. X for a possible reason to why birds may violently attack"", I decided to watch the movie in hopes that I might find a reasonable explanation and maybe have a better understanding of the characters. I also decided to watch the movie thinking maybe it was a story that needed to be 'seen' in order to capture the eeriness and essence of the birds' wrath. I must say, that was not the case.Melanie (Tippi Hedren) is a spoiled rich girl that is used to being childish and foolish and uses her Daddy's newspaper to bid her ways. Mitch (Rod Taylor) is the sophisticated lawyer strangely attracted to Melanie's beauty despite her 'reckless' behavior. Lydia (Jessica Tandy) is Mitch's widowed mother who is (unsuccessfully) coping with the loss of her husband and clinging to her son tooth and nail. Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) is Mitch's ex-girlfriend who still remains friends with him but continues to love him. Add to this soap like melodrama the sudden attack of birds for no inexplicable reason and you have yourself a movie titled ""The Birds"".The reason why it failed to even remotely interest me was not because it wasn't ""scary enough"" or because the ""special effects weren't good enough"" those are poor excuses  but because I could not see a personal growth from almost all of the characters. The romance between the two lead characters seemed abrupt, there is a scene in the script that actually displays them getting close and ultimately displaying their affections for one another, but in the movie it just seems rushed and out of nowhere. Annie's love for Mitch is not resolved in a tasteful manner  her character meets a terrible faith and she is simply taken out of the equation. Lydia is about the only person that comes to some sort of resolution and resignation in this inexplicable catastrophe of events. The brief 10 minutes of monologue she has on screen serve to explain the struggles she finds herself in as she attempts to overcome the fear she has been plagued with.Still, the connection and emotional value just lack from my part and do not allow me to engage with a plausible contempt for the story.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near? (Tippi),"We may never know the answer to this question. But this movie is unquestionably a classic.Like it or not (it is impossible to not like it), this is a standard by which other movies are judged. The script, actors (some of whom are Rod Taylor and Suzanne Pleshette), and execution are always being compared to earlier and later movies.The story adapted from Daphne du Maurier, does seem to be a little mysterious as to why the birds suddenly appear and as to the ending if that is what it is; however, the build-up and execution of the conflict with birds, and between women is definitely worth watching.A small town is devastated when a bunch of birds terrorizes the inhabitants in what seems to be an all-out war. The graphics leave little to be desired, but you will be so absorbed that you do not care.If you have the DVD watch the movie before the goodies (extras.) then watch it again afterwards.Feel the tension build up and be sure to duck at the appropriate time.

This is not a flighty movie,"Due to the large number of references to this movie in The Simpsons, my children had a keen interest in seeing this movie.  It's been around thirty years since I'd seen it, so I felt it was about time for a second viewing.Like Psycho, the movie opens with a blond woman who's just a little bit bad. Fortunately, Hitchcock lets her live longer than he let Janet Leigh.  The woman is an unusual character...almost malevalent, even when she is flirting.The first fifty minutes are spent introducing the characters and building relationships.  There is a single bird attack, beautifully directed, during this period.My children were skeptical about a bunch of birds being a threat; however, the scenes of the mass attacks by the gulls, ravens and sparrows MAKE you believe.One last thing:  I'm sure that this is often talked about, but I have to say that I was impressed with the sequence in the schoolyard.

Vivid Touch and Interpretation,Just got done with The Birds movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Had heard about it so finally got my hands on. Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted. I still feel this movie had more to offer but it was stopped at the right time before the concept went off hand.

good classic thriller,"The Birds/1963/***Main Stars: 'Tippi' HedrenSuzanne Pleshette Rod Taylor Jessica TandyNot only was this a classic but a fake classic with fake birds on strings or drawn birds that were somehow put into the screen but also some were real. Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" was one of his goriest films. I'd say the tamest one was ""North by Northwest"" which was even better than ""The Birds"" because it was more intriguing, suspenseful (not that ""The Birds"" wasn't though) and had a very good storyline to it. I'd give it four stars out of four stars. ""The Birds"" was ""good"" (not any worse, not any better). The main star, Melanie Daniels ('Tippi' Hedren), is a lady that gets involved with the ""birds"" thing just because she wanted to know who this mysterious person named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) was at a bird shop. She decides to give his daughter Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) a gift. The gift was two lovebirds in a cage. She delivered it to the house by boat because Mitch lives near water (a lake). Melanie interrogates an old man, who happened to be a cashier, when she wanted to know where the Brenners' lived and he told her where they lived and that there were two ways to get to the house: by road or boat. She decided to take the boat option and bring the lovebirds to Mitch's house. She then got to the house and decided to invite herself in without knocking and put the cage right in the living room along with two cards. Then they meet and while she's going to return the boat to where she got it (the dock), a bird (fake) swoops down on her and cuts her. She then goes in to a restaurant to get some help and that's when she meets the strict mother of Mitch's (Jessica Tandy). In this movie there are about four bird attacks. One is at a schoolhouse, at a party, at a restaurant/telephone booth, and inside Mitch's house. There are a few other minor attacks also. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should so you can see how good and fake it is at the same time. Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",,Anonymous,Horror

I was visiting my home town of Philadelphia after being away for a couple of years and one of my older cousins was given the job of entertaining me by taking me to a movie. I was totally taken with The Birds but I'm not sure my cousin liked it at all. Since then, I've seen the movie dozens of times and I've enjoyed it on many different levels every time I've seen it, depending on what age I was, what experiences I'd had to date, and where my consciousness was. If I'm flipping channels and see any scene from The Birds, I tend to get riveted to the spot and have to finish watching through to the end. There are scenes in this film which, like great music, carry you along with them to places you wouldn't otherwise go but, once there, won't willingly leave.Hitchcock's films are all crafted with extreme care and the stories of his obsessions and perfectionism are legendary. For me, those things pale beside the work itself, this film being one of my personal favorites. Tippi Hedren, whom I identified with very strongly in this film and even more so as Marnie, epitomized a certain 50's ideal turned on its head - a strong-willed woman who was visually very together but, underneath it all, perhaps a bit fragile psychologically. I like the fact that Hitchcock chose to make her rich in this film because that' makes sense to me as someone who grew up in that era. I say 50's because, although the film was made in the early 60's, it is built on the imagery and assumptions of the 50's as firmly as early 70's films were built on those of the 60's. It takes a while for the societal norms and cultural views of one decade to make it into the movies, especially the movies which make sense of, or epitomize, them.Every camera angle and small exchange between people, or between people and birds, or between the birds themselves, is exquisitely pertinent to the story. Every detail of each set, every action, every snippet of dialogue, every gesture all fit together seamlessly to create a world that feels as real and comfortable as an old sweater... the better to take you places you would never dream of going psychologically. Comfort and safety, order, well-understood expectations all create a firm foundation for you to surrender your emotions and allow the story to work on your subconscious as well as your conscious mind.It does this brilliantly and that is why generations of film students know the beats of the movement, the pauses and silences, the framing and the pacing as well as I do. Many people prefer to study Psycho for these nuances but I think that which film strikes one's own personal chord most resonantly speaks more to our own internal landscapes than to which film of Hitchcock's is 'better'.I have never taped or purchased a copy of The Birds. I think it's because I would rather remember it, like memories from my own life, within the context of the time I saw it. I also like to stumble across it on TV or cable and rediscover it all over again in whatever frame of mind I am in at the time. If you've never seen it, please do. It's one of the real masterpieces of cinematic art.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cross examination,Is interesting to see how Hitchcock used the car as a witness box with Mitch leaning on Melanies car door as if in the courtroom.

"So many birds, so few answers...","The first 45 or so minutes of ""The Birds"" (which is 2 hours long) is spent setting up an unusual plot about a woman named Melanie Daniels (played by Tippi Hedren) stalking a man she met in a pet shop named Mitch Brenner (played by Rod Taylor), supposedly out of playful romantic interest. She goes through a LOT of trouble to get in touch with this guy, whom she didn't really seem to get along with in the pet shop. How she suddenly fell in love with this guy or why she goes through so much trouble to do what she does is never explained.But, then we get to see dive-bombing birds!I don't necessarily mind a red herring plot, mind you. ""Psycho"" starts off as a story about an embezzler running away, but it takes a dramatic turn into uncharted territory as soon as our protagonist stops for the night at the Bates Motel. However, unlike in ""Psycho,"" the red herring plot doesn't disappear in ""The Birds"" once the main plot begins. We see long discussions between Melanie and her newly found roommate (played by Suzanne Pleshette) about Mitch. We see heart-to-heart conversations between Mitch and Melanie. And, the relationship between Mitch and his mother has clear elements of the jealous, controlling relationship that Mrs. Bates has with her son Norman. Why all of this continues to happen throughout the movie, I have no idea. It's all interesting stuff, but it starts to feel like filler material after a while.All of this, of course, occurs in between scenes of DIVE-BOMBING BIRDS!Speaking of such birds, I did enjoy seeing them and the attack scenes. This is a movie that would look great and be pretty scary in 3-D. The one thing I loved the most about any of the attack scenes was the sound effects of the bird calls. The cacophony of bird calls, while seemingly innocent in real life, manages to make these birds seem ever more menacing in this film.At the same time, though, I couldn't help but wonder what on earth possessed the birds to suddenly attack and in such massive numbers. Why did they keep on attacking? Why did their attacks seem way more intelligent than we know birds to be? Are they supernatural birds? Do they have some disease? Have they gone psycho? Are they under the control of Norman Bates' mother? In the beginning, there's something mentioned about dead chickens and bad birdseed. Does that have anything to do with the birds' behavior? None of this is ever answered.I'm willing to put up with lack of explanation, as well, since I'm sure no explanation would probably satisfy me, given the behavior of the birds. But, then, the film never really finishes the story either. Right as the we're getting into the thick of the plot, the film is over. No resolution, no explanation, no real sense of ""falling action"" either. We reach the climax of the story and then we're done right away.Now, I don't mind ambiguous endings. Sometimes, the best way to end the film is on an ambiguous note. But, with a red herring plot that continues throughout the film even after it is revealed to be a red herring, no explanation for the odd behavior of the birds, and no resolution to the main plot, I walked away from ""The Birds"" thinking that I had seen a script that had a good premise but had no idea where it wanted to go with it.But, still, DIVE-BOMBING BIRDS! :)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the weakest Hitchcock movies that I've seen,"This movie has total tonal shift and it is done badly.

I would rather recommend Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho and others beside Marnie over this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Hitchcock's best but still Very Good and a personal favorite of mine,"Hitchcock has made many memorable and suspenseful movies. The Birds is among them. It has chilling and very memorable scenes.The acting in The Birds is good but definitely not as good as in say Notorious or some other of Hitchcock's movies. Tippi Hedren is good in one of her first roles but she is a little bit stiff in areas. Rod Taylor is good in his role. Veronica Cartwright is much more impressive here than she would be in Alien, she plays Cathy quite well. Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette give good, credible performances.The premise of the Birds is interesting. Its Man vs. Nature, though its not the first time its been done. Its a conflict that ends in a surprising way, that during the time the movie was made, only Hitchcock would have ended it like this. It has a powerful ending.The Birds is not a flawless film. The dialogue was not award material then and certainly not now, but for the movie the dialogue works well. However, the scenes are whats important in The Birds. The scenes are well put together and well shot by Hitchcock. One scene that is unforgettable in The Birds is when Melanie(Tippi Hedren) sees The Birds perched on the Playground equipment and the power wires and she slowly walks into the school. This is an absolutely chilling scene, the way its crafted.Some may think The Birds has dated because of its special effects. I will admit The Birds special effects have not aged as well as say 2001's have but I think The Birds special effects are still exceptional. But maybe one may have to really like the movie to see that.One thing that recently jumped out to me about The Birds is the main character, Melanie. Is she bad luck? The script shows us that the attacks didnt start happening until Melanie came to the little Calfornia town. But also her mother left her when she was young and in the end out of her and Mitch's (Rod Taylor) family, she is the only one that gets hurt. Also Annie dies when Melanie had been staying with her.Overall, The Birds is definitely not Hitchcock's best film but it is very good and a personal favorite of mine. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Technically brilliant, inconsistent Hitchcock thriller","""The Birds"" truly shows Hitchcock's directing skills. He builds up suspense very effectively, and the film is technically (camera work, editing, sound effects, etc.) brilliant. But, as a whole, it's disturbingly inconsistent. It feels as if two different movies have been put together; other about birds attacking people, and other about the characters and their problematic relations. This doesn't quite work because of the missing link between them. What's more, the characters are cold and uninteresting.""The Birds"" is undeniably a classic piece of cinema history, but it's not one of Hitchcock's top achievements.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

When I saw Psycho, I noticed the importance of music because I felt fear very much by music. However, There are no music in this film.

However, We believe this movie's story and go into our heart and soul.Third, I expect this movie appeal the importance to treasure animals equally. Many people think humans are not equal to animal.

Very Enjoyable Hitchcock Classic,"A wealthy San Francisco socialite (Tippi Hedren) pursues a potential boyfriend (Rod Taylor) to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people there in increasing numbers and with increasing viciousness.I have to say, right off the bat, that the birds were pretty cheesy. It was more than obvious that they were not actually in the same room or area as the people, at least most of the time. And their squawks were like records being played backwards. They were not particularly terrifying.That aside, it was a good movie. Great characters (though the sister is a bit irritating) and some underlying issues that never fully come to a head. Dominant mother? Absent father? A former lover? We have the makings of a good bit of tension here... enough to have a plot outside of the bird attacks.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
HITCHCOCK - FLYING HIGH!,"The first half hour feels like the opening of one of those Doris Day romantic comedies so popualar in the early sixties. The cute meeting of the stars in the pet store, and Melanie's flirtatious attempt to play an elaborate practical joke on the attractive guy almost make us forget we are watching a movie directed by the man who terrified us a couple of years before with PSYCHO. Then, first with one peck from a gull on Melanie's forehead, then with the discovery of a neighbor's multi-pecked corpse, we begin to realize what we're in for. Even if he had not made PSYCHO, this movie would have made his reputation. Has any director ever delivered such a ""one-two punch"" of great films in succession? It seems time to applaud the performance Tippi Heston gives here in what was her first movie role. She makes her character's slow transition from shallow socialite to traumatized heroine completely believable. And speaking of ""one/two punches,"" she jabbed two of her own with her follow-up movie, MARNIE, in which she totally carries the entire film without any help from exciting bird attacks - again for Hitchcock. We now know the director's deep obsession with this actress caused her to endure some frightening real life ordeals while working for him. It is interesting to wonder to what degree her personal anxiety contributed to her powerful performances in these two films. She is truly a woman who endured much for her art, and perhaps reluctantly helped her ""master"" achieve new heights.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good nature goes berserk movie.,"This is like the only Alfred Hitchcock movie I have seen, and it is a rather good nature strikes back type of movie. That is the best way to describe this movie as you never really find out why or anything to that effect in this movie, which kind of adds to the charm of it. In another director's hands this movie would probably be rather silly, let's face it, birds on the attack does not sound particularly frightening, but it is here. Also, it is rather bloody for an early 1960's motion picture, it is certainly not toned down or anything. The story is simple enough, a lady is visiting an island or something and while boating on over she is attacked by a bird. This seems only minor at first, but it ends up being the start of something very big and nasty as soon all the birds in the area start to go on the attack. The attack on the school and the attack on the street near the diner being two of the more memorable attacks. The end it gets more into the type of movie where survivors board themselves in a house while the animal that is on the attack tries to get in and at this point the movie weakens a bit. The film is still somewhat good just not like it was in earlier attack scenes. The effects are reasonably good for the time and convincing enough to pass the test. There would be a sequel made years later, but I pretty much figure that one is going to be horrible.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Still the master after so long,"Alfred Hitchcock is still the master of the horror genre, no matter that cinematic effects have vastly improved and the technology available is a far cry from the 60's.

Birds of a Feather...Flock Together,"Hitchcock does it again...he takes the seemingly ordinary and mundane in life like a simple act of taking a shower in Psycho, the familial relationship of Niece and Uncle in Shadow of a Doubt, and, in this picture, the natural, friendly relationship of commonplace birds with mankind - and turns them into nightmarish scenes.  In the Birds, Hitchcock displays his gargantuan talent for creating and sustaining suspense.  On the Californian coast, for some inexplicable reason, birds begin attacking people.  Hitchcok uses this backdrop to showcase the story of a family and a visitor, Tippie Hedren, in the midst of this unnatural phenomenon,  This film is a pleasure to watch because it is so well-done.  Hitchcock's direction is superb.  The work with the birds themselves is amazing as thousands of real ones were used with mechanical ones.  Quite impressive.  The acting is first-rate with Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, and Jessica Tandy in attendance.  Easily my favourite scene is the one when the townfolk are in the diner....talking about the rumours of the birds...and an elderly woman begins to expound on the genial nature of our feathered friends...only to have her words simplicity shattered in moments.

Turkey Lurkey,"I've been trying to enjoy this movie for years. The performances for the most part are good, the costumes, sets and certainly the director are all great, but deep down, this movie seems very sterile and cold to me. Maybe the lack of an intriguing musical score is what I miss. Sure, the scene where the children are signing (part of the ""musical"" score), and Melanie sits down for a smoke is a classic in movie making, and shouldn't be missed. But I get distracted by Tippi. She's good in one scene, not so good in the next, and the rear projections are jarring and so fake looking. I don't know why Alfred didn't keep up with technology and try a different technique. He used rear screen projection in every movie he made, and you can pick them out each time-just think of the motorboat scene in this movie! I've heard all the metaphors before, what this scene signifies, what this phrase really means, etc., but it doesn't necessarily make a good, interesting movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds and me.,"I have nothing but admiration for this movie. While not afraid of it like I was when I first saw it when I was twelve, back then I saw the movie as somewhat prophetic, a ""could be scenario' of the future. Maybe a reaction to the time of my life I was about to enter in to. Nature turning on its cruel masters scenario!! I even thought, with that teenage sense of smug superiority, that we deserved it!!I, of course think differently about it now. Hitchcock is such a master at portraying the futility of human relationships in light of such actions of finality. Mundane everyday things that we think are so important that are swallowed up by some acts of desperateness, ruthlessness or anything else we really have no control over. What does it take to shake us out of our complacency? In this movie, the signs are evident throughout, yet, it is almost too late and the end leaves you thinking, ""Are we still too late? I always wonder, whenever I watch this movie, how we would react? Would we kill all the birds we could, not taking any mind as to the huge environmental disaster that such an action would bring about. Hopefully we would not, but the old nature dies hard when survival is at stake.So in my mind, The Birds is a a modern day morality play. It still has the power to move and still speaks to us. In any disaster, we will react. My question is and always will be, ""How?""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A pleasant surprise that shows Hitchcock's versatility,"A lot has been said about ""The Birds"" already, so I'll just throw in my quirky observations and be done with it. I had never seen it from start to finish, and having seen most of Hitchcock's other films, I was curious as to how it would stand up. I expected not to like it, but I wound up giving it a 7 in the voting booth.I have to echo that the special effects were innovative for the time period. They weren't nearly as cheesy as I expected. The thing that annoys me about later Hitchcock films is his incessant use of backdrops. Hitch hated shooting on location, but after the 1950s the backdrop technique was badly outdated. He should have made the effort to do more location shooting. For example, in the scene in which Tippi Hedron is in the motorboat, we see a real live shot of her bringing it into shore and getting out of it. Why then, if she was actually there in the bay for that scene, did Hitch have to shoot the rest of the boat scene against a backdrop? Oh well.I can't for the life of me see Hitch's attraction to Tippi Hedron. She's a mediocre actress at best, and I find her voice to be nasally and grating. I would have loved to see Ingrid Bergman in this role. Perhaps if she had been cast the writers would have re-written the story and actually made it interesting.The second half of The Birds makes up for the boring, slow paced first half. I never thought of ""Psycho"" as a horror film- I saw it as more of a documentary, a psychological thriller. But ""The Birds"" was truly terrifying. As has been said before, the reasons for this are the lack of soundtrack, the use of ""ordinary"" creatures like birds as monsters, and the tension leading up to climactic moments. Nothing like ""The Birds"" had been done up to that time, and nothing has been done like it since. People were afraid of Martians before they saw ""War of the Worlds"", and they were afraid of sharks before they saw ""Jaws."" Not many people were afraid of seagulls before seeing ""The Birds.""I thought the scene inside the cafe was hilarious. The doomsayer, the angry fisherman, and the elderly ornithologist had me cackling. I don't even know if this scene was meant to be funny, and not a single reviewer other than myself has mentioned it as being humorous. By contrast, I didn't laugh once when I saw ""The Trouble With Harry"", which was supposed to be a dark comedy. I think that what Hitch tried to do there, he got right here.I loved the ending to ""The Birds."" I think its strength lies in its ambiguity. After such a surrealistic story, it was the only ending that was appropriate. ""The Birds"" is truly a unique film, both among Hitchcock's own body of work and cinema in general.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The one indisputable Hitchcock masterpiece,"I have delayed commenting on a Hitchcock film for two reasons; first, so much has been written about them that I seriously wonder if there is anything more that can usefully be said and second, I am probably rare among movie buffs in not placing him at the top among the greatest of directors. That he is a marvellous entertainer and craftsman I would not deny;  indeed there are few other directors whose work I can return to again and again with such pleasure, but his films are all, with two exceptions, surface divertissements and some pretty wondrous at that -""Vertigo"" and Psycho"" for instance.  The ones I take really seriously are ""The Wrong Man"", an intense study, almost documentary in style, of the ghastly consequences of mistaken identity and ""The Birds"" which is so much more profound than anything else in the canon that I wonder if Hitchcock really was aware of the great gap between this and anything else he undertook.  As I feel so passionately about this work it is probably the one to write about.  Any serious discussion of ""The Birds"" cannot commence without clearing away the problem of its widely misinterpreted genre.  Although I can appreciate that there are many with a bird phobia who can hardly bare to watch the film, I would insist that it is not a horror movie.  While every attempt is made to explain the behaviour of Norman Bates in Psycho ( a genuine horror film), the malevolent attacks by the birds on human beings remain a mystery to the end, creating an ambivalence that is more the stuff of the metaphysical than the horrific.  I see ""The Birds as an allegory on the way human beings prey on each other, demanding possession and affection often when it cannot be reciprocated, with the birds themselves surfacing every so often as a sort of Greek Chorus to externalise the inner clawing and tearing apart that humans often do to each other.  As the film has been analysed so many times I won't go into lengthy details, but simply record that it is the only Hitchcock film I would put in the top hundred of all time.  It says something profound about the human condition and was made by a craftsman, who, post ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", had reached the very apex of his career.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Was ""The birds"" meant to be interpreted ecologically?","""The birds"" is in my opinion the last great picture of Hitchcock. It has two themes.The first one is of course the attacking birds. Today we can only interpret this theme in an ecological way. Mother Nature stikes back. This interpretation owes much to the club of Rome and their 1972 report ""The limits to growth"". ""The birds"" was released 9 years before this report, so it remains to be seen if our present day interpretation was meant by Hitchcock. Maybe he just liked the suprise of turning otherwise innocent animals in deadly creatures?Apart from this the attacks of the birds were state of the art cinematography at the time of release. Once again Hitchcock shows that he is a master of suspense and not a master of shock. I am referring to the scene in which Melanie (Tippi Hedren) s quietly smoking a cigarette while crows are gathering behind her back on a climbing frame.The second theme is less obvious, but it is still there. ""The birds"" has something in common with ""Psycho"" (1960, Alfred Hitchcock). In both films a dominant mother threatens amorous relationships of her son. The difference is that in ""Psycho"" the dominant mother is dead and only exists in the mind of her son. In ""The birds"" she is alive and kicking, so changes are still possible. Melanie is every inch a city girl and rather out of place in the fishing town of Bodega Bay (a third theme?). Only when she starts to integrate the mother in law to be becomes somewhat milder.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Let's Talk About Tippi,"From the day ""The Birds"" opened in 1963, Tippi Hedren has been subjected to some very harsh judgment for her acting. Critics were unimpressed. Perhaps they resented an unknown with no acting experience following in the footsteps of stars like Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly. Viewers to this day still insist her performance is ""wooden."" I think they're wrong.Tippi Hedren for me is the ultimate Hitchcock heroine, created from the ground up by the Master who took all the best elements of his former leading ladies and produced his ideal blonde beauty. Just what James Stewart attempted with Kim Novak in ""Vertigo.""Watch ""The Birds"" again, solely for her performance (And to a somewhat lesser degree, ""Marnie""). You can see Hitchcock directing every flicker of the eyelid, every purse of the lips. Lovingly made up, clothed and photographed, she is, as aptly described by Camille Paglia, a ""walking work of art.""",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
more than a bit scary,"It is some time since I last watched this and especially on Blu-ray have found it stunning.

The film really is all about the birds and I forgot that they are in it from the very beginning. It is a horror, of course and it is very scary and a bit bloody which is surprising for a big film and early blockbuster. A little wordy bit with the mother and how she may lose her son but it really is the birds all the time and is so well done. It is brilliant the way that a bird and a few birds and then hundreds of birds can be more than a bit scary anyway. Splendid.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hitchcock once again proves that smart direction can save a sub-par screenplay as ""The Birds"" is not the smartest film ever made, but it is a movie that does just enough to entertain and make its audience think.

He made movies which were ahead of it's time including this one.The story shown in the movie had a lot of potential but the ending in which there was no reasoning was a let down. Also, the story felt incomplete. They could have made a proper story with 2 hour runtime but they focused too much on story build-up only. The movie was enjoyable.

There is thrill and drama which keeps this movie on track.Overall, it is a good horror thriller drama which will keep you bounded till the end but the climax portion may disappoint you.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock in full flight and fright,"Following up an undisputed horror masterpiece like PSYCHO would have been a very hard bargain for almost every other director, but Alfred Hitchcock was not like ""every other director.""  THE BIRDS was the result; and while its special effects aren't up to snuff when compared to the CGIs we've got today, one should keep in mind that THE BIRDS is an early 1960s product.Although sometimes labeled as science fiction, THE BIRDS offers no explanation, scientific or otherwise, for why Bodega Bay, California and its residents and visitors should be besieged by half the avian kingdom.  The performances, particularly by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren, sometimes seem very distant--which is not to say they're bad, quite the contrary.  But it does produce an emotional and psychological chill that hadn't been seen in the horror genre before.It is also clear that, despite its age, THE BIRDS has worn rather well as a movie and continues to be hugely influential.  The nighttime sieges at Taylor's house seemed to have influenced that aspect of George Romero's 1968 cult film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  And certainly this film's influence is clearly felt by Steven Spielberg, whose great suspense thrillers DUEL and JAWS pay homage to the Hitchcock aesthetic.Thus, it should come as no surprise that I rate THE BIRDS a clear 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well Made, But Pointless","I finally saw this movie last weekend at the Tennessee Theatre in Knoxville for their Summer Movie Magic series. This is one of those classic movies that I'd heard of all my life, but had never seen.Now that I have seen ""The Birds"", I must say that I was left a bit unimpressed. The movie is well made, and certainly fits well with the eerie vibe of Hitchcock films. There are certainly many scenes that induce horror and suspense along the way, and inasmuch as that is true, I suppose that this was a mildly good horror film just based on the shock value of its imagery alone.Still, the movie suffers in that it ultimately comes across as pointless. There is no resolution at the end of this film. It simply ends in a way that is senseless. The opening half of the film has a somewhat intriguing plot, but that plot is completely divorced from the rest of the movie. Essentially, birds begin attacking folks. That's it. You never find out why. The characters and plot are completely removed from any motive or rationale for the gist of the film.That said, I've rated this at a six simply due to the fact that it is a well made Hitchcock film, but the truth is that I could have just as easily rated it much lower.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful and Terrifying,"Alfred Hitchcock is arguably the best director ever to make a film. And The Birds is in my opinion his best work, it does something I thought was nearly impossible and beat out Psycho and The Man Who Knew Too Much. The Birds is a magical film adventure that tells the story of a woman named Melanie Danielles who after being on the wrong side of a practical joke goes after the man who did it to play one on him. On her way back from the house she is attacked by a seagull. The man helps her and invites her to dinner. She goes and later they invite her to the mans kid sisters birthday party. At the party the children are attacked by more birds. Later on they are attacked again while at school. Soon The Birds are attacking often and this time are killing as well, and soon they start to take over. This is the fairly simple plot of the Hitchcock masterpiece The Birds. The film does many great things, one is that it never really explains why or how the birds are attacking, that makes it even more scary. The screenplay is also great with amazing dialogue and characters. The acting is also very good, Tippy Hedren in particular is amazing. The direction is flawless, it is perfect. Hitchcock has something he always does. You can have the film on mute and still get the entire story, it is amazing. The visual effects are also surprisingly good for the sixties. Some of them are even very good for today. The Birds is a masterpiece that everyone should see, it is terrifying and bone chilling but most of all just wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
takes too long to start,"Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is a wealthy San Francisco lady who falls for handsome combative Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). She follows him to coastal small town Bodega Bay, and finds him there with his mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and sister (Veronica Cartwright). She rents a room from school teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). Melanie and the town get attacked by birds.I find that Tippi Hedren has an air of entitlement. And I didn't see much in Rod Taylor other than his rugged good looks. I don't feel much chemistry between them. It makes the long setup very tedious. I don't find their courtship compelling although the bird store was kinda cute.It takes too long to get the birds started. The effects look good especially considering the times. It has some excitement, but I don't think it has enough tension. Birds attacking is just not a phobia that most people have, other than bird poop. Once they stop attacking, the birds aren't that scary.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Birds of a feather....,"Bodega Bay is a peaceful community in Northern California. Melanie Daniels has come to this small town trying to outsmart Mitch Brenner, the man who she had met previously at a San Francisco pet shop. Little does Melanie know what she is in for! The first indication everything is not right happens as Melanie, who is returning to the town in a small motor boat, is hit by a flying gull. Mitch, who has followed her, comes to her rescue. Melanie is invited to have dinner that night with Mitch and his family in the house across the bay. Right after dinner, they get a surprise visit through the chimney, when hundreds of birds descend on the Brenner's living room to create panic among them.Melanie, who has met the young teacher, Annie Hayworth, before going to the Brenners, asks her to put her up for the night, since there are no other accommodations in town and she has been invited to attend a party for Cathy, Mitch's young sister. During the celebration, more gulls and even black crows, decide to pay them a visit that upsets the festivity. Right after that, everything turns loose in the small town. The birds are relentless in their attack; it's clear they intend to get their revenge.""The Birds"" is one of the scariest films by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. For the time it was filmed, it proved to be a ground breaking movie of this genre. After more than forty years since its release, the film still delivers because Hitchcock knew how to scare his audience even with the innocent gulls and crows that turn into evil creatures bent on destruction of everything in their wake. In a way, it's ironic, as Mrs. Bundy, a woman who knew her birds explains to the people in the local restaurant, only birds of a specie flock together, never mixing with another type. Also, the vengeful birds are seen in contrast with the tamed love birds Melanie has brought, as a present, for Mitch.The film works because of the genius of Hitchcock. Tippi Hedren is a perfect Hitchcock's ""blonde"". Rod Taylor is also effective as Mitch. Jessica Tandy, though, has the best moments to show her range. She goes from the stern Lydia at the beginning to one of an infinite kind when she realizes Melanie loves her son. Suzanne Pleshette is also good as Annie Hayworth. Ethel Griffies makes a wonderful Mrs. Bundy, a no-nonsense woman who can't believe sea gulls could be hurting people, at all.""The Birds"" is an entertaining film that will be cherished by many Hitchcock's fans because of all the elements that went into it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Fellini's Ten Favorite films,"As Francois Truffaut said, cinema was invented so that we could be shown things like the bird attacks in The Birds. The savage, meaningless idea of it is profoundly existential in a way that even Antonioni himself deeply appreciated. Antonioni admired many things about Hitchcock and Hitchcock was himself inspired by Blow-Up. Fellini, himself, called The Birds one of the most BEAUTIFUL movies ever made (?!) and listed it among his top ten favorite films of all time. Having seen this many times I have come to appreciate the small Hitchcock touches - even in the 'notoriously slow' first hour of the film.Hitchcock was a master of sound and all of his films had a separate and carefully orchestrated sound-script which he closely supervised. This included even incidental sounds, doors opening, etc. It is worth your while to re-watch The Birds with the sole idea of listening to every incidental sound on the track.Even Ingmar Bergman was a Hitchcock fan and lifted a scene from The Paradine Case and reworked it into Cries and Whispers! The relationships of The Birds have a 'Bergmanesque' quality as well and the Bodega Bay setting could as well have been Ingmar's Faro island. The film The Passion of Anna, deftly counterpoints the personal relationship with an unknown outside 'monster' who is killing and mutilating animals. Very much like 'The Birds' in spirit.The great directors have been far kinder to this film than many critics.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Reality Flies Off,"I am not an appreciator of Hitchcock, at least not recently as I wade though reviewings of his work.But this film is different. Many of his films dance on the edge of the surreal, and deal with a person or people swept up in events beyond their control. But here he tips well into another world and does it so artfully that we don't notice. I recall the film being touted as a horror film when first released, but it is not so. Horror depends on reality -- the more likely, the more threatening. Terror is another thing.What is so skillful here is that no one behaves as people normally would, not even close. Yet no one remarks on that fact. Such a notice would be automatic in today's infatuation with irony and self-reference. So what makes this film so intriguing is that it is entirely without irony, non-modern even in the sense common in the 60's. This effect is amplified by the `studio' style of camera-work: stationary cameras and flat sets. Essentially all dialog is indoors.Further: huge mysteries remain at the end of the film, about the cause of the supernatural, about the Oedipal characters, and of course about what happens next. World, people, story are all left open. How intelligent.A side remark: once again in a Hitchcock film, minor actors outshine the main characters. But no matter. The effects, as with the sets, are cheesy, but rather than detracting, this adds to the unsettling unreality of the work.This film is pretty disturbing all around.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Contains brilliant set-pieces, but other important aspects seem lacking","""The Birds"" is an unusual entry among Alfred Hitchcock's oeuvre. Although there are a few psychological dramas such as ""Marnie"" which do not fit this pattern, most of his suspense films feature a hero or heroine who is under threat from a human source. This threat can come from an individual criminal (""Psycho""), from a gang of criminals or terrorists (""The Man Who Knew Too Much""), from the authorities of a foreign state (""The Lady Vanishes"") or, in those films which deal with a hero wrongly accused of a crime, from the authorities of his own state (The Wrong Man""). Sometimes, as in ""The 39 Steps"", the hero is under threat both from the police and from the real perpetrators of the crime of which he stands accused.In ""The Birds"", by contrast, Hitchcock deals with a hero and heroine- indeed, with a whole community- under threat from a hostile nature. It was his third film based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, the others being ""Jamaica Inn"" and ""Rebecca"", although he transfers the action from Cornwall to Bodega Bay, California. The plot is too well-known to need setting out in any detail, but it concerns numerous unexplained violent attacks by birds on the human inhabitants of this small seaside village.This has become one of Hitchcock's best-known films, yet seen as a piece of storytelling it is not very good. Most of the first half is taken up with the growing romance between the two main characters, Mitch Brenner and Melanie Daniels, a wealthy young socialite. The story of their romance is told in the best screwball comedy style- the scene in which they meet in a San Francisco pet shop could be a classic romantic comedy ""meet-cute""- and seems out of key with the later horrific scenes. Only once, when Melanie is hit on the head by a seagull while crossing the bay in a motor-boat, do we get a foretaste of what is to come. The ending of the film is notoriously obscure and ambiguous, leaving too many issues unresolved. (When I first saw the film, having recorded it from the television, it seemed to end so abruptly that I assumed I must have set the video recorder wrongly and failed to record the ending).What makes the film stand out is the series of increasingly violent scenes in which the birds attack, with special effects being used to produce some very scarily realistic moments. As in Du Maurier's story no explanation is given for these attacks; doubtless the director and scriptwriter felt that they would be more frightening if they were left unexplained. Some have inferred that the attacks are a form of revenge for man's exploitation of nature, but this is never stated explicitly in the film itself. There is, however, plenty of evidence for those who prefer this interpretation of the film; a pair of caged lovebirds plays an important role, we hear of chickens being kept for their eggs or eaten, and one individual volunteers the extreme opinion that all birds, of whatever species, should be exterminated.This was the first of two movies which the lovely Tippi Hedren made with Hitchcock, the other being ""Marnie"" from the following year. It was, indeed, Hedren's first-ever film, apart from two uncredited minor roles in the early fifties. It is not as good a performance as she was to give in the later film, but then Marnie Edgar is a much more psychologically complex and demanding role than Melanie, who for most of the time has little to do except to scream and look frightened. (If Hedren's account of her relationship with Hitchcock, as detailed in the recent film ""The Girl"", is to be believed, she was quite genuinely terrified for most of the time while filming). Hedren was a model before becoming an actress, and her performance here is typified by the sort of grace, elegance and ease of movement which one might expect from a former model, but which one does not always get from today's catwalk queens when they try their hand at acting. (No names mentioned). Rod Taylor in his only film with Hitchcock makes a solid, dependable hero, and there are also good contributions from Jessica Tandy as Mitch's possessive mother, Suzanne Pleshette (as striking a beauty as Hedren) as the young schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, and Ethel Griffies in a cameo as an elderly ornithologist.Some would claim classic status for this film, but for me it does not really represent the very best of Hitchcock. There is an instructive contrast between this film and the two which preceded it, ""North by North-West"" and ""Psycho"", both of which I would regard as among his best. Both those films contain memorable directorial set-pieces, the crop-duster and Mount Rushmore scenes in the first, the shower scene in the second, but both are also superior pieces of storytelling, combining suspense with a great plot and satisfying characterisation and, in the case of ""North by North-West"", humour as well. ""The Birds"" probably contains more set-pieces than any other Hitchcock film, but other important aspects seem lacking. At his best, there was always more to the great man than a series of brilliantly directed individual scenes. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fussy Chickens,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sure, I have seen this film many times over the years, but just couldn't miss the chance to see it on the big screen courtesy of Fathom Events and Cinemark. Many critics consider this to be Alfred Hitchcock's last great film, and still others dismiss it as a lark. Hitchcock is known for his sterling career of suspense films, though this one is really categorized as horror.The writing pedigree is beyond reproach as it's based on a story by Daphne du Maurier with a screenplay from Evan Hunter. Dame du Maurier is considered one of the best writers of the twentieth century, and you might recognize Mr. Hunter's pen name - Ed McBain. He was quite famous for his detective stories (including the foundation for TV's ""Hill Street Blues"").There are really two parts to the film. The set-up involves some playful grown-up flirting between lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren). The scene in the pet store is a treat to watch thanks to the banter between two attractive, intelligent, confident people. The tie-in with the love birds for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright) is simple, yet brilliant. The extreme playfulness takes Hedren to Bodega Bay, California via her sleek Astin Martin.Hitchcock includes his common elements of feminine mystique as Mitch Brenner's world revolves around his omnipresent mother (Jessica Tandy), his younger sister (Cartwright), his ex-lover (Suzanne Pleschette) and now a new love interest in Hedren. There are some terrific scenes between Tandy (26 years prior to Driving Miss Daisy) and Hedren, but my favorites are those with Hedren and Pleschette. Pleschette was an underrated actress and is best known for her role in TV's ""The Bob Newhart Show"". Watching her face as Hedren talks on the phone to Taylor is classic frustration from an ex-lover.The second half of the film involves the terror of the bird attacks. Of course, the infamous scene of the kids running down the street being pecked by birds will make your skin crawl, and the scene where Hedren gets attacked in the bedroom is horrific and sends her into a breakdown. I really enjoy the scenes with the townspeople in the café. Some wonderful interchanges as they each tell bird stories. My favorite bird sequence in the film involves the empty playground equipment slowly taken over by birds as Hedren sits on the bench. Great stuff.Another interesting aspect of the film is the cast. Ms. Hedren (mother of Melanie Griffith) is still acting today (in her 80's), though I have never considered her anywhere near the level of actress of other Hitchcock blondes: Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Doris Day, etc. Rod Taylor is also in his 80's now and was last seen on screen as Winston Churchill in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. Jessica Tandy had a long career and is best known for Driving Miss Daisy, and Veronica Cartwright went on to star in such films as Alien and The Right Stuff). The supporting cast is filled with familiar faces including a very young Morgan Brittany (""Dallas""), Malcolm Atterbury (as the Deputy), Ruth McDevitt (as the pet store owner) and one of my favorite actor names, Doodles Weaver (Sigourney's uncle).As you watch the film, you will notice that there is no traditional score. Instead, we are treated to an assortment of bird effects which cue us in to the level of danger. Hitchcock was always a master of guiding the viewer right along the path he wanted. This film has some unusual pacing and a few wide shots that are quite rare for his films. To me, it proves that he was always experimenting, yet with an innate ability to know how the audience would react. A true craftsmen. (www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as Good as the Rating,"I guess the people who give this a high rating are those who have bought into the self-promotion and Hitchcock hype over the years.  The generous rating for ""The Birds"" seems to bear this out.  An interesting ""what if"" premise is spoiled by the incessant lapses in logic and cheesy special effects.The Bodega Bay setting is lovely and the characters attractive, if a little dim.  As is typical with Hitchcock, the pacing is excellent and the shots well framed; and the editing is excellent, as indeed it must be to fake so much of the action.Whatever their ulterior motives, and I have little doubt they have them, the Motion Picture Academy was correct in never bestowing an Oscar on Hitchcock. Most of his films are entertaining, but few of them, such as ""Foreign Correspondent,"" ""Dial M for Murder,"" and ""Frenzy,"" are very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting,"What I love about this film is that it`s so understated . There is absolutely no attempt whatsoever to explain why the birds are turning against humanity , indeed there`s a scene in the cafe where a character points out that bird species joining together to wage war against the human race would be impossible , and the concept is totally ridiculous but Hitchcock and screenwriter Evan Hunter ( Using the basic premise of Du Maurier`s short story - the screenplay is almost totally original ) manage to leave the unsettling thought that this might just happen one day.The film is slightly dated in some ways , most notably the FX which are sometimes obvious back projection , but this was made in 1963 don`t forget . And THE BIRDS does contain some classic scenes like the discussions in the diner , the downbeat ending and the bit where the woman walks into the farmhouse and finds .... no I won`t spoil it for you . I rate this as Hitchcock`s best film .If you want to get your own back then make sure you stuff a turkey this Christmas",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great film but could be better,"I liked this movie. Although, I thought it would be better because my family always said it was great. At first I was very excited to watch it but it turned out not that great. If I could rate it, I would put it a 6/10 because the story was very original but I think that Hitchcock could have done it better than he actually did. I'm still very happy that I've finally seen it because it is one of his most famous films. I love his work. Thank You everyone for reading this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perhaps the only real horror movie Hitchcock ever did.,"Thing with Hitchcock is that he basically never changed his style of film-making. He always kept using this certain '30's and '40's style of film-making, with long set-ups, lots of slow moments and old fashioned type of characters as well. This works for a lot of his movies, though not always too well for some of his later ones. This movie is one of his later ones and perhaps his only truly last great one.Hitchcock was of course the master of suspense but he earned this title with the making of many great thrillers. He's movies often had an horror like atmosphere and build-up in it but they actually were never truly full-blood horror movies. The only movie that comes close to the horror genre as well was the much acclaimed movie ""Psycho"", which he made prior to this film. But even that movie is more of a thriller really, even though it heavily influenced the horror genre later on. With ""The Birds"" Hitchcock perhaps delivers his only truly real horror movie.One of the things you also have to know about an Hitchcock movie is the less you know about it, the better the movie will probably be to you. Hithcock movies often start to head into one direction but then suddenly turn to a complete other. Just imaging going in watching this movie without knowing what will ever happen. The story and the suspense will work out far more suspenseful and surprising.The movie has a bit of a simple story and concept to it. As often mentioned, the beginning is quite slow and the movie often takes its time to build the story, characters and its tensions. It's not slow in a boring in annoying way though, though I could imaging that it's not exactly just everyone's cup of tea.Things start to happen pretty early on already, though it certainly is not until the movie its second halve that things really start to take off. The movie is suspenseful and mysterious but it's not until its second halve that the movie also starts to become tense in an horror type of way.This movie is a real accomplishment with its special effects, in which it really seems like the birds are attacking people. Sure, some of the effects look outdated but you still have to give the movie lots of credit for being creative and some of the sequences are sill amazing and realistic looking. It's being a real original horror movie, not only with its creativity but concept as well.Also quite fun to see Veronica Cartwright as a child in this. I had forgotten she was ever in this. It's a quite big early role for her, though it would still take years for her to finally definitively break through as an actress. Rod Taylor is a good classic hero and Tippi Hedren is the usual great looking Hitchcock blond.A great original, creative and highly effective Hitchcock horror movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sound effects genius behind the film,"I have read quite a few comments mentioning the lack of music in the film so I feel I should make this point. The unsung hero of the film is a German composer called Oskar Sala who worked to compose the electronic score for the film.(see The Dark Side of Genius by Donald Spoto) Hitchcock did not want any music but if you actually listen to the birds themselves their sound is electronic. Sala is now an elderly man of about 90 but is still working occasionally. I was greatly honoured when he composed the score to my short film 'The Box' this year. He is a musical pioneer who developed an instrument called the trautonium. He has worked mostly out of the limelight and the mainstream most of his life but is an inspiration to a lot of musicians. I think the film is extremely powerful because of the lack of music but the birdsound is equally disturbing. It is a simple story that could be handled very loosely in the wrong hands. With some great set pieces and a sense of foreboding, in the hands of Hitchcock it is unforgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Birds Of A Feather?,"OK. Here's the sound of the birds in The Birds... Caw! Caw! Caw!... Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!... Cackle! Cackle! Cackle!... Chirp! Chirp! Chirp! (Ad nauseum)Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, The Birds was the film that followed next after Psycho. And, when it came to the element of horror, I think this film was clearly a giant step down the ladder.This film's preposterous story about common birds, like crows, seagulls and finches, flocking together and deliberately attacking the residents in the town of Bodega Bay (with the intent to kill them) made no sense at all.And the focus on the hot/cold relationship that got underway between Mitch and Melanie only served to turn the whole story into a sappy, 2nd-rate soap opera.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Memorable suspense. One of Hitchcock's best.,The Birds is one of my favourite Hitchcock films and one of his creepiest. A small town begins to suffer attacks by a growing number of birds. On paper it sounds a bit silly but in the hands of a top director this turns into an enjoyable horror.This is a horror film that relies mainly on foreboding suspense rather than copious amounts of gore. And this is delivers in spades. The ominous bird scenes are handled magnificently as are the bird attacks themselves which still hit home today even over 50 years later.The characters are believable if not entirely likable especially the lead Tippi Hendren. Although strangely enough this somehow only adds to the film. The ending is superbly ambiguous leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusion.The Birds is a great film by a great director.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
How Clueless We Are Against the Forces of Nature.,"An absolutely terrifying tale of suspense & horror, an extraordinary achievement in technical filmmaking and a perfect demonstration of how clueless & unprepared we are against the forces of nature, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds remains one of the most under-appreciated works in cinema history & is amongst my top 3 favourite films from this genius filmmaker.Beginning on a relaxed note which only serves as a deep breath before the plunge, The Birds concerns a wealthy San Francisco socialite who pursues her romantic interest to his small Northern California town where things soon take a turn for the bizarre as its entire community is suddenly & viciously attacked by birds of all kinds for no specified reasons.Ingeniously directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the first half is pretty much a romantic tale that nicely introduces & sets up its characters while also slowly but steadily building up its foreshadowing events which ultimately take over the screen like an invading horde and completely changes the mood & atmosphere into a downright terrorizing one.The screenplay is loosely based on the 1952 story of the same name & although the dialogues don't carry that much weight, the events are penned down brilliantly as almost every scene featuring the birds is a tense one. Camera-work is exquisitely carried out, editing never lets the boredom sets in & although it doesn't feature any score, the sound mixing aspect is a revelation of its time.The film marks the screen debut of Tippi Hedren plus also stars Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy & a young Veronica Cartwright. And although everyone chips along finely, the real star of the film is the manner in which Hitchcock really builds up its suspense or handles the mystery element by keeping the entire story highly unpredictable from start to finish.On an overall scale, The Birds is perhaps the final masterpiece to come out from Alfred Hitchcock's cannon and is one of the finest works in the genres of horror & mystery that still hasn't aged a day. It is a remarkable testament to Hitchcock's reputation as 'The Undisputed Master of Suspense' for he effortlessly manages to transform something as beautiful & innocent as birds into one of cinema's most terrifying villains.Worthy of all the praise it has garnered over the years, certainly in need of an even wider audience & deserving to be ranked amongst Hitchcock's finest films, The Birds is an amazingly well directed, smartly scripted, nicely performed & precisely crafted cinema far ahead of its time that not only promises & delivers a thrilling cinematic experience but, with its ambiguous ending, remains an unsolved mystery even today. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Horror
*** out of ****,"Not one of Hitchcock's best, ""The Birds"" is about two people (Tippi Hendren and Rod Taylor) who are in a small seaside town when the birds begin to attack people.  The filmmaking is brilliant, creating suspense with many of Hitchcock's trademark techniques.  The fault of the movie lies in the lack of any substance.  Sure, it is suspenseful, but it doesn't offer anything insightful like ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window"", and the quality of the plot falls short of the likes of ""North by Northwest"".  The two leads are far less charismatic then the normal Hitchcock leads such as Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly.

Intense and Obscurely Frightening,"The master of suspense directed one of the most strangely terrifying films ever made. It revolves around random bird attacks on a bay near San Francisco when a woman decides to spend a few days there. The reason or motive behind these attacks is unknown but the birds show absolutely no remorse.Hitchcock was always great at giving us incredible female leads, and Tippi Hedren's 'Melanie Daniels was no different. You don't even find out a lot about her character, only that she is determined to bring the two love birds to Mitch, a recently stranger turned friend. The film alludes to the fact that the attacks only begin once she arrives on site. But even then we don't truly know the motive behind it all. I didn't find the supporting performances to be all that great, in fact i found the mothers to be a bit revolting at times. The children were also at times obnoxious.The first hour of the film is very calm and reminiscent of a Hitchcock romance but when the attacks begin, they don't let up. The scene at the schoolhouse is iconic and is impossible to remove from your mind. The way Hitchcock shows Melanie's point of view all the way to the hundreds of crows just waiting to attack was marvelous. In what started as a soothing first hour, ends with a terrifying last 50 minutes. Much like every fantasy like story, most people don't believe the attacks are real until they eventually witness the downtown explosions with several people dying. It's then we see one of our favorite characters die and basically all hell breaks loose.Hitchcock did a brilliant job directing the film but i can't quite grip my head around his choice for an ambiguous ending. Usually you take this time to offer either a twist or a huge reveal that alters the viewing experience and pieces the puzzle together. Instead we are left with no answers. Overall, there are several classic moments but the sum of it's parts didn't pay off as much as i would have liked.+Strong Hitchcock female lead+Frightening built up horror+Iconic school scene-Weak supporting characters-Ending7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A near-masterpiece from Hitchcock.,"Suggesting that ""The Birds"" is far superior to ""Psycho"" seems to be considered something of a crime by most Hitchcock fans, but I have to commit that ""crime"". I believe it's superior because it holds up better after repeated viewings. ""Psycho"" loses much of its impact if you're familiar with the final twist; in ""The Birds"" only the shock elements lose some of their power, but that gives you more time to appreciate Hitchcock's complete mastery of his film techniques. His direction is masterful, his pacing is methodical and there are several astonishing, ingenious sequences (the scene where the birds are gathering up behind Hedren is probably one of the greatest in his career).Taylor and Hedren have a warm, believable chemistry as a pair. The job that has been done in the editing and sound-effects department is superb. And the ending has a wonderful apocalyptic quality. This is first-rate filmmaking. Many have tried to attach psychological or metaphysical ""meanings"" to the picture; I find it more enjoyable and rewarding on simpler, less complicated levels. It doesn't have much substance; it's just a flawless horror film and a winning love story, with some nice humorous moments.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Birds of a different feather do indeed flock together.,"The Birds is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screenplay by Evan Hunter from the story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. It stars Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Cartwright and Ethel Griffies. Cinematography is by Robert Burks and editing by George Tomasini.Mother's love? Better to be ditched or loved?When animals attack! The only outright horror movie that Alfred Hitchcock ever directed, The Birds sees the great man get the utmost terror from something so amiable in our lives - Birds! Modern day critics can hark on about it being dated all they like, it still doesn't detract from what a frenzied experience ""The Birds"" can still be - let alone what it did for cinema goers in 1963! Admittedly upon small screen ventures too much is missed or under enhanced, which is a crying shame.But it isn't dark Annie! It's a full moon.Plotting is simple in trajectory terms. Hip socialite Melanie Daniels (Hedren) has a friendly vocal joust in a pet shop with handsome Mitch Brenner (Taylor), the result of which sees Melanie, on a mischievous whim, buy a couple of lovebirds and set off for Mitch's weekend retreat out in Bodega Bay to deliver them as a show of devilish womanhood. Upon arrival in Bodega Bay, though, Melanie seems to be the spark for the birds in the area to start attacking humans, and pretty soon the attacks escalate and intensify...Hitchcock and Hunter offer up no reasons or answers for what occurs in Bodega Bay (to keep it murky we learn late on via radio that other towns become affected), and famously the ending is open ended as well, forcing the audience to unravel ideas themselves. There's no musical score in the film, thus Hitchcock gets the terror and tension out of editing, bird effects and unholy sounds. The pacing is also a key area, it's a good hour before things go decidedly nasty, the wait keeps the viewer on edge, we seriously get to know the principal characters (the actors worked well by Hitch) and then the terror is unleashed. Perfect.Hitchcock's skill at staging a memorable scene is well evident here. The climbing frame that sees one crow arrive, cutaway as Melanie smokes on a bench, back to the frame and now it's four crows, cutaway, back, and five crows - eight - then a ""murder of crows"". The birds first attack at the birthday party, the telephone kiosk, gas station mayhem, the birds swooping into view above the school roof and the POV viewpoint as we join a bird hovering above a town under siege, all great scenes, as is the crowning glory that is the eerie silence that accompanies the edge of your seat finale.Motifs are plentiful, from Mothers to sexuality, from broken crockery - to glass - to abandonment fears, Hitch has fun, especially with the human interactions, or lack of in certain scenes. It's a film that cries out for analysis, such is the director's want, in turn it's a riveting horror picture and a crafty enigma. It sounded daft as a basic idea for a film, and some must have thought Hitchcock had missed the boat of the creature feature boom of the 50s. Yet ""The Birds"" stands tall and proud as a damn fine piece of film from a true maestro of his craft, one of his last true classics and still today, over 50 years after its release, the film provokes theory discussion and visual terror in equal measure. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Perhaps, Alfred Hitchcock's only groundbreaking attempt in his own genre, and it's fascinating.","The Birds (1963) :
Brief Review -Perhaps, Alfred Hitchcock's only groundbreaking attempt in his own genre, and it's fascinating. Having seen almost all the major classics of Hitchcock, I know that he had his own genre. Known as the ""king of suspense/thriller,"" he also made some dramas that are worth watching. I won't talk about the comedies and world war films he made, but I don't remember any groundbreaking or visually breathtaking attempts by him. The Birds must be that one film I was looking for. You know, I kept this film to be watched later deliberately because I know the retro classics from the B&W era cannot be matched. The coloured films were technically advanced, but all the basic theories were cracked in the B&W era only. Yet, Hitchcock had to make one groundbreaking film, not for Hollywood or others but for his own filmography, and I am glad that he made The Birds. I remember watching ""Bats"" on TV several times during my childhood and how frightened and mesmerised I was seeing the world of Bats. That bird has a specific look and cultural impact (Dracula, you know), so it became fascinating. But Hitchcock's birds are so general, yet he managed to create a visually spellbound experience. A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people. The climax didn't make much sense, though. The first attack by birds appears around the intermission point, but the film never looked boring because Alfred kept the romance so intriguing. The second half lifts up the visual appeal and gives you some chills. The special effects may look clumsy now, but they're okay. Rest, from the actors, the writer, the cinematographer, the editor, and the director, everything together put up a gripping spectacle.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suspense landmark,"After briefly flirting with a young man in a bird store, Melanie Daniels, decides to see him again. Her search brings her to a quiet coastal town of Bodega Bay. Inexplicably birds of all types start to pester people and it isn't long before they begin to outright attack in swarms and no one can figure out why...Not many effects and shock based films age well as the audiences definition of shock changes over time. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' from 1930 was the most graphically realistic war film of its time, yet it is seems like a remarkably lightweight next to 'Saving Private Ryan.' Hitchcock, however is often an exception to this unofficial rule. His films are never re-made, just mimicked and even those outright mimic often produce good films - DePalma's 'Dressed to Kill' with it's grisly elevator murder is a clear copy of 'Psycho' but is still a great on screen murder. So Hitchcock doesn't age, he is just continuously appreciated and Brian DePalma borrowing heavily from him has become a fine thriller director is his own right.'The Birds' is a clear example of Hitchcock's unsurpassed ability to get audiences biting their nails. He just lets things happen and sets about showing them in the best way possible. The birds of the title literally just appear and begin to cause hell and the film just shows it almost as if it were happening and you were there amidst the swarm. The film also has groundbreaking sound and visual effect design as virtually all the birds were faked - aurally composed by Bernard Hermann and visually superimposed from many other shots. Today's seamless computer effects show that Hitchcock has plenty of apparent limitations, but he still did a remarkable job. He must have known his limitations since he sets up shots to make them relatively unapparent. He works with what he has and that results in a landmark of the suspense genre. Other films in the same vein, such as 'The Swarm' from the 70s can't lay a feather to 'The Birds.' Also, there is a subtle (actually, in your face!) reference to James Whale's classic monster movie 'Frankenstein' - can you find it?The only thing that is left to be desired is that some of the characterizations seem a outdated by today's standards. But, then again, this isn't a classic because it's new! --- 10/10Rated PG-13 for terror/violence",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Very Good Horror Thriller,"A very good suspenseful thriller from the master of mystery, murder, mayhem and horror Alfred Hitchcock. The plot of the movie is just as you would guess: birds attaching people and the people will do anything to stop the terror. Yet as simple as the plot sounds, the movie is so much better than it sounds like it would be - it's the characters themselves that take the film to a A+ movie level rather than a simple b-rated horror movie.Yes I have experienced birds attacking me in the past. And fairly recently, some birds were attacking my cats because they were trying to protect their babies in a nest - so that in itself give me a basic idea of how truly terrifying it would be if all birds started attacking people as depicted in the film ""The Birds"".This is a must see for those that love horror and thrillers! 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A decent one,"Birds Together StrongThe last of the Alfred Hitchcock's films that I will watch for now. Adapted from the work of Daphne du Maurier who wrote one of my favorite novels Rebecca, the plot was simply about the mysterious attacks from the birds.The first half of the movie was purely setting up the characters while hinting at the looming upcoming attacks from the birds. Honestly I had no idea how spending so much time on developing the characters related to the story of the birds. For me, this part was definitely the weakest because it was unnecessarily long.The movie got better when the birds started their large-scale attacks. Honestly I think that with better technology, the attacks would have more enjoyment and be scarier. Of course, this is not the movie's fault, but it still affected the experience. However, most of the suspense came from before the attacks, where characters had to be careful moving around the gathering birds. This part was good, although I think it can be better.Overall, it's not as good as Vertigo or Rear Window. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tilted Terror,"The narrative here is quite brilliant...the first half is spent building a world through the central metaphor of 'caged lovebirds'. Then it spends the second half turning that on its head by restructuring the perception of the cage.The master, Hitchcock, uses gradual 'tilts' before flipping us...the tilting gag birds in the sports car, the tilted restaurant door's window, the tilted 'God looking down' perspective...small details indicative of the whole, and at the end, we find ourselves completely captivated. I imagine the original critics were just as clueless as the besieged townsfolk. Hitchcock, winking at us all along, exaggerates them as much as he can to make his point.Along the way there is NO soundtrack, and NO gratuitous screaming, heightening the creeping sense of terror (NOT 'horror', a completely different beast...)See this on a dark night for a truly squirm inducing, visceral thrill.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bryan Singer makes a good point,"Bryan Singer (director of X-MEN ) made a good point on The Birds. He mentions that at the end of the film, The Birds win! They are successful in taking over the world. While some feel its a wrong ending without finding out if its a happy ending or not for Tippy. Hitchcock does end it with a powerful end. The Birds win! They allow them to leave the house but not without showing that the humans fear the presents of the birds and that they stand as a force against them. Pure horror where you least expect it. Birds of a feather, they stick together.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nature's Delicate Balance Disturbed.,"The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcocks best known, if not best loved, films. It tells the tale of a small northern California town inexplicably besieged by birds. Or does it? To say so is like saying that The Maltese Falcon is about a statue of a bird.Any literary connection between this film and the Daphne DuMaurier short story is purely accidental. Hitch kept nothing more than the title, and the rest is Evan Hunter's creation. Hunter, part of Hitch's machine, created what became a perfect vehicle for Hitch's vocabulary that had, by this time, become almost cliché.There is the domineering mother, the dutiful son, the salacious blonde, and the slow, gentle descent into terror that only Hitch could weave from these threads. But as with any great story, which this is, one must look deeper to see the true meaning.Consider this. Only when Melanie Daniels arrives in Bodega Bay do the birds begin their attacks, which is to say that her arrival somehow spoils the balance in Bodega Bay. In what way, you might ask. Well, one can't help but notice that Mitch Brenner sees Melanie as someone he might be interested in, even to the point of neglecting his clinging and needy mother. Surely Melanie disturbs the stalemate between Mitch and his former lover, the long-suffering school teacher Annie Hayworth. And, with her big city ways, she is in general a disquieting influence on the town.Nature too maintains a delicate balance that can easily be thrown off balance, just as Bodega Bay is thrown off balance when Melanie breezes in with her convertible, her mink coat, and that pathetic little Edith Head green suit that she wears day after day as the movie progresses. In fact, the first bird attack is on Melanie herself, and for a time the attacks center around her.Once unleashed, however, the force of nature spreads throughout the town. Hitch himself said the central theme of The Birds is Man's unworthiness to have dominion over Nature. As the movie progresses, he reverses that condition, giving Nature dominion over Man. In fact, the small birdcage of lovebirds foreshadows a later scene in which the Brenner home has become a sort of cage with the birds imprisoning the Brenners inside.Having made this point, Hitch seemed to have nowhere to go. The original ending had Mitch, Melanie and crew eventually speeding away in her sexy convertible. The ending Hitch filmed instead was far more memorable, because it is another stalemate, leaving the viewer to wonder what might ultimately happen.This film has aged remarkably well. Having not relied on special effects, which date films so badly, it loses nothing over time. The true genius of The Birds is its slow and almost inevitable slide into a terror that doesn't seem far fetched at all, unlike the preposterous premises for most modern suspense films. Of course, another delight is the powerful cast. Jessica Tandy, Susanne Pleshette, and Rod Taylor are flawless, as is Hitch's masterful touch.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the scariest movies I've ever seen and one of Hitchcock's greatest!,"When it comes to horror movies, I love the genre and I don't usually get scared of horror movies, but MY GOD this was a TERRIFYING experience as a kid! Alfred Hitchcock, the master and the one and only master of suspense and horror has brought us many films and his most memorable and iconic films are Psycho and this film. The Birds is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and I think some reasons for that are that Alfred Hitchcock takes the suspense in this movie very dark if he needs to in certain scenes. There was also no composed score or music in this film which actually made the film feel a little realistic and it STILL terrifies me today! The acting in this film is top notch and the story is pretty solid and I thought some of the characters such as Melanie played by Tippi Hedren and Mitch Brenner played by Rod Taylor were really fleshed out throughout the majority of the film. But for me, the scariest thing about this film is that you don't know why these birds are attacking people. It's just the sense of horror that you feel in these birds when you see them hurting and killing people and it is absolutely TERRIFYING! The mystery behind this film on why these birds are going insane for no reason is absolutely frightening to watch and this has to be one of the greatest horror movies I've seen in a while and it's definitely one of the scariest movies, especially if it's made by a true legend of the genre. I love The Birds. The atmosphere of the film is disturbing and creepy and the movie itself is very scary and it's one of my all time favorite horror classics and i'm gonna give The Birds a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Hitchcock's finest hour,"With so many Alfred Hitchcock classics to choose from The Birds is one of the great master's films you can safely skip. There's nothing in this film to really grab you. There are some nice bits sprinkled throughout but it never really all adds up to much of anything. In the end, it's a frustrating and, almost unbelievably coming from Hitchcock, a downright dull film.The plot, such at it is, in this film centers on a series of unexplained bird attacks in a seemingly ordinary California town. There's a little romantic intrigue, or at least there's meant to be, but that angle doesn't add much to the proceedings. Basically the movie is a lot of talk, very little action. And when the ""action"" arrives it ultimately disappoints. To the modern eye, the special effects used in The Birds appear outrageously amateurish. Many of the bird attack sequences, meant to be fearsomely frightening, instead come off as being rather silly, almost comical. Certainly not the effect Hitchcock was looking for. Meant to shock and terrorize, The Birds does no such thing. The whole enterprise falls flat.There are some decent moments here and there and the cast does the best they can with what little they have to work with. So much of the dialogue seems forced and unnatural. And boy is there ever a lot of dialogue as we sit around and wait for those infernal birds to show up. In the key role of young socialite Melanie Daniels, who sets what little plot there is in motion, Tippi Hedren gives a pretty good performance. Perhaps not up to the standards of some previous Hitchcock blondes (Grace Kelly anyone?) but OK. Playing off Hedren, Rod Taylor gives a somewhat wooden performance as the object of her desire but that probably has more to do with the failings of the script than his own abilities. The rest of the cast does the best they can trying to convince us we should be terrified but it just doesn't work. In the end, when it finally appears the film might be building towards something, there is only disappointment. The Birds is a film which ultimately is going nowhere. And it takes its sweet time getting there. Hitchcock certainly had his share of triumphs. This is not one of them.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blonde Power!,"What makes ""The Birds"" so damn compelling? Of course it skillfully manipulates our fears: its graphic depiction of innocent people getting pecked to death is disturbing, but be honest . . . do humans have a deep-rooted fear of seagulls? I don't think so. Maybe it's because the bird attacks are such an effective dramatization of Melanie Daniels' emotional fragility. But there are any number of symbols -- shattered perfume bottles, broken music boxes, ad infinitum -- that could have testified to Melanie's exquisiteness and delicacy. Why choose screeching winged creatures? Or maybe it's the apocalyptic undertone to the film -- perhaps the brainy old lady in the coffee shop is the equivalent of a mad prophet of doom for our secular age. But why frame the end of the world with a troubled, probably hopeless romance? I think the ultimate message of ""The Birds,"" Hitch's most personal film, is about the destructive power inherent in . . . blonde women.Think about it. A sexy blonde lady comes to a small California town and all hell breaks loose. Wispy, wimpy, towheaded Tippi Hedren represents a threat to Mother that sober, sensible, brunette Suzanne Pleshette could never approach. There is a central clash of symbols in ""The Birds:"" the two lovebirds in a cage, i.e. eroticism contained by domesticity, vs. a flock of violent birds destroying the town, i.e. eroticism unleashed. So even though Melanie Daniels is coming to town to deliver the lovebirds, bringing with her the fragile hope of monogamous bliss, she unwillingly provokes a dangerous and violent response because of who she is. (If you don't get it, just wait until the scene after the birds attack the gas station and the homely housewife screams at poor Tippi: ""you brought them here! YOU! YOU! YOU!"") Blonde women must exist as some sort of archetype in our collective, Jungian unconscious, because time and again they prove to be a menace to the existing order: Marilyn enthralls the Kennedy brothers and could have brought down their administration if she'd opened her pretty mouth; beautiful Diana almost destroys the monarchy and endangers Britain's ossified class system by exposing the shallowness of upper-class English life; Martha must suffer for all of our sins because her blonde superiority makes her the symbol for corporate malfeasance. ""The Birds"" is merely a fictional retelling of the elemental myth of the Blonde femme fatale. I don't know if the word ""bird"" became slang for ""girl"" before or after this movie, but I hardly think it's a coincidence. ""Birds,"" indeed.",,Anonymous,Horror
You've seen it I bet,"While certainly not his best film ""The Birds"" is without a doubt Hitchcock's one film that is most associated with him.Prehaps even more closely associated with him than ""Psycho"" and certainly seen by more people more often than ""Psycho"".While not everyone can tell you who directed ""Psycho"" most everyone will know Alfred Hitchcock directed ""The Birds"".A small California coastal town is invaded by hordes of birds that attack the town in one nerve wrecking wave after another.Of course with Hitchcock it isn't just a straight froward bird attack,it's that but it's also the psychological impact and interactions between the people that Hitchcock deals with under the stress from the attacks.The special effects from 1963 are pretty good.Although some of the flying shots of the birds are obviously transposed in and some of the mechanical birds don't look so great,it still holds up well.The worst part ,in regards to special effects,was when the kids were attacked at the school and run off down the road while under attack.Even as kid I never thought the kids running looked real.They just didn't move their arms or bodies like they were actually running wide open.Years later I read that the kids were actually filmed in a studio running on treadmills and the birds and outside background were added in later.And what can you say about Tippi Hedren? She is one of the most gorgeous women ever on film.She is pure class.I fell in love with her as a young boy watching this film and even today when I see her in this film she is still stunning.Everyone in this film is great for I suppose Hitchcock would have no less.Rod Taylor is a natural in his down to earth playboy role.Jessica Tandy as his mother plays her part as an over protective jealous mother perfectly.Look for Hitchcock himself appearing early in the film.He is the rotund fellow leading the pair of poodles .I suppose this film is more rightly called a thriller as opposed to outright horror but whatever you call it it is one of those classic movies that most everyone has seen ,and better yet,will see again.It is one of those films that I've seen a million times but on a cold winter night with not much else to do I'll gladly watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
That's strictly very good ! (a strictly McGuffin movie),"In 1960 Hitchcock topped himself off. That's exactly the point. He directed three masterpieces in three different genres. A visual investigation: Vertigo. A reference for every action movie (esp. 007 movies): North by Northwest. An horror tale, Psycho, where he reaches the top of what he always tried to do: enthrall audiences.Imagine you reached the top. Then can you go further and not downhill? Fortunately Hitchcock is far from using the same recipes. But what story to shoot now it's over with all that wrong man's stuff? He wants to prove he can play with our emotions once more. The fact it is difficult to show more efficiency than in Psycho is of the utmost importance. He can't. What he can do is experimenting new ways of telling a story. That's why The Birds might look arid as some experimental movies.At the summit of his art, Hitchcock knows he has nothing to account for to the critics. Some of those might have written some time 'That's strictly for the birds'. Easy to say as any critical commonplace. Now look, I'll direct no star and lay the emphasis on the technical aspect. No music but a work on sound effects (today the soundtrack is the very first by-product). For the camera work, the importance is not in the filming of the climax scenes. It's the 'resolutive' shots that follow. What I call resolutive shots is the fact you don't just get in the action and then breath. The follow up impression is much more important.'There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.' That was Hitch's definition of suspense. Now he wants us breathless after the bang too. Psycho already did that, sure (remember Hermann's score after the stabbing violins). Just trying a visual experimentation (perhaps Hitch was kinda jealous of Hermann's contribution to the atmosphere of Psycho and he asked him just to make birds sing). You have two examples of resolutive shots in the overwhelming shot of Bodega Bay after the birds attack and when Mitch' mother comes back after she discovered the dead body of a neighbor.The McGuffin is a great one. Why are those birds attacking us gentle human beings? Hitchcock doesn't dare inventing an other story than just filming a McGuffin. He just experiments that one; something of a sadistic attitude to his audience with no packaging. Spielberg did the same thing in Jaws: why is the shark so bad? We don't care but there's a non-sadistic ending. On the contrary Hitch shoots as if he loves us and then he fools us. No happy ending.So I think this film is for Hitch fans. Strictly. Others would feel disappointed as they are not sure to understand why they've been fooled. And people usually don't want to understand as long as they feel fooled.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some birds have the potential to exterminate the entire human race.,"Birds are not different from human beings.There are as keen on wrecking irreparable damage on people whom they despise as human beings have always made a point to damage minds and souls of other human beings.This is the fundamental concept of ""The Birds"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock.This idea might not appear to be rational to all those who think that birds are innocent souls flying high in mighty sky.If they are really innocent as human beings make them to appear, why is it that not even a single bird other than a parrot is capable of emoting human sentiments.The Birds has been hailed as a horror film as it creates a painful feeling in the minds of people.It is amazing that the feeling of horror is conveyed using real birds.This demonstrates how Mr.Hitchcock was ahead of his times in a world devoid of useless technology.It is such a wonder that ordinary looking birds have fooled devilish human beings who have always felt that birds are nothing but prosaic living organisms who never meant much to human beings.A word about Tippi Hedren.She is a joy to watch as she has been deftly directed by Alfred Hitchcock who has helped her to get over her ""maimed lamb"" persona which was created when she appeared in their previous joint venture ""Marnie"".",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hedren does a good job here, as does Rod Taylor.The lack of a musical score is unusual, especially for a Hitchcock movie. Instead, Hitchcock uses a lot of bird sound effects.I don't think this is one of Hitchcock's better movies, but it is still good and unique. On my recent viewing of the movie, I was shocked to see how the last scene turned out, I really didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, I thought it was going to continue and give the viewer an explanation to the birds behaviour.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Master of the visual medium,"So much has been written about this movie, its hard to know what angle to approach it.The story concerns an attractive, blonde socialite/High society woman who visits a pet shop and bumps into a dashing Dan dare type Lawyer with a biting wit and acid tongue. They flirt and tease and she decides to buy a pair of lovebirds for his baby sister. She makes a surprise visit to his apartment to deliver the birds, finds out that he is on vacation and decides to visit him in Bodega Bay, lovebirds in toe.Calm before the storm.From the moment Melanie arrives in Bodega Bay right up until the inscrutable ending, the landscape is brutalized by a succession of random bird attacks.Volumes have been written on the possible causes.Are the attacks freudian in their revenge? Do they come at times of sexual tension or indifference between the star players? Are the towns folk being divinely punished for their mistreatment of these feathered friends. ""Back in your gilded cage Melanie Daniels"", says Mitch, ""Two southern fried chickens"", an order from the waitress, the birds pov shot above the town looking down on the devastation. These moments could all be nature's revenge, after all there are many references to caging and eating birds in the film.Have we been too complacent about life for too long and have we taken these birds for granted? Is it man's wake up call to treat nature with more respect? Is this all a manifestation of Mitch's sexual frustration and annoyance at his clinging mother who can't let go? Who knows but too wallow and psychoanalyse in this is largely missing the point. The true strength of this picture is in its visual power and assembly of shots. Hitchcock employs so much trickery and gimmickry that you are left feeling that you have just watched a lesson in montage and composition. Static shots are interrupted by movement and the process is repeated. Its like watching an eerie photograph punctuated by forward zooms and then back to the freeze frame. Many angles and points of view are shown. This not only disorientates the viewer but makes for great action sequences and startling imagery.The technical stunt works brilliantly.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Suspenseful as Killer Birds can be,"It's interesting that Hitchcock would choose birds out of all things to make a movie about killer animals. He absolutely does a magnificent job given that it's birds we're talking about here. I mean let's be real, it's no 'Jaws'. The acting and filmmaking is top notch, and I suppose it's considering the strangeness of the phenomenon more than anything. But to find it scary, or really that suspenseful is a bit of a stretch. Unless you have a phobia about birds this really would not be that hard of a problem to manage.The characters of Mitch Brenner and Melanie Daniels I found extremely likable, much more than that bird lady and distraught mother in the diner. The attic scene was the ""really???"" moment for me. However, I'm sure no one could have made a better overall movie with the premise as it was still quite enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beware of our feathered friends!,"The Birds is certainly another highlight in Hitchcock's diary of directing movies after Psycho. He portrays an unusual but terrifying journey where our feathered friends do anything and everything they can to makes lives hell.Many thrillers use extremely ominous background music to heighten the amount of tension and fear, but the lack of it in The Birds is actually more chilling than I would have first thought. The opening titles featured no music either; instead it includes an immense flapping of wings, and was an intriguing and wonderful concept which works extremely well.A credible performance from Tippi Hedren in her film debut, and she certainly proved herself a worthy actress in the lines of Janet Leigh and Vera Miles. Melanie Daniels is a glamorous and easily likable character.The Birds is a masterpiece in suspense and horror, and I have watched it a hundred times. The 32 different shots for the chilling final scene simply showcased Hitchcock's directing ability, but this final cut doesn't answer the question as to why the birds attack. We still have no idea why, and this unanswered question along with many others makes The Birds into an all-time classic. Some questions are just not worth answering, and The Birds proves this point very well...",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Innovative and enigmatic horror film from Hitchcock,"Along with Psycho, The Birds was the other film in Alfred Hitchcock's double horror attack of the early 60's. While it isn't as good as the former, this is still a superlative chiller from the Master of Suspense. For those who don't know, it tells the tale of a young woman who travels to a remote fishing village with a couple of caged lovebirds; immediately thereafter the town is assaulted by the bird population in a bizarre collective attack.One of the chief strong points of The Birds is its sense of mystery. Hitchcock cleverly realized that what makes the film scary is the unknowable motivation of the title creatures. He plays upon the slight strangeness of birds, the way that we can never fully relate to them in the first place. Their subsequent assault is therefore made all the more frightening, as well as seeming plausible. Added to this is the idea that Tippi Hedren's character is somehow a catalyst for the bird attacks. She brings a couple of caged birds to the village and from this point all hell breaks loose. It's really left to the viewer's own judgement if they decide to read anything into this theory, but it is certainly a nice additional angle, and it even is addressed by characters in the film when the towns folk round on Hedren and accuse her of bringing this curse upon the town.Technically the film is full of trick shots. Some are showing their age but you really have to recognize that this is a movie from the early 60's and it clearly was cutting edge and ambitious. I'm not entirely sure, however, about Hitchcock's insistence in shooting characters in a studio to get the right light and then superimposing them in front of the background for external shots. He does this in many occasions here and it is sometimes distractingly false looking. Still, this is a minor complaint.Tippi Hedren is maybe my favourite cool blonde actress that Hitchcock used. For such an inexperienced thespian she really is excellent. Very beautiful and aloof; just what the character requires. Much like Marion Crane from Psycho she has a dark side to her, and she follows a similar path to Crane into the film whereby the story trajectory is such that it looks like it will develop in an entirely different way to the manner it eventually does. The ominous bird behaviour is slowly added into the film until it becomes the film. The attacks themselves are very convincing, while Hitch incorporates the birds themselves into some of his more traditional suspenseful sequences, like where all of a sudden we see the creatures massed on the children's climbing frame, which a few moments previously had been empty. Ever the experimenter Hitchcock also effectively has no soundtrack here. A very unusual thing to do. Instead he got Bernard Herrmann to create a soundscape made up of bird noises. A fairly avant-garde approach, but it works.The Birds is one of the best horror films from the 60's. It's also a great film from Alfred Hitchcock. Either of these aspects should be enough for most people.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Feather In Hitch's Cap.,"There was a great quote I once read about this film "" Enough to make you kick the next pigeon you meet"". Actually that seems a trifle unfair, because the aggressors are mainly blackbirds and gulls, with nary a rat with wings in sight. Of course, if the bacteria-spreading vermin DID put together an army intent on conquering mankind, we wouldn't stand a snowball in hell's chance, as there seem to be more of the little buggers than wasps at Alton Towers during the summer. So it's best to not give them any ideas...Some of Hitchcock's films I think are slightly overrated, but not this one... The scenes of the amassing avian menaces are as creepy as you like, and once the initial attack on poor old Tippi it's suspense and excitement all the way. What make it even better is we're never given a concrete reason as to why these beaked terrors are targeting us. Maybe we're not throwing down as much bread as we used to? Or perhaps it's a protest measure against us keeping vicious cats? (Guilty as charged) Whatever, the fact there isn't a simple solution makes the events evermore scary and nerve wracking.Also, I should mention that I LOVE the slow dramatic build-up each scene has, this is definitely the most believable Hitch I've seen in terms of human interaction. When two people have a conversation, they don't just advance the story... we hear asides, anecdotes and irrelevances. Some people may get bored of this chatter and want to skip to the next sky dive bombing. I, being of slightly more sophisticated stock ;) appreciated the nuances of a very good film that didn't just rely on shock tactics to keep the viewer interested.So overall then, a film for the ages.

Hitchcock at his finest...,"Alfred Hitchcock is considered by many to be a master of suspense, and this becomes evident upon viewing THE BIRDS. While the film itself may not be considered one of the greatest, it is a classic example of Hitchcock's mastery of the art of suspense thrillers.The pacing of this film is its strong point; it is slow and deliberate, and allows the viewer to get a better understanding or 'feel' of the lead characters. One may argue that the buildup is somewhat boring, but it is with this pacing that Hitchcock garners his accolades.Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy perform competently well in a motion picture that drew many snickers form the 'elite' movie-going public. In fact, many dismissed the entire concept of the movie as ridiculous. For this film, Hitchcock takes a relatively unpopular premise and turns it into a classic, and that to me is the genius of the man.The special effects at that time (1962/3) were ground-breaking, and even watching them today, the viewer can't help but get the feeling that the effects take on a rather hauntingly genuine quality, one that adds to the overall feeling of tension that pervades the majority of the second half of the film.The film itself is one that will encourage viewers to use their own intellects to try to determine what really happened, and as a result many different theories and perspectives are formed. As such, it is regarded as one of the more thought-provoking of Hitchcock's classics. On that note, Hitchcock himself has never (allegedly) provided any concrete explanation for the events that transpire in this film, merely stating that if he does so the film then becomes a work of science fiction, and not a work of suspense.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should warrant a place on my Honourable Mentions list. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Underrated script, overrated effects","The thing that struck me the most about this film is its brilliant script. Funnily enough, this is in direct contradiction to a lot of people's perceptions of the film; most find the script to be nonsensical and the characters one-dimensional, citing the suspense and the special effects as the film's strongest points.  While I will admit that the characters (or, indeed, the performances) aren't exactly the greatest I've ever seen in a film, it's the advancement, the mechanics and the allegory of the plot that do it for me.  I hate to echo or copy others, but zetes's 'freudian analysis' of this film (found in the user comments section of this site) was totally spot-on.  The bird attacks were symbolic representations of Mitch's mother's antipathy towards her son's love interests, and seen from this perspective the whole movie makes perfect sense, particularly the ending.Also great is the way the budding love affair between Melanie and Mitch is stripped of its childish veneer when they're faced with real danger. Their relationship never feels fake or contrived to me; even though they aren't the most realistic characters ever put to celluloid, it is clear that the movie is always to some extent a love story.  It's a far cry from the manufactured, crowd-pleasing ""love-interest"" aspects of today's thrillers, and added greatly to my enjoyment of the film.The technical aspects are all good, as can be expected from a Hitchcock film.  The special effects were no doubt marvelous for their time, and the lack of a score gives a realistic atmosphere that adds to the effect nicely (hundreds of birds shrieking incessantly will chip away at anyone's composure).  However, despite being well made, the film didn't have quite the massive effect on me that I thought it would.  Maybe it's my ILM-addled sensibilities talking, or maybe my expectations were just a bit too high going in.  In any case, such gripes notwithstanding one thing is for certain: by any standards, today's or yesterday's, this is good cinema. 8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Two Films,"Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of the famous Daphne DuMaurier novella is really two films: the first hour sets up a flirtation between rambunctious socialite Tippi Hedren and conservative attorney Rod Taylor; the second hour throws the construction aside to concentrate on random attacks on a small California village by flocks of wild birds. Of course, as with Hitchcock, nothing is unnecessary and the relationship between Hedren and Taylor becomes a family unit in order to rescue unity from chaos. Hitchcock's worldview is extremely dour here (everyone--even children--are subjects of graphic torture) and the conclusion suggests a slow impending doom--it's extremely upsetting to say the least. The first hour, however, is talky and dull. There is no musical score but Bernard Herrmann does have a hand in the sound. Disney pioneer Ub Iwerks is listed as a `Special Photographic Advisor'.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really disappointing stuff for a really disappointing movie,"I must confess I always wanted to watch this movie because I saw other classics of Sir Alfred Hitchcock, until I actually saw it. Really, the movie shows what a movie shouldn't ever have: extremely poor special effects and VERY sappy dialogs and situations. The plot seems to make ABSOLUTELY no sense at all: no-one knows why birds attack, if they finish attacking somehow (even at least because they're bored and/or tired). They join, they attack and they just go away no-one knowing REALLY why. Some things are good, however: the camera is quite well used in almost all scenes, and the soundtrack is really good sometimes, but both the script and the production have got a lot of flaws and lacks, something that Sir Alfred Hitchcock should not allow.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie is a classic  Hitchcock .,"Scary and classic  Hitchcock (Vertigo) movie ""The  Birds"" is a movie that I watched years ago and forgot everything except for those mean birds. I just watched it again and found it just as scary,  but also realized that there was no reasonable explanation for the bird's reaction, except that nature is just unpredictable.  I thought that the acting was great. I like Suzanne Pleshette (Rome Adventure) as Annie Hayworth and ""Mitch Brenner"" Rod Taylor (Hong -Kong), and I had not realized until now that Veronica Cartwright (The Witches of Eastwick) was the girl who played ""Cathy Brenner"" in this movie.   Also Melanie Daniels as ""Tippi Hedren"" was Marnie in that movie also by Hitchcock. I thought it was interesting to see ""Jessica Tandy"" (Driving Miss Daisy) playing a cold person such as Lydia Brenner.  Bodega Bay is a quaint little town and a great location, because Bodega Bay was so quiet until the birds started showing up one by one. My favorite quotes: Melanie Daniels ""How did you know my name."" Mitch : ""A little birdie told me.""  Favorite Scenes: Hitchcock's cameo walking dogs. Just sweet!

Amazing,"I am only fifteen years old, and I found this film to be incredible. Alfred Hitchcock should not only be remembered for his classics like Psycho, but also this this film that can only be described as....amazing!The start, I'll admit, is very slow. It takes a while for the whole story to get going, but once it does, the camera angles capture the birds in a unique way.This film was not so much scary, more creepy. The timing is so precise in every Hitchcock film. The audience is more scared by waiting for something to happen, than when it actually does. Rating=4/5P.S. Does Hitchcock cameo at the start, when the man with the two dogs leaves the building, just before the lead female enters?",,Anonymous,Horror
The Master of suspense indeed. what a picture,"When Melanie Daniels (Hedren) visits a mysterious man in Bodega Bay, she and the townsfolk are struck by the vicious nature of the local birds.3 years had passed since Alfred Hitchcock had sat in the director's chair for a horror film and in that time there was outstanding reviews for Psycho, the horror of a lifetime. That 1960 release was widely publicised and so there was a lot to live up to in 1963 when The Birds was released, and as usual for the British director, he knocked us over once more.Psycho was a shocking wake up to the realisation of human madness and Hitchcock again gains access to a concept of realization in this horror by depicting what many would assume as normal well mannered and beautiful creatures, and adds a horrifying viciousness to the birds to give a sharp and tantalizing story that will grip and shock you right till the claustrophobic and nerve jangling finale.The film begins, as usual for the legendary director, with a wonderful montage title sequence. We see a flock of birds acting unusually as the credits roll. It is a complete beautiful blur of wings and fighting with the screeches unmistakable and the juxtaposition of sound and motion gears viewers up for the horrific adventure to come.After another wonderfully cheeky cameo by Hitchcock we are introduced to central character Melanie who, after a flirtatious debate with a strange good looking man, uses her influences to track him down. As the stunning Tippi Hedren makes her way to Bodega Bay with a surprise install for Taylor's Mitch Brenner, Hitchcock delivers a wonderful car driving montage again. If not as springy as those in Vertigo but the feeling of anticipation is nailed down. If you haven't seen the Birds yet and have read reviews, you will feel the same wonderful excitement I felt to, and it is definitely worth it.Hitchcock after all is known as the master of suspense and one of the main reasons why this film works so gloriously is the fact the tension and surprise is built up in such a constructed free and significantly realistic way. What starts out as a minor attack on a boat turns into a town spread panic that generates tension and horror of the utmost brilliance, the suspense and anticipation is brilliantly priceless.Of all of Hitchcock's films, The Birds is surely one of the best filmed. To create the shots of the animals sitting on the climbing frames at the school, to have them all swooping down the chimney, it is simply breathtaking film-making and as a viewer, you feel rewarded and treated to this suspense and appreciation of horror and the unnatural.Once the birds attack there is never any let up in suspense as the characters try to find solutions and look for any way to survive and as in true Hitchcock fashion, he delivers a smart horror that generates realism with a swooping and smart depiction of the nature of the winged creatures that will shock and scare right till the end. Excellence.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
satisfying,"This movie was great and enjoyable,because the movie maker, Hithcock himself, produces an amazing suspense which will amaze you. The plot is based on a pathetic love story which involves Mitch and Melanie. Some stereotypes are very visible for instance : Melanie is weak, and Mitch is a kind of hero in this movie, he is indeed The Husband. However, an attack of birds is creative and original compared to the other typical horror movies, which is a good point. The story is a bit boring, and it ends up going nowhere, especiallly considering that the end is very disappointing.We advise you to Watch this movie if you enjoy suspense and old-fashionned movies!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hitchcock proved to us in ""Psycho"" that even a low-budget horror film can be art. The same applies for his deservedly famous creature feature ""The Birds.""","Alfred Hitchcock was the master of the thriller genre. He invented techniques that to this day are used by other filmmakers (though not to the same level) to stimulate excitement and dread in the hearts of the audience. And Hitchcock was willing to try anything new. By 1963, Hitchcock had made just about every kind of thriller he could. He'd made his sheer suspense thriller ""Rear Window."" He'd made his nonstop, lighthearted thriller ""North by Northwest,"" his psychological thriller and ultimate masterpiece ""Vertigo,"" and of course, need I say it, ""Psycho."" What else was there for him to try in the genre but a creature feature? The film he made was called ""The Birds,"" and it is a richly complex thriller that, despite its flaws, reaches the level, I say, of being a masterpiece on the same tier as the films I just mentioned.""The Birds"" starts out not with an attack by a creature, but setting up the human story, a bold and efficacious move of storytelling. Tippi Hedren stars as Melanie Daniels, a San Francisco playgirl who travels to a small coastal town in northern California in order to pay a mischievous visit on the lawyer (Rod Taylor) who humiliated her. After she arrives in the town, strange incidents involving birds of all species begin to take place and before long, Melanie as well as the whole town begin to realize that birds have started an attack on humankind. And the most horrifying thing is, nobody can find out why.Now in plot ""The Birds"" sounds corny and unbelievable. But like I've told people many times, plot is just an attention-getter. It's the story that matters and ""The Birds"" works on that level. Hitchcock was always a director to break conventions and he does that here. Instead of opening up with a clichéd scene like a bird attack, he opens up with our human story and works that well into the first hour of the picture before the attacks really start coming furiously. And this human story, most notably the relationship between Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor and their mutual friendship with a somewhat unhappy school teacher wonderfully played by the late Suzanne Pleschette really gets you involved, much more than you would expect to be in a movie of this genre. What else is daring? Try the fact that there is no music score. Bernard Herrmann is credited, but only as a sound consultant. And of course, there is the fact that not once throughout the whole picture is it explained directly to us why birds have all of a sudden started a war on humankind. That's a bold and surprisingly effective move than if Hitchcock had opted to go with a tired old scientific speech to further the fowl plot and extend running time. Tippi Hedren and the cast are very good in their roles and help translate the dialogue into the personalities of three-dimensional human beings. I believed and liked these characters, most notably the one played by Suzanne Pleschette, and that really got me involved when their lives were threatened.As a thriller, ""The Birds,"" of course, scores with excellence. Hitchcock at first just introduces little shocking moments to get us stimulated and then, when we know that there's a danger, he again goes with his suspense theory, where the buildup is long and drawn-out and the actual moment of the threat is run through quickly and there are some genuinely scary moments in this motion picture. Only a director of Hitchcock's status could make seagulls and finches and crows into some of the most frightening cinema villains, who scare me a lot more than say the modern-day slasher villains that try to become Norman Bates. ""The Birds"" utilizes some very good graphic effects to insert birds and human actors into the same shot and the composition is very good. There is a flaw in one scene, where a colony of birds flood into a house through a chimney and we can see palm-sized pheasants fluttering about in the shots, clearly a lot smaller than they would be, but that's a minor detractor. Hitchcock also keeps the level of horror under control by not pouring out fountains of blood, but using just enough of it to get a reaction from the audience.""The Birds"" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and that's why Alfred Hitchcock is still one of the most popular directors of all time. He made great, original movies, but he made them for the audience and he wanted them to have fun. And ""The Birds"" is a lot of fun. Now if you've had problems with the way Hitchcock chose to end his movies in the past, you'll have your biggest fit with this one, but I implore you to try not to and enjoy the movie. This is Hitchcock's creature feature and one of the best I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock's last true classic,"Tippi Hedren plays a blond with an unhappy past and Rod Taylor plays a small town lawyer who has thing for her. After he plays a small prank on her as retribution for a prank she pulled a few months earlier, she shows up in his town looking for him to return the favor. They begin a mild courtship after a bird attacks her and she gets to know his mother and sister (though Rod looks old enough to be her father). As time unfolds, the birds attack again and again, no rhyme or reason other than Miss Hedren is in town.Features the usual Hitchcock doses of suspense, dysfunctional relationships between a man and his mother, and a beautiful blond. Though Miss Hedren isn't quite as engaging as Eva Marie Saint or Grace Kelly, she's does alright (it was her first film after all). The mother is strangely sympathetic when compared to a few other Hitchcockian mothers.The little sister later appeared as Lambert in ""Alien"".This would be Hitchcock's last true classic, and last hit from a box office standpoint. While his subsequent films certainly had their interesting points (though TOPAZ was something of a low point for him), Hitch's craftsmanship would slowly begin to deteriorate and he never again quite achieved what he achieved here and/or what he achieved in his other earlier films.

Menacing Birds,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's Hitchcock movie review is The Birds (1963) where the film starts off with a possible romance between the two leading characters. What happens next is a huge flock of birds start to reign chaos on a small town named Bodega Bay, near San Francisco. What gets you in this flick is not the actual birds attacking but the sound of these birds, the high pitch as they are above either children or just kicking back, preparing for an attack. The scene where the birds (mostly crows) are summoned by the nursery rhyme sung by the children which is echoed to the school playground from their classroom is chilling and stunning considering these are real trained birds with no CGI. However, you have no idea what draws the birds and turns them bad and it seems that nobody else does either. The flick provides no answers as to why these birds attack and there is one scene in the local diner where an old lady pretty much states there are billions of billions of birds in comparison to the human population and there be no victory and no escape, if the birds decide to take over. Tippi Hedren, plays Melanie Daniels provides a stunning and courageous performance. The fake muck-up birds you see in the film is when they dive-bomb into window panes and peck at the door. There are so many characters in the diner scene which you do not see progress which is a shame in particular the old lady with the bird knowledge or as it is called in the flick ornithology and the town drunk who quotes Ezekiel along with ""It's the end of the world!!!"" After the diner though the story rushes through and has a non-resolution, which is fine but creates the entirety of the movie uneven. Even the romantic story between the two leading characters is dull and not interesting. How Melanie suddenly fell in love with this guy or why she goes through so much trouble to do what she does is never explained other then she is a pranker. Also, what is missing again is the key question, why did the birds attack? This is not explained in the movie even if there mention about dead chickens and bad birdseeds, which could have caused the attach. Does that have anything to do with the birds' behaviour due to what humans have done? None of this is ever answered. Overall 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
this is a horrible t shirt,the birds by Alfred Hitchcock is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. to start of the movie is not realistic because the setting follows the story of two people and when the girl basically stalks him. when he invites her to his little sisters birthday party they get attacked by birds. i know even though this movie is old the graphics are so bad. you will say to yourself yep thats a green screen and it takes away from the horror. the actors themselves do a terrible job acting they don't even make the performance convincing. out of all the movie was so bad and i don't recommend anyone go see this movie. in the end i wish i could have ended up like the farmer in the beginning of the movie with no eyes at the mercy of the birds,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leaves one question in the air: «What if birds turned against us?»,"'The Birds' is one of the highest achievements by The Master of Suspense. It's a strange but interesting movie. It combines suspense and horror in a classic but fascinating way.However, it isn't just some suspense/horror film. It is very original and unusual. In this motion picture, the birds turn against humans. Apparently, this movie made many people fear the birds after watching it. I don't believe this could happen in real life. I mean, I know that birds can attack when they are messed up with or when they feel threatened but I don't believe they'd attack with no reason, much less entire crowds of birds.Nevertheless, this is what could happen if birds declared war against humankind in real life. The movie is triumphant on this. What it lacks is an explanation. The movie is nearly 2 hours long and it just ends without explaining why did the birds attack people. Was it revenge? Some kind of mental disease or virus? We don't know.While I wouldn't exactly get ""bird phobia"" because of this film, it somewhat makes one look at birds differently. I even remember once coming near some construction near the sea and I realized there were a cup of gulls standing on its roof and it was a bit creepy - it made me think of this film, particularly the scene when Melanie is on the school yard sitting on the fence near the playground, smoking a cigarette and we see behind her a bird flying to a jungle gym and then more and more birds show up until the whole playground is full of them.The birds of the film are mostly seagulls, crows and ravens (they're the ones that viciously attack) but there also parakeets (hilariously called ""lovebirds"" in the film). The parakeets never do any harm, but they get crazy in some scenes.The film takes place in Bodega Bay, California - which is almost like the apocalypse with all those birds attacks. Many of these birds attacks are impressing, including those which children are attacked at school. Besides, the loud sounds of the birds are brilliant and accent the atmosphere: both the sounds of them ""yelling"" (they are well know for being noisy birds) and the crazy sounds of them flapping their winds.As for the cast, the best ones are Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels, Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner, Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner and a very attractive Suzanne Pleshette as the teacher Annie Hayworth.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Visceral Terror and Freudian Psychodrama Meld Seamlessly in Hitchcock Masterwork,"I remember as a child in the late 1960's watching this Alfred Hitchcock masterwork in the darkened family room and being terrified awaiting the next bird attack. It was great, and to my pleasure, it still is. Now that I am far more familiar with Hitchcock's filmography and realize the gamut of sophisticated drama and thrilling suspense he created in his long career, I think 1963's ""The Birds"" is far and away the wonderfully visceral experience he produced on screen. The film is one part allegory on man's impudence over nature and one part family psychodrama full of unresolved feelings, and the two parts work seamlessly together thanks to Evan Hunter's shrewd screenplay. Hitchcock recognizes that more than the technical effects he amassed to simulate the surreal, bludgeoning bird attacks, the actual storytelling is what drives the plot.Although the birds provide an ominous presence from the outset, it starts with a flirtatious, love-hate romance between spoiled socialite Melanie Daniels and insolent attorney Mitch Brenner. Seeking but failing to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his little sister Cathy, Mitch travels to his family home in the friendly hamlet of Bodega Bay north of San Francisco. Motivated by her attraction to Mitch, Melanie goes up to leave the lovebirds secretly at his home, but oddly, a seagull attacks her as she pilots a boat on the bay. This is the start of what becomes a series of attacks that increase in scope and terror, and what I appreciate about Hitchcock's style is how he manages to build to them gradually, almost nonchalantly until the moment of strike when he lets the birds take over the screen. Equally intriguing is the way the characters are presented, especially Mitch's subtly dysfunctional family, and react to the attacks.In a surprising twist, Hitchcock eschews the glamorous stars he usually casts for the leads, though ironically the journeyman-level contributions of Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor seem to work in the film's favor as they don't distract from the allegorical storyline. Taking over for Grace Kelly, Hedren manages to exude the sophistication if not quite the complexity of Melanie. As Mitch, Taylor has always been a lunkish presence on screen and barely charismatic enough to elicit such fervent behavior from the women around him, but he manages the heroic sincerity necessary in the role. Far better are Jessica Tandy, who sublimates her natural likability to play Mitch's controlling, needy mother Lydia, and a sonorous Suzanne Pleshette as repressed schoolteacher Annie who still longs for Mitch despite Lydia's objections. I also love Ethel Griffies's bit as the elderly ornithologist who happens to be there to explain the genesis of the various bird species.Even though the matte shots look dated compared to today's seamless computer animation, the effects are still startling, and some scenes are developed brilliantly, in particular, the schoolyard accumulation leading to a direct attack on the running children. There are quirks that are a bit frustrating for their artificiality - heavy use of back-screen projection, the predictable behavior of stereotypical town folk - but none of this detracts from the superb craftsmanship and breathless pacing toward the apocalyptic ending. There are several extras included with the DVD, the best being the looking-back documentary, ""All About The Birds"". This represents grand execution by a true master.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Hitchcock masterpiece,"A Hitchcock masterpiece from beginning to end. The escalating suspense to the bleakest ending. Every single second in these Hithcock films remains faithful to the entire concept. He was obsessed with birds and here we have them take over Bodega bay, their revenge on mankind. And they succeed. I love how his films start in one direction, like with Psycho, and then at some point take this tangent into an unimaginable direction for the leading characters in our film. The closer one examines this film the more one realizes how frighteningly excellent it is. The birds is an all time classic I could watch again and again. It must have taken a hell of a lot of patience to make such a film back then when there was no computer to aid special effects. And yet now today that we do have all the equipment, I can't think of who has the capacity to come up with a film of such a high calabre of genius. I would not be in the least bit surprised if they make the remake of this sooner or later. They have already done Psycho again unnecessarily.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dated and Overrated,"Unlike 1977's Day of the Animals which is cheesy enough to be funny but also satisfying in its wildlife attacks on deserving humans due to "" a hole in the ozone layer"" The Birds is slow moving, overly serious and the attacks are neither scary nor satisfying since they really don't make sense at all. People die at random, including a couple of characters who are basically extras since we know nothing about them except that they're dead, and only one character who we're encouraged to care about in supporting cast named Annie falls victim to the attacks.Furthermore, all of the main characters are unlikable people including star Tippi Hedren who plays an obnoxious and arrogant Paris Hilton type of character (she even physically looks like her, it's weird) and when she is almost fatally attacked at the end, it's completely due to her own utterly inexplicable stupidity.The bird behavior, which is scientifically impossible, is also never explained at all. It just comes and goes in waves, and the birds are intent on killing to the point of breaking windows and literally performing home invasions. I can see how this would have scared people in 1963 and still might frighten children or scientifically illiterate adults who have a phobia of the great outdoors.I can tell it's Alfred Hitchcock because of the quality of the writing and storytelling...and yet the soap opera level of drama doesn't seem justified since none of it makes me like any of the characters even a tiny bit more. The only innocent character is an eleven year old child named Cathy and a pair of caged lovebirds who inexplicably remain totally docile throughout the entire film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock at his best,"1960 saw the release of Psycho, Hitchcock's signature work, but Psycho is not the only film that people think of when talking about his work. The Birds, made three years later, has a warm place in film fans hearts and a much larger fan base than people seem to think.I know more people who dislike Psycho compared to those who like The Birds and I feel that this is most defiantly Alfred Hitchcock at his best. Rear Window and Vertigo are also up there but this film offers the right blend of shocks and a disturbing sense of dread, that makes it accessible by many, whilst still being fun to watch.The birds have turned. Nature is taking her wrath upon man for a brief moment, but the sheer scale of the idea that nature could turn on us is a primally frightening concept. I do feel that this was the vain in which M. Night Shyamalan's dismal The Happening was attempting to tap into decades later, but Hitchcock got this right first time, for all time.The effects are dated but their impact is still strong, as the ideas are so pronounced that there's little need to show anything. The acting is decent and the direction, though not as perfect as many would argue for Hitch, still doing the job well. This is a timeless and more accessible Hitchcock classic than Psycho, yet often dismissed and I wonder why?Both films are clear genre pieces and are still being drawn from today. This is a textbook thriller with a natural twist and a dire tone.

Still packs a punch,"Alfred Hitchcock's nightmarish tale about the avian-world inflicting a terrible vengeance on their human tormentors.Rod Taylor stars as Mitch Brenner, a bachelor lawyer.The story begins with Brenner having a fractious encounter in a San Francisco pet shop with Melanie Daniels, a chic but haughty young woman, played by Tippi Hedren, Hitchcock's latest hunk of blonde ice. Clearly smitten by the handsome attorney, the woman follows him to his home in Bodega Bay, an idyllic fishing hamlet north of the city to give him a peace offering of two love birds. However, her arrival with the captive livestock in tow seems to trigger a hostile reaction from the local feathered population.

Taylor, in his prime, looks good and makes a powerful and comforting protector in life-threatening circumstances.Although the pedestrian script by Evan Hunter (based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier) doesn't provide any real scope for the cast, the performances are still excellent.

Our Feathered Friends,"""THE BIRDS"",Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic,is my second favorite film by the Master of Suspense (""Psycho"" being the best,of course). Spoiled rich girl Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren,looking as beautiful as the radiant Janet Leigh did in ""Psycho"") follows potential boyfriend Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) to Bodega Bay,California,a small fishing village near San Francisco,where our feathered friends begin to viciously attack the town's denizens. The supporting cast is excellent: Jessica Tandy as Mitch's clinging mother Lydia,Suzanne Pleshette as local schoolteacher Annie Hayworth,and a very young Veronica Cartwright as Mitch's kid sister Cathy (Hitch's screenwriting collaborators always created rich characterizations). The special effects,for the time,were very impressive,and Hitch's direction of the bird attacks is superb. An interesting note: upon viewing the movie again recently (I try to watch it once a year),I noticed that there is no musical score...the sound effects are strictly confined to the birds!

Her character didn't make sense to me which made her very disdainful. She did a series of actions that left you wondering, ""Is this the behavior of rich girls? San Francisco girls?

HOW MANY PSYCHIATRISTS HAVE SEEN THIS ONE!,"A good question, your honor! Prior to this classic exercise in paranoia, we devout Hitchcock enthusiasts had to deal with the fear of taking a shower a la PSYCHO! Now it's THE BIRDS! But what can you do! Hitch was not called the master of suspense for nothing. And aren't we all, deep down inside, thrill seekers at heart, in one way or another? Truly, this is the perfect example of a story that nightmares are made of. It has also been long argued that it is partly factual, as birds most certainly DO have the upper hand on all of us! At least check your windshield every morning, right? This is a MUST see, but most definitely not for the faint of heart. The most bitter pill in this masterpiece, and Hitch surely gave all of us, if not his characters, some bitter pills to swallow, is the absolutely beautiful scenery and island landscapes, soon to be turned upside down. Extremely well acted, though my vote goes to Suzanne Pleshette as the school teacher who truly is a victim of circumstance, in more ways than one. And she is gone way too soon. A film that can be described as a contemporary horror, and yet with such dramatic elements, not to mention the psychological footnotes on human nature! It's all here, and could only have been pulled off so masterfully by Hitchcock. See this one if you can afford it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best horror thriller of all time,"This is a flawless film made by Alfred Hitchcock. The trademark camera-work of Hitchcock, namely the use of camera movement that mimics a person's gaze, forcing viewers to engage in a form of voyeurism, is used again and again in the film, and really gives the audience an authentic feeling.The sound editing and the visual effects are perfect, in the sense that the birds attack looks utterly real. Tippi Hedren delivers an impeccable performance on her screen debut. The directing is just amazing in terms of slow build-up and suspense creation.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Pretty good, but also a little too long","A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds suddenly begin to attack people.It sounds silly, but it does kind of work. I personally don't think this is one of Hitchcock's better films, but it's still pretty decent, and worth at least one viewing. The film's pacing is at times glacial, but it's worth sitting through for the iconic bird attacks, some of which are still sort of scary, even if the visual effects aren't too impressive anymore. Still, I like the ending, as well as the fact that the film succeeded in making fairly mundane-looking birds pretty damn scary, but I just wish the film was about twenty minutes shorter- it's about two hours long, and at points you can really tell. (Just to let you know, I'm fine with two hour plus movies if I feel they justify their length, but The Birds is pretty much a B-movie with solid acting and A-grade directing and effects (for their time)- it really doesn't need to be longer than 100 minutes in my opinion). 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interesting take on horror and romance.,"I feel as if this film is not truly a horror film, but a romantic movie in a horror body. The storyline is about guy and girl meeting and slowly getting together, while on the coinsidence the birds starts to attack people and interfiere. The special effects aged fantastically except for the scene in which sparrows invade the house. The thing which was really disappointing is the ending, the movie just ends. There were a few alternative endings planned which I think are much superior.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Endless thrills are masterfully constructed by Mr. Hitchcock,"There is a reason Alfred Hitchcock is nicknamed The Master of Suspense. The Birds is a film that proves this title oh so well. It was released back in 1963, yet 48 years later it is still terrifying. It's the story of Melanie Daniels as she pursues a handsome San Fransico man named Mitch to his hometown of Bodega Bay. Upon her arrival the birds of the town start to act strangely. They begin to randomly attack people very sporadically. The attacks grow increasingly vicious and what started as an attack by one bird here and there becomes massive attacks from gigantic flocks of birds. You could never predict a movie about killer birds to be so terrifying, yet The Birds will prove you wrong as you will never look at a crow the same way again.This is a movie that you really have to give a chance despite a few kinks in the beginning. Well, I honestly wouldn't call them kinks, just necessary ground that must be covered. The film starts off pretty slow, with a lot of mundane activity. The movie starts out very average and very normal and its easy to get a little bogged down. But after an hour of set-up and creeping suspense building everything pays off. When the film finally kicks in to full gear you realize the necessity of the somewhat dull first half of the film and it is completely worth it.In a lot of older horror/thriller films I'm able to pick up what is supposed to be scary, but due to my desensitized nature I'm not actually scared by it. The Birds is a completely different story, however. This film is truly terrifying. The technical prowess of this film is astounding and it all works towards a goal of honestly scaring the living hell out of you. Hitchcock directs with such thrilling brilliance that you can't take your eyes off the screen during the harrowing bird attacks. He also employs a sort of blue screen effect to fill the screen with angry birds swirling around in a raging mass. Then of course he adds fake birds for the actors to interact with and, allegedly, real birds.But where the real thrill comes from is the sound. The spine tingling sounds of angry birds squawking and screeching adds uncanny amounts of thrilling effect to the film. The sound is edited together to achieve maximum chills, and it definitely achieved its goal. The bird attack scenes are just so powerful and so disturbing that you feel like you are in the midst of it all. The film boasts some masterful editing and ingenious direction that creates some of the most suspenseful, as well as strikingly terrifying, moments imaginable.While the first half of this film is dull yet necessary, the second half does everything possible to make up for a slow start and The Birds ends as a powerful thriller that is incredibly memorable. Alfred Hitchcock is nothing less than a filmmaking genius, and the thrills provided by The Birds during the film's second half proves that all too well. This is a film that sends chills down your spine and will thrill you to the end, especially with one of the most haunting final shots in cinema history.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Arrival of the Birds,"Needing no introduction, Alfred Hitchcock gives us yet another solid, enigmatic and deeply influential work for horror cinema. ""The Birds"" (1963) stands out for presenting an unusual ""antagonist"" for its time, portraying birds as agents of evil.The plot proves to be innovative for the period, inaugurating a wave of productions where animals take on the role of villains, this being one of the first to adopt such an approach. The protagonist is charismatic and well developed, which contributes significantly to the progress of the plot. Despite the technical limitations of the time, the film displays well-constructed scenes of tension, and when it comes to special effects, the film does not disappoint, highlighting the commitment that went into creating the scenes involving the birds. The outcome presents an ambiguous ending, without a clear explanation for the events, which may displease some of the public.Ahead of its time, ""The Birds"" maintains its relevance and excellence. Although it influenced a wave of trash films with animals as antagonists, it is fair to say that the work remains one of the best within this theme.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't look up or down, birds fly amok! As it's wing flying terror in Hitchcock's visual masterpiece.","I've been a big fan of Hitch over the years I especially admired his master suspense work in ""Psycho"". And finally after many years I viewed ""The Birds"" for the first time and I must say that for it's day the film was a visual and mechanical masterpiece a well done work. As many of the scenes just all of a sudden start you with fear that's unexpected like the flock full of birds on the school playground and the quickness of the birds flying from the sky to peck a victim! Set in San Francisco a wealthy and attractive single lady Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren a beautiful screen lady for her day)decides to follow the path of a prospective lover a powerful man attorney Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor)to his northern California home on the island of Bodega Bay. Upon arriving to his home on the other side of the sea past a little schoolhouse with two love birds and her meeting of his daughter and mother, Melanie plans to stay right up.Slowly and one by one when the residents look up they notice the sky above is different as Melanie can remember from her San Francisco days a flock that looked familiar, it's like these birds flew north for her venture! The scenes of the bird attacks and gatherings are master works for Hitch as his camera use put the audience in terror. The mechanical birds worked to a perfect fit to bring terror and blood to the humans of Bodega Bay! Overall not Hitchcock's best, but effective as it made us think to take cover the next time we saw a bird no matter if it was up high in the sky or down low on the ground!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tangled Relationships in a Suspense Thriller,"The Birds presents a story of a young woman named Melanie Daniels, played by Tippi Hedren, who pursues a handsome stranger played by Rod Taylor, as Mitch Brenner, to an outlying fishing village north of San Francisco, where she encounters an unusual phenomenon of birds attacking people.Aside from the main story, we find some interesting characters in the village: a young school teacher named Annie Hayworth, played by Suzanne Pleshette, who left San Francisco to be with Mitch and never returned and Jessica Tandy, as Mitch's mother Lydia Brenner, who delivers the cold shoulder to any woman who is interested in her son. So Melanie Daniels, the daughter of a wealthy newspaper baron, finds herself at odds with Annie and the mother Lydia. Both Melanie and Annie are in conflict with Lydia, a common foe and this brings the two women to form an awkward friendship. The three main female characters have roles defined by their connection to Mitch. For me, the characters of the female performers are a memorable part of the movie.Melanie's strong streak of independence attracts Mitch but doesn't work too well with his mother, who seems bent on keeping her son a bachelor who can help fill the gap that followed the death of her husband four years before Melanie arrives on the scene. Melanie is a prankster and someone who is used to getting her way but she shines in a crisis that puts her to the test. Melanie is tough but she can also show her soft side with Mitch's younger sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) and the two form a strong bond.The movie comes to a climax with the massive bird assaults which unfold very slowly with some small incidents and to add to the suspense, cutaways to birds crowding together on phone poles and play structures. The suspense was very effective with the muted sound track followed by the sudden burst of birds. With the birds becoming a threat to the village, we can feel the tension building before key scenes. I did find the attacks too over the top but Hitchcock was never one to shy from trying something new. The birds become Melanie's main opponent and require her to draw on untested sources of strength and determination. Mitch too performed heroically in the test against the forces of nature. Both Mitch and Melanie showed their mettle through their sheer endurance, a great partnership in adversity. The ending is enigmatic but allows the viewer lots of scope to speculate.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not GREAT.,"This movie was not all that great.  First of all there where a lot of just silents moments and the scene got unnecessarily long!  And At those points It got really boreing.  Also the ending was very bad, the worst ending I have senn in my life(inless there was going to be a sequal but Alfred Hitchcock never got around to doing it).  I wont spoil the end for you, you have to see the movie.On the other hand, there was some good parts too it also.  It was exciting and kept you guessing about what was going to happen. It was also a very origianal movie, not too much like any other movies.

You'll never see another film were simple birds will be so scary.,"Once again a true masterpiece by Hitchcock, it starts of very simple and easy and becomes non-stopping chills and thrills towards the end. Seriously you'll never see another film were something as simple as birds will be so scary.It's not much to say about why the birds attack, they simply do. And a small fishing town has to pay for it. I liked how birds were always in the picture, but they gradually became more and more violent, until the end were the horizon is literally covered with them. To a very, very minor degree it reminded me of the classic Living Dead films, except they're trapped by birds not zombies. but believe me, it's still very scary. Well maybe more chilling by todays standard, but it will keep you locked in your chairs to the end.The main cast is great, including Tippie Hedren in her first movie role. Also i was surprised to see a very young Veronica Cartwright also known for Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. i bet this is the film who set her on the horror movie ""map"", even though Birds is technically a thriller.What can I say, Hitchcock does it again. it almost stands up to Psycho.

There is no suspense, because everyone in the world knows exactly what is going to happen the minute they look at the video box cover.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"When terror takes flight with Hitchcock, you can't go wrong","Every movie fan knows that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the top ten (or even five) geniuses in the history of the movies. I think The Birds is his scariest and most unique picture. Instead of a murder mystery or a psychological thriller, The Birds at its core is essentially a creature feature, and probably one of the most innovative.The premise is sort of a fantasy. It is a completely hypothetical 'What if' story. A small coastal city in sunny California becomes a hellhole when all the local birds suddenly develop a taste for human flesh. Crows, Gulls, sparrows and even fowl all become predators! The story is told from the point of view of a small family and their guest (Tippy Hedron) she has a crush on ... and decides to surprise him by driving into town and giving his sister a present for her birthday.I'll give you a perfect example of just how clever The Birds is. Picture if you will, one bird landing and perching very casually on the monkey bars in a playground, then another lands ten seconds later, then another then another. It resembles something out of Sesame Street (I am count Dracula! lets a-count a-birds!) The next thing you know, there are up to fifty birds just casually sitting on the playground. If you saw that in real life, it would amuse you no doubt. But given the context of the film, you'll either be turned away from the screen or biting your nails off.The visual effects by modern standards would hardly be eye-popping but, considering this was almost fifty years ago, it is a fairly impressive job. There are hand puppets, birds on strings, projector silhouettes, and best of all, the movie features at least a couple hundred real birds. There is an old Hollywood saying, never work with children or animals. Crows and blackbirds are smart fairly easy to train, but seagulls I'm not so sure about, especially for something like the climax. You really need patience to direct a film like this.After three decades in the movie business, Hitchcock has all the skills required to make The Birds come to life. Like all his films, this one has, and will probably continue stand the test of time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best in Horror,"It's difficult to believe that a film about a major birds attack could even be remotely scary. Anyone else who would have directed this film could have made it unbelievably cliché. Oh, wait, Alfred Hitchcock is the director, so it has to be great! And it is.For those of you with a short attention span, don't watch 'The Birds'. The story may seem slow-paced, but it only increases the anticipation. If you appreciate proper storytelling, this is for you.Tippi Hendren gives a wonderful performance as the leading role. She is mainly calm throughout, though she does exactly what Hitchcock expected; Be a character people relate to. The whole point of horror is to begin in a perfect setting similar to the Garden of Eden, which gives a false sense of security. There is barely any music, which only increases discomfort during the calm before the storm of birds.The sound effects are to perfection. The story knows the right timing to frighten its audience. The only scenes more horrific than birds attacking humans, are when the birds are simply perched, waiting. The meaning of the film is to show how we mistreat animals. Yes, revenge. Buying lovebirds toward the beginning shows us how they feel imprisoned. Animals were free once upon a time. To have all animals attack, and not only birds, would have been too obvious.I will not spoil the ending. It is somewhat similar to the original 'Night of the Living Dead' with a twist. Although zombies are not half as threatening as birds.Expect the unexpected from any Hitchcock film.",,Anonymous,Horror
You have to see it once,"Even though the special effects aren't great (although hilarious in how bad they are- even though they were probably good at it's time), the Technicolor looks really fake and bright, the filming isn't the best, the sound is a little dodgy, this movie is pretty creepy and is worth seeing once. Nothing too scary happens until a quarter the way through, but it's done so we can connect to the characters and grow to like them. The plot is pretty thin, but an original and memorable one.Bottom line: technical aspects are terrible (compared to the stuff we have out now), plot is thin, but the ideas, script and execution are very original and clever! I was left on the edge of my seat in suspense at some parts- and that hardly ever happens to me.It's hard to rate this because of the time it was made and the lack of re-watch value, but I'll go somewhere between 6-7.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Good & Bad Of 'The Birds',"This is one of the landmark films where if you saw it in the theater when it was released, you never forgot the experience. What I'll never forget - and this is true, so help me - is that moments after I left the theater, a couple birds swooped over my head. I thought I'd have a heart attack at the age of 18!! I never forgot that. It still creeps me out.Since then, I've seen the film at least a half dozen times, both on TV, on VHS and on DVD and always found it fascinating....even 40-some years later. Sure, it doesn't pack the wallop it did when it came out, but it's still scary enough with unique, memorable scenes.THE GOOD - Those scenes with the birds becoming larger and larger in numbers while sitting on the jungle gym bars, or the telephone wires are some of the most memorable in movie history. Who can forget them, especially if one first saw this film at a young and impressionable age? The suspense and the terror that director Alfred Hitchcock mounted with these scenes are almost unparalleled in film history, so kudos to him for that. Also, even though the special-effects are dated, they were still good enough to be effective today. The birds attacking the kids can still look plenty real. The ending also was very suspenseful and a very good one. This movie is certainly one of the most unique ever made.Acting-wise, I'm sorry Tippi Hedren never made it in the business with that classically-beautiful face and pleasant demeanor. Her acting seemed okay to me, so I don't know what the deal was with her career....or lack of one. Rod Taylor, meanwhile, was fine and Suzanne Pleshette was good in a low-key role. Viewing this in '90s, it was interesting to see such a young Veronica Cartwright, someone, of course, I was unfamiliar with back in the 1960s.THE BAD - A lot of these pertain to my personal beliefs, not to the film-making. For instance, I can't stand shrill, hysterical women so Jessica Tandy's role in here as the crabby old protective mother of star Rod Taylor is extremely irritating to me and takes away from the enjoyment of the movie. I have no problem with the rest of the major players, as I mentioned above.I did not appreciate the usual cheap shot at Christians, which was becoming more and more frequent in the 1960s. The only ""religious"" person in the movie was some wild-eyed doomsday predictor - and drunk - at a restaurant. I'm not surprised Hitchcock, a biased pagan himself, included that in the film. It wasn't untypical of him, and it wasn't there by accident.Some of the scenes were too talky and melodramatic, mostly those with Hedren and either Taylor or Tandy but then, too much action would have spoiled the suspense, so I just put up with some of those annoying-dialog scenes and wait for the birds to re-appear!ONE LAST NOTE: When are they going to produce a good DVD of this film? The disc I owned was almost identical to the VHS, a very poor transfer. I got rid of it, but would be happy to reacquire this film with a sharp DVD transfer. It certainly deserves one.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Even at His Most Frivolous, Hitchcock is Years Ahead of the Curve","The title pretty much says it all in this distinctly Hitchcockian mix of petty social gamesmanship and an abrupt, all-encompassing existential threat. That being the killer birds, obviously, which dive in from nowhere to ruthlessly head-hunt the poor denizens of a sleepy marine village in northern California.It sounds like an odd mix, but it in practice... well, okay, it is an odd mix. The film's sudden about-face, from a slow moving game of flirty pranks to a breakneck avian assault, is disruptive and awkward, its pace a whiplashed tug-of-war between monotonous waits and unannounced bursts of frenzy. I like the metaphorical idea behind it, a pontification on natural catastrophes and how quickly they lead polite society to break down, but didn't enjoy much of the experience itself.In many ways, it's a precursor to the glut of disaster movies that flooded cinemas in the following decade: one central menace, easy enough to boil down to a single word, which sends everybody scurrying in a desperate, improvised bid for survival. The effects are glaringly bad, too, bad enough to, more than once, completely pull me out of the moment with a snicker or a snort. The last big scare scene, however, is all sound and tension, and works so much better for its restraint and subtlety, putting the more garish, visceral preceding shots to shame by leaning on a few wild-eyed close-ups. I can see what Hitchcock was shooting for, but I don't think he got there.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

That said, this is definitely a movie of the time. All the women and girls were needy, irrational, hysterical, stupid, inept, in a nutshell; completely man-dependent. I was rolling my eyes time and again at all the cringe-worthy scenes. Some of the screenplay had women making idiotic decisions just to facilitate action sequences--""OK kids, there is a mass of killer birds gathered just outside. Let's all go outside."" Ridiculous!

Terrific Visuals And Special Effects,"Gripping and unnerving, Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is one of the great films of all time. In more recent movies, special effects are the sole reason to see the film; there is no real story. What makes ""The Birds"" so eloquent is that the special effects enhance an already masterful story.One could reasonably argue that Hitchcock's classic was one of the first, if not the first, films to explore an environmental apocalypse. As such, it has great thematic depth. The story shows how we take for granted simple features of our everyday world, and how unsettling it would be not to have control over these mundane environmental features.Characters are multidimensional; we care about them; they clearly display their humanity. And the dialogue is excellent. My favorite character is the amusingly intellectual ornithologist. Mrs. Bundy, so sure of herself in the Café scene: ""I hardly think that either species (of birds) would have sufficient intelligence to launch a mass attack; their brain pans are not big enough"".Plot structure is fine, although it's not unreasonable to state that the story is a bit slow to develop; perhaps a few scenes in the first twenty minutes could have been deleted or shortened. The film's ending is sufficiently clear without being explicit.There are so many good visuals it's hard to know where to begin. A favorite of mine is the scene where Melanie sits in front of a jungle-gym smoking a cigarette; birds casually and innocently gather behind her. After a time when she has finished her cigarette, the camera reverts back to the jungle-gym; this time it has been overrun by an ominous army of birds; the scene is rendered even more effective by having no dialogue.Another factor that makes this film good is the absence of background music; the story doesn't need it. Ambient sounds alone enhance suspense and realism. The sounds of flapping and squawking birds are eerie and effective. Casting is almost ideal. Tippi Hedren may be a bit prim and proper but she does a good job with her role. I don't recall a weak performance anywhere.""The Birds"" is probably my favorite Hitchcock film. Aside from possibly a slow start, it's a well-made film, using technically difficult visual effects. It is not only entertaining but also thought-provoking in its underlying environmental theme.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Deadly Attack of the Birds,"In San Francisco, the spoiled daughter of the owner of a newspaper Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) meets the lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) at the Davidson's Pet Shop. Mitch recognizes Melanie but pretends that she is a seller and asks two love birds for his sister's birthday as a joke. However, Melanie buys a pair of love birds later and discovers his address in Bodega Bay where he spends the weekends with his mother and his sister. Then she drives to the coastal town and plays a practical joke, leaving the birds inside Mitch's house with an envelope for his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). While returning by boat to her car, Melanie is surprisingly attacked by a seagull. The birds mysteriously attack people in Cathy's birthday party; the children at school; and the skeptical locals in the town, in the beginning of a series of deadly attacks.""The Birds"" is a trash and silly idea of deadly attacks of seagulls, ravens and other birds to humans that only a genius like Alfred Hitchcock could transform in a classic of the horror genre. The making of the special effects was very difficult in 1960, but Hitchcock and his team succeeds again. It is interesting to see the debut of the blonde Tippi Hedren with a character that has the name of her daughter Melanie Griffith. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is leaving the Davidson's Pet Shop with two white dogs in the very beginning.

There was absolutely no reason for he to enter the attic of the house when she knew very well that there were most likely more birds clustered there. Perhaps Mr. Hitchcock meant for us to become somewhat annoyed with Melanie. If so, he certainly succeeded.

Hitchcock's Best Hauntingly Thrilling Movie !,"Alfred Hitchcock's physiognomy, visage and appearance has all that he portrays in his thrilling, suspense laden and at times nail biting cinematic sequences.

Coupled by interesting story and nice direction, movies directed by this suspense guru would always remain a toast for the viewers to watch.The sheer scale and number of threatening sea gulls at the end of the movie is amazing.

A film about birds turning against humanity. The film relies on engaging the most primitive emotion of fear from the audience.

Hitchcock's Greatest Masterpiece,"Considered a major disappointment when it was first released, The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's most ambitious, most audacious, and most astonishing achievement. Some biographers have said that Hitchcock was jealous of the new European directors who were dazzling all the critics, and this movie was his bid for bigger ""artistic"" recognition. Unfortunately, audiences dismissed it as a slow-moving horror movie with few thrills, fewer explanations, and no real ending. (It was one of the first movies to end without the words ""The End."") Even to this day, critics have failed to comprehend its complexities, preferring to hail the more simplistic, easier-to-analyze Vertigo as Hitchcock's masterpiece. Francois Truffaut, however, appreciated the craftsmanship of The Birds in his book of interviews with Hitchcock. Robin Wood also attempted to dissect the movie, but ultimately wrote it off as an exploration of the irrational, emphasizing the precarious nature of life. Finally, thank god, literary commando/critic Camille Paglia gave this underrated classic the kind of rigorous, insightful treatment it so richly deserves in her BFI Film Classics guide, The Birds. I recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and movie lovers. Hopefully, it will inspire closer inspection and further commentary. Here are my two centsThe Birds is a true visionary epic, right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey, 8 1/2, The Seventh Seal, Nashville, Taxi Driver, and Magnolia. Like those thought-provoking masterpieces, it requires repeat viewings to appreciate all the levels of meaning, the philosophical richness, the psychological nuances, and the bold cinematic originality. There's more than meets the eye here (or pecks the eye, to be precise). It's a romantic comedy that mutates into an all-out horror movie, a raging battle of the sexes waged in a symbolic war between nature and civilization. It's the revenge of female power, the breakdown of male logic, the apocalypse of the subconscious. It's a bedroom farce with beaks and feathers and claws, a gleefully sadistic attack on mother and child, Madonna and whore, hunters and gathers, hearth and home. And it's so much fun to watch!Here are just a few ways to ""read"" The Birds:* The attacks are literally nature's revenge. A local fisherman describes the bird's strange behavior and offers logical explanations. Mrs. MacGruder, the ""bird lady"" in the diner, paints a grim picture of what would happen if birds decide to wage war against humans. You can read the movie literally as an ecological disaster movie. But that's just a ""McGuffin,"" (what Hitchcock would describe as a meaningless plot device.)* The attacks are metaphorically nature's revenge. On a deeper level, The Birds graphically illustrates a complete inversion of predatory-prey relationships, thrown disastrously out of balance by the women's pursuit of the man. The hunter is now the hunted, which, according to social norms, is not ""the natural order"" of things. By inverting nature's laws, all of civilization is at risk: traditional families, innocent children, and all of society. When Melanie is finally reduced to the level of a passive child in a mother's armssubjugated to the back seat of her sports car while the man takes his ""rightful place"" at the wheelthe bird attacks stop.* The birds are symbols of female power. The attacks (via beautiful ""harmless"" creatures) are physical manifestations of the all-too-human ""harpies"" in Mitch's life: the sexual predator Melanie, the cold possessive mother Lydia, the clinging little sister who forces him to be a father figure, and Annie, the spurned lover who won't go away. They literally swarm around Mitch, surreptitiously pecking at each other, sublimating their desires, jealousies, and rage. These buried emotions don't just go away, of course; they find expression in the bird attacks. And no one is safenot the children, not the ""hen-pecked"" farmer next door, not the representative citizens trapped in a family restaurant. In the final scene, when the survivors are about to drive away, Mitch's little sister asks, ""Can I bring my lovebirds? They haven't hurt anybody."" But she's wrong. In The Birds, love destroys all. Love, and the female subconsciousuncaged at last.* It's the end of the world. For some inexplicable reason, nature and fate have turned against us. Reason and rationality have failed us. Our survival, in the end, depends upon our ability to navigate a hostile world swarming with unforeseen dangersin this case, drive a sports car through an endless ""sea"" of harmless-looking birds. Birds that, at any moment, might swoop down and destroy us. (You can bet that that flimsy convertible roof of Melanie's car won't save them from the apocalypse.) Still, a ray of light shines through the stormy clouds in the distance. A ray of hope? It's hard to say.You can also interpret the film as a Biblical prophesy, a Freudian nightmare, a battle of Jungian archetypes, or an old-fashioned monster movie without a traditional monster. However you slice it, The Birds is an endlessly fascinating, immensely entertaining, and intellectually challenging epic of the imagination.I know I'm in the minority here, but I think it's Hitchcock's Best.

just OK,"This was basically a disaster film but instead of a Volcano or Tornado, it was killer birds. One thing i liked about it was that you got involved in these people's lives before they were attacked unlike today's disaster films. But what i didn't like about it was that i didn't care about the characters and i could of cared less about who died. I have never liked Rod Taylor and i think he was just wrong for this movie. The birds don't even attack until after the first hour and i wish the birds had killed all the main characters because i really didn't like any of them.

I'd rather watch paint dry,"Apparently this picture worked when it was released almost 60 years ago. Why? I have no idea. I remember watching it as a teen in the Seventies, not being impressed. Now, some 40 years later I gave it the benefit of doubt and watched it again. Boy, what a stinker this is. One of the most overrated, underwhelming ""thrillers"" ever made. Hitchcock did great movies before and after The Birds, which makes this flop a real mystery. What were they thinking? The plot is dragging out forever and the boredom just gets more unbearable with every minute that passes. Yes there is character development, the whole first hour is reserved for that. Just that none of the characters is remotely likable to make me care about any of them. The whole exercise is utterly pointless. In short: a monumental waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
masterpieces there is no other word for it!,"The Birds is one of the greatest horror movies ever to be made, it's not just a great. it's a masterpieces. This movie has some of incredible scenes I have ever see in any horror movies! Outstanding performance from Mitch (Rob Taylor), Lydia Brenner (Jessica Tandy), Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) Cathy Brenner (Veronica Cartwright) and every one else involved! The Summary Beautiful young Melanie Daniels, a wealthy socialite whose father is the proprietor of a large newspaper, visits a San Francisco pet shop to pick up a myna bird she has ordered for her aunt. There, Melanie meets Mitch Brenner, a lawyer who is looking for a pair of lovebirds to give to his young sister.Intrigued by him, she buys the lovebirds and finds the address for Mitch's home in bodega bay a small coastal village up the Pacific coast. Melanie drives to Bodega Bay and delivers the birds by sneaking across the small harbour in a motor boat to the Brenner residence. Melanie walks right into the house and leaves the birds on a table with a note. As Melanie is headed back across the bay, Mitch circles around in his car to meet her. Just as she is about to pull up to the dock, a seagull swoops down and gashes her head.Over the next few days the avian attacks continue, as Melanie develops relationships with Mitch, his clingy mother, Lydia, his teenage sister, Cathy, and Cathy's teacher (and Mitch's former lover), Annie. One of my favourites scenes in any horror movies is when the Grows gather outside the school waiting to attack the kids when they come out! And When Grows attacks Kids so very well done, really scary at the same time and Suspense in that scenes was magnificent, This movie holds Suspense until the last second of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock did a superb job on directing and after 44 Years after movie first came out this is now a classic. I said it before and I say it again This movie is a masterpieces there is no other word for it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock's Masterpiece: The Birds,"I write this as I look out the window onto the bird bath. Now that I have watched The Birds (1963), I have a completely different perspective of them. I have a slight, small fear that they will gather (there's quite a few out there), and somehow attack me with force. But I guess that's what an amazing movie does to you  it affects your thoughts and feelings long after you have finished watching.The Birds is about a notorious socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) who goes out of her way to deliver two lovebirds for a prank on a man she just met (although he recognized her!). She ends up staying the weekend in Bogeda Bay, strange things start to happen: a seagull attacks her when she delivers the lovebirds, and this is the start of the attacks which increase in terror over the movie. Hitchcock is extremely clever with this, and manages to build up both suspense and tension.Out of all the Hitchock's I've seen so far, I believe that this is my favourite. I loved the air of suspense and tension that was created, I loved the acting, I loved the story, I loved the special effects (I would much prefer the simplistic special effects than today's  if this was made today, everything would be over the top and I believe it could take away from the movie itself), everything. Hitchcock truly excelled at this genre  no wonder why it is his trademark. A timeless classic  chilling and suspenseful.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant special effects heighten suspense in top Hitchcock thriller...,"'The Birds' gets you involved with the story right away as the camera follows Tippi Hedren into a pet store where she makes an inquiry about love birds. Next, she meets Rod Taylor and we immediately sense that there will be a growing bond between them that will lead to a bird attack of some sort. After that, Hitch slowly builds the suspense, climaxing midway with a gas station scene in which an expert on bird behavior (Ethel Griffies) expounds on her theories before a vicious attack outside the diner silences her. The most brilliant touch of all occurs during the schoolhouse scene with Hedren seated outside waiting for her teacher friend (Suzanne Pleshette). Unknown to her, birds are quietly lining up on the telephone wires and elsewhere, looking like ominous creatures against the sky. Other scenes are equally scary--particularly when the birds even attack by coming down the chimney--with the final attack occurring when Tippi Hedren climbs the steps to the attic. A gripping film, slow in starting as characters are introduced, but masterfully directed for the maximum of suspense once the birds start attacking. Definitely a ""must see"" for any fan of Hitchcock films. The color photography of Bodega Bay and surrounding areas is excellent. Missing is a Bernard Herrmann background score--but the flapping of wings does nicely!",,Anonymous,Horror
Usual Hitchcock quality shines through,"Slightly abstract thriller/horror engrosses for the duration and shows once again how good a director Hitchcock was.I'd heard vague references to Birds, particularly in relation to the opening scene of modern sci-fi flick 'The Core', and given my previous enjoyment of the content (If not always the endings) of other Hitchcock movies I thought I knew pretty much exactly what to expect.The Birds is a chiller from the 60s about a young woman, Melanie, who finds herself in the middle of a battle with huge flocks of birds. Aided and abetted by her beau Mitch, his mother Lydia and his sister Cathy, the motley crew endeavour to survive these ever increasing and inexplicable attacks, attacks which it becomes apparent are for the purpose of killing humans.The very first thing which struck me about this picture was I'd been convinced it was a black and white movie, and of course it is not. This gave the film a vibrant life not unlike Vertigo yet radically of its own ilk.However, like all Hitchcock flicks, the direction and cinematography are out of this world. The man's genius for breathtaking scenes and stunning colour combinations continues to amaze even today, and the multiple scenes with practically thousands of birds was on a scale I doubt has been repeated. It amazed me.Another of the qualities Birds has is that it is absolute enchanting. Undoubtedly helped by the richness of each scene, it is completely gripping all of the way and your attention never weans.The acting is also pretty good, if not quite as remarkable as Rear Window, Vertigo et al. It still oozes class, however.But the direction really is the main character in this, much like it is for so many of Hitchcock's other movies. The life which breathes from the celluloid never lets up, and while the ending isn't exactly conclusive, you shouldn't find yourself particularly worried or feeling hard done by. Instead feel enriched by yet another fantastic of cinematic genius at its finest.Truly absorbing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Engrossing Hitchcock thriller,"An incredibly engrossing Alfred Hitchcock thriller.Very original plot. Hitchcock probably created the creature-horror movie with this film, yet it is so much more than that. It has romance, human drama and survival.In typical Hitchcock fashion, the tension builds slowly. The background story is interesting in itself. Without the birds, the movie could easily have been turned into a romantic-drama (it probably would have needed a different name though...). Little by little, Hitchcock introduces the protagonists.Also typically Hitchcockian, there is no sound effects to artificially dial up the tension. It is all visual. Some scenes are particularly chilling. The birds behind Tippi Hendren at the school is a good example.Good performances by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hendren in the lead roles. Good support from Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette and Veronica Cartwright.A classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Let The Pecking Begin...,"Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) heads to Bodega Bay to surprise Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). For some unknown reason birds of all species begin attacking humans. At first, it seems like a small problem. Then, a few turn into many, then into millions.In anyone else's hands this could have been just another foray into hyper-schlock territory. Thankfully, Director Alfred Hitchcock was in charge, and due to his guidance THE BIRDS is a genuine horror classic.Hitchcock's ability to make the best of such material is an example of his genius.The phonebooth scene takes a confined location and turns it into an explosive, jarring experience. The attic scene puts Ms. Hedren's character into a painful, dangerous, and bewildering situation. The house under siege scene is downright apocalyptic! It even prefigures George A. Romero's fortified farmhouse in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD!In addition, when school teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette) is found on the ground, it's genuinely shocking.

A murder most 'fowl',"My Take: Brilliant, subtle and surprisingly sophisticated.Although age has certainly taken advantage on Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 thriller THE BIRDS, it's still one of the few of these ""nature goes wild"" thrillers that manage to keep its momentum and some of its effectiveness. Although the plot of nature turning against mankind seemed dated and became the subject of B-grade drive -in flicks and William Girdler's camping trip horrors, THE BIRDS does keep its credibility as a thriller, and a clever and subtle one at that. The silence and subtleness of the film, featuring the fact that it doesn't have an original score, presents The Master of Suspense's clever ways of obtaining suspense. There are a lot of scenes here that provide some tingle and chills, rather than violence and gore, which is somehow more effective. And, surprisingly, Hitch doesn't spare providing some bits of old-fashioned humor and romance. Hitchcock may be one of the few talents in Hollywood that can successfully fuse low-key comedy and offbeat romance with fear and panic.The first few half of the film (The first attack doesn't occur until later on) was more of a comedy and a mismatched relationship between characters. Mainly, it is about the human characters first, including spoiled city girl Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren's Debut), who flirts with lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Hitchcock continues on with the humorous tone when Melanie does follow Mitch in his summer house in Bodega Bay, with a present of lovebirds intended for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright). Serious thing picks up when poor Melanie gets attacked by a gull, which is later followed by a series of bizarre attacks from the birds on Bodega Bay residence. What caused them to turn against mankind? Is Melanie involved? Is she EVIL? Not even Hitch or the climax will leave you the answer to that.This, I think, is a very underrated work from The Master of Suspense, with much of the complaints coming from the film ending short of what was expected. But I may be only the few ones who actually understand what Hitch is trying to do here. I think the ending may not explain the endless ""whats?"" and ""hows"", but satisfaction has nothing to do with it. Hitchcock is not the kind of director who would wanted the film to end with a bang. Hitch wanted to give as the film that would give us the creeps, and successfully gives us one that we'd think about even after it's over.Yes, I give it *****. Although it isn't usually compared with Hitch's other efforts like PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO, THE BIRDS, without the comparisons, is still a great thriller that manages to create a very competent material in a premise that hardly anyone would believe in. Alongside the said classics, THE BIRDS still remains one of the master's best and most interesting efforts, and still remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst of Hitchcock,"The bird was a very underwhelming experience for me. I am well aware that the technologies of today were not around to make movies as adrenalin pumping as they are today, but that is why the story was so important back then. I commend the actors in this films as they delivered a great performance. I was going to give this movie a one-star rating, but I almost forgot that no matter how much I hated this movie, I was still drawn into what was going to happen next and couldn't stop watching. One final point. The ending was the most abrupt ending possible. I thought that my DVD player was broken, but it wasn't. The ending did not give the sort of closing feeling to it. I felt like I had just turned off the TV in the middle of it. Hitchcock was the greatest director of all time. There is no question about it. This movie was just his single blunder.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

And apart from the excellent and promising opening scene in the pet shop, there is nothing positive to draw from this endless film.

what is it you most fear?,"Daphne Du Maurier's work largely falls into he category of 'gothic romance' - not the kind that has glutted supermarkets since the '50s, her best known books really hark back to the genre's roots in the 19th century. Her short story, ""The Birds,"" is something of an anomaly in her work - on the surface its a sci-fi/disaster story that ends grimly (the farmer's family is pretty much doomed); but it is also clearly an expressive allegory for what it must have felt like for many British during the Battle of Britain - the description of an army of seagulls appearing on the horizon could easily be that of a fleet of German bombers. The giveaway line comes from the farmer's wife when she remarks that ""surely the Americans will do something."" Of course they did, and they and the British went on to defeat the Germans, which makes the post-war publication of the story a little out of date.Hitchccock had gotten one of his most successful films from Du Maurier's work - Rebecca - as well as one of his least successful, Under Capricorn. Deciding to take one of her most popular but least typical short stories as source for The Birds may have involved some risk - especially considering what he added to the original material. Obviously there was no longer any purpose served in evoking the Battle of Britain, so the location of the film is moved to America. The birds of the film then take on an entirely different quality - they become what can be called 'an open metaphor' meaning that they can be interpreted in any number of ways. To one asking ""why are they attacking humans en masse?"" the proper response is ""what is it you most fear? that's what they will represent to you."" Hitchcock does provide us with a key to his own interpretation, by adding a clinging mother to the family unit. Hitchcock, for better or worse, is the most overtly Freudian of directors - as the birds gather in the background preparing their assault, the central players quietly dance around the problem of the lead female's sexual attraction to a man whom his mother has effectively neutered. Only the sudden onslaught of the birds allows him the moment to reclaim his status as head of the family, and by that time his would-be lover has been severely damaged. Anyone who knows Hitchcock's body of work will recognize how this resonates with themes of sexuality and fear in his other films.But, again the birds are an open metaphor - Hitchcock is clever enough not to bind their threat too tightly to his own paranoias here. We are free to interpret them as we please, and to read the domestic drama as mere back-story to their unpredictable attacks. The film's suspense thus hinges, not on our concern for the family's problems, but on our own fears of inexplicable and sudden catastrophe. I think the effort to achieve that is entirely successful, and this is one of Hitchcock's most unsettling, and most memorable, accomplishments.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A macabre Masterpiece!,"I am ashamed to say this, but The Birds is my first Hitchcock film. Yes, it is true, so I was not familiar with the style that he was going to use, but dang, this film was spectacular! The writing and directing really captures your full attention. What I love was that the first 40 minutes or so there was nothing about it that was in any way horror, but instead gave all the characters perfect development and mystery. The dialogue was brilliant and clever, and the characters fleshed out strongly to make us care for them. When the horror started, it completely amazed me how Hitchcock could make the transition from such a light, and fairly romantic film to a terror and suspenseful film, but that is exactly what he does. The cinematography is brilliant, as are the performances. Suzanne Pleshette was the stand-out to me, creating a very mysterious and somewhat likable, yet at the same time very hidden and obscured, character. I am fairly certain that I will seek out more of Hitchcock's film after this!",,Anonymous,Horror
"Without The Birds, no Jaws!","The Birds is NOT the best movie Hitchcock ever made. Probably the most difficult, but far from the best. But it's influence is all over the place. Specially Spielberg and Jaws. And I was really impressed over some of the scenes. Specially the haunting ending. But it's alot of nonsense, too. The beginning makes no sense at all. I had to rewind several times to try to get just WHY our protagonist, Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) chooses to drive 10 miles to deliver some birds to some guy called Mitch, since he lives on weekends at his remote home. Don't get it. And ROMANCE! All of a sudden, Melanie and Mitch is smoching and kissing out of nowhere. It's poorly written character development, since the big thing is the birds. I actually like that we never get an answer to why they are so agressive. And some of the scenes are pretty shockingly violent. But again, it takes forever before things go into motion. And I absolutely hate the sound effects. Hitch and Hermann bunked using music, and instead travelled to Switzerland to learn using an early synth gizmo. This is the sound of the birds. And for me, a native from an island full of seagulls, it sounds rubbish. You can hear the electronic crackle. That much of the attacks looks fake I have no problems with, that's called age, way before CGI. There's anyway scenes that are truly unsettling, like the crow hacking away at a kids head. But the best scenes in the movie is the smaller, before all hell breaks loose. Like when Tippi Hedren smokes outside the church, and behind her, more and more crows gathers (a scene that the mediocre The Dark Half stole). But the influence on big monster movies are obvious. Specially one of my own favorites, Tremors. And worth mention is that Tippi got so traumatized by a week of bird attacks that she spent a week in hospital.

We know that there are birds outside, and we're not sure what will happen next. I must say that the film is very unpredictable. Especially the ending. It came as a shock to me at that time. Oh, man, I couldn't breath. Hitcock is an genius, he just knew where and when to shock you, keep you at the edge of your seat. In short, this is the best horror film I've ever since.

Hitchcock's genius shines in his direction:the scene that shows Hedren sitting on a bench near the school,while one by one the birds are arriving is an absolute classic,plundered by too many directors.In the indispensable Truffaut book,we discover that the master used to draw his scenes before filming them;the drawings from the scene I talk about above are downright fascinating.All the scenes which feature the birds are extraordinary and a lot of disaster films with bigger budgets cannot hold a candle to them.

Perhaps I've been spoiled by advances made in special effects, but this was just too distracting - I couldn't help it, I was ""pulled out of the story"" again and again by the old-style ""special effects.""  To put it mildly, they stink.  Also, the hitchcockian formula has been copied and copied and copied and copied again... so many times, that it ""feels like"" we're watching yet another copy, although it's not the case.  I found myself generally bored with ""The Birds,"" although I loved it as a child and young teenager.  It just has not stood the test of time well.

As she starts to get to know the town the birds mysteriously attack in force.""The Birds"" might well be the first official nature-runs-amok flick, which were made hugely popular a dozen years later with the release of ""Jaws,"" the film that opened the Pandora's box to creatures-on-the-loose flicks.I believe ""The Birds"" should be enjoyed at face value as a simple story of birds mysteriously attacking a coastal hamlet, but a more allegorical interpretation is that Melanie (Hedren) represents modern ideas that attempt to infect the rural communities where people live and think in a simpler, more conservative way. The village is not ready to accept and incorporate these ""new"" concepts and so nature itself attempts to vomit out the infection, irregardless of hometown damage and casualties. Yet this interpretation seems to be rejected by the film itself in the restaurant scene where the mother with two kids hysterically rebukes Melanie for supposedly causing the bird attacks; when Melanie slaps the mother, this irrational notion is 'slapped' out of the viewer as well, as if to say, ""That's stupid. Melanie is not the cause of this, literally or figuratively.""WHAT DOESN'T WORK (supposedly):For the better part of an hour the story plays out as a slow drama, which will likely turn off those with ADHD. Personally, I find this approach refreshing in light of the frenetic editing and absurd action sequences of modern ""blockbusters."" Films like ""The Birds"" seem almost daring by comparison; in fact, it's startling. Besides, the beautiful Bodega Bay photography provides some nice backdrop eye-candy to help maintain one's attention with the soap operatics.One obvious plot hole is: Why do Melanie, the schoolmarm and the kids flee the schoolhouse? Wouldn't it be wiser to simply blockade themselves in an inner room with no windows? Or maybe there isn't such an interior room big enough to fit all the kids; after all, it appears to be a fairly small schoolhouse.Complaints about Melanie's supposedly lame prank on Mitch (Taylor) are nitpicking at best; and criticisms of Melanie foolishly searching for the source of a mysterious sound -- even though she must know what it is -- can easily be chalked up to curiosity killing the cat (for instance, while stopping by Point Pleasant, WV, on vacation in 2005 I went into an old abandoned building that used to be a home for troubled kids back in the day; my wife refused to go any where near the creepy domicile but I HAD to go in and look around; even the satanic graffiti and shocked birds flying out the windows didn't deter me!).After recently seeing films like the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", I can hardly find ""The Birds"" horrifying, although I certainly find it very entertaining. Really, the creepiest aspect of the movie is Mitch's hovering, suspicious mother, played by Jessica Tandy -- whoa, is she scary.The age difference of Mitch and his sister seems off. Taylor (Mitch) was 33 years-old during filming, although he looks to be more like 40 or older, but his sister in the story (Veronica Cartwright) was only 13. That's a twenty-year difference. I could see her being his daughter, but his sister? Also, if Veronica is 13 that means his creepy mother had sex a mere 13 years before -- and that's a really scary thought!WHAT WORKS:As noted above, the slow dialogue-driven drama of the first hour is actually appealing in light of the modern glut of moronic cgi-laden, frenetically-edited drivel, not to mention the awesome coastal Northern California cinematography.Viewing the film is like going back in time to the early 60s. It's entertaining to see the clothing and decor styles, as well as social interactions, etc.Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions. I know this is an odd comment, but she does have that Paul Stanley pouty lips rockstar expression down pat.Suzanne Pleshette's in the cast -- now SHE's sexy.There are numerous memorable and thrilling sequences -- the various bird attacks, the guy with no eye balls, the phone booth scene, etc. I also enjoyed the interesting discussion on birds in the diner sequence.!!END SPOILER!! I love the mysterious way the film ends with no explanation or dialogue. The sea of birds seem to permit their departure, even though the fowls could easily stop them if they wanted.The film runs 2 hours.GRADE: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
You'll never look at birds the same way again.,"In 2008's The Happening, M. Knight Shyamalan failed spectacularly to do what Alfred Hitchcock did way back in 1963. Make a great movie about what would happen if one of the most benign and least threatening aspects of nature, suddenly, inexplicably, and fatally turned against humanity.While Shymalan tried to horrify us with the wind and plant pollen, Hitchcock decides to remind us of how many more birds there are than humans, and how sharp beaks are just as capable of plucking out eyes and stabbing flesh as they are at pecking seeds. If you scoff at the idea of birds being deadly...well, imagine yourself in any of the various terrifying and menacing situations that these characters face throughout The Birds. The last 15 minutes are as tense as almost anything I've ever seen in movieThe ordinary and frivolous opening of the story is a perfect segue into the unexpected horror that descends on the small coastal town of Bodega Bay. There's a slow, menacing buildup to the action, and it definitely serves to lull you into an easy calm that shatters all the harder once the feathers start flying. And we never know why. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Love? Is that all you men think about? What about birds?,"There's something fearful, something of an emergency, something hateful, something to bring people together.Isn't it sad that people can only be brought together by common cause, such as a mutual antipathy?The Birds was a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, before it became a film. The birds. They attack. It never happened before, and it's happening now. And where is the explanation? Where is the protection? According to Wiki, Du Maurier's story reflected resentment at the failure of government to protect people during the Blitz, not just from the Luftwaffe but also from looters. What's going on in this movie, the story transplanted to Northern California?Well, there's a love angle, and female jealousy, a double helping? But as with a maniac on the hunt, there's really no satisfactory explanation, other than to say that nature is cruel and the world is a dangerous place. The Birds is simply about a sudden threat, and dealing with it, as best they can. It's like any horror movie.The special effects are very effective, especially if you suspend disbelief. What is not effective is the children's voice-acting, which sounds unnatural, although the screaming and running is persuasive enough.Funny how no one thinks to open an umbrella.But make no mistake, I've been dive=bombed by a bird, and it ain't no joke. Imagine a flock of them? Or just watch this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fascinating; Freudian analysis of The Birds,"One would think, not having seen this film, that it is just a normal horror film where a mass of animals attacks people who run from them and scream. Well, this film is different, in that it was directed by the single greatest director of all times, Alfred Hitchcock. The Birds was made during his peak. It follows on the heels of such films as Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. It is as well directed as those films. In fact, it is even more daring than those. Several classical Hollywood elements are missing from this film. For one thing, and perhaps the most effective choice made by Hitchcock for this film, there is no musical score. Even in his best films, Psycho and Vertigo, for instance, the films are swept along by the score. They are great scores, by maybe the best score composer who ever worked in the movies, Bernard Herrmann, but to see a Hitchcock film without a score is just fantastic. Even the best musical scores are meant to manipulate your emotions, so here we get a chance to see just how effective a film can be without one. Also, the end of this film is perhaps the most unconventional you're ever going to see (although Vertigo also has a very unconventional ending). It is possibly the most startling image I've ever seen.Even if it just had Hitchcock's amazing direction going for it, The Birds also benefits from an absolutely masterful script. It is never as if the story is just that birds attack people. It is much, much more complex than that. And herein lies my Freudian Analysis. Of course, coming right after Psycho, Hitch was probably jumping to keep the whole Oedipus theme alive here. Annie, the school teacher, expresses this literally. But I would like to interpret the birds as more of a symbol than actual matter. Think back to the film Forbidden Planet. Remember the Monster of the Id, the invisible and immaterial beast who destroyed every person who attempted to take Dr. Morbius and his daughter off the planet, basically whoever threatened to steal his daughter from him? I think the birds in The Birds serve the same function for Lydia. When Melanie Daniels, a supposed sexual predator, enters the small, peaceful town of Bodega Bay, she does so to prey on Mitch Brenner. We find out, just as much by her actions as by Annie's speech, that Lydia is very jealous of her son's women. Melanie is also introducing her carnality onto the town as a whole. She brings the love birds for Cathy. Mitch had at first asked that the love birds not be too willing to display their love, and the first thing that Cathy asks is, ""How can I tell which one is male and which one is female?"" Notice also that the mother in the restaurant attacks her for being responsible. This ought to seem ridiculous, but it seems perfectly logical in the text of this film. The woman says, ""I think you're responsible. Who are you? WHAT are you?"" At the end of the film, Lydia does seem to accept Melanie. The birds are still there, but they do not harm them as they leave.Too often this film gets shoved into the horror genre and left there. I believe it was Hitchcock's most successful film, and for some reason, I think that more people could identify it and identify it as a Hitchcock film than any of his other films except for maybe Psycho. The Birds, and Psycho, too, which is also often classified as a horror film (which it is not in any way) are far too complex to be labeled with such a small label. They are both masterpieces. Psycho has always been regarded as one. The Birds is sometimes, but not as often. It is certainly one of Hitchcock's best. This man was a god. The Birds is a godly film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Overrated, ambiguously structured, easy Hitchcock","This is a great opportunity to state that Hitchcock was really more of a great/legendary businessman than he was a great director. He never wrote any of the films he worked on, but knew how to spot and exploit a story with cinematic potential. There isn't so much an artistic style to his films as there is a know-how stamp or signature.This here is yet another Hitchcock film, one more down the conveyor belt of prolific industrial mainstream production.We're given a long narrative in the first part between basically one man and a woman, with the typical bit of mystery that always starts off the Hitchcock films. This would all turn out to be quite vain when we understand what the film really is about: exactly what the title suggests. It seems wasteful to have spent that much time developing so much story and intrigue in human relationship so far-removed from what this film ultimately becomes, and is as a horror concept.There isn't an interesting thought or a subtle reason behind the strange happenings and every scene is more linear development in the bird catastrophe and never does the movie attempt to create a symbol or hidden/double meaning out of this. This is just cheap 60's horror, with strawman characters and moments that are today absolute clichés of the genre - and whether it was impressive visually for its time is absolutely irrelevant today, and additionally there's a terrible lack of attention to detail: all the scenes where they're outside where the birds are, forget to close doors despite the wind of chaos, etc etc...The fact there isn't music in key moments was nice, but terribly thin as an excuse to call this a cinematic masterpiece. This is another by-the-numbers lazy Hitchcock marketing/business idea, and once again he'd achieved undeserved recognition for a highly, highly overrated piece. A very lucky, right man in the right place character, Alfred Hitchcock, with an eye and a mind to seize the opportunity, and juice it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Apocalypse Now,"""Psycho"" may have been the scariest Hitchcock film, but there is no film by the master of suspense more unsettling than ""The Birds."" This enigmatic revenge-of-nature fable makes no effort to explain away its mysteries, and that's the most unsettling thing about it. What is nature seeking revenge for? Why is the birds' uprising timed to begin with the appearance in a sleepy little coastal town of an icy blonde from the city? Why is everyone so antagonistic toward said blonde? Is it only because she appears to have designs on the resident golden boy stud, or is there more to it?Ultimately, these questions end up not mattering much. Three-fourths of the film concern itself with the tensions (sexual and otherwise) between Tippi Hedren's Melanie and the townspeople; then all hell breaks loose in the last quarter and these tensions are completely forgotten. The genius of the film lies in its ability to make horror out of the mundane. At the apocalyptic end, as the rag-tag group of survivors drive off into the distance, watched by a bird army that covers the ground as far as the eye can see, the effect on the viewer is as powerful as if the survivors had awakened the morning after a nuclear holocaust.And perhaps most unsettling of all is Hitchcock's refusal to use any kind of incidental scoring in his film. You don't realize how much we rely on film music to tell us how we should feel until it's no longer there to do so.With Rod Taylor as the stud, who keeps that famous hairy chest under wraps (sorry ladies); Suzanne Pleshette, as the butch and sexually repressed school marm; Jessica Tandy, in the film's best performance as a mother who relies a little too much on her son; and Veronica Cartwright, whose presence in any film is like nails on a chalkboard.A strange masterpiece, and Hitchcock's last great film.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Essential Hitchcock film,"Esteemed director Alfred Hitchcock's follow up movie after Psycho. The Birds depicts what happens when a coastal town is overtaken by hostile birds. Socialite Tippi Hedren meets handsome Rod Taylor in a bird store. She follows him to the town where he lives with his mother and young daughter. It seems every time Hedren shows up there is some kind of bird attack. She herself is attacked by a gull as she drives a boat across the lake. Why are the birds attacking? Hitchcock and writer Evan Hunter never answer that question. The birds are the ""maguffin"", Hitchcock's term for a plot device to get the story moving but having nothing to do with the actual story. Once again Hitchcock creates a film that can be read on different levels. For an excellent analysis of the movie see Daniel Spoto's ""The Art of Alfred Hitchcock.""",,Anonymous,Horror
A great horror flick but a disappointing Hitchcock film,"This is a great horror film but a mediocre Hitchcock film.  It's worth seeing for all the great shots, such as the two love birds swaying back and forth as the car turns and the scene at the end of the film when Mitch opens the door and sees ALL the BIRDS, but all in all, I was disappointed in the film.  The ending was abrupt and left me feeling very unfulfilled. However, don't let me discourage you from watching it...  If you're in the mood for some shock horror and want to see a bunch of screaming children get their eyes poked out, rent this and Night of the Living Dead (the original one) and be shocked at the similarities.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lightyears ahead,"Alfred Hitchcock was simply a master, and arguments can be had until Kingdom come as to which of his classics was the best, but at the end of the day it can only ever be subjective. I am aware that there is an argument for both ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Vertigo"" as his best, but as much as I love theme, ""The Birds"" is my favourite.I actually think the film itself sags a little in the front half, and I'm not a huge fan of Tippi Hedren, but that all falls away when you look at how brilliantly executed this film is. Technically, Hitchcock was light years ahead of his time, using a record number of trick-shots, and for such a dated film, the effects still look amazing, to the point where I wonder, ""How did he manage that?"" Exciting filmmaking from a man who, if alive today, would still be showing the rest of them how it is done.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Character gives way to suspense, but what suspense!","This movie has no business working as well as it does. It's a horror movie about birds that largely stops giving its characters room to grow at the halfway point to focus on pure survival. And yet, it's got such a good build of tension over the course of the entire film through its final moments that it overcomes the thinness of some of what came before. It should be minor Hitchcock, but by pure force of his talent, he turns a small film into a wonderful entertainment.Much like Psycho, the movie spends a lot of its early moments dedicated to its characters. Our two main characters are Tippi Hedren's Melanie Daniels and Rod Taylor's Mitch Brenner. Melanie is the daughter of a newspaper owner, a rich girl with little to do and likes to resort to pranks, including one time the summer before when she fell into a fountain in Rome (a reference to La Dolce Vita, perhaps). Mitch knows of her reputation and has some fun with her at a pet shop, getting her to act as a salesperson and she ends up over her head, not really knowing anything about the birds she's talking about. As a way to troll him a bit, she buys a pair of lovebirds that he had said he wanted to get for his sister's birthday and ends up driving sixty miles up the California coast from San Francisco to the small seaside community Bodega Bay. There, she meets the local schoolteacher, Annie, before lying over and over to Mitch about her purpose in Bodega Bay. She's cynical and can't admit to any genuine feelings, so everything's a bit of a joke to her.Now, one of the joys of the first half of the movie is Tippi Hedren herself. She's sardonic and very self-assured, carrying herself with great overinflated pride that is both a bit infectious and a great setup for a great fall. She's a great leading lady, picked out from obscurity by Hitchcock. He also put her through hell, not just the characters, but Tippi ended up in the hospital for a week because of how intense once particular late scene went for her.The build of tension is really well handled. For the first half of the film, the overall emphasis is definitely on character, getting Melanie to Bodega Bay, introducing Mitch, his mother, and his sister, and allowing some background information about the previous relationship between Mitch and Annie come out. At the same time are small moments hear and there that build in intensity. First is the unnatural amount of noise from the birds in the pet shop in the first scene. Then there's the seagull flying into Melanie's head as she crosses the bay. Then there's the gull that flies straight into Annie's door, killing itself. The final major event of the first half is the birthday party for Mitch's sister, Cathy. The children are all out, having a good time, when birds fly down without explanation and simply start attacking. Each event is bigger than the last until the attack.Now, one of the things that I love about this film is that the bird attacks never get an explanation. The source material by Daphne du Maurier did provide some small explanation about the tides, but one source of terror is the unknown. Something rather benign, like birds, suddenly turning on people and becoming destructive is scary, especially if we can't figure out why. Explanations are soothing to the human mind, being able to categorize things neatly helps make us feel better. Denying us the ability to classify a threat increases the terror of that threat to the human mind, so while having the ornithologist show up and explain bird behavior is a drag on the film, it does do one important thing. It gives us an expert on birds being without explanation for their behavior. No, birds do not act like this, she assures us while birds attack the small diner. Her terror increases our own.Slight tangent: When, in movies, things don't go according to nature, it's often sloppiness on the part of the filmmakers, and I understand that. But something like Jaws, which uses the same basic template as The Birds with a more naturally terrifying animal at its center, does it on purpose and yet it still gets complaints that great white sharks don't act like that. Well, this one does, and that's what's important to the story.Anyway, the movie really shifts focus in its second half to the increasing terror. The only real character work that happens is the humiliation of Melanie until she becomes an emotional wreck by the end, her cynicism replaced by abject terror at the mere sight of birds.There are some absolutely fantastic visuals in the latter half of the film as innocent images suddenly get invaded by threats. Melanie sits on a bench outside the small community's school in front of its playground equipment. As she lights up a cigarette, without any fanfare, a crow flies in and lands on the equipment behind her. The innocent moment has been completely undermined by that single bird showing up. It's a great moment.Another great thing about the film is that there's no musical score whatsoever. One thing that can really help elevate tension is quiet, as the audience sits in wait for something to happen. When the entire movie built on raising tension from the first frame to the last is done without music, the technique provides space for audience expectations that something is going to happen at some point, and it never lets up. The only real soundtrack is the use of bird sounds, some electronically generated, and it's really effective.As I said, The Birds is far better than it really deserves to be. It thins as it goes along, but tension becomes the overriding factor and just dominates every moment. It's a fun, tense movie that leaves you with a sense of dread at its ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just okay,"This is probably my least favorite Hitchcock film. Many of the reviewers seemed unnecessarily troubled by the lack of explanations in the plot. That ambiguity, of course, was part of the plot. Why did the birds suddenly organize and attack? We don't know. Not knowing why the threat exists is part of the terror. We take for granted that birds are just a non-threatening part of the scenery in our lives. What, says Hitchcock, would happen if birds, especially birds not particularly known as hunters like gulls and crows and ordinary starlings, suddenly and inexplicably appeared to start to prey on human beings. The birds are eco-terrorists, if you will. Clearly humanity has done something to ruffle the birds' tail-feathers. Caging them, as with the lovebirds, is perhaps the cause. Perhaps the cause is pesticide use or pollution. Whatever the cause, the birds are mad as hell and not going to take it any more. What that idea amounts to is a pretty good story line for for an installment of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour, but not quite enough meat for a feature film. Add to that some mediocre acting by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren in the lead roles (there was no chemistry between them whatsoever) and you have the recipe for a disappointing effort from Hitchcock. While I will admit that this movie scared the bejesus out of me when I first saw it on TV at age 8, it's really not all that frightening. It is ironic that in a film where birds are portrayed as apparently up in arms over their mistreatment by humans, in at least some scenes, Hitchcok had stage hands physically throwing live birds at Tippi Hedren to enhance the bird attack sequences. Overall, though, the bird attacks come off as pretty hokey. The general chaos scenes are pretty good, but the close ups are so obviously mechanical birds as to be laughable. I absolutely hate the sequence of shots where Hedren tracks the flow of the gas from the gas station to the man lighting his cigar -- the facial reactions are just a little too much, especially since all she's doing is watching the flow. This film is okay as a light diversion, but if you seek out the Hitchcock Hour on DVD, you will find many episodes that are more worthwhile than this mediocre movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A victory lap for Hitch,"Alfred Hitchcock was on the run of his life by the early 1960s. His last three films, `Vertigo,' `North By Northwest,' and `Psycho,' were not uniformly successful in their day, but all would eventually become recognized as among an elite grouping of truly great films. In December, 2003, IMDB's own ranking system has all three in its Top 30, pretty incredible anyway you slice it. But what was really incredible was how Hitchcock came off that creative peak. Other directors might have made a vanity picture, or an overblown epic of some kind. Hitchcock made `The Birds,' an entirely different kind of film from anything he or anyone else had made before, one that would carve out its own genre for decades to come. And a pretty fine movie to boot.There was never a movie as utterly out-of-the-blue as `The Birds.' Even `Psycho' had some precedent going for it. Before `Psycho,' people had killed other people for no better reason than it seemed like something worth doing at the time. But concerted offensives directed from the animal kingdom? A film that starts off as a romantic comedy i.e. `When Harry Met Sally' and ends up like `Jurassic Park' with feathers in place of scales? What people must have thought in 1963!Tippi Hendren stars as Melanie Daniels, a sort of Paris Hilton character who lives the life of a carefree trust-fund princess until a chance encounter with disapproving lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) sends her on a whimsical trip to his family home in Bodega Bay, and into the hands, or claws, of destiny. Hendren plays her very well, charming and a trifle too easygoing. Taylor offers an interesting parallel, as a smug, scarf-wearing playboy you somehow find yourself liking for (or despite) his assured charm. Whether the two will find each other or not is the principal source of interest through the first half of the film. After, of course, it's whether they get turned into bird chow.Whatever sets the birds of Bodega Bay off is a mystery. Maybe it is the presence of Melanie Daniels, as one resident blurts out, though there is evidence the attack is much wider-spread. Maybe it is the environmental damage being done to the planet by humankind, just gaining expression during this period in works like `Silent Spring.' Maybe it's one too many Thanksgivings. The wherefores aren't as important as the hows, how the birds start their attacks, with slow-gathering momentum that gains in ferocity until the town of Bodega Bay is literally aflame.`The Birds' doesn't get the same kind of respect as does so-called classic Hitchcock of previous decades, which is just stupid snobbery. His powers as the proclaimed `Master of Suspense' were never as much on view; not since his British period before World War II, anyway. `Vertigo' and `Suspicion' and others are good in their way, but they don't reward repeat viewings the same way `The Birds' does. Every person Melanie meets in Bodega Bay has his or her own involving personality that welcomes interest at the same time she or her serves to speed the plot along. The lunch crowd at the Tides Restaurant alone would be worth an hour of anyone else's movie. And then there's Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette, as two characters who make quite a tandem as they seem to resent Melanie's attentions on Mitch. Is their jealousy somehow at the cause of all this?Editing is a chief virtue of `The Birds.' It papers over the defects in the special effects exposed by advancing technology and galvanizes attention to where Hitchcock wants it. Watch the scene where Jessica Tandy checks on the farmer with the grain problem. The three successive close-up shots of the farmer crumpled on the floor get deserved attention, but what about the way Hitchcock lets Tandy's Mrs. Brenner out of the house, with a series of basic shots, all filmed at angles to suggest how tilted her world has become, with no words or music to accompany her?There's much psychology and characterization driving `The Birds,' but ultimately what makes the film worth watching are the bird attacks. Hitchcock makes you wait, but when they come, they come fast and hard, without warning or expected respite. You really gotta love the chimney scene, and the way a children's song heightens the suspense during the famous schoolyard sequence.Just wish they had let the film go on an hour longer. So many more species still to hear from! How about a nice penguin assault, or an ostrich attack? Hitchcock could have put an entirely new construction to the term `duck hunt!'",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Will Never Beat Psycho!,"The Birds. Heh. What to say about it? First of all, it won't beat Psycho. It won't beat it, after the amazing performance of Antony Perkins and the amazing direction by Alfred Hitchcock. Then I'm watching this, and kind of wonder what a big contrast it is between these. The plot of The Birds is basically about a women that meet a man in a small village, they discover each other and look at everything in new ways, as well as become friends with the new villagers. The plot was building up, and later came the birds. And when the birds came, everything lowered and made my rating lower. If it was so called entertainment Alfred made, he could have done a better job, and thinking about birds as the main antagonists, it doesn't make it so interesting as it could have been. I really liked the first hour or so, when the birds appeared from time to time, and it was just a little sneak peak of what was going to happen. The psychological problems of the characters were well presented and the actors did play very good, especially the main characters, and even the little girl that came later, a daughter, that played so real, she cried so much as hell. When the birds came, the entertainment fall, the attacks and the jump-scares weren't really entertaining or fun in some way, except the last scene, when one of the characters had to go to the parking across many birds, and I never knew if they were going to attack. That was good suspense there. Besides, nothing much suspense or entertaining. The scenes could have been done much better. So if I have to say good things about The Birds, it would be: Good pictures, very good actors, and an interesting first hour. The birds didn't impress and I would say they were pretty banal. Could have been more suspense and more music in the scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"sorry, but this one is (ba-da-bim) for the birds","I'll have to be the turd in the punchbowl here and insert a contrary opinion among the critical encomia. I finally managed to see this one from beginning to end in American Movie Classics's Hitchcock retrospective in early summer 2000. I had had my doubts about the flick from the bits and pieces I had seen earlier, and seeing it entire did nothing to change my opinion, despite the fact that Camille Paglia thinks this is one of cinema's great masterpieces. I found nothing remotely frightening here; the whole thesis of the movie is laughable, and the sudden stop ending is unsatisfying and anticlimactic. And wordy??? Talk, talk, talk, and more pointless talk. Tippi Hedren ? I think Hitch's erotic fascination with her overcame an objective assessment of her acting abilities, or rather lack of same (her post-Hitch career includes such gems as ""Teresa's Tattoo"" and ""Return to Green Acres""). One curious fact about this film, and one which I have neither read nor seen any comment on, is the glaring omission of a musical score; there is nary a note of background music. I would love to know Hitch's rationale for this choice; in any case Bernie Herrmann might have been able to pump some suspense into this dog, er, bird.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A classic.,"I cant say much about The Birds (1963) because everyone knows why its so good, everyone knows why its so effective, well written and well directed.

Probably because most of those other films lack the kind of writing that this one has, they don't develop their characters well enough so by the time something happens to them you really don't care, in The Birds you do care and you root for these people even if they aren't the most likable people on earth. Also, the bird attacks in the film are really well directed, another aspect those movies lacked.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A lesson on woman's proper role,"The macguffin' in Alfred's Hitchcock's The Birds is really not a mystery after all. The birds' behavior and their attacks are used to represent the various threats posed to the town by Melanie's sexuality and solitude. In this respect, the birds are representative of Melanie. However, in their eventual attack on her, the birds represent an extension of Lydia's will to make Melanie embrace her proper and acceptable role as a woman. The lovebirds serve as that ideal of proper womanhood that Melanie has attained by the final scene of the film.Hitchcock establishes the link between the birds and Melanie's sexuality the first time she steps onto the scene. The birds begin to caw immediately after some ogling men whistle at her, foreshadowing the future encounters between the birds and humans caused by her sexuality. However, while in San Francisco there is no actual contact between the two, as exemplified by her unsuccessful attempt to catch a canary for Mitch. This is because Melanie poses no threat to Lydia's conception of an acceptable female while in San Francisco. It is only in Bodega Bay that Melanie becomes a threat and the subsequent attacks occur. Hitchcock further links Melanie to the birds in order to demonstrate that what is acceptable in the city, namely Melanie's solitude and freedom, is not acceptable in Bodega Bay. While she is in the bird shop during the first scenes, she laments that the `poor, innocent birds' are enclosed in cages, until one lone bird, representing her, does in fact fly free. Mitch catches and subdues that bird, as he would later catch a subdued Melanie. In these instances, Hitchcock establishes a strong link between Melanie's sexuality and solitude with birds.These characteristics pose a threat to the town, and the birds' behavior and attacks demonstrate what those threats are. When the sparrows come down the chimney and destroy the house, it signifies Melanie's role as a home wrecker' if she should take Mitch away from his mother. The death of the first man is similarly close to Lydia. His death, significantly with his eyes plucked out, signifies fear of the gaze and the sexual attraction that Melanie elicits from men, especially Mitch. The birds' attack on the man in the boat is an attack on his livelihood, thus on male stability. The attack on the children coming from school signifies a disruption of the family ideal. Women are not meant to be sexual objects, but rather nurturing mothers. When the birds attack the man pumping oil, much more of the town is affected and destroyed, because Melanie's threat to the family has grown. She has insinuated herself into their lives by saving Cathy and helping Lydia in bed. It becomes Lydia's will to put Melanie in her place, and Hitchcock represents this lesson with the birds.Because Lydia is scared that Mitch will leave her for the love of another woman, she metaphorically picks' at Melanie until she is as subdued and non-demonstrative as the lovebirds. The viewer knows Lydia mistrusts Melanie because of her outright declaration in the kitchen to Mitch. Following this first encounter, birds line the telephone wires as Melanie drives to Annie's. Further foreshadowing the attack on Melanie at the climax is the gull that swoops down on her when she first goes beyond the bounds of acceptable female etiquette. After she accepts an invitation to the party because she is interested in Mitch, a bird flies into the front door despite a full moon. As Melanie comes closer to the ideal, becoming more subdued and helpful to Lydia and Cathy during crisis, the birds attack and kill Annie since it is now her pining presence that is a threat to any serious relationship forming between Mitch and Melanie. However, just as Lydia is still wary of the lovebirds, and keeps them in the kitchen, she is also still not comfortable with Melanie. The birds attack Melanie in the attic with viciousness and Mitch has to save the helpless and disheveled Melanie from them. In an effort to drive her out of town, it is obvious that Melanie has not only gained Mitch's love, but also Lydia's acceptance. The lovebirds in the car, and peace of the birds right outside the house, attest to the proper role of women as desexualized, since Melanie is disheveled, and dependent on man and the family structure.The birds in this film actually have a very symbolic and predictable role in establishing the moral. Sexual and solitary women are acceptable in the city, but are very threatening to the family structure of a small town like Bodega Bay. The birds are both linked to Melanie's character to symbolize the threat she poses, and to her ultimate downfall to symbolize the proper non-demonstrative role of a woman.",,Anonymous,Horror
A revenge-of-nature film without a clear ending,"It's a horror movie set on a long weekend in the early 1960s, initially in San Francisco, California, but mainly in the small town of Bodega Bay, California, north of San Francisco. It focuses on the experiences of four people and some acquaintances in the community when various species of birds begin to attack humans.Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is the wealthy daughter of the publisher of a San Francisco newspaper. She's well-known as something of a playgirl that makes the gossip columns. A San Francisco lawyer, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), recognizes her in a pet shop, where they have extended banter before he reveals that he knows her. He had intended but could not buy two lovebirds for his much younger sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). On weekends he lives with his sister and recently-widowed mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy), in Bodega Bay.Melanie decides to buy the lovebirds and deliver them to Cathy and Mitch. When she arrives, she meets the local schoolteacher, Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), a former girlfriend of Mitch's who Lydia appears to dislike.""The Birds"" then follows the developing relationship between Melanie and Mitch at a time when seagulls, crows, and sparrows at various times attack humans in a rapidly escalating manner. As the violence escalates, the Brenners and Melanie plan an escape.""The Birds"" is a revenge-of-nature film without a clear ending. Hedren and Taylor give good performances. Tandy and Cartwright seem more forced and wooden. The age difference between ""brother"" and ""sister"" is striking. Hitchcock's use of technology is impressive for 1963 in his manipulation of actual and mechanical birds. His ability to inject terror into the commonplace is well done. Since this is a horror movie outside the walls of reality, questions about plot logic become irrelevant. ""The Birds"" is an entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock's Finest,"I may be in the minority, but I feel that ""The Birds"" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans.Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in.One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in ""The Birds,"" when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, ""Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!""There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall ""The Birds"" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nevermore.,"Much like Hitchcock's other horror film, 'The Birds (1963)' feels like it's being interrupted by its inevitable horrific aspects, playing like a traditional romantic comedy for over an hour before its eponymous creatures come pecking proper. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. The picture is generally enjoyable even during its more mundane segments. The relationships established in the first act do carry throughout the rest of the feature; they serve as the backbone that keeps all the bird attacks together. The movie isn't incredibly exciting, outside of a few well-achieved set-pieces, and it does sort of settle into a repetitive pacing in its latter half. It feels generally quite basic, too; there's very little in the way of twists or turns and it all seems sort of surface-level. Still, it's a solid effort with typically convincing special effects. It's entertaining throughout. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Real 'Why',"I've seen this movie many times and I think I finally got it (with apologies to any posts already saying this, that I have not read). Incidentally, it's a nearly perfect film, I'm not a Hitchcock fanatic by any means, and the only real flaw is the sequence of three stills of Melanie in the diner window.Never mind. It's Mom behind the 'bird war'. It's Jessica Tandy. We know of only one attack prior to Melanie's arrival - the gulls and the fishing boat - and it may be that was a little bit of Lydia Brenner premonition. Just watch all the scenes in the Brenner house; every time Cathy expresses affection for Melanie, Tandy is stressed. Same with Mitch. Then come the birds. Most telling is the climactic attack later on, when they're all sitting and waiting in the boarded home. Cathy feels sick and turns to Melanie, not her mother. Two minutes later...Then, before the schoolhouse attack, Lydia asks Melanie three times if Cathy will be safe there. She knows, somehow. And don't forget that, the birds aside, the pivotal tension in the storyline is Lydia's neurotic dread of being abandoned.What is very cool is that Lydia is unaware of what she is creating through her distress.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun And Good,"THE BIRDS is a fun film by one of my favorite directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock. I've seen just about everything he made. This is by no means his masterpiece but it still holds up after all these years. It's unique and never boring. A classic, often shown on TV.Granted, it's nothing compared to the likes of PSYCHO or VERTIGO, for instance, just to name a few. He made tons of great pictures, and this falls somewhere in the middle. Better than most of his very early work. Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pecking Order,"Tippi Hedren (as Melanie Daniels) visits a San Francisco pet shop when Rod Taylor (as Mitch Brenner) cruises in, looking to pick up some lovebirds for his little sister. When Mr. Taylor mistakes the beautiful and alluring Ms. Hedren for an employee, she plays along, obviously attracted to the handsome man. Since the shop has none of Taylor's desired lovebirds, wealthy Hedren orders some up. Then, she decides to personally deliver them to Taylor's out-of-the-way home, on an island in Bodega Bay. After secretly delivering the lovebirds, Hedren is attacked by a seagull. The freakish incident causes Hedren to stay in Bodega Bay; there, she becomes acquainted with locals, like schoolteacher Suzanne Pleshette (as Annie Hayworth) and Taylor's mother Jessica Tandy (as Lydia Brenner).Inexplicable terror, laced with sexual desire - ""The Birds"" is one of director Alfred Hitchcock's best.Worth noting: The lovebirds get excited, but never attack. Hedren makes a sensational starring debut. Brenner daughter ""Cathy"" looks like Angela Cartwright for a very good reason, she's Angela's sister Veronica. The Daphne Du Maurier short story ""The Birds"" (1952) only slightly resembles Hitchcock's film adaptation. An even earlier ""Battle of the Birds"" occurred in the Fawcett comic ""Captain Marvel Jr. #90"" (October 1950). The story, probably written by Otto Binder, provides an explanation for the madness in, ""the seeds of the Pyrrhic Plantthat drives all types of birds into a murderous rage!""********** The Birds (3/28/63) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Terrifying, an excellent horror movie!","The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",,Anonymous,Horror
Feathered Fear,"The Birds, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a quintessential example of the master's ability to transform the mundane into the terrifying. With its unnerving premise of a small town inexplicably attacked by aggressive flocks of birds, the film stands as an influential work in horror cinema. However, it doesn't quite reach the storytelling or character depth of some of Hitchcock's other iconic films, such as Psycho or Rear Window.Tippi Hedren shines as Melanie Daniels, bringing a poised yet enigmatic quality to her role, though her character feels less nuanced compared to other Hitchcock heroines. Rod Taylor offers a solid performance as Mitch Brenner, though the romantic subplot between Mitch and Melanie doesn't generate the chemistry or emotional stakes needed to anchor the human drama amidst the chaos.Where The Birds excels is in its atmosphere and suspense. Hitchcock's meticulous pacing builds an almost unbearable sense of dread as the bird attacks escalate. The absence of a musical score-relying instead on the unsettling sound of flapping wings and piercing cries-amplifies the tension, creating a uniquely eerie soundscape. The unexplained nature of the attacks enhances the film's chilling effect, leaving audiences unnerved by the randomness of nature's fury.The film's visual effects, while groundbreaking for the 1960s, can feel dated by contemporary standards, with some attack sequences bordering on the unintentionally humorous. However, many scenes, such as the ominous gathering of birds on playground equipment, remain deeply effective and iconic.One of the film's most polarising aspects is its ambiguous ending, which provides no resolution or explanation for the bird attacks. While this open-ended approach adds to the film's haunting quality, it may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied or frustrated.The Birds is a testament to Hitchcock's talent for building suspense and creating horror from the ordinary, but its pacing and lack of character depth make it feel uneven at times. Despite these shortcomings, its impact on the genre and its unforgettable imagery secure its place in film history.In conclusion, The Birds is a classic that excels in atmosphere and suspense, even if it doesn't achieve the narrative perfection of Hitchcock's finest works. Its legacy endures as a reminder of the master's ability to make the familiar deeply unsettling.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Beyond Categories; Outstanding Impact,"Having seen THE BIRDS, you might take a stroll and accidentally notice crows flying nearby. Nobody around seems to pay attention and you feel a bit at odds with the situation. ""Are they going to attack me...?"" you think. And it is not merely Hitchcock's intention but the truly outstanding impact of great piece of cinema.Based on Daphne Du Maurier's story (the author of REBECCA), the film is probably most associated with the Master of Suspense thanks to his splendid rapport with the screenwriter Evan Hunter who adapted the story to the screen. The movie's major strength lies in its flawless storytelling, buildup of tension and study of characters. That makes any viewer emotionally and intellectually involved since everything occurs to be perfectly measured and, yet, surprising. The movie does not display the mainstay themes; there is no McGuffin, there are no explanations, climaxes, explicit references. Nevertheless, it deserves to be called ""Hitchcock's last unflawed film"" (David Thomson) where, in Hitchcock's very intention to ""scare the hell out of people,"" it still haunts as ""a threat of unspeakable horror"" (Bosley Crowther, NYTimes). However, what makes it a movie beyond categories is the fact that it does not aspire to thriller but goes far beyond.If it were not for the credits and the lack of music score (replaced by the sounds of birds that powerfully aid the mood), we would actually assume that we are watching some story that, on the one hand, presents to us captivating characters and, on the other hand, some theme for psychoanalysis. Mitch and Melanie meet in a rather unexpected circumstances at a birds' shop in San Francisco. Just to note that Mr Hitchcock makes his cameo performance quite soon so that we can direct our curiosity towards something else. The action moves to Bodega Bay that supplies the atmosphere with a rather English flair. There, Melanie gets to know people seemingly living together but innerly being quite closed within their angst. Mind you what brings her there to Mitch's house. A gift for his young sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) - two love birds. Crowther nicely defines them as ""one of nature's most innocent creatures and one of man's most melodious friends."" The hidden meaning of this gift, however, works as a 'contrast' for events to come. And the plot would rather develop in a natural human way where love takes over if it were not for the prophets of doom and messengers of terror, the title birds whose noises shade the chirping of the love birds.Indeed, much has been said about such effective depiction of the birds' attacks. Those images are simply 'carved' in your memory and appear to create unforgettable emotions. The incredibly lasting effect predominates thanks to no explanation of why they attack. Xan Brooks in The Guardian accurately points out that the movie ""provides no answers and no escape."" We actually do not know how it all ends. There is no Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco, no trip of the escaper as it was initially planned, no additional thrills; there is as little as and as much as an image, horrifying, gloomy, and pessimistic where the aggressive intruders from the air take sovereign control over the land, over the world, conclusively. However, the horror depicted in those images, including the victims of the attacks, is merely a miniature of what the film really offers to more cautious viewers, cautious to details and analysis. For if the thrill may become dated as more decades pass, this aspect predominates as essentially timeless.CHARACTERS: The rather uncomplicated nature of the plot goes with a truly sophisticated, complex study of the characters. The movie's triumph are the narrative elements which Crowther labeled as ""clear"" and ""naturalistic"" because that provides extraordinary insight into the personalities portrayed. Melanie is, on the one hand, a typical Hitchcock blonde - beautiful, sophisticated, a woman of appeal you might easily be taken with and, on the other hand, a character of naiveness and freshness; an outsider for others not feeling totally at ease in Bodega Bay. That odd feeling is intensified when she meets the teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette) and discovers that she used to be Mitch's girlfriend. Mitch delivers certain features of a mama's boy (Hitchcock's fertile theme) but appears to be sympathetic. What emerges as embodiment of angst and fear of loneliness is his mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy), a character of constant 'presence' and permanent 'distance.' But for any viewer fond of social significance, one scene is a masterwork.The TIDES RESTAURANT scene alone is the sufficient reason for seeing the film. A display of various characters at the face of a problem. The true problem, however, lies in the fact that they either refuse to admit a problem or exaggerate it. There is hardly anyone who would offer us something objective, realistic. There is Mrs Bundy (Ethel Griffies), an ornithologist who embodies skepticism of a scientist and pride of human mind ready to give the answer to anything. She builds all her theses on reason. Although she becomes intellectually involved in the possible assumptions, she does not in the possible solutions. On the totally opposite point, there is a religious devout, a distortion of religion's essence whose prophetic affiliations lead him to one condensed utterance: ""This is the end of the world."" Both of them contribute very little to the situation. In between, amidst the gore of talks, comes a more 'humane' personality of a mother afraid for her kids and a man who finds so simple a solution...In all, some of them resort merely to words, others to deeds and media...highly measured and condensed informing. What occurs, however, is the fact that nature stands above human reasoning. Furthermore, it may indeed scare the hell out of us...And that thought should, perhaps, accompany us while watching THE BIRDS - an outstanding movie of visual, intellectual, emotional impact beyond categories evocative of something uncommon, scary, memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tame this Hitch review now!,I usually like films from legendary director Alfred Hitchcock.His brand of suspense thrillers and technical film wizardry for the era are strongpoints. So it is with some degree of trepidation that my review of such a well known Hitchcock film is mediocre.I just found the build up starring the two principal actors Tippi Hedren as Socialite Melanie Daniels and Australian Rod Taylor as San Francisco lawyer Mitch Brenner...boring.It begins with some potential romance scenario where Brenner and Taylor meet each other in a pet store before the film cuts to Daniels driving up the California coast to a resort called Bodega Bay where Taylor spends weekends with his domineering mother Lydia Brenner (Jessica Tandy).Eventually some bird action occurs as Daniels is attacked by a rogue seagull. Scenes are shown featuring other bird species in attack mode such as sparrows and crows.The horror of the bird attacks look tame by modern standards but I imagine back in 1963 they caused a stir.In one scene a dead body with no eyeballs is shown.The film was produced way before computer effects so relies on special effects from cameras and film. They do the job adequately.The film ends quite abruptly without providing adequate resolution in my opinion. Questions are left unanswered.Why do the birds attack the coastal town?Does outsider to the town Daniels have some link?,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Just Could Have Been Better,"I don't know exactly why, but ""The Birds"" sometimes leaves me a little cold. I admire the sense of threat, some of the signature scenes (the playground, the service station, Tippi Hedren going into the attic, the broken glass in the phone booth), but the pacing just seems slow. The pacing, however, seems slow. There is a lack of economy that I am used to in my favorite Hitchcock movies. Nevertheless, it is still a very good film. I love the premise it is based on. The DuMaurier story is more bleak and hopeless, the Hitchcock more open ended-still, the threat is there. My criticisms may seem petty, but spending less time on exposition may have made this a much tighter production. Also, I have nothing against romance, but the relationship between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren takes up too much time from the issue at hand--THE BIRDS!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A little bird brained, but not too bad","Hitchcock's 'The Birds', is not quite the masterpiece that ranks with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window', but it's still interesting. The film was probably quite influential in the movie trend of having animals of all types attack, and that may not be a good thing. Bees, ants, cats, dogs, spiders, bats, fish, bears and rats are some of the animals used in such films, and I'm sure that guinea pigs, harbor seals, and penguins are in the works by pioneering animal attack auteurs.The viewer has to suspend their disbelief that sparrows and sea gulls are deadly minions of human destruction, but the special effects and credibility gap make that kind of a stretch. People may think that with today's CGI effects that this film is perfect for a remake, and maybe so, but can't the movie viewing public encourage fresh ideas with our movie dollar votes? Hitchcock tried to cultivate a sense of uneasiness throughout the film, a creepiness and mystery that makes the viewer feel that weird things are possible, but I mostly felt that through Jessica Tandy's strange performance as the mother.All in all, not a terrible film, and fun as a Hitchcock time capsule sort of film, but not one of Hitchcock's best by a long shot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tedious and contrived story line,"I normally enjoy watching an Alfred Hitchcock film, but sadly this one falls well short of his usual standards. It suffers from a meandering script, and too much inconsequential and dreary dialogue between Tippi Hedren (Melanie Daniels) and Rod Taylor, who plays 'Mitch' her romantic interest. However, the film is handicapped by the fact that there is very little sexual chemistry between these two - and to make matters worse, Tippi Hedren's performance is limp and unconvincing. Rod Taylor's character is not exactly interesting - and so it's up to the rest of the supporting cast to give the film some sparkle. There are some great cameo parts. Ethel Griffies is superb as the ornithologist - as is Ruth McDevitt, the owner of the bird shop. Jessica Tandy also gives a strong performance as Mitch's mother. But the problem here is that the director seems torn between presenting a 'love story' or giving the audience a traditional horror story. Sadly, it falls between two stalls. The lack of realism is highlighted by the fact that Tippi Hedren is always 'dressed up to the hilt' (never without high heels) and heavily made up, despite her stay in this sleepy harbour community, where the folk are always casually dressed, while Rod Taylor never steps out of his suit and tie, whatever the social circumstances. The actual scenes of the birds swooping down on their victims, causing mayhem wears a little thin by the end of the film - and certainly doesn't induce much horror. The harbour locations are interesting but a significant number of scenes are shot in the studio, making the film look 'cheesy.'

Wings of desire.,"Certainly one of the stranger movies of his career, Alfred Hitchcock nevertheless is able to astound and amaze use even forty years after the release of this story of horrific occurrences in a small bay side town involving fine-feather friends.What makes this a memorable experience despite its shortcomings, is how Hitchcock never explains to us the reason behind the birds. They attack but essentially there is no logical or natural reason to understand this. Perhaps it is supernatural, but that also is never examined. What Hitchcock wants to do is put ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and study how they behave. He did this in Psycho, North by Northwest, and Vertigo which are three of his personal best as well as three of the best films ever made. Here, he uses elements from those films and creates a rather dizzying portrait of a small group of people trying to band together and fight against whatever nature brings them.I'm not quite sure what Hitchcock is trying to say here. Perhaps he is saying that sometimes nature will impose its will on us and we shouldn't try and fight it. Or maybe he is suggesting we do fight back. However, I think that is besides the point as this is yet again a huge step forward for movies from the 1960s. Hitchcock insisted on using the ground-breaking technique from Disney to combine two different backgrounds and foregrounds to create shots that seem to be together but really weren't. Even today, this stands as some of the finest examples in special effects. Some elements of the story don't work as well as his other movies, but this is an enjoyable and strangely mesmerizing tale of scary things happening in a place you wouldn't expect by creatures you wouldn't expect. Next time, cover your head when you go outside.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Enduring Story,"Although most people have seen this Hitchcock favorite from 1963 whether at the theater, on television, on videotape, on DVD, or online many of them should see it again.It's far more than some trivial fright movie. The obvious fact that real birds usually do not, nor are they much likely to, act that way, at least not on that scale, should be a clue to a deeper symbolic exercise.Although Bodega Bay, home and weekend retreat of Mitch Brenner, is a mere quaint hamlet, it can be rife with the same social, economic and political intricacies likely faced by the people in San Francisco, where he works.The list of interesting characters at Bodega Bay includes a sort of postman, a schoolteacher and a policeman. There is probably a church and a hospital of sorts as well, but those and the people who work there are not obvious in the movie. There is however first aid and a community discussion at a diner.At that diner as well as for the real world audience the bird attacks, real or not, serve as the topic of the community discussion.The social, economic and political intricacies of today across this country are much the same as in the Bodega Bay of the movie. The birds in the movie might not be following real bird nature, but the humans in the movie are following real human nature.",,Anonymous,Horror
Don't give this the bird,"Hitchcock pulls off an interesting theme. What's different about this film compared to other horrors is typically the main villain/creature is something many people fear. Although some do fear birds, most don't. Hitchcock somehow manages to create incredibly vulnerable scenarios. Thousands of birds in a jungle gym watching you. Image how powerless you would be under an attack of thousands of birds.This film starts strong. I felt engaged with the characters. Melanie trying to get back and prank Mitch a nice adventure. When the adventure and characters are introduced we then see the birds influence. Melanie and Mitch are engaging and interesting to follow and give this plot some nice direction.The issue with the film would just be the time filmed. If this would've got done 20 or more years later they could've created better violent bird scenes. Them pecking you to death is hard to film and funny looking. Also just had to use a backdrop on a lot. Did anyone also think they used cat meows and contorted them to make it sound more like birds?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""The Birds"" is one of the most shocking and terrifying movies ever made","After the success ""Psycho,"" Alfred Hitchcock turns his next film about birds that attack human nature. Hitchcock thought he was only making a ""B"" movie, but when the critics saw it they thought that Hitchcock is too good for making ""The Birds"" a ""B"" movie. So it now means that ""The Birds"" went from a ""B"" movie to an ""A"" movie. That is very much like when Steven Spielberg thought he was making ""Jaws"" a ""B"" movie, but it wasn't. I thought the story was great and it really works that there is no need to explain why the birds are attacking and killing people. This suspense of this movie really works, and does its job to not make things laughable. ""The Birds"" does keep you on the edge of your seat and wonder if the birds will attack and kill people. There is no music by Bernard Herrmann in this movie, but it does make it more effective when you only hear sounds like birds and such. The special effects in this movie are great, and they do a great job to get the birds into frame when they are attacking. However, I will admit that some of the projector screens are good and some are not, but that is just only a minor nitpick. The cast did wonderful in this movie. I give props to Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, and a young Veronica Cartwright. ""The Birds"" is one of the most shocking and terrifying movies ever made.

Rushed ending,"Despite the simple concept, ""The Birds"" is one of Hitch's most complex and experimental films. The first half is a rather dull and frivolous romantic comedy, but once nature suddenly starts to turn against mankind, it becomes a whole different film. The special effects look a bit cheesy now, but they still managed to creep me out except maybe the school evacuation scene. The last thirty minutes, when the threat reaches apocalyptic levels, have some of the most disturbing and lingering ""natural"" horror scenes ever made. When the birds start attacking the house, I couldn't help feeling as sick as Cathy. The uncanny atmosphere that can be felt from the beginning also comes from the fact that the film uses no music at all. The silence is always broke by the piercing cries of the birds.It must be said that it's an incomplete film under too many aspects, though. I didn't expect to get an explanation of what happened or the menace to go away, but the ending feels rushed as if it was the first episode of a TV show. It was so anti-climatic to see them getting away a few times as the birds deliberately chose not to attack anymore. I would have preferred to see all of them die instead.

"""Mitch, this isn't usual is it?""","Daphne Du Maurier absolutely hated the last of the three adaptations he based on her work; hardly surprising as only the climax (SLIGHT SPOILER COMING:) when the principals are besieged by birds bears any resemblance to her 1952 short story, although along with 'Psycho' it's the film that saw Hitchcock admitted to the pantheon of horror directors.The most Hitchcockian feature - seldom commented upon- is the character of the ornithologist; since Hitchcock knew full well that countless clever-dicks would emerge from the cinema denying birds would ever attack en masse, so he craftily put their arguments in the mouth of one of the characters, who promptly saw her words thrown straight back in her face.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great suspense, good characters. Unhinged plot","""Why are they doing this, the birds?"" - the question on everyone's mind in this movie that nobody-I'd argue not even the director himself-seems to have an answer for. What was interesting about this movie was how stark of a plot switch happens once the horror takes off. I enjoyed the slice-of-life rom com the first half of the movie led us through (the opening scene at the bird shop was a brilliant introduction to our two leads, Mitch and Melanie), and the switch to inexplicable bird attack-based horror in the second half, despite all the bird imagery all throughout the film, is quite jarring. For all the successful visual suspense Hitchcock builds in the sequences leading up to attack sequences, such as the scene on the jungle gym, I was a bit underwhelmed watching the attack sequences. I don't think we needed more gore or anything like that per se, but I think a conventional movie score could've better heightened the stakes of the attacks and made this horror movie more... well, scary!That all being said, it's clear Hitchcock is a great visual filmmaker, and the characters are well-drawn. This plot is unhinged, though, and while I'd be down for that in the hands of a great filmmaker like Hitchcock, I was a bit ambivalent on the bird attacks themselves. I think a score could've gone a long way.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
a treasure for all true movie fans,"43 years after it was initially released the Birds is still a stunning, haunting, masterpiece. Hitchcock's last great film, the special effects hold up well especially with newly digitally mastered prints as well as DVD'S . I just watched the movie on T.V. for the perhaps 30th time and it was the clearest , cleanest print of the BIRDS I'd ever seen . DVD included. One thing that often gets overlooked in a Hitchcock film is the acting. The acting in this film is terrific. It seems static at first but that is perhaps due to the lack of a sound track. During the horrific scenes near the end of the movie the acting is near letter perfect including Tippi Hedren who had never been in a movie before. Her depiction of someone who has been traumatized by birds is one of the most honest pieces of film acting I think I have ever seen. As for the rest ... well let's just say this is a timeless movie that is a treasure for all real movie fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mesmerising, Ingenious, Wildly original piece of melodramatic cinema","""They're birds, aren't they?"".This film is truly a Ornithophobic's nightmare and is a film that makes you think of what menial power humans have in contrast to the potential power the animal kingdom can have over us.Its about a small harbour city that gets terrorised by all the birds that live there such as the Crows and Seagulls. The birds turn deranged and militant.The question is why do these birds turn on mankind? Hitchcock never stated a reason but it is widely believed that the birds turning against mankind is a symbol of how much us as humans live on the edge of the animal kingdom. Think about it, there are 100 billion birds on earth, if they turned against us, mankind would shrivel away.Its a frightening thought and the film presents this thought which leads to a chilling classic.There is no music in this film which although is original, i believe it tones down the tension of the film. However, the absence of digetic sound gives the audience a natural feel towards the film. Its a very down to earth and natural movie.In conclusion, this is a definitive hitchcock classic, note to the squeamish: avoid! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not a 10, but close","Hitchcock is one of the best directors ever. The special affects will make you cringe. But you'll probably forgive that because of other elements like: script, cinematography, location, thought-provoking eco-commentary, etc.
Why did I give it such a high rating? Because in the hands of another director this story would've come across like Plan 9 From Outer Space.
I also like the fact that the movie spends as much time making you think as it does tapping into your primal fears.

Classic Story,"I saw this movie a couple times as a child and for some reason was not frightened by it. But I have revisited it as an adult and I can now understand it much better. To me now, this movie is a lot more frightening than other ""scary"" movies I've seen. I think what makes it more terrifying than a monster flick, is because we all know that monsters aren't real. At least the traditional ones. But birds ARE real. The birds that were used in this movie still exist and are everywhere. What could be more frightening than something that is so ordinary, in nature, suddenly turning its back on us? It's really very unsettling.I think they did a great job casting this movie, every actor fit their part. No one seemed or looked oddly misplaced. A couple scenes seemed oddly edited for me, though. Almost like they suddenly skipped over or the sound would happen before a scene. But that could have been the copy that I have.I'll end this review by saying that my mother is actually afraid of birds because of this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Surprisingly Scary,"I have always vaguely heard about The Birds. But to be honest it sounded a little weird to me, so I always skipped it. After my sister told me how terrified she was from it and nothing else being on tv, i decided to watch it.

Not only did this movie scare the crap out of me, i was on the edge of my seat until the very end. I have loved scary movies for as long as I can remember and it takes ALOT to scare me. Well this movie no doubt did it! I was more into the cult horrors and Halloween than Hitchcock, but after watching this movie I will be searching to see what other classics i have snottily overlooked. 
I only wish the ending cleared up some questions... such as WHY????? (only reason for the 9)

Hitchcock the innovator,"One of my sci-fi/horror/fantasy reviews written 50 years ago: Directed and Produced by Alfred Hitchcock; Screenplay by Evan Hunter, based on Daphne De Maurier's story; Photography by Robert Burks; edited by George Tomasini; special effects by Lawrence A.

Horror derived from unexpected and inexplicable attacks by birds on the inhabitants of a small seaport Bodega Bay. Subtle generating of suspense and plot development combines with creative stagings to fashion a classic.",,Anonymous,Horror
It's a Hitchcock film,"One of the most innovative aspects here is a lack of any musical score of any kind. Hitch's long-time partner Bernard Herrman is listed as ""sound consultant"" and I'm sure he had something to do with the ominous sounds of the various birds, as their building wrath is indicated by their squawks. The attack scenes are a bit dated, but considering the technology of the day was pre-historic compared to the computer generated effects of today, they come across chillingly. Some birds were props, others hand-drawn, even others real. The film surprisingly benefits from a lack of music, heightening the suspense. Tippi Hedren is the icy blonde and a standard of Hitch's movies, the jealous or overbearing mother, is played by Jessica Tandy (in an awkwardly distant role). Performances aside, Hitch does something he wished not to do in PSYCHO. The bloody attacks are in bright technicolor, and one scene depicting a victim of the birds is quite shocking. Hitch was afraid of showing the bloody carnage of the 'shower scene' in color, leaving it to the viewer's imagination. It works here, showing the blood-red evil happening in this everyday small town.If you are claustrophobic, I would avoid THE BIRDS. Like Janet Leigh in the PSYCHO shower scene, Tippi Hedren is caught in a phone booth in one of many tight situations, shot from overhead. Otherwise, let Sir Alfred play you like a piano, like he so often has before !",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not the best Hitchcock, but good","Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives to a small Northern California town and notices the birds have gone crazy.They start attacking people for what ever reason and even killing them.Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963) doesn't represent the best of Hitchcock.I could say it's slightly overrated.But still it makes a pretty good thriller, a movie that will keep you nailed to your seats till the end.Tippi Hedren as well as the rest of the cast does an excellent job.Rod Taylor is great as Mitch Brenner.Jessica Tandy is brilliant as Lydia Brenner.Suzanne Pleshette is wonderful as Annie Hayworth.Veronica Cartwright is Cathy Brenner, and she's doing very good job.There are some classic scenes in the movie.My favorite one is the scene where Melanie is in the phone booth watching the birds causing a disaster.It looks like the world is coming to an end outside the phone booth and Melanie is there to witness that.This may not be the master's best work, but thinking what some of the modern filmmakers would have done with birds as villains of the movie...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Film,"This movie is great, but I think it lacked a resolution and the ending disappointed me. It was definitely Hitchcock's darkest movie, and it unfolded in a great way. I have a few problems, but I won't bicker. The effects are great for its time. You can tell that they've been chroma-keyed from todays view, but what it has done has made the movie genuinely scary. Where are the birds? Oh, they're there! Will they attack? Oh yes, they are! The gore is pretty full on too, to think Hitchcock made Psycho Black and White because he thought it would be too gory. This gore is Life-Like! I couldn't tell if they were real people or not. It's a great movie though.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant,"I like how this story was built up over the flirtation between a young socialite (Tippi Hedren) and a lawyer (Rod Taylor), who meet each other by chance in a bird store in San Francisco. She goes up to Bodega Bay to surprise him with a couple of lovebirds, and meets his ex (Suzanne Pleshette), mother (Jessica Tandy), and sister (Veronica Cartwright). She also, of course, meets swarms of angry birds, who attack mercilessly without warning, and for no apparent reason.The fact that the attacks are unexplained is genius, as it implies a malevolent force of nature beyond our understanding. It's all the scarier because there isn't some easily identified cause, meaning the birds could strike at any time in the film, and by eerie suggestion, to viewers on the way out to their cars in the parking lot. The open-endedness of it is brilliant.Hitchcock was at the top of his game here, and there are many masterful moments of tension, e.g. in the schoolyard, at a gas station, and in an attic. I absolutely loved the soundtrack, with its other-worldly bird squawking and fluttering, and more importantly, its silences. In many of the film's big scenes, there is absolutely no background music, which amplified their power for me. The way bodies are discovered is fantastic. The shot from way up high is too, where we see a fire and humans scurrying around, suddenly no longer masters of their world. The cinematography is beautiful, and I think this is one of the most scenic of Hitchcock's films.For my taste, the pacing of the film, which very gradually gets the birds involved in sinister acts, is excellent, though it may be slow for some viewers. It's not until about an hour in that the real mayhem starts, and there is downtime between waves. The dialogue during this periods sometimes is quite entertaining, such as the family discussion in which Hitchcock works in sex (the story of Hedren's character swimming nude in Rome), violence (the client Taylor's character defends who shot his wife in the head six times), and his droll humor (he murdered her because she changed the channel during the ball game). At other times, it drags a bit, such as the talk between Hedren and Tandy after the latter has been traumatized and needs to rest. I appreciated the slow buildup though, and felt the tension over the second half.The Birds capped an extraordinary run in Hitchcock's career - there were earlier masterpieces as well of course, but Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), and The Birds (1963) are a pretty damn impressive string. This is essential viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Highly entertaining horror,"This film is the same age as me, so forgive me if I show a soft spot for it!In Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds', Melanie Daniels (played by Tippi Hedren) drives to Bodega Bay (near San Fransisco) to deliver a pair of love birds to Mitch Brenner (played by Rod Taylor). The trip is really just an excuse to see him again - her intrigue in him kicking in through a chance meeting in a pet store shortly before.Bodega Bay is a quiet, pretty place by the sea - not much extraordinary is likely to happen, except that the birds appear to be acting strangely. Melanie is attacked by a gull, and some school children are harangued by a flock of birds during an outdoor party. What's going on?Well, I don't think it is a spoiler to say that the birds are the monsters and these incidents are just the beginning.If you forget about today's impressive cgi production technologies and embrace the special effects standards from back in the 1960s, you can enjoy this film - not least because there's far more to it than killer birds.Tippi Hedren delivers a performance that is always watchable and absorbing - even when not much is happening - and Hitch provides his customary complex commentary on mothers. Jessica Tandy is excellent as Mitch's mum, and her relationship with Mitch and with his new admirer is a strong part of the narrative.The film has some truly fine moments, good supporting characters and an unusual, much-debated ending that is certainly in the 'love it or hate it' category. I especially like the way Hitch uses the noise of the birds to suggest threat rather than relying on the more traditional menacing music that accompanies most horror films.An entertaining and recommended watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alfred Hitchcock Uses His Talent To Mock The Audience,"""I'm such a skilled director with such clever wit, I could make them afraid of birds if I wanted to,"" - Said Alfred Hitchcock, probably.

Unsettling Apocalyptic Hitchcock - Totally Memorable,"The Birds - one of my favourite Hitchcock films - is based around a young socialite/prankster (Tippi Hedren) who sets her eyes on a sexy lawyer (Rod Taylor).  She follows him to Bodega Bay with a couple of caged ""Love-Birds"" and is herself, followed by flocks of Birds. When I was young and watched this - I thought it was fairly cheesy - with non-convincing special effects - but good for a bit of a squeal. But recently watching it again, from an adult perspective - I found it quite apocalyptic and unsettling in the way it brings up ideas of environmental damage and man against beast.  The way Hitchcock devises tension in this film is quite memorable and fantastic. I love the warped ""Bird"" soundtrack - which just adds to the surrealness of it all.

Strange yet hypnotic psychological horror movie...,"1st watched 3/9/2007 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Strange yet hypnotic psychological horror movie from the never predictable Alfred Hitchcock. The movie starts out as the lead character, played by Tippi Hedren, meets the male lead in a pet store and then begins an almost stalker-like obsessive trek to find this man(ala. Jimmy Stewart going after Kim Novak in Vertigo except the sexes are reversed). Once she finds him in a small bay town and gives his sister a gift of two love-birds, the local birds start acting strange; first attacking her and then everyone and everything else. Along the way, we find out bits & pieces about many of the character's lives turning it into a bit of a drama until the final attacks of the birds in the last third of the movie. At this point it becomes more of a standard horror flick until the end. The question keeps coming up about why the birds are doing this and why now?? We never find this out and the movie ends extremely abruptly lending us to wonder what this was all about. Despite this, the movie does more than most movies these days -- it keeps your attention. Hitchcock seems to always be able to do this no matter what the subject is. This time it just happens to be birds and relationships in a small bay town, the next time maybe a weirdo in a hotel??",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Master of Suspense at His Schlockiest,"""When I was a budding young cinephile, my parents started to introduce me and my siblings to some of Hitchcock's tamer films like ""North by Northwest"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and this film. These films made quite an impression on me when I was young, but I grew older and watched more of Hitchcock's oeuvre, and whenever I was in the mood to watch one of his films I found myself gravitating towards either rewatching my favorite- ""Psycho""- or checking out one the films of his that I had not seen as a child (like ""Rebecca"" or ""Notorious""). It had been a long time since I had revisited this film, so when we at TMM decided to revisit Hitchcock, I thought this would be a great time to go back to a movie I hadn't seen in probably fifteen years.I remembered this film to be pretty intense, but that was from the perspective of myself as a child. I honestly was a bit nervous to revisit this, because, out of all of Hitch's films, I have to say that this one probably has the schlockiest plot. Nevertheless, I started my journey to Bodega Bay, and to my delight, I found the film not only still holds up, it completely elevates all of the schlocky elements to the point that it becomes artistic. It just goes to show you how great of a director Hitchcock really was.I think the thing I like most about this film is the way that it sort of starts off as a rather melodramatic romance, plodding along rather pleasantly, before it shifts, ever so violently, and suddenly the viewer finds him or herself in a horror flick. This sort of structuring isn't unusual for Hitch (look at ""Psycho"" which starts out as a thriller about a secretary stealing forty-thousand dollars, before it shifts, and we're suddenly watching a movie about a mad, cross-dressing serial killer), but it does put the viewer in a position of feeling unprepared for whatever will happen next. I think one of the reasons I like that shift so much is because A) it allows time for us to get to know the characters and their backstories, and B) when freak phenomenon happen (realistic or fantastical) usually there isn't a lot of warning when said phenomenon occurs. Not only does it feel far more realistic to have our characters wandering about their lives, going about whatever it was that they would normally be doing before the phenomenon happens, it makes it much more frightening when that shift does happen.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Technically excellent but.....,"I very much understand the technical importance of this film regarding the difficulty and incision of Hitchcock's magic but I also think this ranks among his most overrated films.

"Dark, Large, and fundamentally Hitchcokian.","Continuing with his Birds and Mothers themes carried over from his previous movie ""Psycho"", Hitchcock went all out for what is one of his goriest, and most disturbing films. He combined the visceral violence of ""Psycho"" with the large set pieces of ""North by Northwest"" creating a paranoid and frantic thriller, which successfully turns a mundane creature into a frightening nightmare.The Story starts, as many Hitchcock films before it, with the introduction of a young blonde woman. Although Tippi Hendren was a poor replacement for Grace Kelly, she performs adequately in the role of an initially shallow young woman. Much has been said of Hitchcock's treatment of hair during production, and Hendren herself has made some particularly libelous statements. But whatever he did, it managed to illicit of truly fearful performance during the more integral moments of the film.The Bird motif is established early on, as the first scene takes place in a Bird Shop where they're all caged and harmless, a condition which evidently changes as the film goes on. As the woman decides to pursue a man, a drama story is established, as she contends with his mother and integrates herself with his family and the town of Bodega Bay. Alongside this is the increasing intensity of Bird attacks, until eventually the focus of the story shifts to this in the final act. The slow and meticulous unraveling of the story not only allows for Hitchcock to drum up suspense, it also means that when the characters are under the most extreme threat we have spent a lot of time with them, and know them inside and out. This means that we feel every hit that they take, as well as making us more fearful for them.The choice of Hitchcock to not use a traditional soundtrack, despite having Bernard Herman at his disposal, was an inspired one. The cawing of the Birds is a grating and piercing noise, and is more relevant to the content of the film than a traditional horror score. The film looks beautiful, the camera captures the picturesque nature of the setting perfectly,and it is filled with strong primary colours. These 2 things make it a major departure from ""Psycho"" and shows what a pioneering and innovative director Hitchcock was, always looking to change and challenge himself, while still employing his tried and tested techniques of drumming up tension and suspense.This is an excellent thriller, and you'll likely never look at Birds the same way again.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Title: The Birds (1963) - A Classic Thriller That Still Scares,"Directed by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, ""The Birds"" is a timeless thriller that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release in 1963. Set in a picturesque coastal town of Bodega Bay, California, the film follows the increasingly terrifying attacks of birds on the town's residents, without any clear explanation.Hitchcock, known for his meticulous attention to detail and ability to build suspense, expertly crafts a chilling atmosphere from the very beginning. The slow buildup of tension, accompanied by the eerie absence of a musical score, creates an unnerving sense of dread that permeates every scene.One of the film's strengths lies in its simplicity. Rather than relying on elaborate special effects, Hitchcock utilizes the innate fear of the unknown to great effect. The sight of ordinary birds gathering en masse, their motives ambiguous and inexplicable, serves as a potent symbol of nature turning against humanity.Central to the film's success is the character of Melanie Daniels, played brilliantly by Tippi Hedren. As the film's protagonist, Melanie undergoes a harrowing journey from a carefree socialite to a woman fighting for survival in the face of an inexplicable threat. Hedren's nuanced performance adds depth to the character, making her someone the audience can root for amidst the chaos.The film's climax, set in the Brenner family home, is a masterclass in suspenseful filmmaking. As the avian assailants launch a relentless assault on the house, Hitchcock ratchets up the tension to almost unbearable levels. The lack of a clear resolution only adds to the film's haunting impact, leaving audiences to ponder the implications long after the credits roll.Despite being released over half a century ago, ""The Birds"" remains a powerful testament to Hitchcock's mastery of the thriller genre. Its timeless themes of paranoia, survival, and the fragility of human civilization continue to resonate with viewers, ensuring its status as a classic of cinema that is as terrifying today as it was upon its initial release.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
strangely understated,"First saw this film when it was released in the spring of 1963- at that time I was 11 years old. It was scary and compelling to me as a young kid.I have seen the film countless times since- and own the DVD version. Filmed in early 1962, the film shows those great early 60s' fashions as designed in the film by icon Edith Head- it also harks back in a way to JFK and Camelot.Tippi Hedren looked great in the French twist hairdo- and those stiletto spiked heels. Taylor at times looks like he was wearing something President Kennedy would have worn then.The acting is solid, yet unremarkable. All the leads are very good. The cinematography is nearly flawless. There is no musical soundtrack- again very unique- but the soundtrack is the 'birds' and the one conceived by maestro Bernard Hermann.I have been to Bodega Bay many times (the town burned down mostly in the late 60s) - though the Tides restaurant remains as does the schoolhouse -which is located a bit out of town.The film remains iconic and fascinating to watch. Hitchcock does a stunningly understated job in his direction.Although the films premise is rather bizarre- it maintains its integrity and believability. Still fascinating and fun to watch- considering it is 45 years old- a bit dated in many ways bit still a most famous and impressive film for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Almost Too Understated For Its Own Good,"Generally-speaking, Alfred Hitchcock directed two types of films: psychological thrillers and star vehicles for Hollywood's leading men and women. With ""The Birds"", both goals are accomplished nicely, albeit with the former being largely understated in deference to the latter.For a very basic overview, ""The Birds"" sees young socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), become intriguingly smitten with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) after a chance encounter at a pet shop. As the two begin to mingle, however, Mitch's small island town is suddenly beset by bird attacks both large and small, seemingly without rhyme or reason.Despite ostensibly being a ""bird attack"" disaster film, Hitchcock inherently knows that it has to be more than that. So, he (and screenplay writer Evan Hunter) craft a compelling story surrounding Mitch and Melanie. The chemistry between the two is palpable, and even their ""fringe stories"" (Mitch's overbearing mother, Melanie's befriending of the town schoolteacher with an unrequited crush on Mitch) prove to be intriguing. In other words, ""The Birds"" actually turns out to be a great character-piece in spite of the suspense/disaster label it often gets.Ironically, the ""bird stuff"" almost takes a back seat in importance for much of the film. A lot of foreshadowing happens in the first half of the runtime, but it is so subtle as to be nonexistent. In other Hitchcock films, the drama is punctuated by musical flourishes (think Hermann's Psycho strings or Vertigo's tension-filled score). Here, the bird attacks are silent but for the mechanical squawking. This approach does create one incredibly dynamic scene outside of the schoolhouse, but it largely is so understated as to be almost flat.Thus, I place ""The Birds"" just outside my favorite all-time Hitch flicks. Despite its reputation, it actually does a better job of setting up interesting characters than it does with the bird attack ""primary"" storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Birds rules, birds rule","Superb, original film by Hitchcock, combining a novel horror idea of attacking birds in a somewhat surreal country setting with a very pretty protagonist (or antagonist).  Tippi Hedren's character of Melanie evokes both sympathy and some disdain for her sneakiness, mystery (whatever might lay behind it), and (causation?) throughout the film, and in contrast to ""Psycho,"" things are not resolved.  Attraction exists between Melanie and her beau, but closeness is deterred with a mutual feeling of distrust and suspicion, cleverly developed by Hitchcock.  While the characters --townspeople etc. -- are somewhat understated, as appropriate in most horror films, their psychology and interplay are well done, almost brilliant.  The color is subtly essential to this movie just as black & white is to Psycho.  But ultimately, the film is for the birds, ever ominous and on the offensive.

One of Hitchcock's most suspenseful,"Of all Hitchcock's movies, this horror flick is one of his most suspenseful; the most tension filled. He created this palpable tension by focusing the camera on the person fidgeting, or moving, or just sitting.The film resembles very much Greek Tragedy: clearly Mitch's mother does not want her son to leave her, she fears profoundly the loneliness of her senior years--isolated without her son. She resents Annie and yet she makes friends with Annie; by the end of the movie she embraces Melanie, clearly an evocation of Mary the Mother of Jesus embracing Jesus in Michael Angelo's PIETA.Is Melanie the cause of the bird's attack? And what is the specific motivation of her as symbol to the birds to justify attacking humanity? Melanie as symbol to the birds, what does she represent? During many scenes, Melanie incongruously wears a fur coat; crossing Bodega Bay in a skiff, she wears this fur coat. At the end of the movie she, wounded by the birds, wears the fur coat as she is escorted into Mitch's car.Does she become symbol to the birds by carrying love birds in a cage?Spring 2010 saw the British Petroleum pipeline explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, spilling millions of gallons of oil into the sea for more than 90 days, devastating the ecology. In one news item, a large oil soaked bird is attacking a small boat with it's beak, as if to say: ""You got me into this mess, now get me out."" Humanity's predation of planet earth could very well spell the demise of Planet Earth's habitability--a millenia sooner than what might be expected from natural processes; for example, expansion of the sun in a next billion years to that of a red giant first broiling the planet then engulfing the planet. But Humanity's predation could sterilize the oceans of food, sterilize the atmosphere with excessive co2 emissions, sterilize the land with deforestation.And this is Humanity's legacy to Planet Earth. The birds of the Air, and the Beasts of the Field are victims of this mass extinction brought on by Humanity's predation. Alfred Hitchcock's tale is a Greek tragedy about an unfolding mass extinction brought about by humanity's demonic predation; the birds are simply seeking revenge.Or is this giving Hitchcock more credit than he deserves? A movie taking on more weight than the artist intended. The artist must always be reminded that he/she is not the final arbitrator of a movie's interpretation. A movie succeeds because it evokes more than it's immediate import. So while Hitchcock did not intend a morality tale on the environment, some fifty years after the movie, it has transcended itself to a morality tale about the environment and ecology.I saw the movie when it came out in 1962 and then saw it again at Oakland''s art deco Paramount Theatre; it had lost none of its force in those years; if anything, the modern ecology movement and warnings of global warming and a sixth mass extinction brought on by Humanity's predation made the movie even more powerful and moving.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alfred Hitchcock's Best Film,"Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock scores his greatest one out of his many triumphs with this 1963 Universal release. Hitchcock's usual mix of horror and laughs works extremely well in this ""what if"" tale about what would happen if the birds took over society. The results are often too frightening for small children so don't let them confuse this film for something else. A true standout classic in Hollywood's otherwise most lackluster decade.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Pretty average, minus the intensity.","Hitchcock isn't necessarily the amazing director everyone credits him as. Of the films I've seen by him, all of them were boring and never gave the ""suspense"" that everyone also credits him for. Far better and more original directors have been bashed and hated by critics and never once recognized for what they do. That said, Hitchcock was solid and has some nifty camera angles that do make his films much more unnerving and intense than a good chunk of modern horror.The movie itself must have been amazing in its time. A lot of R-rated movies today are tamer than this PG-13 rated movie, and nowhere near as intense. The bird animations are laughable, the first hour gives boring a new definition, the acting and dialog are trite and sillybut it's hard to call this a bad movie.The lack of music and the camera style both reek of realism, and that's a very good thing. The scares and intensity of the last 30 minutes are hard to match if you aren't laughing at the bird animations. Add a couple weird-out moments and an ending so open it's effective, and you have a solid movie. I'd go as far as to say it's superior to the modern movie The Mist.If the remake keeps all the positives and makes it less cheesy I don't see how any horror fan could dislike it.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genuinely Terrifying!,"Consider for a second some of the incredible films Alfred Hitchcock has directed; Rear Window, Psycho, Vertigo to name just a few. It is therefore saying something that in my opinion 'The Birds' is the directors greatest accomplishment.The film, based in California, focuses on a mass outbreak of bird attacks against the residents of Bodega Bay with its main characters the macho Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and a rich 'it girl' of the time, Melanie Daneils (Tippi Hedren). Its perhaps fair to say that if you aren't a fan of leaving questions unanswered in a film this may not be for you. We are never presented with any answers as to just why these birds are choosing to seemingly wage war with humanity, yet in a way this is what makes the film so haunting.As a fan of the horror genre too many films tend to fall in to the trap of displaying frequent over the top gore as a way of providing the shock factor. Whilst 'The Birds' does provide genuine gore, in one scene Brenner's mother travels to a friends farmhouse to find the birds have laid siege to the house and pecked the mans eyes clean out, it is the eerie silences when the birds are gathering and the excellent POV shots that help build suspense, meaning when the shocks do come they are genuinely terrifying!Indeed when Melanie is waiting outside the school and the birds are gathering in silence on the climbing friend behind or when she climbs up to the attic with nothing but torch light.Another thing modern day horror tends to fall into the trap of his underestimating the sheer terror of pure silence. There is no music in 'The Birds' meaning when they do attack all we hear is the shrill sound of the bird calls and the flapping of their wings. Believe me, its a haunting sound! You also cannot underestimate the role the characters play in this film, they are real people who you genuinely care what happens to them. Taylor and Hedren are both excellent but it is arguably Mitch's mother, Jessica Tandy who is the cream of the crop as a character petrified of being left alone. Note her haunting reactions as the camera provides to sudden close up shots after she discovers her friends eyes have been picked out! It may be some 47 years since the release of 'The Birds' yet you would have a very tough time to find many films that can be as genuinely haunting. It is a Hitchcock must see!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good movie but isn't made to scare in todays society,"I don't know whether I really need to include a spoiler alert in this review or not so I think those who haven't seen 'The Birds' (and if you haven't you should!) are safe to carry on reading. I've seen this film a couple of times, once when I was very young and again yesterday. I remember that the first time I saw it it really did quite scare me, as I can't remember exactly how old I was but to be quite honest I was a bit of a woos anyway! However, watching back over it yesterday I began to realise just how tame 'The Birds' and other horror movies of the generation were! Then again this is by no means a criticism of Alfred Hichcock who was indeed one of the finest directors of his time. In creating 'The Birds' he achieved what he set out to do, and that was to create a movie that would terrorise and shock cinema goers of the time (1963). However I feel that it has be said that most cinema goers of this generation would not even be slightly un-nerved by this film. With movies now such as 'The Grudge', 'Creep' and 'The Ring' I think it is safe to say that this film is not designed to shock modern society. This film is a classic and should be treated as such, but speaking as somebody who is not even a hard core fan of the horror genre and does not normally even enjoy being scared I must admit that no-longer can this film be described as horrifying, or even vaguely scary. But in saying that, don't get me wrong, I still really like this movie and despite how critical this review may sound I am not trying to put this movie down and am not by any means saying that it is bad. In fact I think it's a great deal better than many of todays movies, which is why I would still give it a 10/10 rating!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice little trip to the bay...,"This Hitchcock classic concerns itself with a cute little romantic caper that quickly descends into horror when the titular birds attack for no rhyme or reason. There are a few things that stood out to me when I watched this film. Firstly, the score is practically non-existant, which not only adds to the eerie vibe the film has but also helps the film not feel dated. I was also surprised by how many actual real birds were used, which helps hugely with the realism. On the subject of the eerie vibe, even before the birds attack there's just this uneasy feeling right from the off, with vast shots of open vistas and barely any dialogue. It all comes together to create a highly unsettling horror that doesn't rely on jumpscares or gore for its scares. I have to say that I thorougly enjoyed this film, and highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The birds are scary,"The birds is the scariest bird attack film ever portrayed on cinema if there ever was one. Before I watch this film, I have very little to no fear of flock of birds. But after I finished it, this film changes my perspective about how deadly they can be. Hitchcock made this film memorable to me and the cast are excellent, the setting is eerie as a seaport with little going on; just some peaceful town folks that succumb to this evil fate. The film is excellent in showing the phenomenon that make audience in disbelief of how animals that ornithologically speaking, are very harmless, but can also be so dangerous at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

60's horror that still works.,"In many ways, The Birds is quite a strange film. It's got a plot that is very different for the time period let alone now and flaws that would ruin most films. That said, it's still one the finest horror films around. It's 60's horror that still works.Set in 1963, it has a simple plot involving an island plot getting attacked by killer birds. It was a highly anticipated film for Alfred Hitchcock as it was the next film after his massive hit, Psycho.Even though common but always to me to be a flaw regardless of the director, is how Hitchcock creates suspense. Set through the first act, he creates an act that makes the film progressively slow and loses touch with these characters and the film is much longer because of this set-up. The leads of Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy put out good performances that continues on through the later acts and it's career marks for both of them.The film enters what I call it's ""legendary style"" in the birds scenes. The effects are no doubt showing age close to fifty years in but it is still groundbreaking. From the attacks at the school to it's ending, the horror here is revolutionary with a creepy vibe with 60's blood. These are the type of scenes that create inspiration to come and created one more of a mark in the film world for Hitchcock.This is not my absolute favorite Hitchcock film nor my favorite horror film but it is still great for the nostalgia, it's purpose and to see one of the greatest filmmakers with another memorable highlight to his career",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Hitch's Best!,"This complicated, cinematic triumph deserves Best picture and best director award for Hitch along with Rebecca, Psycho, and Strangers on a Train. He never won those awards. Awards are given to mediocrities like Martin Scorsese etc..... Casting was brilliant both Tippi Hedren and Suzanne Pleshette were gorgeous and two totally different looking women. Rod Taylor perfectly cast along with Jessica Tandy. All the smaller roles were well cast. I have been in the Bodega Bay area and that atmosphere was captured. The ending Hitch wanted to use was proscribed by the studio heads. It was Rod, Tippi, Mom and the child entering the Golden Gate bridge and stopping because the bridge was covered in BIRDS!

what does Tippi drive,"Fist off, I love the movie, Hitch was a true master. I do have a question about the film, however.

I've been debating this with some friends in the office - one thinks it is an Alvis (but if it were an Alvis it'd be quite a bit larger, in my opinion) - however - I'm sure someone out in movie-trivia land knows what the exact make and model designation are.

Tension Driven Animal Attack Film,"This is a film that at least one of my parents introduced to me. I know for a fact when it came out, it terrified my father. Since that first watch, I've seen this one quite a few times, including at the Gateway Film Center. The most recent was with my wife, Jaime, as I got it on 4K. It also was a Traverse through the Threes for me.Synopsis: a wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people.As the synopsis states, we start with a woman going into a pet shop. She is Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren). She is a strong, independent woman and we see that with how she speaks to the woman working there. Her order isn't ready yet and she is going to get her way. We then meet Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). He knows her as she pulled a prank on someone that caused damage and had to go to court. He messes her and she is intrigued by him. She decides to go to his mother's home, where he goes every weekend in Bodega Bay. I should point out that she pulls strings at her father's newspaper to learn this information.She ends up staying to have dinner with him. The film doesn't waste too much time as she is attacked by a seagull before she can get off the boat she rented. These attacks become more and more frequent and the number of birds continues to grow.I went light on my recap as I'm assuming most everyone has seen this at one time or another in their life. To delve a bit more into my history with it, it is a movie that I loved growing up. The concept is terrifying as for the fact that there are so many birds not just around us every day, but in the world. If they decided to do what this film has them doing, we would be in a lot of trouble. They outnumber us and when they attack by force, the bigger birds could do some damage. My viewing in the theater, I left a bit disappointed. I'll come back to this though.Another thing that is scary, we do not ever get why they are doing it. The people in this can't make sense of it as they don't continually attack or anything. Mitch points out that they flock together, attack and then leave. They repeat this pattern. The other people in this town are scared by not knowing. I can't blame them. They even go as far as say that it is Melanie's fault because it started when she got there. I could buy this as it is becoming hysterical. It is fitting for human nature.Since I've brought up the two leads, the love story is where I'll go next. From the beginning, we see that Melanie and Mitch have a connection. I really think that Hitchcock did a good job at developing their relationship. They don't fall for each other immediately. They bump heads. It seems natural to build. Something I really noticed in these last couple viewings is the development of the characters. We get scenes where the birds are in the background. Characters may or may not notice them, but we as viewers do. It is another way that Hitchcock builds tension and makes him the master of suspense. This is more of a character study where the bird attacks bring the characters together.It isn't just these two though. I was telling Jaime during this watch that this was better than I remembered. I used to have issues with how much this slows down as it is building the characters. It was during this watch that it makes more sense though. Mitch looks down on Melanie. She digs it, but also wants to prove him wrong. Lydia (Jessica Tandy) who is Mitch's mother is struggling because her husband has passed away. She looks to Mitch as a replacement of sorts. She also needs to approve whomever Mitch sees whether it is officially set up that way. There is also Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) and Anne Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). The latter dated Mitch and her talks with Melanie are interesting.Since the important characters have been brought up, let me go through the performances. Taylor is a great hero. What is most interesting is his interactions with Lydia. She is broken and hard on him, but he can disarm her without making problems. He keeps his cool. Hedren is beautiful and becomes a great damsel in distress. My problem though is that she is built up to be the main character. During the climax she goes catatonic and we see Mitch taking over. I didn't care for this shift. I think that's more the era though. Tandy is solid as the mother. Seeing a young Cartwright is crazy. She does so well at playing up the hysterics without going over the top. Pleshette doesn't have a lot of time in this film, but what she does is good. She helps in filling backstory. The rest of the cast rounded the film out for what they needed.All that is left is filmmaking. The effects are where I'll start. I thought they were well done for the time. They used superimposing images on top of each other, which works. There is a scene in the house where it doesn't. It doesn't look great, but it is still effective. I'm also watching this in 4K, which does highlight things as well. I do give them credit for getting as many birds as they do. What I can't discredit is the cinematography. This is shot beautifully. Hitchcock just knows how to frame a shot. What also impressed me was the soundtrack. The music doesn't stand out, but it didn't need to. There is a song that Melanie hears while waiting for Annie who is teaching. We get this somewhat cheery song the children are singing, but you hear the birds making noise as they gather in the playground. I liked that build. The sounds of the different birds in general here are good as well.In conclusion, this is a solid, early animals attack film. The idea of birds turning on us like they do is terrifying for how badly we're outnumbered. This is even stated in the movie itself. The story isn't overly complex, but I love that we don't know why these birds or doing this. The hysteria it causes helps the tension. The acting was good. I'd even go as far to say that this is more of a character study and seeing the relationship developed between Mitch and Melanie. This is a well-made movie from the cinematography to the soundtrack. This is a classic Hitchcock film that should be watched at least once for sure.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tippi Hedren,"The Birds is no doubt a very good Hitchcock film that has stood the test of time pretty well.  Some of the Special Effects are a bit amateurish by modern standards, but get the point across well enough in my opinion.  I have to strongly disagree with many of the comments here regarding Tippi Hedren.  I think her performance was quite good, especially for a first major role.  She was just absolutely stunning to look at, especially in the opening scenes of the film in the Bird Shop.  The basic premise of her character (i.e. the outwardly cool and confident female beauty possessing a core of vulnerability) was not new or groundbreaking.  Grace Kelly made a brief and meteoric movie career playing this type of character, well before Tippi was discovered by Hitchcock.  But Tippi was a beautiful and classy woman who gave a fine and appropriate performance in my opinion.  Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are great too.  I was not real impressed with Rod Taylor's performance, but his character was possibly stiff and measured intentionally, as opposed to being poorly played.  Great movie, a must see for all movie buffs and fans of classy old movie stars like Tippi Hedren.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Scary, yet beautiful assault on human smugness about nature","-The Birds- is one of two great animal-attack films; the other is, of course, -Jaws-, a very different movie. -The Birds- and -Jaws- are the only truly good movies of a genre that easily degenerates into pure schlock, exploitative, low-budget fare with bad scripts and dreadful acting. The two masterpieces of terror by animal assault the human conceit that 'we' own the world. The third best is the merely 'good' -Them-, whose overgrown ants do their predation on a bigger scale -- our scale -- than their usual world.We may hold the land; the birds own the skies, and they can be anywhere. Only because of their small size are they generally harmless, but if they ever ganged up on us we humans would be in big trouble.DuMaurier and Hitchcock exploit such a primal fear by turning the tables on us, exploiting our primal fear of sudden, horrifying death from animals striking from above, recalling our monkey-like ancestors who had cause to dread the lethal strike of beak and talon of a hawk or eagle. The birds have gotten organized, and they have chosen to take back their world. Unlike the shark that one never sees striking from dark aquatic depths, we see the birds coming and we fail to believe that they can do anything to us.Plausible? Not really. At least it's well done, and that is all that we can expect, with the superb cinematography that one would expect from the great Hitch. It's second-rate Hitchcock, but second-rate Hitchcock is better than first-rate work of almost anyone else. This is the only horror film from him in which nature provides such terror. Aside from the original -Jaws- (which I think owes more to -Psycho- than to -The Birds- ), and -Them- (with the overgrown ants that result from irradiation that destroys the controls upon their growth), this is the only animal-attack movie to have cinematic worth.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock at his very best,"Based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, The Birds is a classic thriller mystery from Alfred Hitchcock about a woman who travels to a small town to deliver some love birds to a man she met in a bird store. Unfortunately, as soon as she gets there, birds start attacking people, seemingly for no reason at all.Following Psycho was not an easy feat but Alfred Hitchcock went all in with this strange little movie that received mixed reviews initially but is now seen as one of the director's very best films. The bizarre premise definitely perplexed viewers back in the day but the unpredictability of The Birds, and the fact that Hitchcock doesn't hold your hand for a second during it, is arguably what makes the film so fascinating and unique. Hitchcock is known as the master of suspense, but he proves himself a master in misdirection with this film which teases the viewer constantly, dragging them in all sorts of directions before sweeping the rug from under them every time.The plot is fairly simple, as is the core mystery (why are the birds attacking?), but the strangeness of it all, and the desperate, lost feeling of the townspeople, which mirrors the viewer's own struggle, encourages you to dig deeper into subtext in order to find out what makes these characters tick. Maybe the answers can be found there? This reveals the director's extremely clever use of shots, atmosphere, dialog, scares and humor, all of which confirm a deep understanding of what the viewer is thinking throughout the film. Composer Bernard Herrmann doesn't deliver your typical Hitchcock movie score here, instead mixing countless bird sounds over silence to sell the eerie emptiness of the setting, and the loneliness of the characters.The action in the film is tightly crafted, and hugely creative: the director is at his most bold here. The visual effects are very impressive for the time and, while more uptight critics might call them ""dated"", they are still striking to this day and, combined with the ""score"", emphasize the bubbling chaos brilliantly. There are iconic moments in this movie that very much hold up (the schoolyard, the gas station sequence, the last shot of the film) and it's a surprisingly brutal film overall, even following Psycho. The cast is flawlessly chosen, including Tippi Hedren who knocks it out of the park in her debut, giving a layered, playful, delightfully undecipherable performance.Alfred Hitchcock expertly shocks and confuses us with The Birds, a film that demands several close viewings to truly nail down. It's darkly funny, haunting, devilishly clever and genuinely unnerving. There's no other film quite like it.Essential viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Romance/Horror/Comedy/Apocalypse/Thriller...,"An enigmatic chiller posing as a romance, Hitchcock and screenwriter Evan Hunter (better known as crime writer Ed McBain) remove the film of context - the puzzling Whyness of what is happening is something that stands over the film with far more anxiety and unease than do any of the individual attacks. The film has a scene where everyone offers up an explanation - they considering the Bomb and pollution - but Hitchcock and Hunter sit neither confirming nor denying. The ending is perhaps one of the most famous anticlimaxes in film history and comes with a baffling perplexity - after the intensively sustained onslaught of the previous night, hundreds of birds allow the humans to leave the farmhouse and simply sit and watch as they drive away. Hitchcock reportedly did film an ending but chose not to leave it in. As a result he has created a film that is not only removed of source and explanation but also of outcome - rather than ending with the birds defeated or triumphant, the film now just fades off on an anxiety-inducing state of ambiguity and unease.The Birds doesn't quite rank up among the real Hitchcock classics like Saboteur (1942), Lifeboat (1944), Rear Window (1954) or Psycho (1960) - but is no less a great film for such. The bird attacks are mounted with superb artistry in the same clipped, droll and immaculately staged style we have come to know from Hitchcock. There is a terrifying sequence with Tippi Hedren trapped inside a phone-booth where Hitchcock places the camera inside the booth sharing the claustrophobia of the assault. And the climactic siege of the farmhouse (which is the only real connection to the slim Daphne Du Maurier short story that the film is based on) with Rod Taylor fighting off frenzied avian suicide attacks in trying to barricade the house and save a mobbed Hedren from the attic contains some real seat-edge suspense.Like Psycho the film has a lengthy preamble, where Hitchcock involves one in the unrelated day-to-day happenings of its characters before disorientatingly switching tracks to the main story. One is drawn into the rather silly and petty prank Hedren plays on Taylor and her sudden desire to follow him - another of Hitchcock's characteristic long pursuit sequences - but, as in Psycho and the long preamble involving Janet Leigh's theft of the money and flight to the motel, this is only extended prologue to the main story. Hitchcock was playing with audience's expectation of films and pulling the rug out from under them way before anyone else ever was.The casting of Hedren and Taylor is an admirable pairing - both play off each other with a sly, mocking charm. Poor optical work on the bird attacks does regrettably lend certain artificiality to the film - and some modern genre purveyors have tended to downplay the rest of the film's excellence as a result. Saul Bass creates the finest of his famed credits sequences for Hitchcock - one with animated black bird shapes frenziedly screeching across a white background while the credits form as piecemeal shapes around them. Despite the listing of Hitchcock's regular composer Bernard Herrmann as sound consultant', the film has no score.The Birds suffers from unintentional giggles. The sets are hugely unrealistic, and sometimes Taylor and Hedren are quite wooden. However, The Birds remains a hugely influential and extremely sadistic horror film.Verdict  Dark, and blackly comic, The Birds will peck away at your sanity for its duration, and will have you looking at our feathered friends with suspicion for the rest of your days.  ****",,Anonymous,Horror
Supremely silly,"Even Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, couldn't save this film. The famous director applies all of his talent to make the birds as scary as possible, but it's far too limited by the silly premise. For sure, there are certain scenes that can be tense and make us root for the characters to get through the latest flock of birds unharmed, but it all quickly goes downhill as soon as the birds appear as hokey puppets or start dive-bombing through windows in bizarre fashions. The Birds is best viewed as a comedy, because it's not worth much more than that, and I don't think anyone can make mindless flocks of birds seem like a truly formidable force. The only part I found genuinely eerie was the sequence near the end when birds cover the entire landscape, sit still and watch the protagonists silently as they walk slowly through their driveway. Those few shots were the only thing stopping me from submitting an even lower star rating.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'd forgotten a lot of the melodramatic set up,I guess it was reflective of it's time ,But the juxtaposition of the tame caged songbirds versus the savage seagulls makes works well.. The horror elements are still effective. First a minor attack, then a house invasion, deaths, the attack at the school. It;s the tension though and psychological horror in between these attacks which is most effective, Still, Tippi Hedren in the phone box watching as a man has his eyes pecked out is terrifying. As is her own experience of being swarmed by the birds in the attic. Plenty of interesting character roles especially Ethel Griffies as Mrs. Bundy, the know-all ornithologist.

The Birds - The Community vs the Outsider,"I think this movie is about the problems of outsiders in being accepted in a small self-contained community. The community is fine until Melanie shows up with the lovebirds. Nothing untoward happens until Rod Taylor jumps into the car to go after Melanie, thus effectively indicating his acceptance of Melanie into his world and into town life. Then comes the first attack.Note the resemblance in hairstyles when Melanie meets Rod Taylor's mother. He is obviously searching for the love he did not find in his mother. As the birds do not accept the presence of Melanie and the lovebirds in town, so the mother will not accept a new woman in her son's life. She wants someone in her own life badly and realizes too late the barricades she has put up. Not even her own son has been allowed to enterThe birds single out for attack the sister, who befriends Melanie, and the schoolteacher, who takes her into her house. When the schoolteacher arrived in town, she was rejected by Rod Taylor, thus not incurring the enmity of the birds. Also note the striking moment when the woman at the restaurant hurls abuse at Melanie. ""It's your fault! Nothing happened here until you came!"" The community always seeks to ostracize and drive away the newcomer. The opera ""Peter Grimes"" tackles the same theme. The birds allow the family to leave as they have won. Melanie and the lovebirds drive off to San Francisco. The town can return to normal daily life. Anyway, that's my take on this Hitchcock opus.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alfred Hitchcock portrays the birds as being so evil and fierce that every time you see a bird after, you will be extra cautious and think of the movie.  I thought that the special effects were fabulous for the 1960's. When the birds keep trying to break through the telephone and try to attack Tippi Hedron you are kept on the edge of your seat. I thought that ""The Birds"" was a job well done for the 60's and was still scary in the 90's""The Birds"" would be a great movie to remake in the 90's.  With all the technology and special effects we have today the movie would be extremely scary and gory.",,Anonymous,Horror
Nature Always Wins,"Not only is this a great film (Hitchcock's best), but what a great example of the kind of repercussions that await us if man doesn't stop waging war on the environment. How much is Mother Earth supposed to take before she decides it's time to fight back. When it comes down to Man vs. Nature, Nature always wins! In the film, the lovebirds are caged rather than free to live in nature, and Zeke, the fishing boat captain, tells of how his crew had to drive off the birds trying to eat the fish they caught (as man again tries to keep the bounty of nature all to himself). We should all come away from this film both wiser and more sympathetic to the wanton destruction we have unjustifiably perpetrated on our environment.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Iconic....and Scary!,"Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is another strong film in a filmography that is nothing but strong films. This 1963 horror thriller is Hitchcock's second horror film after the chilling 1960's Psycho. This movie is the weaker of the two, but that is nothing to scoff at. This film's imagery of the birds swooping down and attacking the folks of Bodega Bay is iconic. Hitchcock enjoyed bird-watching as a child and he was fascinated what would happen if birds were to turn evil. I do not believe that Hitchcock added any messages or allegories in the film, but some people suggest the attacking birds are actually Greek Furies attacking those people who dwell in evil. The movie may not be as good as other Hitchcock movies like Rear Window, but the movie has this eerie tone that works, the acting is solid thanks to newcomer Tippi Hedren's soaring performance, and the visual effects are especially great. I could do with less of the oddly tedious love story and the change of tone (screwball comedy to suspense/horror) jarred me just a tad bit.The movie starts in the city of San Francisco where criminal lawyer Mitch Brennan (Rod Taylor) means the attractive socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) at a pet shop. He plays a prank on her trying to have her act as a store clerk to purchase lovebirds, despite him knowing exactly who she is. She decides to return the favor by traveling to Bodega Bay, his hometown after she purchased the lovebirds. He lives with his overbearing mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his school-age sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). He also remains close to his ex-lover, the schoolteacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). When she arrives, she is attacked by a seagull. Also, on the day of her arrival, the citizens of Bodega Bay are also attacked by these birds.The performances in the film are great. Tippi Hedren does very well in her debut on screen and she fits the model of a Hitchcock woman-an icy blonde. I would even go as far to say that she has a likeness towards Grace Kelly. Rod Taylor is the central male figure of the story, and he feeds off the women in his life. I always loved Jessica Tandy as an actress because she plays the strict, overbearing type of woman so well. It is pleasing to see that women are important in the film here as they all have major roles. They may come across as unlikable at times, but that is the point of these characters.The one thing that distracted me from the movie was the love story between Mitch and Melanie. It had some good moments, but some parts were too cheesy. For instance, Lyndia does not like any of his female companions because she feels as if they will love him more than the love she brings him as a mother. That is quite....odd. Also, I was very curious about the relationship between the ex-lover, Annie and Melanie. Annie does not seem to mind Melanie pursuing the man she used to love. Interesting!The build up to the birds attacking was well-made. I understand the reasoning behind the shift of the film's tone, but I felt it to be jarring. In the long run, it does work. The birds attacking the town is not only iconic, but legitimately scary. The birds going around killing people had me thinking strangely about birds for weeks after viewing the movie. Who would think a grown man would be so afraid of a pigeon? Kudos to the visual effects team making these birds so realistic. Not only the visual imagery works on a high level, but so does the unique sound. Hitchcock decided to forgo the traditional score in order to focus more on sound effects. Basically, the sounds birds make is the score. That added to the consistent eerie feel of the movie.Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a must-watch, especially if you like horror films. It may not rank as the auteur's best, but it might be one of his most iconic films. Hitchcock left the door open to viewers about what these birds may mean as there is plenty of speculation out there. I just believe these birds are just the subjects of a horror film and the director did a fine job turning these innocent works of nature into fearsome creatures of prey. After watching the movie, you may not look at birds in the same way again.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bodega Bay, bombs away","grrrrr!!  This movie is terrifying.  Another masterpiece from the late great maestro, Alfred Hitchcock.  This is one of the slickest animal attack movies along with Jaws.  If you are going to expect not to be too impressed by this movie because it was made in 1963 I think you got a very big surprise comin for ya buster.  Go out and rent it and know what I'm talking about.  This movie gives a whole new meaning to suspense.  Saying that this movie is suspenseful is like saying the Atlantic Ocean is wet.  If you get what I'm sayin ; )   What makes this movie so terrifying?  Well, besides the suspense there is also the fact that, when Jaws scared people they just stayed out of the water, because a shark can't get you if you're not swimming.  But what do you do when the enemies can get you inside of your own home with their kamikazee type attacks?  Had they done this movie in 3d I can bet there would have been many heartattacks!  The scenes of gore are very realistic in this movie also.  But that isn't what the film is riding on.  It just makes it more realistic, along with the impeccable acting.  I highly recommend this movie to all people, not just horror fans.  You will enjoy this fast paced thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hitchcock at his best, almost.","This may be Hitchcock's best masterpiece.  Although he has so many great movies this one can just rank with them instead of over them.  I watched The Birds with 10 other people and the ending had half cheering and the half screaming ""RIP OFF!""  I was cheering.  Endings w/o explanation are the best. If you want an explanation to something read a science book.  I watch movies for entertainment and Hitchcock always delivers.  I had to walk my girlfriend home after the film and the next day she was attacked by geese at the park.  Talk about suspense.  Hitchcock is the master.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Superior mankind vs. nature horror, with a consummate Hitchcock at the flight controls.","Quoth the raven, `Nevermore!'  Not as `Poe-etic' maybe but just as grim and fateful in its intent was 1963's hotly anticipated `The Birds,' loosely based on the1952 Daphne Du Maurier Gothic-styled novella (originally set on a post-WWII English coast).  Alfred Hitchcock had faithful fans scurrying to the theater houses in droves for his first feature in three years following his macabre masterpiece `Psycho.'  In between, Hitch launched his celebrated TV anthology series, winning a whole new generation of admirers.By altering the image of our fair, feathered friends from symbols of peace, freedom and paradise into terrifying tools of terror, Hitch once again assaulted our eyes and ears in a fresh, cleverly laid out manner.  Flocks of birds of varying species descend upon a small California coastal town and attack without provocation, turning into Armageddon-like messengers of doom and annihilation.  It was an ingenious comeback idea and Hitch did not disappoint.  I can't recall an earlier movie that so rerouted a creature as sweet and innocent as a sparrow.Since `Psycho' put the `H' in (modern) Horror, what could we expect from `The Birds' on its initial release?  Would this heroine too meet an early, similar fate ála Janet Leigh?  Would she be beaked to death before the end of the first reel?  What would the gore factor be now that `Psycho' had opened Hollywood's bloody doors?  Unmercifully playful as always and a master of pre-show suspense, Hitch released his birds with tremendous fanfare and, of course, made quite an impact.  The movie became the prototype for a stream of `nature's revenge' movies involving unlikely human predators  ants, frogs, rabbits, and the like.The characters in `Psycho' and `The Birds' are similar in their presentation.  They are chilly, not easily embraced, hardly flesh-and-blood characters.  They appear to be mere instruments to present, not distract from, the ultimate horrific elements, and yet they becoming more fascinating with each repeated viewing.Over the years Hitch had a penchant for taking beautiful, sometimes limited, well-coiffed blonde actresses and turning them into exquisite mysteries. Kim Novak of `Vertigo' comes foremost to mind.  Here, Tippi Hedren provides one of the most vexing, deceptively intriguing characters yet.  A coy, superficial, self-indulgent socialite whose reckless, news-making escapades has been front-page tabloid material, Melanie Daniels, one day at a pet shop, happens to meet and fix upon Mitch Brenner, an assertive, strapping, hirsutely handsome nice guy' attorney (Rod Taylor), totally out of her league, yet a down-home charmer just the same.  A casual but obvious flirtation filters out between the two.  The capricious lady proceeds to drive all the way to the isolated little town of Bodega Bay to sneak a pair of lovebirds, into Mitch's mother's home for his much, much younger sister's (Veronica Cartwright, by at least 20 years!) birthday.  Hedren is a cool but captivating young heroine who gets to thaw out a little as the film progresses.  The other roles are handled just as professionally.Rod Taylor (`The Time Machine') is a definitive man's man and an ingratiating ladies' man to boot.  Doling out steadfast, unflinching heroes most his career, he has that fine reputation as a protector extraordinaire, and though he remained in the second ranks for the long duration, his wry charm, stocky masculinity and sexy banter has always been first rate with me.  His Mitch Brenner may still be caught up in his mother's apron strings a bit, but on him it looks honorable, not emasculating.The always wonderful Jessica Tandy returned to the cinematic fold after a decade of stage and TV work as Mrs. Brenner.  A wan, high-strung, overly possessive widow incapacitated over the years by fear and anxiety, her desperate attachment to her son was sure to discourage any female competitor.  Tandy's performance bears close attention.  She draws out a subtle flurry of emotions in what at first might appear to be a one-note performance, drawing sympathy in spite of her limitations.Lovely Suzanne Pleshette, in a rare, dressed-down support role, gives one of the more curious performances of the film.  As the insular, cynical school teacher Annie Hayworth, she inspires genuine empathy as a young woman mysteriously bitter and broken in spirit for such a young age.  Once in love with Mitch until Mrs. Brenner's interference, she strangely hangs around as a friend, yearning maybe for a reconciliation.  Despite her obvious beauty and intelligence, she has consigned herself to living a small-town life of boredom, broken dreams, and ultimate loneliness.  Ironically, it is she, the self-appointed spinster, who makes the ultimate mother's sacrifice  protecting her `children' at all costs.A number of familiar faces, if not names, flutter about as well:  Ethel Griffies as an ornithological expert, Lonny Chapman as a restaurant operator, comedian Doodles Weaver (uncle of Sigourney) as a boatman, Ruth McDevitt, flighty as always, as a pet shop owner, Richard (`The Dick Van Dyke Show') Deacon as Mitch's dour city neighbor, and, with a keen eye, little Morgan Brittany can be glimpsed as one of the terrified schoolgirls. Of course, there is a bit of fun to be had trying to spot Hitch himself, whose trademark cameo appearance comes early in the film.As in all of Hitch's films, the successful buildup of suspense is done in a myriad of ways.  Nobody works a camera like the master.  Slightly distorted angles accentuate the character's imbalance and gathering paranoia.  Even something as unvarnished as Hedren's little boat trek across the lake offers a moving camera that taunts with eery tension.  The absence of a screechy Bernard Herrman score, using this time only the intermittent chirping and cawing of his foul fowl, enhances the feelings of isolation and vulnerability.  Classic terror' scenes here include Hedren's school bench sequence in which clusters of crows furtively take over a school playground; Tandy's slow discovery of a neighbor's grisly attack; and Hedren's claustrophobic telephone booth assault -- all indelible visions long after the finale.Metaphorically speaking , the outcome is purposely left `up in the air'  which, I suppose, is relatively germane to the world-threatening conflicts of today.  Hitch's film projects may be designed for escape but he has a knack for making them seem awfully real.  First shower-taking, now bird-watching.  He has a devilish habit of taking the fun out of life's little pleasures, doesn't he?.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Psychoanalytical Thriller,"Complex interpersonal relationships with their possessiveness, jealousies, insecurities and anxieties are played out against the backdrop of spine-chilling massed attacks by birds in a small picturesque town near San Francisco. Why the birds attack without any provocation is neither made clear nor is any hypothesis proffered. It is this open-ended quality that elevates the film from being a mere bloodcurdling thriller at the superficial level to a subtler plane with many possibilities of psychoanalytical interpretations. The sub-textual reading of the film offers many hours of pleasure to the armchair psychologist. All the four principal characters, though outwardly simple, seem weighed down by some not so pleasant pasts, which they are reluctantly suppressing. The birds perhaps symbolise the cathartic release of their bottled up emotions. The almost tranquil anti-climax of the film makes you wonder whether the birds were just demons of the mind that have been expurgated. The present of caged lovebirds, which seemingly trigger off the inexplicably bizarre chain of events, are also central to the sub-text, and can be infused with several layers of semantics. In a most poignant final sequence, the little girl Cathy, who has been traumatised by the recurrent bird attacks requests her family to take along the caged birds with them as they flee to safety. So does the cage stand for security rather than the oft-repeated cliché of bondage?  an interesting speculation!  In a strikingly refreshing departure from modern day films of animal terror, there is no attempt to avenge the attack, which further lends weight to the feeling that the birds are a chimera. 	Even if Freudian analysis is not your up of tea, this is a fine film to be enjoyed for its sheer craftsmanship. Notice that the film is totally devoid of background score, debunking the notion that music heightens suspense. The long silent pauses are actually deafening. The sequences of bird strikes are amazingly well done. The camerawork is graceful  particularly noteworthy is the sequence in which Melanie stealthily arrives by boat to deliver the caged birds. A film out of the top drawer of Hitchcock.",,Anonymous,Horror
Lovebirds,"One of Alfred Hitchcock's most notorious films.Centered around a woman by the name of Melanie, who visits a bird shop and crosses paths with a man known as Mitch.She begins to pursue this man to his home out in the country and gives him his favorite birds which are known as lovebirds.As the film goes on we notice that the birds don't seem to be acting normal and begin to attack people out in public and chaos breaks out from there.The story and pacing can somewhat feel like a slow burn but the climax and action towards the end pays off.Despite the villain being average birds, I still find that the premise can be frightening and I was shocked by a few disturbing shots throughout the film.It is honestly one of my favorite from Hitchcock.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One Of His Most Sonically Advanced,"Before there was Jaws or really any other monster animal movie there was Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. The film convincingly displays birds as a lethal threat and builds suspense and thrills in all the usual ways you can expect from Hitch. What you may not anticipate, is the film's score. His essentially career long collaboration with Bernard Herrman brought us many great scores most notably the three movies made before this: Vertigo, North By Northwest and Psycho. Imagine Psycho without the screeching strings or in Vertigo's case you don't even have a movie sans music. Perhaps to prove it wasn't a crutch, Hitchcock forewent using any score on The Birds. But there's no gap and he replaces music with sounds; including Herrman as a ' special sound consultant'. The rest of the crew is also terrific and it's a shame Tippi Hedren and Rod Steiger didn't collaborate on his projects as much as some other actors he used.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Thanksgiving movie...,"I watched ""The Birds"" for probably the fourth or fifth time tonight, the night before the US holiday of Thanksgiving.  It was an appropriate choice: I feel gratitude to Alfred Hitchcock for the wonderful body of work he left to moviegoers.As with some other Hitchcock films, I enjoy ""The Birds"" more every time I see it, and I notice little things that I didn't notice earlier.  Re-seeing a Hitchcock movie is like visiting an old friend, or wearing favorite old clothes.  It's a little island of comfort in this increasingly uncomfortable world.I found myself grinning as I recognized one Hitchcock ""trademark"" after another: the traveling shot after a horrific event culminating in a bucolic panorama, as if to say, ""Look how this horror is only a tiny part of the world--still, it's the world YOU know.""  The hesitant hand on the doorknob. The magnificent scene beginning in the boat, over five minutes with no words, no music, just the camera telling the story as only Hitchcock knew how to make it do.  And so many others...I'll be the first to admit I think Hitchcock made some crummy films.  But he made so many marvelous ones that the poor ones fade into insignificance. And I believe he had a style, a flair, an audacity, that was inimitable.  No wonder the French appreciate his work so much.  And no wonder this francophile feels the same way.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Why are they doing this.....the Birds?""","Each time I see ""The Birds"" I am enthralled. And yet each time I get annoyed. I am one of those viewers duly recognizing the eternal genius of Hitchcock--and The Birds is right up there with the best of his films. For film magic to really take effect--one of course has to suspend disbelief. And while there are moments that I quibble with in each of his films in terms of common sense or in terms of the way people would really talk or react in the given situations--with ""The Birds"" there are so many more of those moments. OK--here goes:What I love about ""The Birds"" 1. that famous scene of the birds circling down from the heavens over the burning gas station. 2. The great schoolyard scene--what a visual jolt the first time both Melanie Daniels and the viewer sees the full scope of the perched birds. (In that scene I even like that dumb song the kids are singing--I could sing it right now!!) 3. At the end of the scene where the family, in their own household cage, are surrounded by the frightening sounds of the bird attacks, and each character comes into view with the camera down below looking up at their eerily lit and haunted visage. Disorienting and Intriguing as could be. 4. The variety of the bird attacks--no two are the same--each one grows in intensity--and is so singular. One doesn't really prepare the viewer for the next one. 5. The electronic score. Mesmerizing--right from the word ""Go""! 6. That well-needed moment of repose in the seaside diner with the assorted town characters all chattering away. We're in the middle of a cataclysm, in the middle of our roller-coaster ride, but we enjoy the humor, irony, and sort of comfort of these people all gathered together. (We would not want to be alone during an attack like this--we crave human contact.) 7. The beautiful visuals--whether of the ride up the coastal highway, or the curving Bodega Bay, or the School's majestic position on the hill. 8. The final, eerie landscape of the birds in closeup around the house--to an infinite distance. 9. The intriguing ending--leaving it all up to our imagination as to ""what happens""--and making us want to see the film all over again to search for clues to what indeed happens. 10. Hitchcock's genuinely funny appearance at the beginning walking out the store with his two funny white dogs. Incongruous and adorable.What I find annoying about ""The Birds"" 1. I'm sorry-- I know, I know--the opening helps set the mood, and there is lots of symbolism, and lots of Red Herrings as to where the plot might go--but it is still too damn long before anything ""good"" happens! 2. Some of the acting is just execrable. Tippi Hedron is beautiful--but that voice!! 3. The whiny kids! They had me rooting for the birds sometimes. 4. Why does Melanie leave the diner for the phone booth? Oh--the visuals in the phone booth are spectacular. But why did she do that? 5. Why does Mitch spend ALL that time hammering wooden boards onto the outside windows of his house, when he should have just taken his family and gotten the Heck out of there? (Of course that would have deprived us of some additional spectacular scenes.) But it just seems silly what he is doing. 6. The sound of Cathy throwing up. (As she delicately coughs a couple of times. If you listen really hard--you do hear the sound of a bit of a ""throw-up sound""--but that may be wishful thinking! I say its just coughing!!) 7. Lydia's character. What an annoying human being. 8. Mitch's opening nastiness to Melanie. Melanie has to have real co- dependency issues to be drawn to him after that unpleasant exchange! I didn't buy it. 9. Some awkward camera shots--when the car explodes in flames, there are three frozen scenes of Teppi Hedron looking from her right to her left--it looks sort of silly. Also, the cook at the end of this scene suddenly runs in saying that the birds are leaving after everyone has already accepted that fact. It comes out inadvertently funny. 10. Cathy's immortal line: ""Why are they doing this....the birds?""It's a classic and a great movie, and who knows? Maybe some of the ""lesser moments"" adds to its classic, unforgettable reputation. I've seen this film more times than I can count--and if it were on tonight--I'd watch it again!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hey my teacher made me watch it.,Hitchcock rocks. The whole plot was eerie and frightening. It wasn't that scary but it had a point. The camera views for the time were like Blair Witch material and the lighting was so needed for effect. The music was made for the movie and the sounds could scare Hitler when you have surround sound. The actors and actresses were creative and energetic. So all around the movie gets a 8.5 off my chart. Only because it can't beat my favorite movie....,,Anonymous,Horror
For the Birds!,"I remember reading the novel and being really scared. But when the movie came out in '63 I was so disappointed and thought it was silly. Tonight I decided to give it another go, it was even worse than I remembered. Did Hitchcock dislike women, think they were utter idiots? The lack of dialogue is unbelievable and very stilted when they do finally speak, the only character who seems any way normal and able to act is Rod Taylor. The women and young girl just stand around, doing and saying stupid stuff, acting pathetic. As women aren't like this in real life I think Hitchcock must have had mother issues somewhere in his life.
Not a classic but a lesson in how not to direct.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A 1963 Masterpiece,I didn't see the Birds until it made it to TV some years later but at the time the children fleeing the schoolhouse left me physically shaking in horror.  Years later I had the opportunity to spend the night at the schoolhouse which was and still is one of my best memories to date. Hitch's plodding drama may seem slow by todays standards but I feel that is one of the very reasons the attacks are so delightful! You get caught up in this slow moving story and whamo the birds attack out of nowhere.  One wonders why after all these years no one has ever been able to recreate such a great film.  It's easy to imagine in these turbulent times that evil can come at any moment from the very things we take for granted and do not normally fear.  I am sure that is what drew Sir Alfred to this material in the first place.  Pass the popcorn!,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ripe for a quality re-do,"First off, I am amazed that this has never been remade. I do remember that there was an absolute hideous TV sequel in the 90's that should never see the light of day again, but this material is so ripe for our CGI era. There was a time when this was my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film and I'm not sure that that has really changed, though I would imagine that Psycho would seem better now, but some of his films just don't hold up. This simple tale of birds attacking people for no known reason still holds up pretty well and is quite entertaining, but the special effects are antiquated greatly by this point in time and the acting is wooden by nearly everyone in the cast. If Hitchcock could have made a film without actors he would have been a happier guy. He has been quoted as calling them cattle that he had to move around and that attitude sometimes shows with bland performances, primarily from his frequent beautiful blonde leads and non more so than Tippi Hedren here. She's pretty bad and surprisingly, her male co star, Rod Taylor, isn't a lot better. Actually, the only performance of interest in the entire film comes from Suzanne Pleshette. Hitchcock did create some really interesting and atmospheric scenes in this and it might still be suspenseful to the uninitiated. Other than the birds attacking this is pretty much a love story in the making with those pesky critters showing up every now and then before the big finale which is still pretty good and I do love the way it ends.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"mildly outdated, yet still has suspense.....","I am a fan of most of Hitchcock.  I was pleased when I watched 'The Birds'.  There are many things in this movie that are quite outdated, such as some acting techniques, as well as special effect techniques.  Even with such faults, minor ones if you ask me, Hitchcock manages to create some real suspense that is still effective today.  Specifically in the last half hour of the film.He creates great suspense with his incredible use of sound effects creating the deafening noises of the birds attacking a house.  What we get to see is the terror the people inside the house feel.  In this whole sequence of events we get an excellent climax.  Plus he gets us very well, not by making things happen, but by putting the thought into our heads that something could happen.The most ominous parts in this movie are not when the birds attacking, but when Hitchcock frames them gathering.  The attacks are excellent in and of themselves, but its the waiting that creates the suspense.  Its our knowing something that the characters don't that make it exciting, and Hitchcock does a great job of utilizing that here.Its not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it was very good, and even with some things being outdated, it was still an innovative idea and you should check it out at least once, just to see for yourself.  8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It must suck to be them, to be so numb to such greatest.And here's a little tibit about Bodega Bay I've since found out today while doing more research on that city while watching The Birds for the 9th time.The movie ""Nicolas's Gift"" with Jamie Lee Curtis was about a boy named Nicholas Green who was from of all towns (((Bodega Bay))), he was sadly murdered in a botched robbery while with his family in Italy.

What does it mean?,"Why do the birds attack? Despite the warning of the tweed wearing woman in the diner that the birds represent nature rebelling against man's interference, I have my own theory that will change the way you see the movie. The birds represent repressed female sexuality. Think about it and the movie becomes pretty funny. Every time the women in the movie start becoming sexually frustrated, the birds attack. The first attack is when Tippi Hedren has teased Rod by leaving the lovebirds (who, after being given to a prepubescent girl, are the only birds not to attack anybody) and is racing back to the dock while he chases on the road around Bodega Bay. Then, the schoolteacher and Tippi are talking and a bird dies after hitting the door. By the time we get to the oedipal scene with Rod's mother, the birds are bursting from the chimney(Go Freud!). Watch it with this in your head and it confirms what Hitch said after a reporter mentioned that he should do more comedies because ""To Catch a Thief"" was so funny. He deadpanned, ""Young man, all my movies are comedies.""",,Anonymous,Horror
Better with every viewing,"When it first came out, the public was disappointed. It wasn't Psycho and seemed to pale in comparison to Norman's story, but I liked it better than Psycho then and still do today. Along with Shadow of a Doubt and 39 Steps, it is my favorite Hitchcock.I watched it again last night, Halloween, on a VHS tape from several years ago. Today I came to this board; I notice there are 22 pages of comments, so I doubt I can add anything new, but here are some thoughts in general that may engender more discussion on boards:1. The final scene will always stick with you; 2. How many times does Hitch let his heroines enter a room that they should not? This plot device goes back to Mary Roberts Rinehart, but it works every time. 3. Get the wide screen DVD; there is one scene in my 'fit to your screen' tape where Mitch is talking to Melanie walking back to the house, but he is not on the screen. 4. Tippi is gorgeous, but there are times you can hear daughter Melanie's helium voice bursting out. 5. I wonder about the necessity of the scene in the restaurant with the end of the world man, the old lady who studies birds, the mother and kids eating lunch and the fisherman. It is borrowed from many 50's SCI-FI pictures. The purpose, of course, is to give a pause until the next attack, but all the dialog sounds so trite. 6. Is Annie the only teacher in that school? 7. And what did Mitch's father do for a living when they resided in Bodega Bay? Today such a place would be overrun by tourists. 8. I cannot get over the confidence of Hitchcock, to set that first gull attack on Melanie without music. I keep trying to think what Jaws would be like without the pounding score. 9. Then again, sharks do not caw or coo. There were over 100 starlings and blackbirds on my lawn and in the trees this morning, making what sounded like a hideous racket. Yesterday the noise would not have bothered me, but today? 10. Can we make a pact to shoot the first producer or director who announces he or she wants to remake the film?",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thriller/Romance/Suspense/Drama/(Unsolved)Mystery Introducing 'Tippi' Hedren...,"This is an interesting film about different species of birds attacking a small California town called Bodega Bay. The attacks begin when Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives with two love birds as a gift for a resident of the town. Did those two caged ""love"" birds stir the whole mess up in the first place? Will their horror continue because they take the ""love"" birds along with them in the end? There are no answers to be had at the film's conclusion & what's next for the characters is left to the viewer's imagination. 'Tippi' Hedren was an attractive female lead for this role. Her appearance was obviously more important than her acting skills. Rod Taylor is beefy, & sexy. Suzanne Pleshette is like a dark haired Susan Hayward. Jessica Tandy (was she ever young??) plays the possessive, widowed mom with fears of abandonment well. (She's so wrapped up in her own angst & weaknesses, in most scenes Melanie, who's a virtual stranger, comforts her daughter when she's horrified.) Although the movie holds up very well (especially the diner scene where everyone is pontificating about bird attacks) some scenes are very hokey, & unintentionably laughable now. Those still close-ups of 'Tippi's' facial expressions before, during, & after the gas station explosion are jaw-droppingly hilarious! I'm not sure this movie should be remade. Unlike the unnecessary ""Psycho"" remake, at least ""The Birds"" could benefit from modern day special effects. It would be great to see Hitchcock's original ending realized: The Golden Gate Bridge covered with ""The Birds"".",,Anonymous,Horror
You will never look at those little feathered things in the same way ever again....,"Hitchcock showed what he could do when given another of Daphne Du Maurier's ""The Birds"" in 1960 and was well on his way into the supernatural with THE BIRDS. If anyone can hold you in suspense with a bunch of seagulls and sparrows Hitchcock and Du Mauroer can.Tippi Hedren is the ice queen  blonde, a standard in Hitchcock's films.  And she really earns her salary in this one.  Don't forget Jessica Tandy, the overbearing mother.

Alfred Hitchcock at his best,"In my opinion, it's one of the best horror movies ever; Of course you can not match other great movies like ""Psycho"" or ""The Shining"" but still, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job. I think the creators had an idea that someone else would hardly have. I only have to criticize the special effects and the open end (for a movie without continuation). Highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is how I got hooked,"This movie is why I got hooked on Hitchcock movies so how can I find any fault in it? Tippi Hendrin plays the beautiful Melanie Daniel's who meets bachelor Mitch Brenner in a bird shop. Here she plays a practical joke on him and in turn, he plays one back. This leads to her buying him a pair of lovebirds. She takes them to Bodega Bay and all hell breaks loose. The bird attacks are stunning, the suspense is very high in this film, the lack of music gives this whole movie a cool effect and the final scenes are breathtaking. I would recommend this for a first movie of his to watch. Prepare to be amazed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Open to interpretation,"I agree with ""cordedpoodle"" in that The Birds is a metaphor for nature and chaos conflicting with human society. I enjoyed the open-ended story such as it is and found the characters to be very convincingly portrayed by the actors. The chemistry between Hedren and Taylor was terrific and their relationship developed in a very satisfying manor. The periphery characters of Mitch's 'clinging' mother and in his still jealous previous love interest were also first-rate characterizations. The only character I thought was somewhat extraneous was Mitch's daughter. The direction and pure craftsmanship of the film were also of the first order. I think Hitchcock said that he used 371 trick shots or so in the film. The Hitchcock Collection DVD I watched had excellent supplementary materials and the picture and sound were very sharp. Another feather in the cap of The Master. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I never thought I could be scared of birds,"Let me say now that I think birds are one of the LEAST frightening things in this world--but this film will leave you feeling differently.The film is basically about a town invaded by birds with no real mission...oh yeah, except to attack. It is wonderfully acted and isn't one of your basic slasher-teen flicks. This movie is like a Stephen King book--no outright terror, but psychological horror. It's scary to think about it actually happening. And I was utterly surprised at myself for being so frightened of BIRDS--I mean, I own birds. But these are not your regular birds. See the film to see what I mean.",,Anonymous,Horror
"unnerving images, bad acting","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is undoubtedly one of the low points in his career. I am not sure why he chose to make this move. It has a weak plot that was doomed to fail. Of course Hitchcock was still able to deliver some eerie scenes of the birds. Also he was able to give the setting of the small town its own life, just as he did in Psycho and Rear Window. In those movies, as in the Birds, he allows the setting to become its own character. Other than those two positives, the movie was lacking quite a bit in other areas. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor were perhaps Hitchcock's worst lead pair. Most scenes were over-acted. Also the direction was not up to par with Hitchcock's other movies. I give it a solid 5 out 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic.,"I wish I was around when this was first released on the cinema.  Every time I watch it, it freaks me out.  Tippi Hedren is particularly excellent in her role as Melanie Daniels.  However, the bit where the camera focuses upon the woman in the cafe and looking straight down the camera lens, she says, ""Ever since you came here, this started happening...it's your fault!"" - absolute genius.  In my view, that is one of the finest moments in cinema history. Is the woman talking to Hedren's character or to the viewer?! It's awesome. There's something very real about the whole situation and the way it is shot is superb, nothing short of genius.  Hitch really was a genius.  They really don't make horror movies like they used to.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

NATURE'S GREATEST ATTACK,"The birds is simply one of Hitchcock's best films. It's not only his final masterpiece, but also the best film ever made about how we treat nature and how nature can strike back violently. Yet the best thing about THE BIRDS is how the film never takes itself too seriously, something not surprising given Hitchcock's peculiar sense of humor. And once again the undisputed master of suspense creates memorable scenes including the birds attack at the Bodega Bay gas station and one particular shot at the end of the movie involving a door that i will not spoil. Something so simple and yet so striking. And please, do yourself a favor and watch the film's unique trailer. A hands down classic!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Hitchcock masterpiece,"This is, for me, one of the most horrifying films of all time, even by Hitchcock's standards. Tippi Hedren turns in a superb performance, portraying the usual ""ice-blonde"" as a real woman; not just as a model the camera can ogle. Rod Taylor is also very appealing as the suave action man, with that special twinkle-in-the-eye, which only he can do. There are some particularly scary scenes involving ""the birds"", which is all down to the terrific Hitchcock direction. This is a mesmeric film which will horrify all who watch it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Memorable Hitchcock Classic,"Although it was 3 years after Psycho, The Birds was well worth the wait. Although the acting wasn't great--Tippi Hedren was much better in Marnie, the special effects in this movie was absolutely awesome.  You have to remember that this was 1963 and that there were no computer graphics/animation to pull off the illusion needed to make this movie successful.  I felt that not having any music for this movie was an effective move by Hitch that added to the eerieness of the picture.  Just thinking about the chance of every bird in the world to gang up on the human race sends chills down my spine.  Hitchcock is able to pull it off.  One of his 10 best.  If you have never seen this movie, you must see it as soon as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Hitchcock from du Maurier short story,"The short story by Daphne du Maurier is transposed from South West England to America for this Hitchcock outing. It contains some really effective and scary moments and is beautifully photographed. It also has some typical Hitchcock humour. Without giving the game away for those yet to view this film, it concerns a strange phenomenon - all the birds start to gather together for a concerted attack on mankind. This attack is viewed from the perspective of the inhabitants of a small seaside community and an outsider - played by Tippi Hedren. The very ambiguous ending is as per the original tale, and all the more chilling for it. When short stories are expanded to full length films the original's impact is frequently lost. Not so here, I think. One does not look at gulls and starlings in quite the same way, having seen this film!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Master of Suspense is also a Master of Symbolism!,"Well, I'm so glad I sold my Budgies and Cockatiels before I watch this movie. Because this was pretty darn disturbing!The Birds finds Hitchcock at his very best building up the tension and creating suspense. The way the minor details are revealed in this movie is enough to make you glued to the screen throughout the whole movie, but I already know that Hitchcock is the best in doing this.
What I didn't know before watching this movie is that The Master of Suspense is also a Master of Symbolism!Many people consider The Birds as one of Hitchcock most modest films, even some of his fans. I can see why, and it's simply because the movie seems that it left a lot of very important questions unanswered. I said it seems because it really did answer these questions symbolically.I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen this gem yet, but I'll just point that the key to all these questions is a very important character and everything related to it.Just try to think which character the movie gave it a lot of exposition, and you'll easily understand the whole movie. And there is where I've an issue with The Birds. I think it gives a lot of explanations to this character that we don't necessarily need to because the movie expose some details what have already been revealed before. That being said, all characters are well-grounded, compelling, interesting, and necessary to the plot.All the performances were excellent, specially from Tippi Hedren who played the movie's protagonist. She is a wonderful actress, and her performance in this movie is nothing short of endearing. She is as charming as Audrey Hepburn!Some few decisions the characters made, may be one or two, are not so subtle, but the execution of the results to these decisions is what annoyed me a little bit. The characters seemed forced to fall into the trap.Although there is some blood and gore in this movie, Alfred Hitchcock proves again that what the scenes imply can be way more brutal than what they show. The scenes when the titular creatures attack are very painful to watch. Adding insult to injury, the birds acquire a metaphorical complexity that is as distressing as their beaks!Overall, The Birds is a very underrated Hitchcock film that doesn't lack any of Hitchcock's unparalleled brilliance. Also it would make a great companion to Hitchcock's most famous work, Psycho!(9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock's Last Great Film,"Hitchcock never limited himself. He stuck mostly to the thriller genre but his films always blended varying styles and themes. The Birds is his venture into pure horror, an area that he'd touched on previously but never fully dived into. It's him taking the atmosphere that runs through many of his mysteries and combing it with imagery and ideas that succeed in being as macabre as possible. The whole idea behind the film is preposterous, yet it is clear that the whole point is using it to create as frightening a spectacle as possible and that is something the master of suspense achieves.The set-up involves wealthy Californian socialite Melanie Daniels journeying to Bodega Bay in order to woo lawyer and bachelor Mitch Brenner, after he makes a thinly veiled invite to her. She meets his icy mother and cheerful little sister, the local school teacher and the townspeople all seem nice enough so she decides to stay for the weekend. Of course this is part of the film's genius, everything moves along smoothly and seems pleasant for most of the first half, creating a sense of ease on the surface that you know is just waiting to be torn apart. Tippi Hedren puts in a very good performance, far greater than she would later do in 'Marnie' where she appeared to be suffocated by the complexities of the material. She is clearly at her best when she can play to her naturally warm and charming personality, which are traits she aptly passes on to Melanie.Something more sinister starts to form when large groups of birds begin attacking and killing the locals at random with no reasoning, leaving the entire town stranded, confused and defenceless against further attacks. It's a true testament to Hitchcock's genius that he was able to make a species as seemingly harmless as birds appear to be the most vicious and terrifying out there. He does what he is so good at, building unease and dread slowly out of seemingly ordinary situations. It would be nowhere near as scary if it wasn't for the deliberately paced build-up. The film is surprisingly brutal and visceral even for modern day. There's no shortage of people cut or sliced as a result of the attacks. The scene where the farmer's body is discovered is truly horrifying. Even the bleak ending, something Hitchcock was no stranger to, feels much darker than usual.The characters present here are so enjoyable and distinctly drawn that you could lose the entire birds gone wild aspect and it would still be an interesting watch. The suave Mitch (played smoothly by the ideal Hitchcock leading man Rod Taylor), his distant mother Lydia, the sharp school teacher Annie Hayworth, the crotchety old ornithologist, they are all sharply defined and engaging presences. It's something that Hitchcock also did to great effect in his previous film 'Psycho', he gave us characters that we gain some kind of connection to so that when the terror begins we feel invested in what's at stake. There's plenty of smartly handled scenes that establish details about their personalities and moods, such as a nicely emotive one that explains Lydia's coldness. Hitchcock has paced the film perfectly, there isn't a second that is boring or uninteresting to watch.The effects are understandably dated, but still rather impressive for how much creativity was used in making it look like a massive flock of birds was causing so much destruction. All kinds of techniques were used and most of them blend together effectively. If anything it is simply guilty of showing too much ambition for the time period. What is notable is that the film contains no score, regular collaborator Bernard Herrmann is noted as 'sound consultant', and that is an interesting stylistic choice. The film appreciates the strength of silence and uses it fantastically. How unease can be crafted because everything appears to be too quiet. There is a potency with in that which the film taps in to. It also means that the piercing squawks that emerge once the birds attack are all the more startling.For me personally this is Hitchcock's last truly great film. One where the story, the writing, the acting, the scares and the direction all came together to create something both spectacular and memorable. None of his films that followed ever reached the same heights, whether it was because one of these areas was dealt with poorly or a multitude of them were. Here Hitchcock knew better than anyone that there has to be a story and set of people that we feel invested in for the film to truly work. As a result this film is a masterpiece in how to gradually build tension and craft horror that packs a punch. When the scares come along they work outstandingly, partly because of the gruesome imagery but also because we're invested in the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The birds were out for vengeance,"The Birds is an incredible film.  At first I was a little bit confused as to how it could be ranked as such a popular film.

A wonderful movie from the master of suspense!,"First off, Tippi Hedren was great for the part. This movie just shows that you don't need to have ANY music in a movie just to make it scary. It's great how Hitchcock slowly builds up the suspense, as he does in all his movies. The scary thing about this movie is that when you see it, it is not only scary to see these innocent people being attacked by the birds, but it's also sort of psychologically scary because Hitchcock almost forces you to believe that this could really happen at any time when we least expect it. In my opinion, the only REALLY scary scene is when Melanie goes upstairs and is attacked by the birds and is basically trapped, what makes that scene so scary was that the it shows the birds coming right at the camera and also that they show so many times the birds biting her hand in the same place, you feel likes it's almost happening to you. An excellent film but you might not want to see it if you are already a little afraid of birds.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds,"I don't know if this is Hitchcock's ""best"" film. I've seen almost all of them that are available, from some of his early silent films to his last.

I still feel like shouting to the man lighting his cigar with gasoline all over the street, ""Don't drop the match."" And when Tippi Hedron sits at the school yard and the birds slowly fill the yard behind her. I tingle. What a movie!

All silliness aside,"I'll be honest, I sometimes watch this movie to laugh. The reaction of the people to being attacked to birds, just gets me sometimes. Other times, the mystery of it grasps me. I wonder just WHY this town, WHY these people, WHY these birds. It makes me wonder what was going on in the beautiful brain of Hitchcock that he thought this up. The lack of music haunts you, the silence adds to the suspense instead of a nice violin piece. You start to fear the sounds of the birds just as the people on the screen are starting to fear them. You get drawn in, you find yourself the next day noticing just how many birds there are around you.This is a must watch for any Hitchcock fan.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much Flapping About Nothing,"""The Birds"" is quite a come-down from the magnificent decade of the 1950s for Hitchcock, and following on from the success of ""Psycho"". Watching ""The Birds"" on the back of his best work from that period I always find it hard to believe that he made this. While the film looks gorgeous in Technicolour - some scenes look like Hopper paintings - the main problem lies in a very pedestrian script that fails to hold interest or spark much tension. A flock of birds sit on a jungle gym getting ready to attack? Just does nothing for me. The film is uncomfortably melodramatic to the point that it feels more like a heavy romantic drama from this period than a horror. It drags a fair bit, and again this goes back to the mediocre script. I am surprised of Hitchcock taking this on, with all of his experience, because in my opinion there was not a whole lot for him to work with here.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nature vs. Humanity,"""The Birds,"" like ""Psycho"" (1960) was a major departure from Hitchcock's 1950s romantic melodramas. Instead of lunatic Norman Bates, pursuing his hobby of taxidermy by stuffing and mounting birds, this time it's the birds who have the upper hand. ""The Birds"" is a technical masterpiece. Hitchcock worked with his most trusted associates (Editor George Tomasini, DP Robert Burks and Production Designer Robert Boyle). All the actors are perfectly cast and wonderful, from 14 year old Veronica Cartwright to 85 year old Ethel Griffies. I was once privileged to see some of the storyboard: nothing was left to chance. Every shot and action was carefully pre-planned and executed. Although I admire the film all the more each time that I see it, its dry formalism and constraint feels somewhat alienating. Hitchcock seemed to be in total control of everything, except perhaps, if Donald Spoto's biography is to be believed, himself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
What do you expect with a 1963 movie?,No really? it's not like they had computers and graphics back then. This was a really great movie for back then. It's about this lady Melanie(Tippi) who is going to deliver some love birds to some guy i forgot his name already sorry. When she gets to Bodega Bay she gets a welcome by a whole bunch of birds. I didn't really realize that there was no music until i read the comments here. so what if there is no music? It's different and better than having to listen to a song you don't like.  Instead you hear the birds cawing. I always thought the birds were real. I should have known that they were fake. How else would they have trained hundreds of birds.

"""Suspense and shock beyond anything you have seen or imagined!""","The Birds is easily one of the best horror films of all time. It's Hitchcock's second best achievement (behind the fantastic horror masterpiece that was Psycho).One of the great things about this is that there's no soundtrack, just the ominous sounds of the birds flapping and screeching. It only underscores Hitch's sure directorial hand -- who needs a clanging, scary soundtrack when the images and well-plotted suspense do it all for you? The fact that we cannot really unravel the mystery gives the film an almost mythic quality, as if it means more than it actually does.The performances are top notch. Tippi Hendren steals the show as the wealthy but fun-loving socialite. Jessica Tandy provides a hypnotic and wonderfully disturbing portrait of a possessive mother, and Suzanne Pleshette is excellent as an emotionally devastated schoolteacher -- she blends toughness and vulnerability to perfection in a small role.There's only one small problem. The matte paintings and animation that create the attack scenes are admittedly both tame and lame when looked at today. Yet it hardly detracts from the rest of the film anyways, so it's really nothing.I don't know how else to put the way I feel abut The Birds except to say ""indescribable"".

The ensuing presence of our flying friends is slowly built, which is of course a Hitchcock trademark. It's truly a shocking film of it's time (more so than Psycho, in my opinion), and more or less a female driven movie.

It's really an achievement in the 60's to make such a good looking movie with brilliant special effects.This movie is more of a drama than a horror movie, but still it's pretty enjoyable even today. Hitchcock puts deepness into characters and it makes them believable but it also makes this movie pretty slow because of the long lasting dialogues. Another thing to notice is that there's no soundtrack, just the ambient sounds. It's good in a way and it actually suits the film really well.If they remaked this movie they could not use birds in that way because there's a law to prohibit cruelty to animals.

"""It's the end of the world !!"" - yelled the drunken Doomsayer at the diner. An interspecies birds launch an attack on humans in the small coastal town of Bodega Bay.","Coming from a last night screening of ""The Birds"" in a drive-in theater, i decided to write the review here of one of Hitchcock's most critically misunderstood films, even if it's one of his most cherished & well known towards the general public.Firstly, it's undeniable how much ""The Birds"" influenced the postmodernist horror & suspense cinema, from George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws""; John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Halloween"" and particularly, ""The Fog"" or more recently Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"", the sense of dread provided by a menace surrounding a group of individuals in a small coastal town became the pinnacle of a genre that still attracts millions of viewers.Secondly, Hitchcock's use of silence (no orchestration was used), except for the sound effects to create the birdcalls and noises, was a genious and inovative decision from the Master (Hitchcock had already used this gimmick in ""Lifeboat""), it created the perfect eerie tone for the film.Thirdly, the special effects and animatronics were outstanding for the early 60's standards, and it still holds well and way more realistic (the attacking birds and their interaction with the actors) than the nowadays' use of the overexposed C.G.I.
The way that scenes were staged and photographed by Hitchcock's usual cinematographer, Robert Burks (the visual craftsman behind Hitch's most celebrated films such as ""Dial M For Murder"", ""Rear Window"", ""Vertigo"" or ""North by Northwest"") were unique and inovative (it even amazed the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa who included ""The Birds"" in his top 100 films ever made, using a technical and artistic criteria).Fourthly, the plot was loosely based on the 1952 short-story of the same name by the British Novelist, Dame Daphne du Maurier (who also penned ""Rebecca"" & ""Jamaica Inn"", two previous Hitchcock's film adaptations), but the screenplay by Evan Hunter was expanded to include new characters and sub-plots for the full length movie to work, hence the entire first act developing the relationship between the two main characters and ""the third wheel"" who lives in the coastal town of Bodega Bay, where the main action takes place.The reason why the interspecies of birds attacked people during that fateful weekend was indeed left unexplained, maybe due to the imperfections of the human race (every character in the movie was written as having major flaws) and we're a condemned species after all and nature and the animals, the worthy and the pure ones who will inherit Earth, will come and take their toll.Last, but not the least, the cast. Nathalie Kay ""Tippi"" Hedren (which is, with Peter Griffith, the parents of the Academy Award Nominee, Melanie Griffith), a former fashion model who was discovered by the Master when he saw her in a TV commercial, he put her under his wing and gave her an education in filmmaking, which is way evident in her screen debut in ""The Birds"". She's total confident in the role of Melanie Daniels and made the camera her own, following the footsteps of Hitch's other famous blondes such as Grace Kelly or Kim Novak.'Tippi', and now the tastes may differ, is probably the most beautiful of all the Hitchcock's leading actresses, she had a some kind of innocence, but at the same time a mysterious nuance throughout her on-screen personna and debuting at 32 years old on cinema she had much more class and self-confidence as a woman than Grace Kelly in her 20's trying to stole the focus in ""Rear Window"" or ""Dial M for Murder"".
Her performance here as Melanie Daniels and as the title character in the Hitch's follow-up work, ""Marnie"", where she delivered even a greater performance, are absolutely fascinating.Rod Taylor was cast as the male lead when Hitch opted for a cheaper actor (Connery wasn't avaiable because he was shooting his second entry in the Bond universe: ""From Russia with Love"", but he was later used as 'Tippi' Hedren's charming co-lead in ""Marnie"") than his usual lead stars of Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant. He wanted to make a film about the unexplained bird attacks, not about Hollywood's established hearthtrobs and stardom, so he keeped it low profile. 
The surly rugged, but wooden actor, who looked at least 10 years older than his actual age and could have matched better with his on-screen mother (played here by an over-the-top, but future Oscar winner Jessica Tandy) than 'Tippi', was not the perfect choice for the ""Mitch"" Brenner character, but in his defense he didn't ruined it and, in a matter of fact, he fared better doing his beefcake action routine during the birds attacks scenes, than in the more intimate and sensitive moments with Hedren.To contrast his ladies, brunette Suzanne Pleshette was specifically hired by Hitch to play Rod Taylor's former fiancee, the school teacher Annie Hayworth, and she was jealous throughout principal photography of 'Tippi' having all the director's attention and being the lead star in the film, and maybe that bitterness enhanced her supporting performance. 
She's very good, especially during the initial confrontation with 'Tippi'.Former child star and future adult actress, Veronica Cartwright, better known as Lambert in Ridley Scott's sci-fi / horror classic ""Alien"", is appropriate as Rod Taylor's much younger sister. Again he looked more his father than his older brother.To summarize, ""The Birds"" isn't Hitchcock's american masterpiece film, that honor belongs undoubtedly to ""Vertigo"", but it's one of his most daring and technically accomplished works. The birds as characters may not be as memorable as Anthony Perkins' rendition of Norman Bates in ""Psycho"", but they're still quite effective and the movie deserves to be re-praised as one of the greatest entries in the filmography of 'The Master of Suspense'.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Whilst Psycho has been ripped off, parodied, copied and shudder Remade, there has never been another film like the Birds.","I first saw this film when I was a cynical teenager, adamant that nothing could scare me, and it didn't- I point blank refused to let it happen.  Not the Exorcist, not Freddy or Jason and not the Birds could shake this tough-girl up. So now I am a bit older and wiser and I also know a lot more about film. And I watched the Birds again for a different look at it.It is SO cleverly done. As an earlier reviewer said, Hitch plays the audience like a finely tuned instrument and the effects can be stronger than you would realise especially for a 1963 film being watched in the 21st Century! (A lot of younger people seem to believe that old films are at best cute and at worse, old fashioned and irrelevant- oh if only they knew, they were so much worse than anything that is considered ""Shocking"" today) EXAMPLE: I am not scared of spiders but they bring out an almost primeval instinct in me, My hands sweat, I get cold shivers and goose bumps all over but at the same time my rational brain tells me it's ok and I pick up incy-wincy and chuck him out of the window- no problem. But after  I watched the Birds, it happened again. Some scenes gave me the shivers so bad that I thought I was going to flip out and hide in a cave somewhere and by bed time I was pumped so full of adrenaline that I couldn't get to sleep. It's Hitch you see, not only does he know film, he knows YOU as well and how to get to you.  I will try to keep it brief as to what makes this film so special. Firstly, he lands heavy portents on the characters.  The early scenes all end with a bird acting strange, in a variety of ways. Secondly, silence is sometimes golden.  The indoor attack sequences are unique in the reaction of the victims, I will say no more as it so effective and scary.

"movie-review-style (details, but not too much)","Like many other animal-attack movies (Jaws, etc.), you would think that the solution is to stay away from the animal and it will not harm you, right? What do you do if the adversaries can get to you inside your own home? Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of The Birds by Daphne Du Maurier is a thrilling movie that asks the same question.  Hitchcock has been known to produce suspenseful thrillers that send you home thinking, but The Birds can actually draw you into the town of Bodega Bay.  The plot starts out with a young woman, Melanie Daniels, traveling to the little town near San Francisco to see a man named Mitch Brenner.  The town's eyes were upon her, watching her every move, as she traveled out to Mitch's house.  Mitch lived with his jealous overbearing mother, Lydia Brenner, and younger sister Cathy.  Mitch and Cathy love Melanie, but Lydia is very suspicious of her. The unspoken tension that comes from Mitch's ex-girlfriend Annie Hayworth (Cathy's schoolteacher) is a technique that is somewhat difficult to find in the character development of modern-day characters.  Once the birds begin to attack, Melanie's character development becomes the center of attention. She goes from a wealthy, boasting, girl to a well controlled, lovable woman by the end of the picture.  Mitch Brenner, on the other hand, is a more prominent figure in Bodega Bay.  His complacent demeanor settles the movie's enigmatic attacks.  Alfred Hitchcock continues the element of suspense from the beginning of The Birds all the way to your living room.  The fact that there is no music in the movie adds to the eeriness of the birds when they mass and attack, juxtaposed with the melody of children in song.  Hitchcock also delayed the first major attack until near sixty minutes into the movie, a technique modern filmmakers use recurrently.  There could possibly be a symbolic relationship between the birds and Lydia's jealousy of her son's women; once Lydia learns to accept Melanie, the birds can be looked upon with a different perspective.  The scenes of the bird attacks may seem tacky today, but when the film was released, the birds in the movie were the newest special effect the public had seen for a while.  He believed that the characters' reactions to the attacks were worth much more than the attacks themselves.  Because of his passion for atypical, Hitchcock left out a reason for the attacks-the avoidance of that explanation was purely startling to audiences.  Some may be disappointed by the slow progression of discovery that is hindered by the ending of the movie, but this is one that is left open to the imagination.  To watch this amazing, thirty-eight-year-young Hitchcock classic come to life, rent The Birds today.",,Anonymous,Horror
Alfred Hitchcock's seagull,"Bodega bay sees the arrival of sophisticated socialite (Hedren), cautiously optimistic of a budding relationship with local boy (Taylor) over whom all the local girls swoon – none more so than school teacher (Pleshette). But jealousy and social acceptance become minor distractions to the relaxed seaside lifestyle, when the community's bird population suddenly get into a flap and begin terrorizing bystanders.Hitchcock's rather austere treatment of what is, ostensibly, a strained love triangle played against a backdrop of marauding flocks of seagulls, contains one strong characterization (that of Annie, the jilted school teacher as played with aplomb by gravel-voiced Pleshette) and some glorious location cinematography. Other than that, it's a labour intensive allegory, a loose machination for examining gender tensions, based around a colloquial term for women (Birds). Chauvinistic widow Mitch Brenner dalliances with unsuspecting quarry, admired by his mostly senile neighbours, encouraged to end his therapeutic (read womanizing) ways and find a replacement wife and mother to his school-aged daughter, i.e. Annie. But his pathological weakness for blondes – in direct contrast to Annie's raven-haired vixen – introduces a superior contender that must fend off the unwanted attentions of all comers (some feathered) to claim her trophy and rightful place as the family's next matriarch.Hitchcock's macabre self indulgence is evident in his treatment of Hedren, whose encounter with the feathered contestants is a harrowing experience, and a somewhat confronting action sequence for its vintage (Hedren later stated she narrowly avoided being blinded by a stray beak). As usual the complexities in the characterizations bleed into the fabric over an extended period of time, the almost arbitrary appearance of the birds gradually becomes pervasive coinciding with the characters' darkest revelations. And while the construction is interesting, the lack of momentum occasionally drifts into soap opera.Narrative challenges aside, it still remains a stylish approach, with memorable scenes including some graphic attacks, and the best performance of a woman scorned you're ever likely to see on the screen. It's just a shame that it takes 2 hours to convey.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fine Feathered Enemies?,"It's hard to know what director Alfred Hitchcock, or authors Daphne du Maurier and Evan Hunter, were up to with The Birds. I've read a variety of explanations of the film and story, none of which quite makes sense. Not that a movie has to, but one would like to know what the director and author had on their minds when making it. The story itself concerns an unexplained series of attacks by birds on a small California coastal community. There is a romance, a subplot or two, but that's about it. A number of people get pecked to death, a gas station blows up, but the focal point of the movie, once it gets moving, is the birds themselves, and when or whether they will attack again. The acting by Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette and Jessica Tandy, is good if hardly outstanding, though to be fair, they don't have that much to work with. By today's standards the special effects are fairly primitive, and one has to suspend disbelief now and again when some of the obviously unreal birds fly into view.If it belongs to any genre, I would say that The Birds falls under the general rubric of what, for want of a better term, I would call the Anglo-Saxon Anxiety Film, which is to say a movie that features mostly WASP characters under attack from foreigners or outside forces in general, pulling together, often in some isolated outpost, where they make one last stand against the ""invaders"". The Anglo Anxiety film goes back to the earliest days of the movies, and includes many if not most westerns, especially those that feature white settlers and/or cavalry under attack from Indians. There are AAF elements in many horror movies, some gangster films (look what those awful foreigners are doing to our cities!), and World War II movies, especially those concerning the Japanese. A good deal of fifties sci-fi can be viewed in this light, especially The Thing and its various spaceman successors. By the sixties, the anxiety became more intense, and also more diffuse, often turning into black comedy (Dr. Strangelove, Rosemary's Baby). The Birds is Hitchcock's take on this Last Stand At the Alamo genre, and he makes the most of the improbable situation, even including an incongruously English woman ornithologist, who uncannily resembles Hitch in drag, to explain that birds are really are friends, and wish harm on no one. Could this be the director poking fun at Americans? We'll never know, of course, though it's worth pointing out that the great man remained a British subject, was knighted in his twilight years, and died in England.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Hitchcock is just sick, sick i tells ya!","As is the case with Psycho - the classic made directly before this film - The Birds is a story that can be split into two halves.  Where Psycho gave us Janet Leigh's getaway before turning its attention to Norman Bates, The Birds gives us Tippi Hedren's practical jokes before letting the winged freaks terrorise us.As is also the case with Psycho, the opening thread works well enough on its own, so that the gentle romantic comedy and Hedren's practical jokes feel like well-developed set-up rather than padding.  Hedren is effortlessly charming, and her smoker's voice is cute and occasionally sexy (before it was passed down a generation to become irritating).  The chemistry between her and Rod Taylor seems genuine enough, and the unspoken tension that comes from his ex-girlfriend and overbearing mother add depth to the characters. It seems strange that so many reviews complain of the wafer-thin story; these are details and depths that would be hard to find in the set-up of most modern movies.Having Hedren's character as a practical joker is a nice touch, as most people know Hitchcock was a bit of a trickster himself.  You get the idea he's sniggering to himself behind the camera, thinking `my jokes are a lot meaner than hers!'  His sense of humour is perhaps more prominent than ever, and leads to my favourite shot in the whole film; as Hedren drives badly along winding roads, we see her love birds clinging on to their perch, leaning to one side and then to the other as she swerves all over the road. It looks incredibly fake but it's just such an inventive idea you laugh with it rather than at it, which I suppose was the point.Once Hedren's flirting with Rod Taylor begins in earnest, and the story moves to Bodega Bay, the film begins to lose its similarities with Psycho. Whereas the shower scene in Bates Motel changed the tone of the film instantly, here we are witness to a rather slow build-up and an impending sense of doom.  The tension is built with predictable expertise, so that things that shouldn't be scary genuinely are; when all you hear is a flapping of wings it's scary, when all you see is a bird landing on a climbing frame it's scary.  The effects have aged quite badly, but they are no real barrier to the tension and fear you will feel, although you probably get more from the film if you're not too keen on birds already.  While I haven't got a phobia I could live quite happily without their flapping wings and biting beaks so all the movie's tricks worked on me.As other reviews have pointed out, the most noticeable difference with Psycho comes in what we are allowed to see.  Shadows and chocolate sauce were enough to scare in Psycho, but in The Birds we see everything, including a horrible shot of a corpse whose eyes have been pecked out.  It is testament to Hitchcock's skill that he could approach these movies so differently and have them both work so well, each scaring the audience in their own way.The ending is deliberately abrupt, and I'm not quite sure if I liked it or not.  It was a nice idea to suggest that this wasn't the end of the story, just the end for these characters, but as with most older movies the absence of an end credit sequence means there is no time within the film to think about it.  It was probably a little too abrupt, but it is hard to see how else it could have ended.My main recommendation for the film is that for a few days after seeing it, I noticed loads more birds than usual on the wires and rooftops outside my house, and felt rather suspicious of why there were there.  I'm sure Hitchcock would have wanted it that way.",,Anonymous,Horror
Take the time to unravel the meaning of this masterpiece.,"This movie seems to be so misunderstood by so many. Many don't understand it. Many that praise it need to also watch it again to have more to praise than suspense and special effects.Begin with the characters.Mitch Brenner is a unmarried successful San Francisco lawyer. I will cue you in here... today he would be able to legally marry his male partner. His double life is spent during the week in SF and weekends being a good son in Bodega Bay.Lydia Brenner is Mitch's mother. Seemingly insecure since her husband died and left her with 2 children. Seemingly insecure, but really the domineering and overprotective mother shielding her boy from women like Melanie Daniels and Anne Heyward. Going as far as criticizing him for not being as smart and in control of it all, as his father. Chopping him down to a little boy, because his father would have known how to protect the family.Anne Heyward the school teacher. Deep voiced and sexy. Ex-lover of Mitch that moved to Bodega Bay just to be near Mitch She reveals their relationship never got off the ground because of his mother as well as other reasons. One line of dialogue to Melanie was, ""I don't think there has ever been anything between Mitch and any woman"". She indicates that when she was no longer a threat to Lydia and her control over Mitch, Lydia and she became close friend and Mitch and her became like brother and sister.Melanie Daniels. Wealthy, beautiful, chic, educated, fun party girl, world traveler, well groomed to 1962 perfection. Well guess who really never has a truly romantic moment with this cool, sophisticated, wealthy, party girl, blonde beauty? In the pet store scene one would expect any hunk of a healthy red blooded heterosexual male to be at least flirting with her, not intentionally making a fool out of her. I think his overall lack of interest in doing anything other than playing this unfriendly game reeks of a sarcastic distrust of woman... but he probably trusts his mother.Miss Grundy. A local Bodega Bay ornithologist that is the only one that thinks all the incidents of bird attacks are ridiculous exaggeration. Grundy wears man tailored clothing. Her hairstyle, outfit, and demeanor is more of a masculine dignified Englishman than a Northern Californian elderly woman. She even smokes a pipe with butch gestures.HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS EVERYONE... HERE COME THE BIRDS!!!! Explanation of the Birds... Mitch has now a second beautiful woman following and showing heavy interest in being with him. How many will he reject? How long can he hide, showing ambivalent feelings towards women as they arrive one after the other. Rivaling each other in attractiveness. How long before the towns people start calling him, Lydia's weird son that never married? The birds represent Mitch's homosexuality. They attack women and children mostly. First Melanie. Then the gull smashes Anne's door where those two women are just relaxing. Anne says, Poor thing must have got confused and flew into the light"". The children's birthday party. In the house after dinner through the fire place. Only one single male farmer was attacked in a detailed scene. He could be someone one else that may have known about Mitch. The school children. The decent on the whole town. Anne's death. Melanie, Lydia, and Anne certainly had more than a real good hint about Mitch. You can't hide it anymore Mitch. It's come home to roost! So Melanie hears some rustling upstairs while the others sleep. Melanie should know what that means. She has to have figured out by now where Mitch is concerned, something is wrong in the bedroom. Obviously his bedroom has not seen much action with women. She opens the door and is attacked and nearly killed by the birds... they peck at her and make shrieking, and scowling noises. Rescued by Mitch and Lydia she is in a state of shock. One gets the feeling as they drive away that they may never return to Bodega Bay. Lydia holds Melanie in the back seat of the car reminiscent of the Blessed Mother cradling Jesus in Michael Amgelo's statue, The Pieta. Could you ever imagine Mitch and Melanie ever being in a relationship ever again? Seems like Mitch has turned another woman into a sister.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible Hitchcock film... more scary than most other horror films,"Hitchcock has a unique film style; no one can do exactly what he does when directing horror films. His talent is especially obvious in this film; all the nice little touches, the old typical Hitchcock details(controlling mother, minor romance between male and female main characters, strong-willed, powerful female main character, etc.) are beautifully and discreetly put into the film, without in any way distracting from the main plot or disturbing the natural cycle of the film. I like how Hitchcock, as with several other of his big films(Psycho immediately comes to mind) starts with one story, that has nothing in particular to do with the source of the terror. The movie starts with a certain story, that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film, and ends with that story still present, instead of just flat-out starting the film with a story about birds attacking people. There are hints and a lot of foreshadowing from the very minute that the movie starts, but it's not the main theme of the film until the last fourth part. The plot is pretty good, interesting and developing consistently throughout the movie. The actors all perform very well, with no exceptions. The characters are believable, and their actions are mostly entirely understandable. In fact, I found it far more psychologically realistic, in how it portrays the different characters emotional reactions to the situations. The special effects are amazing; the film is more than forty years old and the effects look very dated today, but it still scared me more than I could have possibly imagined. I don't think I'll look at a bird the same way ever again. Another masterpiece from the master of suspense. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind watching a film that isn't entirely new, and who are looking for a good scare. I have a hard time imagining anyone not being scared by this film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock's finest.,"There are a lot of celebrated Hitchcock movies, but to me this is his best. The man against nature along with the slow build up are fantastic. This is a love story intermixed with a thriller. A chance encounter at a pet store between Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner causes Melanie to track him from San Francisco to Bodega Bay. It is here that people are mysteriously attacked by birds. It starts out slowly with a single bird attacking one person, to massed, planned attacks. A lot of modern viewers deride this as boring or cheesy, nut they need to look at it through the lens with which it was made in 1963. This is a gritty thriller that reminds us that we are not as superior as we think we are.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If the birds don't get them, the lung cancer will.","Only a director of Hitchcock's calibre could transform a patently silly idea like killer birds into such a nerve wracking and thoroughly entertaining movie, one that proves without a doubt that he really is 'the master of suspense'.The director spends the first half of his film investing purely in the characters, letting his audience get to know them, making the viewer care so as to increase the potency of the horror once they are eventually in peril. Before we even see the birds in action, Hitch shows exactly what his feathered fiends are capable of, with a truly shocking shot of a victim, eyes pecked out, covered in blood. The scenes when the birds attack are suitably vicious and gruesome, Hitch making it abundantly clear that no-one is safe from harm, not even children.But it is the moments between the attacks, the calms before the storm, when the director really pulls out all the stops to show how just good he is at cranking up the tension. A flap of a wing, a few creepy echoey caws, screeches and squawks, a malevolent glance—that's all Hitch needs to have his audience on tenterhooks. Case in point: my favourite scene of the film, in which Melanie (Tippi Hedren) sits smoking yet another cigarette while crows slowly gather behind her; when she finally turns around, there's hundreds of the bloody things—superb!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very intriguing plot!,"This is a great story!  The scary part of this movie -- I would say -- is not just the scenes where they are being attacked by the birds, but the idea that they are.  It shows, that we don't know what would happen, if for some reason a species that seems relatively harmless most of the time, decides to turn on us.  Add in some suspenseful scenes, and a story among the characters, and you have a very well done movie!  I highly recommend this movie!",,Anonymous,Horror
"both absurd and completely terrifying, a film of massive intelligence and enthrallment","What a repeat viewing will bring: The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's blockbuster entertainment that somehow can appeal to the ""art-house"" movie-goers as well. Meaning that even more than with Psycho, and certainly on a much grander and ambitious palette than North by Northwest, we have Hitchcock the grand ol' Master of Suspense for his mainstream fans, and at the same time gives an appeal to those who might consider themselves too high-minded to be considered part of the 'mainstream'. Meaning if you're in a coffee shop and on one end there's a group of teenagers and on the other end a couple of middle-aged psycho-therapists with numerous degrees, they could both be talking with similar depth &/or enthusiasm over the Birds. It's a work where the story gets set up very well: Tippi Hedren as the daughter of a high-ranking official (maybe a few brain cells and style-wise above Paris Hilton) in San Francisco who wants to get to know better a man, Mitch, who's from an island off the coast. She follows him down to the island only to be confronted by Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy) as well as his sister. It's a little uncomfortable a situation in the sort of mother-son dynamic she rattles...but that's not all her presence seems to be incurring.What unravels from there is sheer Hitchcock exploitation film-making- exploiting the audience's wildest fears- always with the most assured and inventiveness that one would expect. Several shots stick in one's memory, perhaps the greatest being the from-the-sky view of the fire that breaks out in the city, and then the seagulls that come into the foreground (point of view is put into question here, and it's a shot that works on both levels as mentioned before). As for the average horror fan, The Birds may work even more effectively than Psycho, despite its age shown in the bird attack scenes- which are nevertheless extraordinary in the usage of composite shots- because after the initial shock of the middle chunk of the film Hitchcock gets into something of a near zombie movie in the last third of the picture. Mitch barricades his mother, sister and Melanie in the house, only to have the rancor-loaded birds crashing head on to get at the house. Getting at what, who's to say? There's explanations that can be given, to be sure, but it may not even be necessary, it just is (one gets this amusingly from Hitchcock via the scene in the restaurant/bar with the town locals giving their drunken/angered/well-informed viewpoints).When it comes down to it, The Birds is not entirely as emotionally disturbing or complex as Vertigo, and one might be reluctant to say that it is art because of its appeal on a commercial level. But art it is, conjured out of a premise that seems ridiculous yet made all the more prescient and startling through Hitchcock's ever-careful style, and specifically the lack of a traditional Herrmann musical score (albeit with his contribution as a sound-designer with the birds notwithstanding). By the last scene, one sees how what might have been a cheesy, trashy work by a lesser filmmaker out for cheap scares, becomes something of a bizarre, discomforting statement on nature versus human beings, or at least what can be capable of those we all take for granted. It's also a hell of a lot of fun for the whole family, more or less; watch for the school-yard singing as the birds swarm around the playground, later parodied wonderfully in High Anxiety.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scary Monsters?,"The most interesting question of this film is the question - why attack the birds the people? In the short story from Daphne de Maurier (called The Birds too) the answer is easy - the complete story based on the attack of the Germans on England in the second world war.A man is standing at the ocean and see the birds a coming like airplanes. The complete english country is attacked. Hitchocks film has changed this things. Only one town called Bodega Bay was attacked and the person in the center of the story is not a man (as by Maurier) either a women. She is it who was first attacked. She has big psycho-problems with the relation to her mother - and in Mitch mother this old conflict become a new dimension. As bigger the love story between Melanie and Mitch as most the birds will attack the people. Lydia is against this love - and thats one point in the conflict who was never directly seen between the women.In other words: The conflict between the women who are mirroring themselfes in the other has an paranoid dimension - on this place the birds are situated. They are the sign of this paranoid picture world- the are the result of the conflict for the visitor of this film. Scary is the great dimension they have - not the hole country but the hole town. This are the two points of a paranoid structur: projection and universal. - The psycho dimension become a place in reality! A real protection is impossible - because the beginning of the attacks is inside the subject - thats the reason why Hitchock let left the title ""The End"" in the end of this film - because the conflict in Melanie have no end inside this film. The scary monsters - the birds will be peaceful again, when she will find a solution for her conflict. We have an apocalyptic picture in the end - who is not an end - the birds are sitting there but in the next moment they can attack the people again.

Birds attack people. There's not much to it.,"The Birds is a movie about birds that go insane and start attacking people. Obviously there's character development but the main thing here is the birds.

The plot apart from the birds is that a young rich playgirl named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) follows a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) to a remote town in California. The film at first takes awhile with delivering the bird attacks but I think it does a good job in keeping us on our toes. That's Alfred Hitchcock for you.

She is the one that takes action and follows a man (it would be quite creepy the other way around, but it also would be th way most movies would have done it back then).Having said that, there are some interesting choices and some quite maddening relationships that get explored.

Death from above,"A Hitchcock classic from 1963 featuring Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels who goes to Bodega Bay to surprise Rod Taylor's Mitch Brenner with a gift for his young sister. Almost at the same time as arriving flocks of birds begin attacking the townsfolk with deathly consequences.Based very loosely on a Daphne du Maurier story by the same name (Hitchcock has used her material before), and also based on a real, but strange, incident in Monterey Bay (1961) where birds frenzied after eating toxic substances. The film shows the start of the attacks and how those affected cope with it and try to survive. The acting is great much like you'd expect from a Hitchcock film and the script allows them to come across as authentic and believable - albeit Melanie comes across as a bit of a stalker at the start of the film the way she hunts and follows Mitch. The cinematography is superb although there is a lot of studio filmed footage in the film which is noticeable by today's standards - this however doesn't detract from the film. Being the master of suspense Hitchcock decided to leave the films ending open to interpretation although 40+ years later people are still debating why the birds began attacking in the first place. Is Melanie's arrival with the caged love birds a catalyst? Is it a revenge for the treatment of birds in real life (as mentioned at various points in the film)? Is it (as mentioned a few times) the end of the world slowly unfolding? Whatever the reason behind it audiences who watch this today will be as baffled as audiences who watched this in the 60's. As a standalone film this is great, by today's standards of quality you may be disappointed by the CGI and fake blood, maybe even the naivety of some of the townsfolk too. If you forget those things and sit and watch the film for what it is you'll surely enjoy it.I'm giving this 8 out 10.

You can tell The Master liked it because in the movies he liked he put a cameo at the begining so that audiences wouldn't be distracted from the plot trying to find him (examples:Psycho, North by Northwest, Frenzy)It' at the very beggining, walking some dogs out of the pet shop (a fact is they were actually his own). It isn't actually scary until the middle, though there's a bit of gore. But then it gets really freaky! The end is a dissapointment, though. Rated PG-13 for violence, gore, and frightening content.",,Anonymous,Horror
A thrilling film.,"Birds is a good and very different film for his purpose, but it fails a lot in very basic levels to be considered a great one. Some special effects are super-outdated, honestly it's very awful if compared to nowadays standards(which is obvious). But is obviously as well that i can't blame a film made in 1963 by having bad visual effects. I would be a jerk if i do such thing. Anyways, it's laughably bad. The major problems that i find in this movie are all located in the second half. Some pointless and incomprehensible actions by the characters really annoyed me. Troubles variated since bad editing to mediocre acting. Some of these problems really disappointed me, because i was sure that this movie was going to be great, due to a excellent first hour. But with such big flaws, it can't be considered nothing more than a good film. Shame. But despite some awful and bad planed/executed sequences, the film as a whole it's not so bad in that quest. I was quite satisfied with the birds 'motivations' to the attacks, for example. Also, the great character development is fundamental to the film 'finale' effect, and the dialogues are also very good. To finish, If i had to make a balance, the first half would be a 9.5 and the second half would be something around 5 or 6. Overall, a 7.7/10 is enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of Hitchcock's strongest films,"""The Birds"" is one of the greatest classics in Alfred Hitchcock's career. Its story basically reports an attack of raging birds against a small village on the Californian coast. The movie has often been touted as overrated but I definitely disagree. It's true that this kind of situation is quite unusual and the reasons for the abnormal behavior of the birds is never properly explained to us. I also considered the way the main character behaves, practically chasing a man she is attracted to without knowing him, is illogical and, at least, strange. That's the biggest negative criticism I can make of this movie which, apart from that, is flawless. The script explores a ""nature vs. human"" situation quite well, doing it in a way that we actually see as threatening, dangerous and tense. The way the birds behave is highly intimidating, and I just hope no animal has been wounded during the shootings. Cinematography is very good as well as visual effects. Tippi Hedren gave life to the main character, Melanie Daniels, a young spoiled daughter of a big-shot, and Rod Taylor played Mitch Brenner, for whom she is romantically interested. Both actors went very well in their characters, counting on the collaboration of a very competent support cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The only good bird is a roasted bird,"I watched this on TV as a child and, although I forgot all the details a long time ago, it remained carved in my memory as terrifying. Of course, this memory was greatly influenced by its reputation as one of the most famous horrors of all time. I just watched it for the first time as an adult in its entirety and I must say - wtf?! The story is linear, simple and does not require even the slightest use of the brain. It starts as a typical romantic comedy of its time (and it would be better if it stayed that way to the end), and then turns into something that is supposed to be a horror, but it is at best a mediocre drama. There is no mystery and tension that we expect from Hitchcock, there are no interesting dialogues, and performances of the actors are at a rather low level. From today's perspective, the effects are tragicomic, and I believe they were not anywhere near top-notch even for their time, which leads to the question how the hell was this film nominated for an Oscar in that category. Occasionally, the effects were so ridiculous that I had the impression that someone deliberately mocked with bird attacks. This is a film from 1963, not from 1923. The events in the movie remain completely unexplained, but that didn't bother me much because I couldn't care less about the reasons for bird attacks. The only good thing about this movie is the premise itself, because it is relatively realistic. Considering the number of birds on the planet in relation to the number of people, the very idea that birds can turn against us and attack us all at once is horrifying, because, despite their primitiveness in relation to human technology, I believe that in this war mankind would have no chance to win. Ever since I can remember I felt moderate repulsion and disgust towards birds, and after this movie, however unconvincing it may be, I could easily develop a phobia. If this movie was of a more recent date, I would rate it even lower, but, considering technical capabilities of the sixties, I have to give it a slack, so I'll rate it5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Winging A Cold War Apocalypse,"Little known to most filmgoers was a traumatic experience that befell Hitch as a young boy, he was accidentally locked in a stairwell that had in it several badly decomposed bird carcasses, where he was forced to remain amidst the stench for hours one afternoon and evening until finally detected and freed.  While Hitch counted the experience as notable but not significant in his childhood development, he did acknowledge it as a partial wellspring in inspiring 'The Birds'. The other major contributing factor was linked to his well known fear of the police.  After completing 'North By Northwest', Hitch was invited by an associate to a social gathering of former policemen who had entered the intelligence profession, and their straightforward discussions of prospects for nuclear apocalypse apparently jarred Hitch to a level of discomfort that he felt the need to take on the apocalyptic dimension of life in the Cold War in a metaphorical manner.  As the concept was being fleshed out, the idea came to Hitch of using the birds as a representative vehicle for life out of balance, and the rest is as they say, history.  Just imagine, if these criteria had applied to the inspiration for ""The Sound of Music"", what a different film that would have been.....",,Anonymous,Horror
When Birds go Wild!!!,"The Birds is a Hitchcock classic but I never understood why the birds attacked people in the first place. After all, they can go anywhere thanks to their flying capabilities. Tippi Hedren plays the female who travels to a small Northern California town from San Francisco to deliver love birds to a young girl played by Veronica Cartwright who becomes a great actress as an adult as she was a child. My biggest complaint is why the birds go mad in the first place. I admire Hitchcock for all his genius but I never get an answer and it's still an enjoyable movie. Maybe we just have to figure it out for ourselves or maybe we should stop abusing our habitat.

There are lots of good parts but,"Womans. They are like helpless people that cant do anything on their own. I got so frustrated by their random hand and face gestures while getting attacked. They are like dull creatures that cant do anything on their own. Everyone waiting for the ""guy"". That was pretty annoying to watch.

Suspense through something you never thought could be scary,"Who would think birds can be presented as scary? I knew that they would be attacking before I saw this film, but I never thought I could be frightened by them. Well, Hitchcock makes it happen. He has closeups of birds doing things to people that you would never imagine being possible to do without computers. The beauty of the film isn't the birds, although they put films like Deep Blue Sea that are plastered with effects, to shame. The beauty is the suspense. Hitchcock knows all the tricks to scare an audience. Put them in a small room with no way out because the exits have all been boarded up. Then have the real terror begin. Everyone says he is a genious, but this film proves it more than any other. Sometimes I watch movies of his like Saboteur and say ""What's so great about Hitchcock?"" After seeing The Birds, the answer is almost impossible not to see. His timing, music, and ways of framing scenes so that they are completely frightening. If you want a scary movie, don't see the Haunting or the House on Haunted Hill (new versions), see this movie right here. You may not think birds can be scary but after you see it you won't believe how wrong you were.",,Anonymous,Horror

The birds is one of kind terror , using less blood then most horror film and no music, and so subtle it just lets your heart beat, maybe a bit too much attacks but still, the film which in the book the art of Alfred Hitchcock says it is a film is a film on abandonment because when ever someone mentions something about being abandoned the birds attack. This film is a one of a kind terror hats off for Hitchcock. Write to me if you disagree, but I hope you won't.

Eery and Satisfying Hitchcock Film,"The film starts out interestingly enough with Mitch Brenner checking out Annie Hayworth in a bird store, claiming he would like to purchase a pair of love birds. Annie and Mitch end up knowing each other from a some sort of court dispute. Mitch needles Annie much to her disliking and promptly leaves the store. Annie manages to get his license plate number and decides to buy him some love birds, perhaps feeling she's misunderstood and this is a way to win him over. She drives the birds to the address she tracks down from his plate and drops off the birds. Mitch sees her and promptly catches up to her, asking her to stay for dinner. The birds in the area start to act a little aggressive and increasing in numbers. As usual, no one in the beginning believes the situation will get out of hand. I actually liked Jessica Tandy's character as Mitch's mother Lydia more often than I liked Mitch. Mitch convinces everyone to stay at the house and wait the attack out. Every good film has an antagonist and there are several in this film. The plot could have been developed more as far as how Annie and Mitch work out their differences. Lydia leaves the house one morning and we could swear Annie and Mitch hit the sheets during her absence, though nothing is shown except how affectionate and close they are when Lydia returns.One minor note is that Mitch's younger sister looks more like she could be his daughter, but this doesn't detract from the film. I enjoyed Suzanne Pleshette's teacher character and found her to be the most engaging character in the whole film.Overall, a good film with excellent directing, cinematography and film editing. The plot of how birds can increase in numbers and attack people is believable in my opinion, especially with today's bird flu epidemics and such. If you've ever eaten food on an East coast beach, some birds will swoop down at you with a few getting a little too close. I wasn't disappointed with the ending -- it leaves the idea of what happens next to both imagination and a possible sequence.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock actually made birds scary.,"This is a movie I've only seen in pieces, mostly notably through the Kill Count in Dead Meat and that's pretty much it. Now that I've watched the movie in its entirety, I can say that The Birds is an easy Top 10 movies in Alfred Hitchcock's filmography.Positives for The Birds (1963):
Like his other movies, Alfred Hitchcock's direction and execution is done masterfully in this movie. I also have to give credit that Hitchcock actually made the birds in this movie scary and I don't even find birds to be that scary. I also have to say that the performances from the cast are phenomenal whether you're talking about Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner, Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner, Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth, Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels and Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner. I really enjoyed the little romance between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren, the grandmother of Dakota Johnson, as these two manage to give each other those ""will they, won't they"" interactions and it works perfectly. When the birds attack Bodega Bay, I was on the edge of my seat and I was scared to see whenever they started another attack on the town and there aren't a lot of movies that can do that successfully. And finally, the ending to this movie was deeply disturbing in a way that still makes you terrified by these birds.Overall, The Birds (1963) is another phenomenal entry into Alfred Hitchcock's filmography and while I already know that, I am still genuinely impressed with how consistently great of a filmmaker Hitchcock was.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horror classic of a different type,"I saw this movie when it debuted. I was 9. It was pretty scary. Obviously, I (we), have taken it in a few more times since then.Hitchcock as usual does a good job. The setting is different from the book, but the essence is the same: Birds gone murderously berserk. I think his best creepy effect is the way he handles the amassing of crows at the school.The story is OK. My wife and I actually attended a small family reunion in Bodega Bay maybe 10 years ago. It was pretty there. I kept my eyes open for killer gulls but none appeared.Rod does a decent job. A little bit dour in personality maybe, but I figure that's only because he missed Weena (who he saved from the Morlocks.)Trippy Headcase did a bang up job. Around the same time, she also did ""Marnie"", a psychological Hitchcock thriller with 007 as the lead. Not a bad fare.I didn't even recognize Jessica Tandy as Rod's possessive mother. I discovered it on line. When I told my wife, she couldn't believe it. Everybody's so much younger obviously.I have one beef, and it's legit. Trippy shows up at the school to check on Rod's kid sister. Of course this is the scene I alluded to above. Trippy has just alerted the teacher as to the crows amassing outside. Both are alarmed, particularly in light of the very recent bird attacks, one, on Trippy herself.Taking this into account, and thinking of the children's safety first of course; they make the super intelligent decision about what to do with the (already frightened) young students. That's right, Send them outside at dusk, to walk (then run) home! Teacher Pleshette next, actually does indeed give strict instructions to the kids to quietly walk slowly until she instructs them to ""RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!""Why didn't Plesh baby just say ""OK kids, millions of bloodthirsty murderous crows are outside. Children's eyeballs are a delicacy of theirs. The last thing we want to do is keep you here, safe inside, preferably in another room with no windows. That's crazy! Somebody might get claustrophobic. Not only that, I couldn't contact your parents anyway, because a bunch of angry swallows broke into the filing cabinets earlier, and ate all the Emergency Contact Cards. So here's your homework assignment: Make it home alive! And if you don't show up for school tomorrow, you flunk!""
""Now get out there and pretend you're invisible. I'll tell you when to run & scream. Cover your eyes too, and run in a zigzag pattern, preferably in the middle of the street where you're less likely to run into things. Also, absolutely NO falling down and crying! Good luck! If you need us for anything, Trippy & I are going to stay safely inside, knock back some more brandy, and watch the show.""""Ready Kids?!?""
""ON YOUR MARK!!""
""GET SET!!""

Hitchcock at his best!,"Every now and then you come across a little gem of a classic,

A Haunting Fairytale,"Fairytales, even those for kids, are seldom serene and innocent. Think of Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, full of mysterious and haunting characters imbued with evil.The Birds, released three years after Psycho, a gap relatively long for Hitchcock but explained also by the technical challenges of the production, contains all the trademarks typical of both his cinema style and the fairytales.
The blond and beautiful leading lady, much stronger and determined than the appearances suggest, the light initial tone, almost a comedy with the witty bickering of the main characters, the unmissable Hitch's cameo, the long and winding coastal road, the ingenious quotes of his previous movies, here The 39 steps and To Catch a Thief amongst others, are intertwined with the inexplicable evil and the helplessness of the darkest fairytales' personas.But The Birds, loosely based on a short story published in 1952 by Daphne du Maurier, an author that the English master had already used as a source for Rebecca and Jamaica Inn, is also deeply experimental and has a philosophical sophistication unrivalled by any of Hitchcock's movies.
Since the opening credits, evoking the optical expressionist illusions of Escher's birds, the film is imbued with a haunting introspection that is ultimately only enhanced by the lively beginning of the movie, when Mitch, an anonymous Rod Taylor, meets and squabbles with Melanie, Tippi Hedren on her cinema debut.
The director's choice of giving up a musical soundtrack, with the only music briefly played by Melanie on the piano and the nursery rhyme sang by the school children, skipping the end credits and a real, defined ending, the sophisticated special effects engineered for the birds' attacks, that all in all have well survived time and digitalisation, the dilution of time and pace challenging and almost mocking the viewer, like in the emblematic scene of the crows perched on the jungle gym, the unpredictable and random behaviour of the birds, the roles' reverse, with the humans forced by attacks and fear to look for protection into the cages, either houses, cars, bars, phone boots, coinciding with the mental cages built by the terror generated by the distortion of the natural order that everybody is used to and expects, make The Birds an overwhelming complex movie to watch and understand, difficult to define, in between horrors and thrillers and that in fact was not very much appreciated by both the critics and the public when released.
Only recently the first Hitchcock movie produced and distributed by Universal has been heralded as one of his bests and most likely his last masterpiece, as well as a trailblazer on the analyses of the sickness and inner demons of the human psyche.The Birds is a movie that leaves a long-lasting impression in the discerning viewer, notwithstanding the mediocrity of the actors, with the exceptions on an intense Jessica Tandy as Mitch's mother and a convincing Suzanne Pleshette as Annie, the sacrificial lamb of both Mitch and the birds.
Regrettably, the few films Alfred Hitchcock directed after The Birds, however well-crafted and a pleasure to watch, will not add anything to the film body of one of the most important filmmakers of the XX Century.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing Effects,"The Birds was made in 1963 for Christ sakes and yet the effects still amaze me because if you compare the effects for this film with the one in Jaws 3 the you'd think that this was made years before it.

Movie Review: The Birds,"The Birds is a classic Alfred Hitchcock horror/thriller that sees socialite Melanie Daniels travel to Bodega Bay to see lawyer Mitch Brenner, however soon after her arrival, swarms of birds begin attacking the town for seemingly no reason. The whole reason that the birds keep attacking is a mystery and the entire town is terrorized constantly to the point where people are actually getting killed by these flocks of birds. I really enjoyed this movie and to be honest, I don't really know where Alfred Hitchcock would get the idea of killer birds to begin with, but they definitely work as an interesting plot device. This movie has a great atmosphere with the Sunny Bodega Bay where it feels like a place where nothing could go wrong and the beginning of the movie really enforces that feeling where it seems like it will just be another romance plot. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror/thriller movies or to anyone that just wants to see a good Alfred Hitchcock movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Finally, the last 20 minutes you get to see the dystopian world you've been waiting for. But this is short lived and left open ended.Honestly, by the end of the movie you can't wait for it to be over. There's a bit of a campy feel to it.

Refreshingly creepy,"There's something about birds in general that is just unpleasant.  The beaks, the flapping wings, the claws and dirty feathers.  I've always found birds to be a little bit unnerving and that's why I found Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" to be refreshingly creepy.Surprisingly, the effects (the birds) were remarkably realistic and effective.  The number of birds alone was uncanny.  There appeared to be thousands of them.  Certainly this excessive number of birds added to the horror of the film.The performances of the actors were very straightforward, and the story contained a number of bizarre story points or red herrings.  Hitchcock has used a large number of devices to surprise the audience just one more time, and keep us expecting more.  For this reason, I highly recommend watching this film more than once.",,Anonymous,Horror

with three-foot wingspans - diving into the roofs of their homes. The few
people who ventured out into their yards to investigate, armed with
flashlights, saw large birds littering the streets. Many were dead, but
some only stunned, and those, attracted by the flashlights, flew at the
townspeople. In the morning, residents found the streets covered in dead
shearwaters and ""bits fo fish and fish skeletons over the streets and
lawns and housetops, leaving an overpowering fishy stench."" Thirty years
later, a similar event occurred, only that time it was flocks of pelicanswith the bellies full of fish - that crashed into houses in the samecoastal towns.In both instances - and no doubt other that went unrecorded - the birds

The Birds,"A woman looking for love gets more than she bargained for when thousands of birds attack any human in sight in a sleepy coastal town called Bodega Bay.We first meet Melanie Daniels at a pet shop in San Francisco where she is intrigued by a dashing gentleman by the name of Mitch Brenner. He mentions to her that he is looking for love birds as a gift for his 11 year old sister. After tracking down his full name and address, she decides to surprise him with two love birds by traveling via boat to his family home in Bodega Bay. On the way, a seagull swoops down and hits her on the head causing her to bleed. As a gesture, Mitch invites Melanie to have dinner with him, his sister, and his mother at their house.Afterwards, Melanie meets Annie Hayward who is a local teacher and former girlfriend of Mitch. They both talk about Mitch's mother Lydia and how jealous she can be with any girl who gets close to Mitch. The next day at Mitch's sisters birthday party, a flock of seagulls attack the guests. Then it attacks a group of children leaving their school. With all different types of birds coming together to kill humans, can they be stopped? And will Melanie and Mitch survive the vicious attack on Bodega Bay?The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films of all times. His creative abilities made a movie about killer birds really come to life and be terrifying, when it could have been a bit of a joke if done by the wrong person. The idea of birds attacking us is a scary thought. There are billions of birds in the world so if for some reason they decided to attack we would be in serious danger. The Birds never gives us the reason for the attack which I like. It's almost scarier not knowing why this is happening to Bodega Bay.The acting is superb, led by Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels. She has a likability that she puts forth to the character, so we really root for her and admire her strength in battling the birds. Great character development by Hitchcock as well. She really connects with Mitch's sister Cathy played by a very young Veronica Cartwright. Also has a lot of chemistry with actor Rod Taylor who plays Mitch. His possessive mother is played wonderfully by Jessica Tandy.I highly recommend The Birds for it's creativity and high tension scenes involving the bird attacks. We get some vicious ambushes in there at times, and it placed me in the movie and made me think of how scary it would be if all of this was happening around us. The acting and character work was at a high level which also made viewers care for the characters. A great horror film overall.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Possibly the best horror picture of all time,"The mastery Alfred Hitchcock displays in the Birds has no comparison to any other horror movie ever. First of all, the characters are perfectly described and no mere cliches that nobody cares for (very usual in this movie genre). I wouldn't like to point any of them, but I think Melanie (portrayed by the beautiful Tippi Hedren stands above the rest). Also Jessica Tandy as Rod Taylor's mother is equally standout. That's important, very important in this type of movie, cause when they face danger, we CARE about their fate. Second, the birds. I think the most frightening scene ever seen on the silver screen, is that of the siege of the Breener's house (Rod Taylor's family). We see nothing,..but we HEAR ,thus allowing our imagination to think freely. And most important of all, Hitch does not give us an explanation on the subject, nor does he gives us a happy ending. It's pure horror. A masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Maori will speak of this giant carrying people away to feed its ravenous young.Red Tailed Hawks can take down animals 2 times their own size, like a children. Do eagles really try to snatch up babies? It's not common. Many attacks by eagles on children have been reported over the years, but it's hard to tell how many are accurate.

Strong Suspense from the Master of Suspense,"THE BIRDS is often listed amongst the great works of Alfred Hitchcock and I could never really understand the attraction. I thought it was a so-so fright-flick, so when I tripped across it on TV the other day, I started watching it with one eye, figuring I'd flip to something else in a few minutes.And...then I caught myself getting into it.Based on the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, THE BIRDS is told in Alfred Hithcock's suspenseful style to elevate a ""pulp novel"" idea of birds turning on humans to something much more tense than it had any right to be.Newcomer Tippi Hendren stars as wealthy San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels who chases suave charismatic lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) north of San Fran to his home of Bodego Bay. Will Melanie be able to win Mitch's heart over the objections of his mother (Jessica Tandy) and ex-girlfriend (Suzanne Pleshette)? We'll never know, for the Birds have their own idea of how this tale will end.Hitchock, of course, earns his nickname ""The Master of Suspense"" with this film. He has some long scenes that grow with tension. Whether it's Melanie crossing the Bay in a boat (only to, finally, be attacked by a bird) or Mitch's mother going down a long hallway to find out what happened to a farmer friend of hers to the famous - and famously pulled off - scene of the birds gathering en masse on the jungle gym prior to attacking Melanie and the school children. Hitchcock knows exactly how to raise tension in these scenes and he does so marvelously. Even 56 years later, I found what little hairs I have standing up on the back of my neck and my body bending ever so slightly towards the screen during these scenes.But...the thing that caught me this time around was the performances of the leads and the way Hitchock lets scenes play out with the actors. I've never been a big Rod Taylor fan, I've always thought he was ""fine"", but nothing special. He is much more than ""fine"" in this film. It's probably the best work I've ever seen him do. Jessica Tandy, of course, as the mother is wonderfully cold and distant to begin with and slowly moves to close to madness and then understanding, it is a wonderfully understated performance showcasing a superb theater actress. As is Pleshette's turn as school teacher Annie. Her scenes with Hendren were laced (I'm sure purposely) with an undercurrent of sexual tension between the two female characters.But...the star of this film is Tippi Hendren, beyond a doubt. Much has been made of the cruelty and misogynistic ways that Hitchock treated and abused Hendren in the making of this film. But her performance shone as the gold-digging, fun loving Melanie who descends into the depths as the film progresses. I've never thought much of her as a performer, but will have to check out other films of hers (most notably, Hitchock's MARNIE).The special effects - which were cutting edge and earned an Oscar nomination back in the day - are dated, but that adds to the charm of the film (at least for me). I'm sure they ""wowed"" the audience in 1963, so I'll cut them some slack.I was pleasantly surprised by the pacing, acting and SUSPENSE of this film. It has held up very well and if you haven't seen THE BIRDS in awhile, I recommend you check it out.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Certainly A Classic,"Probably the weakest Hitchcock film I've seen so far, but all his films are so great that it's hard to care. I honestly really liked the opening. The romantic tension really worked and the patient setup just helped to build suspense. Unfortunately, the first couple of bird sequences didn't really work for me. They felt quite choppy and the effects didn't hold up nearly as well as later on in the film. I was worried that this was going to end up being underwhelming, but the final few bird sequences elevated the film a whole lot. They were much more entertaining to watch and made sure the film ended on a high note. Hitchcock's direction is obviously great, and I really liked the lack of a score. Given that the score in Psycho became one of the most iconic scores of all time, it would have been easy to just replicate that score, so I appreciate Hitchcock going in a different direction with this score. The performances were really good, particularly Tippi Hedren in the lead role, and overall this was just a thoroughly entertaining film. If you're a bit Hitchcock fan, then you'll probably really like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
So people got scared by Ravens and Seagulls?,"Dear Mr. Hitchcock, you did not need to create a film to convince me that ravens and seagulls are incorrigible creatures, as I am well aware of their 'erratic' personalities.Anyway, this happens to be my third Hitchcock film (following Rear Window and Vertigo) and unfortunately, it is yet another disappointment.To be honest, I didn't even plan on watching it initially, but the abundance of positive reviews piqued my curiosity the other day, so I decided to give it a chance.Little did I know that all I would get is a mediocre amalgamation of genres, where both romance and thrill fail to leave a lasting impact.Maybe it's because I've been exposed to these specific genres too much, or perhaps it's due to the outdated approach that lies beneath, but I just couldn't connect with the tale or find myself caring for the characters, I adored the location, had fun with the technical sides but that's about it!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

An influencing Horror Film.,"A very beautifully crafted horror film by the Legend Alfred Hitchcock. Screenwriting and the Adaptation of the book which he represented in his style was awful. It really kept me hooked and one thing which strikes me is that , Alfred Hitchcock never won the Oscar, I think it's a fact that he had made the films which are a way ahead from his time and that's why he was unable to decode.
As he has not revealed or explained the entire BIRDS script. He left the audience to put on their own theories and the movie can explain a lot. All I can say is the youngsters nowadays should watch Alfred Hitchcock once before you die",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Feed the Birds,After seeing this movie I was waiting for the damn birds to attack me. Cant trust these Canadian geese flying in their v formation. I felt since Ms. Daniels took the song birds that the other birds were trying to free those two. The bird were ruthless in their attacks. I loved the movie. It has a great love story and a strong female character.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A strong & frightening film.,"The more times I view ""The Birds"" the more I understand the ending, but I do agree that at first I was not satisfied with it. I wanted the birds to either finish the job or to be challenged by something (Mitch did hear on Melanie's car radio that perhaps the military might be called in!) but we never saw anything like that. I guess that's why we have imaginations!'Tippi' Hedren was a beautiful cool blonde who played Melanie Daniels as she should have - icy and yet ultimately very vulnerable. Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner seemed a good reason for her to travel to Bodega Bay. Jessica Tandy as Lydia was what you'd expect of an older, widowed, small town woman from that time. Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth, the school teacher, with her dark beauty was quite a contrast to Melanie and I felt awful at her death by the birds. Veronica Cartwright as Kathy Brenner was a little annoying when she cried but then that IS what young girls do!!A strong, frightening film but one of Hitch's best horror films. Decidedly not for children. Even Ingmar Bergman was a Hitchcock fan and lifted a scene from The Paradine Case and reworked it into Cries and Whispers! The relationships of The Birds have a 'Bergmanesque' quality as well and the Bodega Bay setting could as well have been Ingmar's Faro island. The film The Passion of Anna, deftly counterpoints the personal relationship with an unknown outside 'monster' who is killing and mutilating animals. Very much like 'The Birds' in spirit.The cast is very good too. Taylor is as perfect as the everyman hero as he was in THE TIME MACHINE. Jessica Tandy is excellent, playing a very irritating character and giving her some warmth and life despite her bad points. Veronica Cartwright is convincingly menaced, just as she was years later in ALIEN and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. I didn't care much for Tippi Hedren's cold character the first couple of times I saw this, but her presence has subsequently grown on me in the intervening years.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hitchcock at his 'beak',"Well, its Friday the 13th, of Aug. '99 of course, and someone from beyond the grave wants to spook you.Actually its Hitch's 100 rd birthday and what better way to spook you than with THE BIRDS.I first saw this movie as a child and it scared the pants off of me.I had nightmares for months after, like millions of other young people. Today I appreciate the mystery its conveys.In the movie we just don't know why the birds attack unprovoked but we're treated to some speculative ideas.Initially, Tippi Hedren gets the blame, the attacks starting when she arrives in Bodega Bay.Playing the character, Melanie Daniels, a rich daughter of a newspaper magnate,Hedren is labelled as 'pure evil' by one of the townsfolk.But this isn't right, you see Melanie is not even raven-haired, she's pure blonde.Hitch knows we won't fall for that old trick,so in comes a charute smoking ornithologist complete with feather in hat who blinds us with fact after fact about how sweet and nice our fine feathered friends are. The birds dispute this by their actions surrounding a cafe menacingly. naw,that's not the answer,back to the drawing board folks.So there is no explanation given except perhaps that the Bodega Bay residents were skimpy with the bird seeds that week and therefore the birds felt,er a little .. peckish.No it's just as if..as if your left in silence, like the silence of no movie score, or the silent scream of Jessica Tandy, or perhaps the silence of Hedren being peaked to death in the attic scene. Each element is like gathering a twig here, a sapling there,a leaf elsewhere and building them up into a nestling symbolism that comprises, stealth, secretiveness,mysteriousness and pure creepiness that eventually hatches under your skin.Technically unique,THE BIRDS uses various special effects ,such as, animation,models and live birds to stage the attacks.It's truly amazing, the school house attack being my favourite.But my overall favourite piece is when Rod Taylor tries to walk to his car at the end of the movie.A single perched crow turns its head and curiously looks up at Taylor then at his hand and bites it!!. Seagulls timidly peck at his pants and shoes,all the while cooing softly. In our minds were saying Rod get back in the house your outnumbered!! It's not truly anticlimactic,it's just pure suspense,anticipation of what might happen rather than does.It's also amazing that no other director,at least to my  knowledge, has pursued this aviaristic theme.There's a very funny story told by the director Peter Bogdanovich about Hitch.One day he was waiting for Hitch at some hotel somewhere and when they met,they got on an elevator to go down to the hotel lobby,some 20 stories below them. Hitch got in the back and the lift filled up with people.Suddenly Hitch starts to speak... ""There was blooood eveerrywhere"",he starts in his British accent. ""Bloooood on the carpet,blooood on this chaps clooothing,blooood on the couch,"" Bogdanovich is trully puzzled,what brought this on, he thought,but he decides to chime in. ""Really,Hitch?"", ""Yeeesss"", drools back Hitch. The elevator stops somewhere on the 12th floor,there's an exchange of people and it moves off again. ""Blooood streaming from his nose,"" continues Hitch, ""His cloothes were a complete meess,"" Unable to escape the talking,people were cocking an ear or two to this diminutive,bald,rotund gentleman with the oh-so drool English accent. The elevator gets close to the lobby, Hitch goes in for the kill.""GOOD GOD MAN,WHAT EEEVVVEEERR HAPPENED TO YOU?"" continuing slowly he says, ""..and do you know what he said to me""?The elevator reaches the lobby,doors part, and nobody appears to want to move. Hitch quietly makes his way out of the lobby trailed by a small contingent of people seeming to follow him.Bogdanovich comes up to Hitch's level. ""Well, Hitch, what did the man say""? ""Whaaat""? replies Hitch. ""The man with the blood all over him"". ""OH thhhaat,...nothing..that was my elevator stooory"", and walks on.",,Anonymous,Horror
Alfred Hitchcock's Crowning Achievement,"Dazed and confused by the pure brilliance of Hitchcock's greatest film, many critics sank to the cheap shot evaluation ""It's for the birds,"" and thus undercut the initial box office for this picture. The laugh would come later as THE BIRDS scored whammy ratings over and over, every time it was played on TV, for decades. Based on a razor thin short story, Hitchcock elaborated into a multi-teared suspense drama juxtaposed with the strongly drawn romantic relationship between Tippi Hedrin and Rod Taylor. Hitchcock was the ""master of suspense"" but how many other of his films can match the raw suspense, hitting the viewer over and over, of this masterpiece. The answer is zero. PSYCHO's asset was shock; THE BIRDS was suspense. From the initial single bird attack at the docks of Bodega Bay, to the brilliant scenes at the schoolyard, to the unparalleled fear inside the boarded-up house, no other Hitchcock film even came close regarding suspense. The scene censored from early TV screenings, running 1.5 seconds, where Jessica Tandy enters her neighbor's farmhouse and finds him dead --- the fact that they'd cut 1.5 seconds says it all. The romance has real magic to it, and Hitchcock succeeds with this despite the absence of his trademark heavy-necking scene. Finally, the suspense factor obviously is gone after the first viewing; nonetheless this film stands up tall for multiple replays. An absolute classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hitchcock always knew how to make use of chaos, and he takes it to the extreme here","Probably no motif appears in Alfred Hitchcock's movies more often than chaos. While it played a central role in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"" is probably the ultimate chaos story, especially considering how Hitchcock plays with the audience.It all begins when socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) enters a San Francisco pet shop and meets lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). While they at first seem to be a little displeased with each other, Melanie then buys some love birds to give Mitch. When she goes to his apartment and learns from a neighbor that he's in Bodega Bay for the weekend, she promptly drives up there. That's when things start to get strange. A seagull pecks Melanie on the forehead while she is on a boat, and then a bird crashes into a schoolteacher's door.Finally, at a birthday party, a whole flock of birds attacks everyone. Then, a flock of birds gathers around a school and attacks the children as they're leaving. After a gas station explosion, it turns into full scale war; the chaos has irreversibly set in. Whereas in most movies, chaotic events get explained, they do not get explained in ""The Birds"", which adds to the terror.What I mean by ""playing with the audience"" is this: for about the first half hour, the movie seems to be a romantic comedy. Then, once the birds attack at the birthday party, everything changes; there's nothing that's going to save anyone now.A common theme in Hitchcock's movies is the guilty woman (think ""Blackmail"" and ""Psycho""). Clearly, Melanie is a guilty woman, but guilty of what? Maybe this: she walks around in a fur coat, which identifies a disdain for animals. Perhaps the birds see her as the incarnation of everything bad that humans have done to animals, and so they take revenge on her.Nowadays when something bad happens in a movie, the solution is to have Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis kick ass. Not so in ""The Birds"". Rod Taylor, whose character could easily be a ""potent male adventurer"", is helpless; seeing that the birds have essentially taken over Bodega Bay, Mitch boards up his house and hopes that the killer avians don't enter.The movie makes an interesting use of the color green. First and foremost are Melanie's clothes: her dress and blouse are lime-colored. Also, as she is driving to Bodega Bay, she drives through vast fields, meaning a lot of grass. What does this mean? Maybe that although Melanie is disconnected from nature, the latter is creeping up on her.I guess that an obvious point is that Tippi Hedren was one of Hitchcock's icy blondes, following Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint and Janet Leigh. It's too bad that Tippi Hedren didn't do much after ""The Birds""; she was hot in this movie.So, in conclusion, the next time you see a bird, just remember this movie, and especially remember the song that the schoolchildren are singing right before an ornithological onslaught. It might save your life...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Line your canary's cage with this.,"Brokeback Mountain was a short story that was easily able to be adapted into a feature length film, despite covering decades of its characters' lives.This movie was based on a short story and totally feels like it.Desperate filler after desperate filler is the experience of this movie as we go through a parade of bland characters with null back-stories that only makes you more and more desperate to see someone get pecked to death.The long awaited scenes of avian aggression and suspense are pretty well realized but are truly not worth the wait.There is nothing to this except feathered friends inexplicably turning vicious which is kind of the point but after sitting through so much that was inconsequential it all feels insulting.No, I do not feel more empathy for these characters after seeing something of their human lives. No, it does not feel more terrifying to see regular life suddenly turn evil.Hitchcock isn't a particularly amazing film-maker; partly because mostly he just directs but he is a typical director who lucked out with some good scripts but THIS is not one of them.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""The Birds"" had excellent special effects for the time period it was made in.","Alfred Hitchcock's film `The Birds' is an outstanding horror film and is very suspenseful, portraying different types of birds going psycho and attacking people. The birds somehow seem to be attracted to light in my point of view. Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner and Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels who are the main characters are excellent actors. Even though most of the time the birds were fake both characters made it look as if it was really happening and they were really being pecked at. The whole idea of Evan Hunter writing a horror story about birds attacking the small town of Bodega Bay then Alfred Hitchcock making a movie out of it is a neat idea. What makes this movie so good is all the suspense and even though it was made in 1963 the graphics and special effects are awesome, even the sound effects of the birds flapping and screeching are good, and the sound is only in mono. Although I think the ending could have been better, the birds looked very real, as did everything else. I give this horror movie for the time period it was in a nine out of ten.",,Anonymous,Horror

I fell in love with Tippi Hedren!!!!!,"Although I don't think that ""The Birds"" is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film, it's very humorous, and obviously Hitchcock wanted to have a lot of fun with his audience. I like the way the film looks at the reaction of people to bizarre events, especially as some of the townspeople connect the arrival of the birds with the arrival of Tippi Hedren as though she somehow brought this on them. I didn't even notice that there wasn't a musical soundtrack the first time I saw the film, because the sounds of the birds attacking amidst the silence is really effective. ""The Birds"" features some great cinematography, a nerve-wracking soundtrack, and some finely wrought performances. ""The Birds"" is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks. And finally there's Tippi Hedren, the beautiful blonde discovered by Hitchcock after viewing her in a toothpaste commercial while Hitch was watching the Today Show. Hedren was one of the cool sophisticated blondes loved by Hitchcock (and this eventually led to problems on their next film, Marnie.) Tippi is just so classy and beautiful to look at and gives a very nice performance considering the fact that she had almost no acting experience. The film also led her to suffer a mini-nervous breakdown after having to endure days of having birds thrown at her during the film's climactic bird attack. Tippi is absolutely wonderful and was even better in a difficult role in her next (and last) Hitchcock film, Marnie. The film is also loaded with many interesting character actors in small roles: Charles McGraw, Richard Deacon, Lonny Chapman, Karl Swenson, etc. all giving entertaining performances.But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself. Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where ""The Birds"" is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps. It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film. This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole. Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one? Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room? Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be? Hitchcock knows how to build suspense and he does it quite convincingly with this movie. He casually starts off with what seems to be an average affair of two people and then those characters have sub plots that surround them and things get a little more tense until their ""normal"" world is thrown off balance by some thing that comes out of left field. This is great suspense film with a witty dialogue.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie gave me nightmares (My favorite Hitchcock),"Though it's not considered one of his masterpieces, 1963's The Birds is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, a film that not only provides genuine scares, but is a master class in the art of cinematic suspense.Based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, this is the story of a wealthy socialite from San Francisco named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who travels to a small Northern Californian town called Bodega Bay to pursue a possible relationship with the town's most eligible bachelor, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and, upon her arrival, a series of unmotivated attacks by birds end up terrorizing the entire town.Other than the technical mastery and animal training that had to be involved in getting these birds to do what they were supposed to do when they are supposed to do it, this film shows what a master Hitchcock was at building suspense...watch the scene where Melanie is sitting on a bench smoking a cigarette while birds begin gathering on a jungle gym behind her or the scene before the final attack where Melanie, Mitch, his mother, and kid sister are sitting in the front room of the Brenner home waiting for a bird attack on the house. The suspense created in these scenes will have you either holding your breath or screaming at the screen for the characters to wake up.The wooden performances, especially Hedren, are irrelevant to the artistry that is Hitchcock that makes this classic a film that gave me nightmares for months and to this day, I still get very nervous when I see 3 or more birds gather in one location.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

More A Series Of Set Pieces Than A Coherent Film; Fascinating Nonetheless,"Time has a way of qualifying our initial assessment of films, and this is particularly true of films made by director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980.) Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded as a solid craftsman but not an artist; in the 1950s many of his films, most notoriously VERTIGO, were received with lukewarm interest. In the 1960s, however, attitudes about his work began to change, and with that came a major re-evaluation of his films. Films that had been earlier dismissed were recognized as great classics; some films that had received tremendous recognition at the time of their release were now seen as somewhat over-praised.To a certain extent this re-evaluation continues today, and at this point one film in particular proves extremely contentious to critics: THE BIRDS, which was considered both extremely innovative and a great shocker in 1963 but which is now teetering on the brink of critical dismissal. Just as it took some thirty years to fix VERTIGO's position in the Hitchcock lexicon, so may it take fifty to arrive at a final summation here.According to film lore, Hitchcock was intrigued by a newspaper story about a ""bird attack,"" and his interest in the story gradually evolved into THE BIRDS. (Although technically based on the 1952 novella by Dauphne du Maurier, the story and film bear little relation to each other.) The story developed by Hitchcock and Evan Hunter concerned slightly wild San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who becomes infatuated with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and whimsically follows him to his home at Bodgea Bay as a prank. Not long after her arrival, however, she is attacked by a seagull, and although her injuries are slight she is quickly, albeit somewhat unwillingly, received by Mitch and his circle. One attack soon leads to another, and before very long Melanie, Mitch, and the entire community are under siege.THE BIRDS is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks. Two of these are particularly famous. While Melanie sits on a bench outside the grade school, her attention is attracted by a flying bird--and she turns to find the playground's jungle gym covered with crows, assembling for an attack as the children leave the school. Later, when the birds attack the town itself, Melanie is trapped in a telephone booth, a helpless witness to the horrors around her even as the birds begin to batter the glass that protects her.But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself. Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where THE BIRDS is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps. It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film. This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole. Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one? Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room? Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be? Hitchcock apologists tend to justify these and many other loose ends in the film by stating that THE BIRDS is intended to have an open-ended structure without resolution and that the random and often incomprehensible nature of the script is intended to reflect the random and incomprehensible nature of the bird attacks. A typical argument in favor of the film also notes that the film is driven by themes instead of plot points. Well-- maybe. But I'm an ""art film"" fan myself, and I can't see it.In the final analysis, THE BIRDS is more akin to modern ultra-commercial action and adventure films than it is to an art-film, with the action and adventure distracting you from the holes in the thing--including the fact that the film is surprising slow. Even so, while THE BIRDS has major flaws, it is so crammed with iconographic moments and visuals that it is impossible to completely dismiss the film as a commercial wallow pure and simple. At its best, THE BIRDS has an incredibly high level of artistry, and those moments really do carry the film and impress themselves in your mind in a most remarkable way. I offer my own experience as an example. I first saw THE BIRDS on television when I was a teenager, and although I thought it was entertaining enough I wasn't particularly impressed. The next morning, however, I opened the living room curtains--startled a flock of birds perched on the outside window sill--and I was scared half to death. And that's cinematic power, nothing else.The DVD presents the film in excellent form and includes several bonuses, most particularly Hitchcock's darkly humorous movie trailer and outlines of a deleted scene. Final comment: it's extremely uneven, but it is also extremely powerful. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The frightening vengeance from Nature,"From the idea that common birds could attack people for no reason, the suspense master Hitchcock created a classic thriller. From ancient times, Men dominated birds, caged and embalmed them as trophies. What would happen if, suddenly, all the birds joined together and rebelled against us? The answer is given on the movie: we wouldn't have a chance of surviving. The movie is based on a story by Daphne Du Maurier. The difficulties of carrying out this task were enormous. The special effects were huge for that time, when there were no computers. Ubi Werk won a nomination to the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, but lost the prize to Cleopatra. Hitchcock used several kind of birds to simulate the attacks: real birds, trained birds, mechanical birds and even embalmed ones. In the beginning, The Birds is like a romantic movie, with the casual encounter of Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a pet store. But when Melanie travels to Bodega Bay to surprise him with two love-birds, the movie twist the mood. A seagull attacks Melanie and, suddenly, the birds start to attack people everywhere. The blood becomes visible, the destruction and the dead appear in all Bodega Bay area. Hitchcock appeals to successive and quick big plans to show the victims of this mysterious evil. The visual horror is combined with silence, only interrupted by the sound made by the birds. Robert Boyle, who was responsible for the scenarios, said that he was inspired by the painting The Scream by Edvard Munch, for the feeling of desolation and madness in a kind of inner solitude. One of the mythic scenes of the film is when, near the school, Tippi Hedren, dressed with the green tailleur she wore during the all film, is seated in a bench smoking a cigarette. We hear the children singing in school and, slowly, the crows begin to join behind her. A little later, there are hundreds of crows, quiet, waiting to attack. It's interesting that the director who always approached the theme of guilt, and how this guilt affected people, made a movie where the evil appears, in a pure state, and where the guilt isn't there.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deeply unnerving thrill ride.,"The Birds, released in 1963, is a deeply unnerving thrill ride and really a lot of fun. Another of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, the film focuses on the idea of birds uniting against man in mysterious fashion. I enjoyed this concept of birds from different species retaliating against human kind for our crimes against them. It gives The Birds a uniquely alarming and disturbing quality by making something generally viewed as innocent and giving it a touch of evil. The films slowly builds with a distinct eeriness that is attributed to the bold score and increasingly unsettling imagery. The Birds blends beauty with terror and is just a realistic feeling thrill. Hitchcock captures many simple shots that are perfectly fitting and terrifying in context. I was sucked into the film early on, as Hitchcock's work has a knack of doing, with the intriguing personality of Melanie Daniels. Ms. Daniels is played by Tippi Hedren, in what's a convincingly dramatic performance, particularly in the final act. Daniels love interest is San Francisco lawyer Mitch Brenner, played charmingly by Rod Taylor. There are some good performances to be found here, but perhaps the best actors/actresses were the birds themselves. This is a film that can be a lot of fun for horror fans and a bit shocking, yet intoxicating for the average movie fan.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Hitchcock's best film,"The Birds stars Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film follows Melanie Daniels who decides to pursue a relationship with a criminal defense attorney at Bodega Bay. But her plans are cut short when a group of birds attack her and the residence of Bodega Bay. As much as I love a good Hitchcock movie, I have to say that this one is not his best. Don't get me wrong getting terrorized by a flock of birds is pretty scary and having them perched on your house, car, to just about anywhere is creepy and eerie. This movie however can't make up its mind on whether it's a romance or a horror movie. This film does provide great acting, dialogue, sound mixing, but where was the score? I understand that Hitchcock wants to give us a good scare but having no music for a two hour movie gets to be pretty boring and awkward at times. The music does work during the last hour of the movie, but before that happens we're left in that awkward state of mind if anything is going to scare us. So in the end, while this film does provide some creepy eerie scenes, the movie misses its target that gives us a two film where the first half is romance and the other half provides the horror. And this would've been perfect had the two found a middle ground instead of giving us a confusing film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Birds, one of Hitchcocks thrillers","I only just watched the birds about three days ago, its the sort of film that's sort of disturbing, what i mean is that when the birds come down and peck you on the hand and body you could almost feel it, and it's one of the most Fictional films i have ever seen in years, no don't get me wrong it's a good film but unlike other horror's like Psycho and scream its not reality because if you think about it, it's not every day that a bunch of birds will invade a small little town.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Hitchcock Classic,"The Birds is an Interesting movie to say the least, a horror movie that is totally plausible and a concept that drew people's attention to the film.

"""Don't they ever stop migrating?!""","THE BIRDS is a mysterious horror drama about an inexplicable conflict between the innocent creatures and the greatest enemy of nature. It is loosely based on the 1952 story of the same name by Daphne du Maurier.The main protagonist is a young woman, who is known for compacting inappropriate jokes and misbehavior in public. One day, she meets a charming lawyer in a San Francisco bird shop. He wants to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his sister's eleventh birthday, but the shop has none. He had seen her in court once before when her recklessness resulted in the breaking of a plate glass window, but she does not know him. He plays a prank by pretending to mistake her for a salesperson. After his departure, she becomes curious and decides to know him better. She finds his weekend address in Bodega Bay, purchases a pair of lovebirds, and makes the long drive to deliver them. The two of them meet again. However, something else is in the air ...Mr. Hitchcock has replaced his traditional tense story with an extreme mystery. He has, through a bizarre apocalyptic atmosphere, a frivolous romance and an idyllic life philosophy, made a symbolic game of destruction. His allegory, in which good and evil are a sort of metaphor, is excellent. The story is intriguing and unfortunately average, but the direction is very good.Hitch plays with visual effects and sound elements. He constantly enhances his horror, through scenes of massacred bodies, explosions and hysteria. The protagonists are constantly exposed to danger and none of them are safe. The fear has changed their character. A psychological or just logical explanation, that is cause of animal attacks, is absent.Characterization is good, while the performances is a bit wooden.Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels is a beautiful and dangerous blonde. She is the main carrier of a danger and reason at the same time. She is an exotic phenomenon in an idyllic landscape. The term ""heroine"" is perhaps too strong, but her performance indicates that notion. Rod Taylor as Mitchell ""Mitch"" Brenner is her support and better segment of their romance. His character is torn by three women. Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner is confused, lost and frightened in a complex role of a mother. Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth is a bit sinister and jealous as an ex-girlfriend, but her performance is the most realistic in this movie.Maestro has offered a bit ""malicious"" end.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Suspenseful & Scary,"One of Hitchcock's most popular movies, ""The Birds"" proves his reputation as ""The Master of Suspense."" There are many suspenseful and scary moments. You see the gas pooling around the vehicle as the idiot lights his cigarette at the pump. You see the birds gathering menacingly to...do what? Hitchcock's timing is perfect as the scene resolves as you knew it would.My favorite character is the ornithologist (amateur, I presume) lady at the gas station. She is so sure that birds would never behave in the manner described that you are almost eager for them to prove her wrong!I have seen the movie several times and enjoyed it very much. But it doesn't make my list of top Hitchcock films because it is more predictable than many others. And I found the ending dissatisfying.Want great characters and plot development? See ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window.""Plot twists? ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" or ""Psycho.""Want a big surprise at the end? Try ""North by Northwest.""A superb adaptation of a Daphne duMaurier story? ""Rebecca.""Great acting? Any of the above, or ""Strangers on a Train.""An entertaining evening watching a relatively easy-to-follow plot by one of the greatest directors ever, while munching on your popcorn? Now you can see ""The Birds.""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Rats with wings, do your thing","As Hitchcock movies go, ""The Birds"" is definitely lower-rung; which surprises me greatly after that teaser trailer, honestly one of the best I've ever seen. I like that the monster is a bloodthirsty swarm, but the suspense just isn't there. Lots of buildup, though; no one's attacked for a good fifty minutes into the film, it's just Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor's awkward back-and-forth (their relationship is weird, man) followed by long stretches of panicky dialog between townspeople. Hitch really spaces out the kills in this film.When the movie actually comes to life, it's fantastic. The main characters are barricaded in the house, irate birds are pecking through the front door and crashing through windows; the sound design here is incredibly effective; escape is in doubt and the terror is real. It's here that I can see why ""The Birds"" is so revered.But all of this is in the film's final stretch, so gear up for the long haul.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds was a fantastic horror movie,"Alfred Hitchcock's film `The Birds' was an outstanding show. Teamed up with Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock made a very suspenseful movie. It was a good idea not to add music it added even more suspense. This horror film also had some pretty good special effects for being made in 1963.  I thought the birds were very lifelike. It was awesome how he thought of making a film about different birds going crazy and attacking the small town. I would have never thought that birds could go crazy and attack people. I especially thought the scene with the children running down the hill was very lifelike. Even though the birds were probably fake, it really looked like they were pecking the children. I thought Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor worked really well together as the main actors. This film had me constantly wondering what would happen next. I give this film a rating of 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
My own theories!,"i only watched this film because i had heard so much about it and it was being shown on ITV new years day. I found the film to be good for the time it was made, and it had an interesting story... but i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since i watched it! the birds just cant attack for no reason, so i came up with the following conclusions: 1) in the bird shop at the beginning, mitch says to Melanie that the birds shouldn't be kept in captivity.. (i cant remember the exact words) but it made me think about whether the birds were attacking because they didn't like the lovebirds being in the cage, and as they were all different species of birds attacking, i thought whether they were sticking together and therefore making the people in the film feel like they are in captivity themselves. 2) the birds only seem to attack when there is fire/smoke. when Melanie is at the school, she lights a cigarette, the birds come. when the lady in the café towards the end is playing with the match to light her cigarette, the birds appear, and in the final bit in the house, the light a fire and Melanie gets attacked.i am sure i will think of more, but please do post and tell me what you think of my theories!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't bother if you value your sanity,"Alfred Hitchcock: depending on you, you will either love him or hate him with all your guts. If you like barf-causing horror and suspense to render your limbs into jelly, as well as a un-foreseeable twist, then this is your movie. It is appreciatable, no matter what. But if you are a person who appreciates movies that make you roar with laughter and recall it the next night with a smile, you will HATE this movie. It will render you to a trembling mass of nerves, and leave you fuming with outrage at the end. If you appreciate suspense, mystery, twists and a movie that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, you could not find a movie to beat The Birds. Otherwise, leave it well alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weaker Hitchcock,"But it is still fun if you enjoy a good monster story.Fortunately, the movie doesn't waste time trying to explain 'WHY' this thing happens.

"A Great Film, But Not Hitchcock's Best","I had previously watched Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' (1960), and absolutely loved it, and was looking forward to viewing future Hitchcock films, so I rented this one. I did enjoy it.It tells the story of Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), the daughter of a rich head of a newspaper, who is in a bird shop after minor birds, when she meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), a lawyer who remembers seeing her in court after she supposedly jumped into a fountain. He is after love birds for his little sister Cathy, as a gift for her 11th birthday. He pretends to think she works there, and waits until she makes a fool of herself, and lets birds out of their cages. There are none in stock, so Mitch heads elsewhere. Melanie's minor birds aren't going to be in yet, so she goes after him, and sees his license plate, and calls it in, and gets his address.Melanie gets some love birds and takes them to his apartment, only to learn that he has gone up to Bodega Bay, about an hour and half from San Francisco, where he and Melanie live, where he goes every weekend to visit Cathy and his mother. Melanie decides to drive up there personally to deliver the love birds. But when she arrives, birds of all sorts, from gulls to black birds and crows, thousands of real birds and about 400 trick shots, swarm Bodega Bay, and Melanie and Mitch must put their differences aside, and fight for their lives.The film has plenty more good acting, with Jessica Tandy playing Lydia Brenner, Mitch's and Cathy's mother, who has a distaste for Melanie, and any woman associated with Mitch, as she is afraid of being abandoned, like she was when her husband died, and Suzanne Pleshette playing Annie Hayworth, the Bodega Bay School Teacher, who is in love with Mitch, though denies it to Melanie.I did enjoy this film, but it is very far from Hitchcock's best, which would most likely be Psycho (1960), or Rear Window (1954). It is in full colour, which would most likely lower the suspense level, but I enjoyed it all the same.Beau's Rating: **** out of *****",,Anonymous,Horror
Little character development,"This movie is definitely gripping in parts but why on Earth do the birds attack only at certain times? This is never really revealed. The development of the characters is also wafer thin. Having said that, this is a genuine Hitchcock thriller. It came during the peak of the great masters powers films like Rear Window,Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, and the Birds all appearing within a ten year period. Hitchcock's earlier and later films with the possible exception of Frenzy in 1972 never quite seemed as captivating as what Hitchcock produced in the 50s and early 60s. It featured the debut of the masculine Australian actor Rod Steiger who went on to become a widely respected actor. Hitchcock's fascination with blondes continues with Tippi Hedren in this case being the leading lady. The location of Bodega Bay, California seems ideal and portrays the intended isolation quite nicely. A little more meaningful dialogue and character development would have been all that this needed to become a true and timeless classic. Well worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hitchcock Classic,"What a different take on horror for the time. Nature strikes back. Alfred Hitchcock masterfully centers this modern horror classic around his muse, Tippie Herdron. The film is ahead of its time with its stunning visual effects, despite the fact that they may appear crude by today's standards. The film really pushed the envelope into the scary and the grisly. Rod Taylor is very compelling. The entire cast is terrific. Catch Hitchcock in his signature cameo in the opening Pet Store Scene. This is a must watch in filmmaking and horror. Aside from Psycho it is Hitchcock's most memorable film, in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This is a horror classic and very methodically put together; however, it's far from Hitchcock's best work","The Birds (1963) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline follows a game of cat and mouse between a rich young lady and a young fella who is playing not to like her to catch her interest. When she travels to a San Francisco suburb to surprise him almost immediately after arriving in town the birds go berserk and start attacking people. What is causing this behavior and will they stop or take over the world?This movie is directed by icon Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and stars Rod Taylor (Inglourious Basterds), Tippi Hedren (Marnie), Jessica Tandy (Driving Miss Daisy), Veronica Cartwright (Alien), Suzanne Pleshette (The Bob Newhart Show) and Bill Quinn (Twilight Zone: The Movie).This will always be one of the more overrated Alfred Hitchcock movies. This wouldn't even make my top 10 films from him. The fake backdrops aren't great and how pressed the main character was to land her love interest didn't feel authentic. However, the casting and acting is top notch. The beach, school and home attacks were very well done and are entertaining every time I watch those sequences. Some of the special effects are dated, but the attack scenes are very good and the birds sitting outside the house are menacing. It is cool how much work went into training of the birds and how they used an actual haunted school to film the school scene. Sigourney Weaver's uncle is in this movie too.Overall, this is a horror classic and very methodically put together; however, it's far from Hitchcock's best work. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Boring,"I don't understand why anyone is scared over this movie. Its not scary. There are some strange elements, but this movie works more as an unintentional comedy than a horror movie. That's actually giving this thing a lot of credit as for the most part its so boring that its not even worth watching as a comedy.The only reason why anyone is going to give this movie a high review is because 
a) They're a fan of Alfred Hitchcock
or b) they were somehow scared by it.Acting - All the acting is very bad. Its like the only direction anyone got was ""just say your line."" Everyone is terrible and unconvincing. The characters themselves are very dull. Some of the people did seem to be trying, but overall everyone failed miserably.Characters - Most of the characters act like total idiots and in general don't act like people. Motivations are very random and nothing is very well established. None of the characters are interesting enough to want to follow.Birds - Except for a few of them, the majority of the birds are very fake. I realize that it would have been able to coordinate that many birds, but it just kinda takes you out of the movie. There is a very long scene early on in the movie were the main character is driving in a car. Between the painfully long shots of the woman driving, there are up close shots on the birds in a cage in the car. Both of them are fake. This scene really sums up most of what is wrong with this movie - its an overlong scene with bad effects, a hint of comedy that is ruined by how long it is, and a moment to think about how boring the story it is. Some annoying woman is driving to some obscure location to give some guy she's met once a bird. What an entertaining premise. Honestly any other movie would condense what this movie drags out for almost an hour into about 10 minutes.Plot - This movie is way longer than it needs to be. Most of the scenes are way too long, and there are a ton of shots that could easily just be cut. The plot itself is already very dull an it doesn't need to be feature length. A lot of this movie is random filler designed to bloat the run time. I explained the basic premise in my previous point.Sights and Sounds - The audio and visual composition of this movie are pretty good, considering how old it is. Too bad its accompanied by terrible acting and a boring plot.I guess there is some potential in this movie. Maybe? Its just to boring for me to recommend it to anyone. I guess its not as bad as it could've been, but its not very good.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A classic from Hitchcock, mainly due to all the discomfort it generates in the audience, whether by the suggestion of ideas through and danger through which the characters go","When Hitchcock released Psycho in 1960, he was getting himself into a lot of trouble. The movie that would follow his great classic would have to be good enough to please fans, hungry for a new horror story that was as good as the last. Unfortunately, that never happened, but he presented us, in his fiftieth film, with a work totally different from anything he had done before: The Birds, from 1963. As in some other works, he left crime as a backdrop. In its story, focusing on further psychological development of the characters. In ""The Birds"" we don't have a killer. But we still have the suspense, the mystery, the fear, only this time with a certain supernatural tone. An extremely different route from what he is used to producing. There is no killer, but a group of apparently crazy birds that are attacking everyone in the city.One of the ways of looking at the work is its ""disconnection"" from Hitchcock's filmography, and I don't take this as a negative point. We have here a terror linked to nature that gives the work an exploitation veil, especially since there is no way to explain, combat or affirm that the problem was about to end. There is no murderer here, but a series of events that, in the end, will not be resolved! That's right, don't expect Hitchcock to chew for you all the philosophy inside The Birds. There's a constant supernatural tone, and that helped a lot to not have that need for the film. It also doesn't have the famous 'The End', just for people to think about everything they had just watched. After everything that happens in the movie, it just ends. The main focus, in fact, is not the attacks, but the psychological fear of people about something they never imagined could be dangerous. The focus is to work on people's subconscious, to make them fear the least fearful things possible. And it worked, at least at the time, since today the movie doesn't scare so much.The Birds is a model when it comes to building the atmosphere of suspense and, often, horror. The real war waged by the birds that storm the small Bodega Bay, a town close to San Francisco, can be easily read as a kind of material projection of the jealousy of Lydia Brenner (Jessica Tandy), a mother who sees the beautiful and famous Melanie as threatens, as she hangs around with her son Mitch. In fact, the angle of perception is offered almost on a platter by Hitchcock himself, in a certain conversation between Melanie and Mitch's old suitor.However, there are several elements that, chained with precision, add complexity to the film. An example is the marked contrast between the metropolis and the interior, an artifice here far from being banal, since it exposes in the coastal idyll a dynamic of relationships governed by somewhat retrograde moral codes. There is also the creation of sexual tension between the protagonists, at first in a bird shop (in a scene of equal subtlety and efficiency) and gradually throughout the narrative, the later arrival of Melanie at Bodega Bay, the first and apparently random attack by a seagull, the realization that physically mother and suitor look alike (more psychology in the vein), among others. Everything converges to the chaos that will soon ensue. The big problem with The Birds is that the text by Evan Hunter, based on the book by Daphne Du Maurier, ends up introducing or dilating some events entirely unnecessary to the general plot. A ninety-minute story ends up stretching for two hours, generating a great and undue slowness in the initial parts, which rely on dispensable approaches from certain characters, who gain back stories, only to be underused or discarded later.Hitchcock would make The Birds one of his most controversial films, both for critics and for his fans, who expected a more palpable horror, characteristic of the director. Like most of his films, Hitchcock presents us with a female character who goes against the conventions of the time in which the films are set, always putting them ahead of their time. At the same time that Melanie arrives in the city, the attacks of birds begin, an omen that she is the point of imbalance and these offensives appear when there are conflicting and emotional relationships. Mitch's mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) like other mothers in Hitchcock's works, is controlling, jealous, domineering and her son's new girlfriend doesn't seem to be in her good graces, only when Melanie seems most vulnerable, most dependent is her son. Mother-in-law seems to support her.The similarity between the birds' revolt and Melanie's avant-garde attitude is visible when we get to the last moments of the film: after being directly attacked and totally handed over to Mitch's family, the end is apocalyptic and the birds cease their attacks. Melanie is totally tamed and no longer presents any danger to that city. It's interesting how the director doesn't offer any explanation for the attacks and still manages to keep the viewer's attention.The film has already gained all kinds of possible interpretations, from symbolic, mystical, psychoanalytic issues to political situations typical of that moment of the Cold War (the birds as a communist invasion, etc.). But the plot is always giving an account of casual relationships, disguised by a certain belligerence and that the moment they become strong, they receive an external call: the struggle for survival, the end of amenities. Regardless of what motivated the birds' attack, the film easily guides the two spheres of transformation, internal and external to the characters, which develop in contrast. A frightening story of behavioral changes and transformation of the beautiful and ordinary into a cause for fear. And all for inexplicable reasons.The Birds is a thriller built on the uncertainty of what is in front of the viewer, something fragile and vulnerable like birds, which change the lives of the inhabitants of the small coastal town of Bodega Bay, California. Although it develops slowly, the fear of the unexpected that the film causes us comes from the unpredictability of elements of nature. Escaping the human ineffability present in past plots, which functioned as a kind of cautionary tale - a story that warns the viewer about an imminent danger.Hitchcock was nothing short of brilliant (he often was in the 1950s and early 1960s), calming the nerves of viewers who came to see the film just to see the bird attacks. As the first one only takes place after 50 minutes of projection, the director offered some ""appetizers"" for the impatient: he filmed a solitary lunge of a seagull here, showed a crowd of crows lined up on pole wires at another time... And, in that, satisfied the spirits of the most daring, and, even more, created an almost supernatural atmosphere of dread, a feeling that something very wrong is happening, but we don't know what (and this annoyance will only increase as the film progresses), making his work gradually more exciting.And in this movie, we know absolutely nothing about what's going on! We are as lost as the characters, with the exception of a small scene in the middle of the film, which precedes an attack by crows. The sensations evoked by Hitchcock in this feature are no longer of apprehension, tension or expectation for what will happen to the characters. Here, we are nothing short of terrified by what can happen, since the behavior of birds (and even that of some characters) is totally unpredictable, bringing out in each of us the fear of the unknown.The birds' attacks are perfectly executed and still impress us today not only because of the difficulty of execution by the technical standards of the time, but also because of the impression they leave on us. The attacks get progressively worse, first with some seagulls, some crows, until we reach an almost apocalyptic scenario in which the birds take over Bodega Bay, causing chaos. To relativize the importance of such marks of time in the effects part, it is enough to realize that the strength of the film lies in the narrative ingenuity. Each flight of a bird gains in significance beyond the ""present"" image, this is why we are led from the beginning, and little by little, to perceive every aerial movement as suspicious and even deadly. The scene in which the crowds gather, one by one, perched on the toy in the courtyard of the local school, is proof of that. In principle, no big deal, even with that exaggerated gathering, but in fact we feel the latent, silent fear, once we understand in advance the danger of stalking.Through sounds, edits and tricks, killer birds provide us with a unique sensory experience. ""The Birds"" does not have a soundtrack. Composer Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's former partner, appears in the credits only as ""sound consultant"" and the idea of not using any score in the feature came from him. The creation of the atmosphere is largely through production design, which, oblivious to Hitchcock's compositional skills, made everything framed through the director's lens become innovative and inventive.In the end, it is quite clear, therefore, why The Birds became this well-known work by Alfred Hitchcock. It is not one of his best works, but it is certainly one of the most impressive, mainly due to all the discomfort it generates in the audience, whether by the suggestion of ideas through linked shots, or the punctual use of violence, blood, that settles, once and for all, the danger through which the characters go. Problems in the script, involving the unnecessary expansion of the plot and slips in the construction of the characters, therefore, do not diminish this great suspense of the master of the genre, who showed again everything he learned in these many years of experience. His prolific career, of course, doesn't end there, but The Birds is still a farewell, like the last of this legendary director.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A farmer is attacked and killed by birds while a huge flock dive bombs children walking home from school. What in the world is making birds a dangerous enemy of humans ?

Tough to Score,"I intensely dislike the open ending of this movie, and have trouble bonding with the character of Melanie, but there's also no denying that this is a great film.Scary as heck, this movie sets up a very vivid confrontation of ""mankind versus nature,"" with the birds suddenly deciding to form flocks and attack.It is apparently based on a real story that was turned into a novel. In the film, we get inside clues that the message is environmentalist. (Orders of fried chicken taken in the background. Love birds caged throughout. No respect for our feathered friends.)The directing, editing, and videography is solid even now. Special effects are dated, but still have a punch.I dislike the character of Melanie, who seems a rather callous human ""bird"" (woman) However, she gets her come uppence.Mitch, his mother, and sister are solidly played, as is his former girlfriend and townsfolk.I wish we had more of a story ending, but this does leave a creepier tone--that the ending is more or less up to us.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hard to sum up what I just watched, but I liked it","I watched the classic Alfred Hitchcock horror film 'The Birds' a few years ago and I only remember that I enjoyed it (and the final shot in the movie). The rest of it I had completely forgotten. Now I've seen it again I can sort of see why. It's a difficult film to do justice when trying to - properly - sum it up.It would be easy to say that it's a horror film where birds start to attack humans. Yes, that's an adequate summary, but the film is so much more than that just saying it like that. The first half is primarily build-up, where a well-to-do socialite decides to follow a man she only just met to his secluded home town in order to play a practical joke on him.Maybe I'm just looking at it through '2023 eyes,' but it all just seems rather odd. I would call these actions 'stalking a stranger the woman had only just met' yet it's all presented as rather harmless and even romantic. But then again perhaps that's the point? This is a horror film after all and this could well all be part of creating a particularly unsettling atmosphere where things all feel a little bit too unreal to be true.It's not until about the halfway mark where all the family parties take a backseat when Woody Woodpecker and his hordes of mates start trying to take a piece of flesh or two out of our human protagonists. The effects do feel a little dated compared to today's standards and they haven't held up that well, but, if you believe what you read on the internet, it wasn't just overlaying footage of flying birds over the humans, but the producers actually trained birds to peck at the actors.It's hard to say whether I should recommend this film or not. I certainly enjoyed it both times I watched it. Hopefully it will stick in my head a little longer after this viewing. There's certainly elements of conventional horror in there, but it's the weird sub-plots that seem to give it whatever 'charm' as made it the classic it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wonderful monster-movie tension.,"In one of Hitchcock's sillier movies (not a bad thing), a perfectly mediocre screwball romance is thankfully interrupted by some angry birds.

Im-peck-able Hitchcock,"Incredibly scary late Hitchcock with many effective moments (especially the attack in the bedroom and at the children's party).  Excellent performances from Taylor, Hedron and Tandy prevail, but the film is flawed by a weak plot (Hedren coming all the way from San Francisco) and the film lacks a proper ending.  The murkyness surrounding the possible connection between the attacks and the lovebirds is very smart, and the film is a Hitchcock worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haven't looked at a seagull the same since,"A small California beach town is attack by flocks of aggressive birds.This is a very strong thriller with memorable horror-suspense sequences.The plot is mostly character-driven as it follows a romance between the two main characters and the reactions of others to their potential relationship. This is pretty well done, especially how it ties into the scenes with the birds.Mitch and Melanie are entertaining characters but not written in an overly likeable way. The most interesting character is the domineering mother who's attitude towards Melanie seems to cleverly change in line with the bird attacks.The attack scenes do look dated in parts, but they are excellent when you consider when the film was released. Some hold up against modern filmmaking, such as the creepy jungle gym scenes, the final big siege on the house, and Melanie's moment of madness when she goes upstairs.Generally the filmmaking and art design is fantastically good. As always Hitchcock tells the story with cinematography and editing. Plus the costumes and use of colour is striking.There are some strong themes that Hitchcock makes clear such as nature fighting back. Imagery/sound like the caged birds, Melanie's fur coat and the fried chicken order at the diner all serve to remind you that as scary as these birds are, man is far worse.All actors give great performances, particularly Tippy Hedren and Jessica Tandy.For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A tad overrated, but still a great movie","Trying to get a rare bird, a woman is shown up in a prank by a stranger and tracks him to a small coastal community and try to kindle a romance only for a strange series of attacks by birds to interrupt everything, and as they start to think that the birds are attacking the community the remaining town-members fight back.This was a really good film with a lot to really like about it. The best feature is the idea of unending terror without giving the reason behind how these birds got this way. This tends to make the understanding of what happened in this movie really dependent on the viewer, and it works for the better because the audience doesn't really need to know. Birds are attacking and killing people, and instead of worrying about what is causing it the characters just need to worry about surviving. That allows for a dramatic increase in the terror since the survival matters more and can pay out to better effect. This also has an added bonus factor in that the birds that attack the humans aren't birds of prey but rather an assortment of ordinary everyday birds. That's what makes the attacks all the more frightening, as a regular bird seen every day instills more terror than those that aren't interacting with them on a daily basis. It gives off a realistic vibe, making the randomness of the events that much more horrific. That the big reason for the film's success lies in its superb attacks aren't all that odd either. Most notable is the entire diner sequence, where a long conversation about the impossibility of the event is broken when they start unleashing their assault. There's the scene inside a phone booth where the film traps us within the confines of the booth whilst birds ram the glass to try and break in. It's a long, drawn-out scene with a lot more action than normal for such a scene, as it plays out in spectacular fashion and gets a lot of time to do so. Another attack that really works is the one on the school children, as every new shot of them climbing the frame outside has a few more birds waiting until the camera takes you outside to see that it's completely covered in birds. When they decide to take flight, the sheer amount of birds is simply awe-inspiring, and the relentless, remorseless attack is brutal and bloody, making that it's about school-children even more frightening as them pecking and scratching is seen here delivering the shock required. The single best, though, is the final assault in the climax that starts the best possible way, where a single, weird coincidence gradually grows by each encounter and helps make this a spectacular entry. This really doesn't have a whole lot, but there are a few problems. The biggest one is the general pacing, which is rather off. The romantic subplot takes up the first fifty minutes before any sort of prolonged attack occurs, leaving the first half really slow-going. That it also contains numerous scenes of talking that leads nowhere also takes up a lot of time. The most obvious ones, where the two girls discuss past dating history, and the girlfriend and mother discuss what happened before they even knew each other are just prime examples. The answers and topics aren't brought up again, and while cementing the relationships, they drag the film out needlessly. At the very least, they could've been trimmed substantially and still kept their overall intent intact. There are also some problems with the special effects, which are, for the most part, pretty bad. The live birds do fine but are inserted into the scenes so haphazardly that it's so obvious it's a special effect that it takes you out of the scene. There are numerous shots too many to mention where the birds don't come off anywhere near realistically, even if the action itself is spectacular. These hamper the film the most and are its main weaknesses.Today's Rating/PG-13: Violence and children-in-danger.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tenser Than You Think,"One of the rare animal horror movies done right with an excellent escalation of terror with how much the birds overwhelm this small seaside town for unknown reasons other than the vague retribution of mother nature. The effects start off bad, but quickly grow really impressive with the mix of real birds in impressively large numbers and plenty of stock footage overlap effects. The first third of the movie is admittedly pretty corny as the ""that just means he likes you when he insults you"" and sex-negative-shaming romantic melodrama shtick gets old fast. But the rest of the character building in this small seaside town is very endearing with all of the townsfolk interacting with Tippi Hendren's character. The character herself is played quite well, as well as the chill schoolteacher and the rest of the smarmy lawyer's family. The bird attack scenes are all great and surprisingly pretty gruesome at times like with the final home invasion and especially in the attic. The schoolyard crow attack is iconic and the café debate was very entertaining. The final looming shot of the calm pile of birds eerily waiting for the main heroes to leave was an effectively chilling way to end the movie on a cautiously bright ending with a heavy reminder of what they narrowly just escaped. Alfred Hitchcock's mistreatment of lead actress Tippi Hendren is greatly disappointing, with his mistrust and endangerment of her with her fear of birds was very reckless and his sexual harassment of her being outright despicable. But as the movie stands on its own, it's quite remarkable and groundbreaking for the animal horror genre. Definitely worth a watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cinema Omnivore - The Birds 7.9/10,"""The world cannot be too good to such a female knockout, at least not in a '60s Hitchcock movie, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) must perish for her avaricious caprice in PSYCHO (1960), and here, Melanie is punished for her irrational infatuation by pecking beaks of gulls and crows. It is a trifle unsavory to let Hitchcock's thinly veiled misogyny and sadism slip through our mind unscathed, inter alia, Melanie's climatic visit to the room upstairs of a battened-down house assaulted by clouds of birds is irrefutably non-sensical and misbegotten, taking the shine off the technical virtuosity that emulates the iconic shower scenes in PSYCHO, the same frenetic montage-splicing artifice works fine, but one also wonders why not let our hero the straight-arrow Mitch Brenner (Taylor) take the shaft for a change?

FREUD explains HITCHCOCK !!,"Another alfred Hitchcock classic that deals with ... family relationship from mother to child, jealousy and passion, all very well orchestrated by the master of suspense , even the oedipus complex in the film, by zigmund Freud, is mentioned for those who like psychoanalysis is a full plate.Melanie Daniels ( Tippie Hedren ) mysterious, socialight, very charismatic we end up wanting to discover her personality at the same time, we twist all the time for her, who ends up being enchanted by Mitch's charm ( Rod Taylor ) successful lawyer who spends his weekends in a small town called Bodega Bay , which melanie goes to her to really know mitch taking two parakeets.Hitchcock divides the film into two stages, the first the beautiful construction of the characters, their characteristics and mysteries, and when we are well ""attached"" to them , intrigued only by mitch's affective relationships ( passion for melanie, a feeling of friendship from his ex, the bodega bay teacher, his protective mother , obsessive and jealous and even his little sister who needs protection. In the second, the attacks of the birds begin, with great scenes always experiencing a lot of tension. It is worth remembering that we are talking about Hitchcock, taken as that of the seated protagonist, waiting to speak with the school teacher, and the playground in its background gradually increasing the number of birds without it noticing, only the public noticing, without the sound of birds, without music and just with the sound of the children's singing class it is sensational . We even remember that in this film there is no soundtrack but we have a lot of bird sound during the attacks.In addition to being fully connected to the film, we have a very subjective ending for each viewer, each one can see the answer for the entire film of "" why did birds attack ?"" In a different way. But you can be sure that it is not just the reaction of the bad bird feed mentioned at the beginning of the film, as they ended up carrying out attacks in another nearby city, or the relationship with the mitch sister caged parakeets, Cathy ? Or Melanie struggling stunned to regain consciousness after being attacked and visualizing Cathy? But we can be sure that when the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is fully defined and birds are accepted, they calm down. Magnificent!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Strong acting, a memorable location and good pacing.","A classic horror which starts off as a drama/romance featuring an obsessive woman and a possessive mother but as the birds begin to behave oddly, the tension slowly builds. This is later replaced by a growing suspense and dread which doesn't let up until the rather abrupt ending. The way they managed to create something disturbing from the mundane is very effective, especially when there's little you can do to stop it. Some of the special effects are (laughably) bad due to their age but others are still just as effective and the sound the birds make as they surround the house is truly terrifying.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's a classic ror a reason,"This movie is a classic for a reason. It centers around birds turning rogue and attacking a small coastal town, which is both bizarre and super entertaining. The suspense builds so slowly at first, and then BAM-you find yourself on the edge of your seat as flocks of birds wreak havoc! The performances, especially by Tippi Hedren, are great and really draw you into the madness. The special effects for the time are impressive, and it's fascinating how Hitchcock creates tension using sound and visuals. It definitely keeps you guessing about what these feathered fiends are up to! That said, it does have some slow moments, and the way people react to the bird attacks is hilariously over-the-top at times. But if you're in the mood for some vintage horror with a unique twist, it's a must-see. I'd give it a solid 8/10-it's a bit quirky, but that just adds to its charm!

major goof that should have been caught in Dailies!,"At Cathy's birthday party, when Mitch and Melanie climb the small hilltop to chat;you can see the Brenner Dock without any water around it and dry ground a good 100yds or more away from the dock. How in one day could that much water disappear when the day before Melanie brings the rented rowboat right up to the dock to deliver Cathy's love birds and the water level is close to the height of the Dock.Unless a major sink hole opened up during the night and swallowed probably mega tons of water its highly unlikely you would have that much water disappear.I'm surprised that a perfectionist like Hitch wouldn't of caught that and did some background reshooting...Still a great movie...s.m.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds Deliver,"A highly unique film for its time (and still is), Hitchcock's The Birds is great fun. I've seen it several times now and it definitely holds up well. A lot has been made of Hedren's performance with many critics saying she plays it too cool and detached. I disagree and counter that her performance is a wise and effective contrast to Suzanne Pleshette's (excellent) performance. Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy are also both quite good. There are real moments of tension and suspense here and like most of Hitchcock's films from this period, it just overall looks great.

Caw Caw,"It's been a while since I've been to Bodega Bay, but Hitchcock has been a favourite since I first watched a VHS of this some 30 years ago. Today I'm introducing my daughter to Alfred's avian nightmare. Now if I'm really really honest, The Birds is pretty cheesy. Hammy acting, the lovebirds swaying in the car footwell, not to mention the retro 60s charm of matte effects, but I love The Birds. Even knowing everything that happens before it graces the screen, the tension is gripping and my young companion gasps accordingly. In 60 years on The Birds hasn't lost its magic. Melanie Daniels proving that the rich have a lot of time on their hands, to go flirting with Mitch Brenner in the outskirts of San Francisco. The old fashioned bayside town is really the star for me, even more than the birds themselves and the cast of backwater characters and their simple lives acts as the perfect canvas for something so unexpected as human hunting airborne marauders. We get a ""whoa"" as the children sing in the school house as the birds amass and I'm taken back to my teenage self watching in awe as each scene painstakingly builds. Yes it's schlocky, yes Tippi Hedren is a bit wooden and yes it's essentially a single premise slowly drawn out over two hours, but this is one of my favourite Hitch outings and I can't wait to relive more.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extraordinary Film,"Alfred Hitchcock didn't waste any time; he started the story right from the first scene. The film is about birds, and the director included at least one bird in almost every scene. The technical side of the movie was great. Today, we could easily make a similar movie, but this one was released in 1963, when there weren't many visual effects. Still, the director and crew managed to do almost everything practically.The movie has 30 to 45 minutes of setup time, but that part is interesting and not boring. As the movie goes on, it keeps getting better. The actors did a great job, and the film was shot beautifully, even with some difficult scenes. Personally, I really like this movie; it's a must-watch for everyone. There are no sexual scenes, so you can enjoy it with your family.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Birds of Prey,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is among the first 'predators-hunting/killing-in-packs' thriller. While there have been almost countless followers that tried to ape the effect of Hitchcock's film, hardly any of them come even remotely close to 'The Birds'. It stands on its own and even after decades, it manages to remain just as engaging, intense and chilling as the first time I saw it as child.The movie more or less starts off as a romantic comedy. The interaction between Tippi's Melanie and Rod's Mitch is amusing to watch. I found this an appealing approach to introduce the characters and their personalities without any distraction. Once Melanie is attacked by a seagull tension gradually builds both between the characters (for example when Melanie meets Rod's family) and then within the town as the birds attack.The special effects and art direction are brilliant. Music is effectively used. The screeching and pecking sounds of the birds is haunting. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor have great chemistry. I liked that they didn't play the cliché hero and heroine that was so apparent in films of that time. Veronica Cartwright, Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are superb in their roles.Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is a chilling and creepy little film, one of the best of it's kind. While the bird attack sequences are tastefully shot, it is the fantastic end sequence that sends a chill down the spine.",,Anonymous,Horror

A lot of it was to do with its cinematography and its being shot in black and white, but one of the things that made The Birds such a surreal horrer film was what it lacked ........a musical score.I never thought I could be scared of the gradual build up of a bunch of ravens on a childrens playground set, but the way Hitchcock shows it is nothing short of genius.

When birds attack...,"Sure, I have watched the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock movie ""The Birds"" once or twice before, during my youth. And as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch it again in 2022, of course I did so.Now, while this movie is deemed a classic, I have to admit that I actually found the storyline to be somewhat trivial and slow paced. There wasn't really a whole lot of excitement and thrills throughout the course of ""The Birds"".Sure, I can imagine that this movie would have been rather thrilling back in 1963. But sitting down and watching it in 2022, then writer Evan Hunter and director Alfred Hitchcock's movie just haven't withstood the passage of time all that well.""The Birds"" is a watchable movie, by all means, but there simply just wasn't enough excitement throughout the nearly two hours that the movie ran for. And that makes ""The Birds"" a somewhat acquired taste of a movie. A classic to some, merely watchable to others, and I am somewhere in between.It wasn't that ""The Birds"" is a lousy or bad movie, not at all. I just didn't get that much of a kick out of watching it again here in 2022. Funny how I remember the movie as being way more entertaining and scary back from my youth.However, it should be noted that the acting performances in ""The Birds"" are quite good, and while the narrative is rather slow paced, then the acting performances do salvage the movie and lifts it up and carries it a great long way.The special effects in ""The Birds"" haven't aged well, and they are quite antiquated. Again, this was great and spectacular back in 1963, of that I am more than sure, but in 2022 not so much.""The Birds"" is a noteworthy movie, by all means, don't get me wrong. It just somewhat fell short of being all that entertaining for my personal preference of entertainment.My rating of ""The Birds"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
mother and son theme,"The theme that is immediately recognized within the film is the mother and son relationship.  The mother in the film, Lydia Brenner is extremely overbearing and needy of her son, Mitch.  Lydia continually points to the fact that she needs Mitch in order to survive.  Lydia becomes especially angered as Melanie shows for dinner and Mitch show a true liking for her. In the scene after Lydia finds her friend's eyes poked out and dead from the birds attack Melanie comes in with tea.  During this scene Lydia makes it a point to explain to Melanie why she does not like her and it is strictly because Lydia does not want her son ever to leave her because she will be alone.  Lydia views Melanie as a threat, which is completely ridiculous! The theme is apparent again when Melanie encounters Annie Hayworth.  Annie is obviously still upset by her and Mitch's berak-up and reveals to Melanie the evil tendecies Lydia has. As Annie explains to Melanie that Lydia does not like anyone that is with Mitch, Melanie and the viewers get a cold and frightening feeling about Lydia and what her motives may be.  Overall, the birds attacking can connect to this overbearing mother Mrs.Brenner and her obsessive attachment to her son. The birds do begin attacking when Melanie arrives and the first person attacked is Melanie. As attacks continue Melanie is always present besides for one occasion. The attacks can be seen as an attack on anything that attacks Mitch. I think the attacks maybe a symbol of lose of control. Lydia maybe losing control of her relationship with her son Mitch because Melanie has entered his life. Therefore, it can be possible that the birds began attacking as Melanie arrived because she is the reason behind this idea of lose of control. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in the film. I thought the mother and son relationship was pretty interesting to watch and evaluate,but the film was extremely slow and lengthy. There was not enough suspense built up for the birds attacks and too much unnecessary dialogue. The special effects were pretty decent considering the time. The movie was too drawn out and did not have enough suspense and build up to hold interest for two hours!",,Anonymous,Horror
My impressions after the last view,"I find the movie absolutely great. It`s one of the masterpieces of the history of the cinema. What I`d like to say-and to know- is that after having seen the movie yesterday I`ve asked to myself if the house of our characters is a metaphor of the bird`s cage, and if the movie is about a kind of revenge of the birds against the man. About the ending, I`ve had different opinions with my friends because for me the dawn towards which the car goes means that the threat has finished and the birds are ""satisfied"" (for the moment!). bye to everybody",,Anonymous,Horror
The Birds is A Predictable and Pointless Flight 🐦,"I was really not a fan of this film. I found the concept quite redundant and there was no explanation as to why the birds went haywire and started attacking people. The shark in ""Jaws"" doesn't have a reason to attack either, but at least it's more palatable with great character moments and scenes. If this was supposed to be a commentary on how humans mistreat animals, I think it was poorly executed by Hitchcock. I much prefer ""Psycho"" and ""Rope"" over this concept over substance movie. Also these characters were as bland as sugarless lemonade, which is not the fault of the actors. The real problem is the script is poor. I think I'm leaning towards agreeing with Tarantino's opinion that Hitchcock may very well be one of the most overrated directors in film history (partially due to the restrictive Hollywood system of the time). I appreciate the look of the film, but that is not enough to carry it through all its flaws. This bird has two broken wings 🦅.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grow up and think!,"As per usual when confronted with a really challenging movie most viewers are lost.Pay attention I say.One wonders what was Hitch's intent? More than likely it was to make an open ended movie that one can interpret multiple ways. There is no explanation of why the Birds are attacking and the ending leaves no clues as to whether they will continue to attack.The Birds becomes more interesting everyday foreshadowing the environmental consciousness and animal rights consciousness. Revolutionary at that time.There are no human hero's here. Almost every character has glaring flaws, petulance, jealousy, callousness, egotistical, lust. Melanie is a rich spoiled brat, Mitch is a lawyer who has lust for Melanie and is not very nice to her at the start, Annie is jealous, and Mitches mother is weak and clinging. The Bar scene is especially delicious, every one who speaks is a jerk, from a self important ""expert"" ornithologist to a drunken bible thumper. Hitchcock, of course, was a master at exposing flaws in human psychology.Metaphors fly right from the start, as the protagonist human brings caged love birds ostensibly as a present but really to buy into a sexual relationship.We hear a lot about how good the shots were and the special effects, and they are good especially for the time. But the true story is really how Hitch was able to get us to watch a film with no ending.Like most truly great film this film presents plenty of questions but gives no answers. That's what's what is really interesting about this film. You don't just sit there and get entertainment spoon fed to you like a baby, you have to interact with the film.That's what most people don't get.

"The Scariest ""Hitchcock"" I've Ever Seen (I Haven't Seen Psycho)","Birds fighting mankind seems unlikely, but Hitchcock makes it happen.

However, the only movies he's directed that I've seen are Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, The Birds, Rope, Marnie, Vertigo, and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This movie brought much fear to me and I wish that they weren't making a sequel because they will ruin the whole thing. This was smart, suspenseful, and gave me the feeling that Hitchcock could do anything. He can, too (including appear in his directed films.

I thought that the scene where all of the birds attack the Brenners and Ms. Daniels was very creepy. However, I found that the ending was considerably disappointing, but other than that I cannot complain at all. It isn't up to todays standards of horror, but i found it quite enjoyable, so if you're looking for a good thriller, ""The Birds"" is definitely worth a look.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Why, indeed?","Why indeed? That's what everyone wants to know. Why did the birds suddenly decide to attack these people? Is there some connection to the middling soap opera we see played out over the first hour of the film and their attacks, (maybe they don't like middling soap operas?). Is it because they are fed up with all the pollution and people shooting at them all the time?  Or is it just because they can?Maybe Hitchcock just wanted to make a scary movie. He might ask you to imagine yourself in the restaurant and suddenly a bloodied man staggers in and says `The birds are attacking and we don't know why!' Now picture yourself in the same restaurant and suddenly a bloodied man staggers in and says,'The birds are attacking and we know exactly why!' Which is scarier?Perhaps a better question is why Hitch spent so much time, (more than usual in his films and more than you'll see in any other horror film), exploring the characters and their relationships, delving into motivations, attractions and resentments. Why does it matter that Jessica Tandy misses her husband because he is so strong and is now so dependent on her son that she doesn't want to share him? Why do we have to know that Suzanne Pleshette's schoolteacher is in love with Mitch and sees Melanie, (Tippi Hedren) as a rival? Why is Melanie's escapade in Rome or her raising funds for orphans so important? Why should we care about this? Do the birds care about these things?I think it's hopeless to try to make some connection between the `plot' and the events in the story. Hitchcock loved to experiment with the cinema and there is little sentiment and only superficial romance in most of this films. This story never gets to the point of being sentimental or romantic anyway. The film is surely not about ecology. Nobody says anything about the birds being angry about the environment or anything else.I think Hitch just liked the idea of a movie starting out to be about one thing and then turning out to be about something else entirely. That's what he did with PSYCHO, which starts out to be a crime melodrama about Janet Leigh trying to get away with some illicit funds and very suddenly becomes the ultimate `slasher' flick about Anthony Perkins and his crazy mother. Here we see a romantic comedy turn gradually into a soap opera and then gradually into a monster movie, with the birds being the monsters. The major difference is the gradual nature of the transition. The attic scene is this film's equivalent of the shower scene in PSYCHO but it doesn't have the same impact because the attacks have already begun, (and Tippi survives). The gradual pace of change is obviously intended to produce a sense of dread, rather than surprise.Looking at Tippi Hedren's performance it's hard to see why she didn't become a major star. She's gorgeous, (much better looking than her daughter, ironically named Melanie, thanks to a softer jaw line), has a strong voice, an expressive face and shows real acting ability. She should have won some kind of award for her perseverance in the attic scene, which took four days with live birds to shoot. That she came out of this an animal lover is amazing.What does it all mean? It means you got your money's worth when you bought your ticket.",,Anonymous,Horror
Dull as a Gull,"The films premise is promising and haunting as it exploits the creepy but familiar nature of birds, an animal that is universally known by humans. Unfortunately this premise is tucked away a quarter into the film. Before an birds attack there is the most unbelievable and forced romantic premise. Plot contrivences and bizarre character motivations. They provide room to allow for character growth but the beginnings is jarring.The actor is not good, especially the wooden female protagonist. I've never had a bird attack but just witnessing it is traumatizing. The movie doesn't take it seriously and worst of all the wooden performance exasperats it. The simple solution utilised at the end was available throughout the film. Especially when the attacks have escalated and the cause is alien, akin to supernatural.What I will say is the shoots of the multitude of birds are great. Marvelous and spectacular and what I sense was the intended feeling Hitchcock wanted to evoke throughout the movie. Unfortunately the movie is silent unless there is the annoyance of bird sounds which quickly turn the evoked fear and distress into frustration and distraction. All the bird attack scenes are distractingly unconvincing. I can't tell the real birds from the fake birds. The shots are dizzying. The attacks are soft for the most part until they aren't but I have already been dulled by the toothless birds. So many times are people unharmed, untouched for the most part that the graphic attacks, although frightening and effective, are few and far between.This is a precursor to masterpieces such as Jaws but on its own it is hindered by the technology, the lack of or uncreative depiction of violent, brutal, graphic attacks, and doesn't utilises Hitchcock's greatest weapon in his arsenal, the suspenseful score he is known for. Not every movie needs its first quarter to be taken up by an unnecessary and irrational subplot.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A showcase of Hitchcock's mastered technique,"3/4The Birds is the subject of an age-old debate that cinephiles often engage in: is The Birds a good or an overrated film? I am one of a neutral party that agrees with both. To me, The Birds is everything that it promised to be, nothing more.There is no debating this: it's not Hitchcock's masterpiece. The plot is this: A woman works a pet shop, she gets an order for love birds, she travels to a coastal town to get the love birds...Birds go wild and ravage the place while she falls in love with the town hunk. Why do these birds go mad? This is one of the many questions the movie will not answer. If you care enough to analyze it, be my guest. This movie does not challenge you to find answers, as it works perfectly fine if you suspend your disbelief.However, the plot is not where the movie earns its merits at all. The film is very surreal, intense, and mildly frightening as Hitch's signature spice. If anything is to be said about this movie at all, the way Hitch shot the Birds was flawless as far as camera work. The way he captured their spirit of destruction through the rule of thirds is truly cinematography in Hitchcock tradition. To me, his portrayal and control of the Birds is what makes the film.The cast (especially Tippi Hedren) are very vibrant characters full of life and genuine emotion. He was able to convey these characters without the use of a musical score was very adept, although it should not go unnoticed that in the school scene the children sing a rhyme to build up suspense. Every component compliments one another in The Birds. There is truly no wasted talent.In conclusion, I find The Birds to be a good movie. Most of all, I find it to be an important milestone in cinematic history simply for the way the birds were captured on-screen. This does not have my vote for Hitchcock's best, or even his second or third best, but it's great for what it is: a landmark movie and a fun thriller.",,Anonymous,Horror
AFLAC!!!!,"Hello fellow movie buffs!After repeated urgings from my brother, I relented and rented ""The Birds"". What a stinker! The only thing missing was Jessica Fletcher. I tried to allow for the fact that SFX technology was not quite as advanced back in 1963 but that didn't work for me. It's still awful. Wooden performances and a lousy production. Ugh!Just my opinion, of course.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad but not great,"I suggest watching ""Strangers on a Train"" instead. The birds was very scary, many of the techniques used in The Birds are still being used today. I would recommend it, but the ending was terrible, you would expect some sort of satisfaction, but there is none so don't get your hopes up. Notice that there is no music whatsoever in the film, adding to the frightfulness.",,Anonymous,Horror
Don't watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This a not very scary film. For a start birds would not be so aggressive if unprovocked and it did not explain why the birds were so aggressive! I waited until the end to see what the ending was like. What ending? This is a film with no ending and if you have seen the Italian job you know what I'm talking about. If you want to see a good thriller/ horror see Children of the corn (1984) or one like this only better see Arachnophobia (1990). I'll be kind with marking 3 out of 10.,,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't work anymore,"I saw this movie last night during a midnight screening at the student theater. After all the wonderful things I had heard about it (Hitchcock's best!), I was extremely disappointed. This movie did not age well at all.The story involves a capricious woman who apparently has played practical jokes following a man to Bodega Bay to deliver some lovebirds. We are not completely sure as to how or why they know each other, but we do know that there is a mutual attraction. Due to some strange attacks by birds, she stays with the man, the young sister, and the elderly, bizarre mother. The attacks become progressively worse, and we watch how they cope with it.Not only are the special effects horrible, the acting was a completely different style as well. Many times the camera would focus on a character doing their best to put on an ""intense"" face. Throughout the movie, the whole audience was laughing almost hysterically. I can't recall a time when I laughed more in a movie theater. Not to mention the awkward laughter that came after the movie ended when people thought the reel had broken, or something along that line to explain the odd ending.Obviously there were some elements that illustrate why some regard it as excellent. The fact that Hitchcock could create suspense with no score is mind-blowing. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I don't know if I would ever recommend this.Bottom line - this movie does not translate well.",,Anonymous,Horror
My cat got scared!,"While watching this film, my cat heard the bird noises and became slightly nervous! It's still a good horror film but Tippi looks unrealistically perfect, even after being attacked by violent birds. There's no outside help. No one comes to kill the birds or rescue the people in this small town, even though they're near San Francisco. Was Hitchcock blaming Tippi, the outsider who had romantic designs on Rod Taylor, for the bird attack? Was she too sexy for her own good? I think that's the ""moral"" of this story but I'm not completely sure! And yes, Jessica Tandy looks and sounds exactly like an older version of Tippi, although this is never mentioned in the movie. It's a good film although outdated, and the bird attacks are still gruesome. What I didn't like was seeing children being attacked by birds. That was in bad taste.",,Anonymous,Horror
THE BIRDS,"One of the most famous movie from director Alfred Hitchcock, but strangely not the typical feature from him. Because this is not a crime thriller suspense. Just a thriller horror suspense, where every shot, every camera angle is calculated in a so accurate, meticulous way. This is a pure masterpiece which everyone should see at least once in his or her life. It may traumatize you if you are a child; it did, concerning me. I was damn shocked, more than PSYCHO, which I also saw in the same period. But it's not the same kind of terror, same kind of horror. It is riveting, guts grabbing, very inventive, gritty, bloody but so terrific. A milestone in movie history.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not as suspenseful as I imagined,"This film is okay. Not very special like Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" but not as bad as many other modern horror-films. The effects with the birds are pretty good but I don't really think that birds can scare you as much as a shark can do, like in Spielberg's ""Jaws"" for example, which was much better I think. If Hitchcock would have done a movie like this with other animals it would have been better! I rate it 6 out to 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not quite a masterpiece...,"The Birds isn't a great film at all - the idea is great, and so is the script, but the direction is sssslllloooowwww, and the first hour or so is tedious. The scenes with the bird attacks are very good, and the ominous precence of the birds sitting on the school climbing frame is unforgettable. But the characters are dull, and the film doesn't get exciting at all. The problem is, today's audiences are brought up on films that eschew subtle suspense for sudden shocks and gore, and can't even feel the uncomfortable atmosphere of this film and, believe it or not, Psycho as well. Which is an awful shame.But I love films that feel they don't have to explain themselves - who says films should make complete sense? It is an art form, after all - and this gives no reason whatsoever for the events taking place, leaving the audience to guess what is going on....the awesome and chilling idea behind this movie is more effective than the actual film itself, though, so I'm going to remake this film sometime.",,Anonymous,Horror
Will the kids EVER stop singing?,"Watch this suspenseful movie and you'll understand exactly what I mean.This movie actually had me edgy after I saw it.  It is one thing to watch birds attack and know why.  It is a whole other thing to watch birds attack and have absolutely no reason.The suspense of this movie makes it exceptional.I found a few things distracting.  The blonde (Melanie) didn't bring any bags with her to Bodega Bay yet for at least three (3) days, her hair was perfect, her makeup was perfect, and her same outfit looked perfect.  She was so perfect that she was distracting.  In fact, even the blondeness of her hair was distracting.Another distracting aspect was the likeness of the mother and Melanie.  I kept thinking they were played by the same person only age makeup was being used.Aside from the distracting aspects of the film, it is very good.",,Anonymous,Horror
Short Story-One Thing; Film-Another.,"Historically, short stories/novels converted into films tend to lack some substance, naturally. While many conversions simply exclude elements of the original writing, The Birds practically disregards the original short story. The short story premise has mystery, suspense, and terror excluding the campy Mitch-Mother-Ms. Daniels triangle. The movie simply misses the valuable factors presented in the short story. For a true feeling of terror and helplessness the short story should have been the premise for the film.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Directorial skill, rather than acting strength.","Hitchcock has taken the fantastical idea from Du Maurier's book and created a film that I judge more on the skill of the director than of the strength of its cast. The portrayal of the birds as vicious, unpredictable, killers is extremely effective and frightening. The cast are methodical, all that is required for this film. Viewers may have a tiny amount of interest in the romantic sub-plot, but what really hooked me was the suspenseful imagery that Hitchcock uses: Crows on climbing frame, or crows on a telegraph line. The ruthless attacks on the children are gripping and shocking, however I would point to the scene that depicts the besiegement of the house from within as the high point of the film: No birds are to be seen but are instead represented by a pulsating crowing reverberating through the house as the desperate situation of its occupants intensifies. A classic piece of film-making.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of Hitchcock's Best,"There are so many wonderful Hitchcock elements within this movie.  The silent scenes in which tension is built and a story told with almost no dialogue or explanatory sounds, the slow building of suspense mixed with misdirection and bewildering amounts of detail in the story, the supporting town characters that are all too real in their attitudes and actions, the then state-of-the-art special effects of the birds themselves, and the excellent point-of-view camera work all add up to a great movie that does not rely just on the gore of the victims to keep the audience engaged.The Birds is best watched and taken at its face value without trying to find symbolism or meaning in what is presented.  I think that is what Hitchcock intended.  The terror is that the birds are attacking for no apparent reason - and no reason is hypothesized in the movie.  It simply is happening.  The characters have to adapt to the situation and try to stay alive.Tippi Hedren's character of Melanie Daniels is all too typical of a type of rich, sophisticated woman of the late fifties and early sixties who lived off of Daddy's money and had no real purpose for her own life.  I knew women like her.The problem with the movie comes from all of the main characters having too much emotional and historical baggage carried with them that for some unknown reason has to be exposed and discussed.  These elements add nothing to the movie and drag down the pace of the story with long scenes of dialogue during which the characters talk about past romances, insecurities, family problems, etc. Hedren's, Tandy's, and  Pleschette's characters all are plagued with so many emotional encumbrances that at times their characters just look silly or pathetic.  Such neurotic-type problems may have been fairly common of movie characters of the sixties, or it may have been Hitchcock planting proverbial red herrings, but it gets annoying at times.  The innuendo about sex in what had to have been an attempt to make the film look more `mature' now looks childish.Ultimately, though, I still place The Birds up there with Psycho and think it remains one of the best suspense/thriller movies ever.",,Anonymous,Horror
Is it really that scary ?,"I have watched Psycho and The Birds, both Hitchcock films, the only two of his I have seen. Comparing this to Psycho, I didn't think ""The Birds"" was that frightening. The only part of the film which had an effect on me was at the end when Melanie is attacked in the room by lots of birds. I'm not saying ""The Birds"" is a poor film, it obviously isn't but it didn't have the moving impact which I expected from a Hitchcock film, especially after viewing Psycho.",,Anonymous,Horror
