"A Nice Sidetrack to the Original, if Occasionally Over-Similar","Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
If it was a standalone it would be great but yeah...,"Right from the start I could easily tell why Finding Dory isn't the most appreciated. It wasn't as brilliantly written as Finding Nemo was and in the opening, it immediately showed your throat with the main plot about Dory's parents and all.I must admit it wasn't a bad film at all. It definitely had a ton of great things going on, it was still enjoyable and I liked some of the new characters introduced. Look if this was a standalone film or if Finding Nemo was around the same quality, my review would have been normal but I just have to compare it with the superior originalWhat happened with the insanely brilliant ways the first was written in? Don't get me wrong, Finding Dory still had some clever ways to get the plot going but it definitely didn't have the Pixar magic for me, I never laughed during this film. One thing to add that severely affected my experience was Dory's short-term memory loss. I know people with it suffer like she does but Dory just experiences it way too many times, in Finding Nemo it was alright because they had some comedy in them plus it was mainly focused on Marlin and Nemo. But as I said I didn't find it funny so each time she would experience her short-term memory loss, I would get frustrated because it genuinely gets on my nerves. If the writers didn't show it into your face that Dory has it, I would have been in a completely different moodBut as I said Finding Dory is still good film, it was entertaining, fun and overall a fun experience but it was lackingRating: 7.0/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Going away,"This is a really good sequel. Taking characters from the first one and putting new ones in there as well, it never gets boring or seems to repetitive. And you don't even have to be Dory, I mean forgetful, for this to work for you. Yes it does make sense to watch the first one (Finding Nemo) then, although I reckon you could watch it and enjoy it as a standalone too.The characters and their traits are strong and there are a lot of side jokes built in to this too. Humans are being treated like extras and we wouldn't have the time to deal with them anyway. That is apart from one major voice - but it's being highlighted too as if one of the writers or Ellen herself might have a crush there. But you can't blame them for that. On the contrary you can congratulate everyone involved for a really good movie",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty good sequel,"A regal blue tang embarks on a journey to find her parents.'Finding Dory' is an enjoyable sequel with some memorable moments.The plot is quite heartwarming as we follow Dory in search of her parents and it is this premise that carries a film with little else to say.As nice as it is to see these characters again, I find it a stretch to stay interested for 97 minutes. There is more of an emphasis on action-oriented visuals than was the case in 'Finding Nemo' and it feels like some of the spectacle is there to pad the movie out. Also Marlin and Nemo seem mostly to be along for the ride this time.That being said there are some standout moments, mostly involving Dory and her parents. There is one spectacular slow motion sequence that is very well done and makes good use of a popular song.Visually, as with most Pixar movies it is very impressive. The character designs and underwater backdrops are as fabulous as the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Why all the hate?,"The story was beautifully executed, it was well paced, the new characters kept the story fresh and the film was somewhat educational. Perhaps not as emotionally charged as the first, but not many sequels can achieve such a high quality level in terms of depth in all its characters and minor details. Only Pixar can make you feel empathetic towards a fish.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A great sequel to the classic of 2003. The essence of Pixar's formula is the balance between humor and emotion, and the film manages to achieve it satisfactorily","The continuations in the Pixar universe have always generated reflections and debates about the creative power of the studio. On the one hand, sequences such as Toy Story 2 (1999) and Toy Story 3 (2010) are praised almost unanimously for maintaining the excellence of the original, on the other, Monsters University (2013) and, mainly, Cars 2 (2011) are seen by many as oscillating points in the production company's acclaimed filmography. For these reasons, and also for the thirteen years between productions, Finding Dory, continuation of the absolute success Finding Nemo (2003), arrives wrapped in a colossal expectation.Now in Finding Dory, she takes center stage for her own story, where this specialty is converted from humor to drama, and the immensity of the ocean is reduced to an oceanarium (more controlled environment) to be proportional to the difficulty of the character's mission. She can remember nothing, but she has flashes of memories with her parents, and now that she knows, she needs to find them. In this sequence of the epoch-making feature, the spectator has the feeling that he is missing the loved ones, such as the goldfish Dory, who is now the main protagonist of the story. Thus, the work is an incredible work of nostalgia, which fills its audience with grace just because it reminds them of such a remarkable universe.Director Andrew Stanton returns, this time alongside Angus MacLane, to lead the plot that takes place a year after the events of the first film. Here the little blue fish Dory, who suffers from a recent memory loss problem, begins to gain insights with fragments of memories of her past alongside her parents. With some clues and a lot of disposition, she sets out on a journey to meet her family again, with the clown fish Marlin and her son Nemo as a company. Along the way, Dory gets lost from his friends, ending up at the California Marine Life Institute. The situation of the previous film is reversed, and now the duo Nemo and Marlin are leaving in search of their demoralized companion.Right in the opening scene, the feature opens up its emotional bias, featuring Dory's first flashback. The design of the young version of the character - with his kind and gigantic eyes - receiving the affection of his parents is the first letter presented by Stanton and MacLane to win over the audience and becomes the joker of the filmmakers, as it is repeated several times throughout the narrative. The repetition, incidentally, is one of the keywords of Finding Dory. Something that makes sense due to the protagonist's condition in relation to her memory, but that also ends up serving as an acceptable pretext for the script to revisit a good part of the elements that contributed to Finding Nemo's success.The new feature bets heavily on the affective memory of the audience and their pleasure in recognizing what is familiar to them, such as the riddle of location / address that serves as a guide for searches in films (formerly ""P. Sherman 42, Wallaby Way, Sydney"", Now ""The Jewel of Monterey, California""). The sequel also strives to make ingenious connections with Dory's past and reveal the origin of some of his trademarks: knowledge in ""whale"" and the motto ""Keep swimming, keep swimming"", for example. Some supporting characters also return in small appearances, such as Uncle Stingray and Crush, the surfing turtle. Beside these well-known figures we have a series of new characters, many serving as comic reliefs, such as the trio of sea lions and the mad bird Becky.Others are more important, such as the dubious Hank octopus, the whale shark with vision problems Destiny and the beluga whale Bailey. Although everyone has their dramatic roles in the story, especially Hank, these characters serve much more as tools to facilitate the actions of the protagonists. The filmmakers seek to explore the real biological peculiarities of animals - the mobility and camouflage capacity of octopuses, the echolocation of belugas 'sonar' - transforming them almost into superpowers, which work well in the busiest scenes, including a grand road chase. But, even though it is an interesting idea and inserted in a fanciful context, its exaggeration often ends up sounding like a simple crutch to sustain the weaknesses of the script.The narrative structure adopted by Stanton and his team, despite being linear, fits flashbacks from Dory's childhood that are triggered by events in the present. Thus, the protagonist's disability and how she deals with her condition end up playing a fundamental role in the progress of the story, in a great view of the filmmakers. Although the central theme of the work is ""the family"", the main lesson here is how to deal with your own limitations. It is not for nothing that a good part of the new characters, like the grouchy octopus Hank (Ed O'Neill), the whale shark Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) or the beluga whale Bailey (Ty Burrell) have physical problems that need to be overcome in the course of of the adventure. The message of resilience is placed in an organic way inside the tape, which never loses sight of the main objective of the protagonist - something quite ironic, considering Dory's peculiar condition.The film makes it very clear throughout the narrative that Dory is unable to do anything because of his short memory. She may find it more difficult to perform some tasks that are simple for other people, but she is much more than a forgotten fish. The impulsiveness, positivity and ability to find solutions in complicated situations of the character work so well that at certain times we can even say that she forgot that that was an impossible task. That's what made her find Nemo together with Marlin and that's what is highlighted in Finding Dory.All this dramatic part is worked in a subtextual way, with the film never neglecting the good agile and accurate gags and jokes that marked the first film. Not that the script is perfect. Some of the subplots are quite predictable and the script suffers trying to find a role for Marlin and Nemo. However, every time the film focuses on the title character, all of that is left out. Dory remains adorable and charismatic, with an almost unshakable optimism and the contrast of his cheerful personality, not only with Hank's traumatic grumpy - who ends up being his main partner for much of the feature - but with his own loss past, makes her a really interesting heroine.Looking for Dory is exactly about longing and this need to find those who make us feel at home, regardless of what happened in the past or how long it has been since we last met. Thus, Finding Dory provides a simple feeling in its viewer, uniting in an exemplary way the feelings of his audience with those of the characters on the scene, a film that comes to be very enchanting because of that. And if Finding Dory expands the universe seen in Nemo, Stanton and his team still demonstrate an enormous creative capacity, both in putting their range of characters in unusual situations, such as the hand pool that is filmed as if it were a natural catastrophe - but in In fact, it is a tank in which the children of the institute can interact with animals - but also in the creation and continuation of their visual identity, often creating sequences with an aesthetic precision that will fill the eyes of any film buff. One is the moment when Nemo, Marlin and Dory are chased by a giant squid; the visual construction of the suspense scene is incredible, showing that Pixar's excellent films go beyond great scripts.As it could not be otherwise, the visual part of the production is impeccable. It is not difficult to recognize the aesthetic richness achieved by the work of the Pixar team: the characters are expressive without having to be excessively anthropomorphized; Marine Institute always brings a pleasant surprise to each new environment; the color palette is rich and intense (it is a pleasure to see how, for example, Dory, Marlin and Nemo change colors appropriately depending on the light - or lack of - that is seen in each place); and the quality of the animation is what we might expect from the studio (note, for example, how the movements of Dory's fins look like anxious beats on the head as she struggles to remember something). More efficient is also the montage: If in Finding Nemo the narrative sounded episodic, relying excessively on fades to jump from one character to another, here these transitions are made in a much more fluid (pardon the pun) and organic way. On the other hand, the excessive reliance on the convenient flashbacks that bring back the heroine's memories when they are most needed is a little disappointing. To top it off, if the animals' actions were relatively plausible in the first feature, however extreme they may be, here the script abandons any attempt to solve the problems with the minimum of verisimilitude - and the climax of the projection, in particular, is too absurd, no fitting the logic established in Nemo.The essence of Pixar's formula is the balance between humor and emotion, and the film manages to achieve it satisfactorily. There are some inspired jokes and puns, the graphic quality of the animation fills the eyes and the drama of loss and the importance of the family has an undeniable appeal. What is missing for Finding Dory is the spark of genius that makes the masterpieces of the studio manage to escape precisely from the facilities previously exposed. Some moments of animation approach this level, such as the emotional climax of Dory or the great sequence in the aquarium of the children's wing of the marine park. But even these scenes do not dazzle the opening minutes of Up (2009) or the culinary critic's scene in Ratatouille (2007), just to mention two examples. Anyway, this probably won't hinder Find Dory's success, because the audience's affection for the universe of Nemo, Marlin and Dory makes them enter the field with the game already won.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Holy Carp!,"I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me. So, going into Finding Dory I had no real expectations.First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.Most importantly though is the story. Dory's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.As an aside, I had avoided seeing this one until I had finally seen Finding Nemo and while I would recommend seeing Nemo, Finding Dory does stand alone as it's own film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply a delightful movie,"I have to admit that I was among many who rolled their eyes when a sequel to Finding Nemo was announced. I really didn't think there was anything else that could be done with that story. WRONG! It was honestly a million times better than I ever could have expected. I definitely loved it more than the original Finding Nemo. Dory was a fan favorite in the original film and the sequel delivers more of Ellen's whimsical portrayal of the forgetful little fish.I am a sucker for backstory (main reason I love the Star Wars prequels) and I absolutely loved the direction they took this film in. Fun for the whole family. Laughs, lessons, tons of heart. Who could ask for more? The voice acting cast was tremendous, particularly Ellen, of course. They really know how to pull you into this undersea world. I really wouldn't have changed anything about it. A truly delightful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming and amusing.,"Everyone's favourite forgetful fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), is back on the big screen a whopping 13 years after joining Marlin (Albert Brooks) on a quest to find his missing clownfish son. This time, however, Dory takes centre stage. Shifting the focus from Nemo to Dory for this belated follow-up is a no-brainer; it allows Pixar to concoct a new ocean-spanning adventure without feeling too repetitive, whilst cleverly bringing the broader plot full-circle by having the child now looking for the parents. Even with the huge gap between movies, there are still obstacles to be circumvented in order to avoid sequelitis. Most of these are handled with the intelligence and elegance we have come to expect from Pixar, though some hurdles prove to be too big. The story goes to very different places from both a narrative and location perspective, but the messages behind the film – don't judge a book by its cover, spontaneity can be liberating, you can do anything if you try hard enough, etc – are all too familiar. With glorious cutting-edge animation, a string of creative sequences and a barrel-full of laughs, there won't be a single audience member, regardless of age, that'll be bored; yet there's also a lack of truly memorable moments that stop this from being a classic like its predecessor. It goes without saying that Dory is the star of the show, although the range of hilarious supporting characters is impressive. Ed O'Neill's cantankerous, camouflaging octopus Hank and Ty Burrell's self-doubting beluga whale Bailey shine brightest. It might not be in the top echelon of Pixar outings, but Finding Dory is a charming, amusing and thoughtful family flick worth visiting the cinema for.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Alarmingly disappointing,"I thought it would be one of the best second part ever made, but to my surprise it turned to be a standard bad second part.Where is the hilarious Dory and the amazingly essential funny characters like the fish tank ones in the first movie. I just found a basic line trying to make a good story. And a boring story trying to not cross the line of disgusting. Characters that have my barely passing grade. But my predictions for this movies were so high that the failure was bigger, just like, I hoped, for all the ones who saw it 13 years ago.See it if you want to know what happens with Dory's family at any cost, but if you just have a low curiosity, just don't see it. I recommend you to see finding Nemo again.Please don't even think to make a third movie in 13 years.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
No walls in the ocean,"I've never been into animation and my comments probably reflect it. Not for any silly quibbles about real cinema versus not, kiddie versus adult; it's simply that the real world that threads itself around us is too marvelous and fantastical, too full of myriad possible worlds to envision, to forego the opportunity. Okay, but this leaves me free to observe these few things here.It really has taken a quantum leap the last decade in trying to replicate our world after that business with dead eyes was over. Is there anything more extraordinary than texture and light falling a certain way? An audience of Disney's time would have been baffled by what kind of reality this film shows.The most fantastical quality of reality is that I can open the door and go wherever. The thinking mind will hold me back nine times out of ten, but the fact that our lives play out against the possibility is behind any life worth being lived. Spontaneity. It lies at the bottom of all the other structures we observe around us and at the bottom of almost every great film I know of.Pixar's main structure in building world - and what sets them apart from previous studios - is finding a small corner of our own world to animate, say toys in the attic, we can then have the delight of secret lives right under our feet. The more ordinary and familiar this corner is, the more often we can imagine passing through it, the better. It's the difference between Toy Story and Cars. It lets them filter in the following way; the larger surrounding human world retains its quality of callous indifference as we think of it ourselves, our gaze is directed to the magical world-within where fragile beings have to struggle with predicaments like ours.The primary thing to note in tandem with this is how the rest has been engineered around spontaneous expression. Pixar are something of a master in how things flow, how walls can be moved around to facilitate experience. It's all about turbulent motion that zig zags over barriers; through ocean streams, a bird flying us overhead, through tubes inside the marine park, hijacking a truck. Things magically work out, even when our heroes don't land in the right place, they do.And you'll see this in the story about a narrator who continuously forgets, has no plan about how she's going to accomplish what she wants other than the urge to find her parents, but makes her way by rubbing against limits of where she finds herself, spontaneously opening ways.",,Anonymous,Animation
Finding a Reason,"""Finding Dory"" has a lot to live up to. ""Finding Nemo"" was a huge hit both financially and critically. It was the number one selling DVD of all time and was nominated 4 Oscars. After 13 years of anticipation ""Finding Dory"" didn't make much of a splash. It did fine at the box office, but went without an Oscar nomination, a rarity given the usual caliber of Pixar films. So, the overall reception was sub-par compared to its predecessor. The question remains, how's the movie? It's sub-par by Pixar standards but in general it's OK.I will be comparing this film to ""Finding Nemo"" quite a bit to help demonstrate my problems with this film. In ""Finding Nemo"" the main focus is divided into two main stories: Nemo's adventure and Marlin's adventure. Both adventures are entertaining and move the story forward. In this film, they likewise break up the team into two separate groups. But this time, one group seems to make no tangible progress, making every time they cut to their story feel like filler. The original film got nominated for best original screenplay partly because of how tightly written it was, no scene seemed unnecessary and no line of dialogue felt wasted. This film feels like it is trying its best to stretch its runtime. Where the first film gives the audience a variety of settings throughout the depths of the ocean, this movie mainly takes place all in one location. It takes place in real life location: ""California's Marine Life Institute"", they spend enough time there it feels like a big budget commercial for the place.In the first film, Dory's ""short term memory loss"" was written off more for laughs than anything else. This film treads in dangerous waters reframing that gimmick as a legitimate mental disability. The movie tackles a lot of themes surrounding mental health. There are some people who could find this offensive, but I feel that the film's heart is in the right place.Sadly, the movie feels forgettable. It follows a lot of the same sequel beats that a Dreamworks sequel would hit. We have a main character, now let's reunite them with their estranged parents. It worked in ""Shrek 2"", ""How to Train your Dragon 2"", ""Madagascar 2"" and ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" why not this film? It's finale also just feels like cheating. Where the first film set up all its final beats seamlessly, this one feels contrived.But I will say that the kids I watched it with absolutely loved it. They laughed a lot throughout the movie. And I will give credit to when it hits its emotional climax, it does really work, it is a very sweet scene. Perhaps I am comparing it too much to a film it will never live up to.It has its faults, but its emotional finale makes it worth a watch. If you are watching and not enjoying it, just keep watching, just keep watching watching watching. There is some joy to be found.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy sequel to a great film,"'Finding Nemo' to me has always been one of Pixar's best, colourful, imaginative, hilarious and poignant with great characters (who cannot love Bruce the shark, plus Dory speaking whale is one of Pixar's funniest moments).Pixar have been hit and miss since 'Up', with some great films like 'Toy Story 3' and 'Inside Out' (which are two of my favourites from the studio) and some disappointments like 'Cars 2' and 'The Good Dinosaur' (don't hate them as much as many others do though, also didn't think 'Brave' was that bad, though it was not the best animated film that year, and liked 'Monsters University'). While it is not as good as 'Finding Nemo', 'Finding Dory' is a worthy sequel and one of their better efforts since 'Up'.The film does meander in places with occasional draggy pacing and a couple of rather too convenient plot devices, and Dory's memory loss shtick does get repetitive quickly that it does grate too early on. However, the animation is wonderful with an even richer colour palette perhaps than 'Finding Nemo' and matches that film in meticulous detail and visual imagination. The music score is rousing, whimsical and nuanced.Where Pixar has always excelled at its best is the balance and execution of humour and pathos. Humour and pathos are balanced deftly in 'Finding Dory', with the humour hilarious and in abundance and the pathos bringing genuine tears and emotional power. The story is flawed and doesn't have the imagination or originality of 'Finding Nemo', but the energy, humour and emotion shine through more than brightly and one does relate to Dory in her quest, one that anybody can relate to if in her situation.Good characters always help and actually are crucial in making a film work. 'Finding Dory' has them, not just Dory, who has lost none of her comic timing but moves the viewer as well, or Marlin and Nemo who bring sweetness and poignancy to the story, but also the scene stealing seals and gleefully entertaining Hank who provides many great moments. One does miss Bruce though. The voice acting is terrific, with Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neill being particularly spot on.To conclude, 'Finding Nemo' is a great film, this reviewer found 'Finding Dory' to be a worthy sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory,"This has been made almost a generation after the first, ""Finding Nemo"", outing for this annoyingly forgetful fish so it's not really fair total it a sequel. It's really a whole new concept that sees ""Dory"" out on a school trip where she gets a bit of rather unpleasant déjà-vu. This brings to mind the incident that led to her separation from her mum and dad. Determined to see if she can track them down, she enlists the help of ""Nemo"" and his dad ""Marlin"" and embarks on a series of fun adventures that introduces us to the engaging septopus ""Hank"" along the way. The story is quite a poignant little one, here. The young fish gradually discovers enough mnemonics to help them all inch towards their goal, and there is enough in the dialogue to satisfy younger audiences - though not so much for the oldies. I am afraid I still find this particular tang fish a bit irritating, but this is still quite an enjoyable and vividly colourful family comedy with messages of loyalty, determination and perseverance featuring strongly but delicately throughout. It gets perilously close to cheesy at times, but is still worth pitching up to a cinema to appreciate on a big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Finding Dory,"The well-known character from Disney's Finding Nemo has now finally gotten her own spotlight. Dory, the funniest fish in the ocean thanks to her voice actress Ellen DeGeneres, is able to take on another adventure. The movie also features all the other past characters that everyone fell in love with from the start. This film is amazing because of how well the voice actors portray the characters, the emotions it brings to the audience, and its animation.The voice actors in Finding Dory do more than an excellent job with making the animated characters come alive. The hilarious Ellen DeGeneres has once again impressed her audience in creating the amazing character that Dory is. While there are many characters that are familiar from Finding Nemo, there are new and unfamiliar ones that are great additions to the movie as well. There are many flashbacks in the film that refer back to Dory as a young girl. This adorable little fish was voice-acted by Sloane Murray, who does an exquisite job of making the audience fall in love with little Dory. Co-stars from the hit TV show Modern Family, Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill make the voices of new characters Bailey and Hank. Aside from Bailey, another whale that is unknown is Destiny, voiced by Kaitlyn Olson. All of these amazing and hilarious voice actors are crucial to making Finding Dory a great film.There are many emotional, happy, and funny moments throughout the entire film that help make it a great story. Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane made sure to always make Dory's disability of short-term memory loss apparent from beginning to end of the movie, which sparks emotion for the audience. Finding Dory is a great especially for the younger audience in the fact that it teaches friendship, teamwork, and that your family is one of the most important things in life. It teaches that just because you have a disability doesn't mean that you can't do anything you set your mind to and you can still achieve many things in life. It also encourages risk- taking and not to be afraid of doing something just because you wouldn't normally do it. Watching this movie gives you the idea to not just sit around and do nothing for the rest of your life and to make the best of it. Reminiscing on Dory's past life makes Finding Dory that much better. Knowing what she had to go through and remembering things to help her through her journey are heart-warming and good life lessons to teach the audience.The animation in this film was indescribable. Its vibrant colors makes the film look very clear. Pixar never disappoints and they do an amazing job with modernizing cartoon's and fictional characters to make them more fun to watch. The beauty of the ocean's creatures and the beautiful colors that they use bring the movie to life moves Pixar to the next level. Even though prior to the sequel in the movie Finding Nemo, which was released in 2003, the characters still look and sound exactly the same. This is something that many movies and television shows lack as time goes on. It brings back the memory of Finding Nemo and the amazing characters that everyone knows and loves but adds in some hilarious ones to the mix that makes this movie different yet unforgettable.All in all, the film Finding Dory is a must-see. It is very hard to find negative things about it and Pixar has exceeded itself once again. It is hard not to fall in love with the beautifully animated characters and the amazing voice-actors that we all love. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"The movie itself was in my opinion disappointing. Maybe it's just me being grown up (which I doubt) but the movie was just lacking so much. Didn't laugh or even smile once throughout the movie. It was just meh i didn't feel like there was any humor in the movie and there wasn't any exciting parts either. After more than 10 years from finding Nemo to this it's just disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying it's not as good as expected. There wasn't any part where i felt danger or where i felt that dory getting lost was actually important at all Music didn't make me feel anything through the whole movie. Animation could've been better as well. Could probably still be a good movie for kids but for people who already watched finding Nemo and who watches lots of movies its just not worth the money",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
More of the same....,"""Finding Dory"" is more of the same...which will no doubt thrill children and audiences of the original, ""Finding Nemo"". But, for folks like me who are NOT big fans of sequels, there also is more of the same.The film is set before, during and mostly after the adventures that Nemo and his father went through in the previous film. Oddly, while Dory has no attention span and not real memory, she inexplicably kinda remembers her early life and goes off in search of her parents. Nemo and Dad go along to help and a bunch of new friends help Dory to achieve her dream.The film is a lazy product...a sequel which is enjoyable but introduces nothing substantially new. There's nothing offensive about it at all but I cannot understand folks being excited about it because the film is mostly by the numbers and takes few chances. Worth seeing if you want to see a CGI film (and the 3D looks nice) and don't mind an incredibly familiar cast.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Animated Film Concering a Difficult Character Study,"30 June 2016. ""Find Dory"" stands out because of the of difficulty of developing a script that focuses primarily on a character who has short-term and long term memory loss. In some ways, like the challenging script of ""50 First Dates"" (2004) where Drew Barrymore plays Lucy Whitmore, a human who also suffers from memory loss, in a live action comedy, the ability to maintain interest and a delicate balance of respect for such characters is definitely not easy to accomplish. Nevertheless in both instances, both comedies accomplish a continuing series of fumbles and ironic come backs that offer both humor and sympathy for their female characters. ""Finding Dory"" offers up some great comic lines, a fast and involving pace with captivating and emotive interest. More involving with its extensive character portrayal more so than the classic ""The Incredibles"" (2004) as a close collection of family members, the audience gets to experience a more personal, intimate voyage much like those found in the animated dog move ""Bolt"" (2008), the lonely sci fi robotic waste collector ""Wall*e (2008), even the live musical drama ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001), the lonely adventure of a woman in ""Wild"" (2014) or the personal blacker demons of ""Black Swan"" (2010).Except for a rather abrupt and not fully developed scene regarding Dory's parents later in the movie which doesn't come across as smoothly, this animated film stands out for its compelling interesting pacing and engaging comedy revolving around a rather peculiar but very likable lead character.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Charming, funny with a great message","Finding Dory is not only a gorgeous-looking animated film, but a really family fun adventure. It's cheeky, funny, cute, naughty, crazy and heart-warming. It is not specially simple or over the top, and settles in a happy medium that will please kids and a adults alike. Although this is a sequel to Finding Nemo, the story feels like a film on its own, and while some of the events and characters in the first film appear also here, Finding Dory would still be a great film even if the first movie had never been made.Finding Dory is not a film about being lost, is a film a about finding who you are and finding home. It sends a message that your family is not always just your natural family, but those who include you in their family, help and love you when you don't have anybody else and you are most vulnerable.The story also sends a very positive message to any kid who has a disability, learning problem, or is just different. Dory has a short memory span, yet that problem makes her take decisions rapidly and be fearless and resolute, lets her evaluate any situation rapidly and make the best of it; Dory needs of other people, but she is so devoted and caring, that anybody wants to help her when she's in need. The analogy for those kids who are different is wonderful -- those things that seem to be a shortcoming and make you different, might end being the source of your greatness, helping you develop great qualities, and make of you an unique lovable individual.No animated movie can pass the adults' test without having great characters and great voices. This is the case here. The characters are varied, funny, have distinct personalities, and the actors lending their voices to them do a great job at infusing them with life and soul. I enjoyed Ellen being Dory. She did a great job at infusing Dory with that charm and soul the character needs. Besides, Ellen's natural voice has those things that are quintessential Dory: naughtiness, innocence, excitement and child-like tones. I found baby Dory absolutely adorable and wonderful. Once Dory becomes an adult and Ellen's voice is more fully there, I couldn't but hear Ellen, not always Dory. I would have liked her voice to be a bit more twinkled or morphed so as to allow Dory to take Ellen over, if you know what I mean.My main criticism to the film is perhaps the fact that the story becomes inorganic when we see an octopus driving a van and a fish reading signs and driving signs. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought that somewhat didn't glue well with the rest of the film.The film comes together with the short film Pipper, which I reviewed elsewhere, and adorable addition to a great combo.Most enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Rollicking Undersea Adventure,"""Finding Nemo"" was a landmark, five-star Pixar film both in terms of visuals and locale (underwater world). ""Finding Dory"" takes that winning formula, tweaks it just a bit, and produces another rollicking (if slightly less groundbreaking) undersea adventure.For a basic plot summary, ""Finding Dory"" focuses on Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the forgetful little blue tang fish. Early on in the film, Dory--now part of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Nemo's (Hayden Rolence) family--remembers that she once had parents of her own, and thus the trio hitch a ride with Crush (Andrew Stanton) for the currents of California. Arriving at a Sea World-esque aquatic park, Dory is helped by a number of newcomers to the franchise, such as Hank the octopus (Ed O'Neil), Destiny the whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and Bailey the Beluga whale (Ty Burrell).Basically, ""Finding Dory"" takes the same basic plot formula (rescue adventure) of ""Finding Nemo"" and just breathes some new life/characters into it. This approach doesn't really break much new ground, but perhaps such a formula doesn't need to be ""messed with"". I was chuckling at many jokes throughout (all the new characters fit in nicely), and found myself mostly caught up in the sense of adventure.Probably the most interesting choice of the entire experience was Disney/Pixar's focus on Dory's ""disability"" (short-term memory loss). For the most part, that is where the emotion of the film comes from...seeing Dory overcome her weaknesses and even turn them into strengths. Whereas in the first film Dory was pretty much played as just the comic relief, this time her personal struggles comprise the main narrative structure of the entire flick.Why not the full five stars? Simply put: because Toy Story 2 was better than Toy Story. Somehow, someway, Disney/Pixar managed to have that sequel transcend its spectacular original, and that didn't necessarily happen here. My final star ranking would be 4.5/5.0, if able.Overall, though, I very much enjoyed the experience of watching ""Finding Dory"". It's an amazing experience to look around the theater and see people of all ages enjoying the same film. I give Disney/Pixar a lot of credit for that. If you were swept away by ""Finding Nemo"", you'll get the same kind of adventure/comedy in ""Finding Dory"".",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adventure under the water continues.....,"Those who loved ""Finding Nemo"" will anticipate some adventures under the water, which ""Finding Dory"" caters. Just like the previous film, which has gained a cult status, the animation and sequences are pretty marvelous. I guess it would be much more a lavish experience if you watch it on a big screen. It takes you to the world inside the water under the seas, pipes, aquariums, and buckets. Through the superb animation and a fast pace, it holds you and entertains you for its entire length. Though there is a lot of happenings in the film, it is not an improvement over ""Finding Nemo,"" in terms of story or characters. Dory lacks the charm spelled by Nemo; and it kinda drops to unbelievable clichés in the end. In comparison, ""Finding Nemo"" is still preferable.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great family movie but not a worthy sequel!!,"Before I was going to see this movie I re- watched Finding Nemo. And I still liked it. It was overwhelming and charming and even scary sometimes. They took a lot of years to make Finding Dory so I've had high expectations.But when I was watching the movie I was bored. Yes, it was funny, it was HILARIOUS! But, that's all. It was a kids movie, not even scary for a second. I was really disappointed about that.The plot was good! In Finding Nemo the story was about a parent searching for his child and now it was about a child searching for his parents, and herself eventually.It's the perfect movie for a family but not a worthy sequel of Finding Nemo.

A Fun Pixar Sequel,"Finding Dory is the long awaited sequel and takes place a year after the amazing Finding Nemo. This time, Dory is the protagonist and she's pretty enjoyable to watch. The story follows Dory trying to find her estranged family and parents with the help of a ton of new characters like Hank the octopus and 2 whales named Destiny and Bailey.This movie is a ton of fun and extremely funny throughout. The humor is funny for both adults and kids. The new characters bring a fresh breath of air to this franchise. However, the story really has no reason for including Marlin and Nemo for as long as they were in the film. They were both pretty much following Dory on her adventures the entire time. Also, the pacing and tone aren't grounded at all and it constantly switches between humor and serious drama. My last criticism is that the movie is not as emotional as it wants to be when watching it. The movie wants you to shed a tear but because of the inconsistent tone, you can't. Nonetheless, this is a fun sequel to Finding Nemo with a solid story, fun characters, and great humor.Overall, Finding Dory is an enjoyable film for adults and kids to watch and it has a lot of great things in it. I don't think it's even close to as good as its predecessor but it is a generally entertaining movie.Finding Dory gets a B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Film Works Swimmingly Well,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fish-out-of-water tale that celebrates family, friendship, and disabilities.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Little Dory goes on a search for her parents and overcomes many hardships along her journey.The search is on yet again in Disney / Pixar's sequel to its 2003 hit, Finding Nemo. Only this time it's not Marlin hunting for his son, but his lovable and forgetful sidekick on the road to find out. Things go swimmingly in this latest chapter. Finding Dory takes the same initial premise and repackages it into a family-friendly always entertaining computer-generated fantasy.￼The same love and care is on display in this finely crafted animated feature as before. The sequel may not be as original as its predecessor, (it isn't), but it is still packed with enough emotion, insightful dialog, and visual awe. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, Finding Dory finds the right course in telling its tale of a little fish with short term memory loss overcoming the odds in search for her family.￼Visually, the film remarkably creates its under the sea universe. The reflections, rich color palette, and lighting effects are rendered with expert details. There is so much to take in with the background photo realism, plus the character animation has subtle textures and expressions that provide an inner story to each character.￼Yet, the deeper message in this children's film is its celebration of disabilities. Weaknesses become strengths in overcoming adversity and we moviegoers cheer our characters onward. Their quest eventually takes them to a marine research institute and, once the trio hits dry land, the sense of underwater wonder dries up a bit too. At this point, the script loses its way and starts to take an all too familiar route, introducing new adorable characters (and possible tie-ins at toy stores), leading to another zany far-fetched climactic chase scene and eventual reunion. Still, the predictability of the formula works yet again and tugs at our emotional core.￼Behind the microphones are a talented cast of celebrities voicing these lovable characters. Taking center stage is Ellen DeGeneres' Dory. The comedian gives her character a wonderful sweetness and breathless wonderment as Dory encounters new experiences along the way...but then, everything is new to our absent-minded heroine. Albert Brooks returns again as Marlin, and Hayden Rolence takes over as Dory's sidekick, Nemo, and they make a delightful tag team. Providing vocal support are Idris Elba, Dominic West, Ty Burrell, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, with Ed O'Neill stealing every scene as crotchety Hank, the seven-armed camouflaged octopus.Not in the same league as the aforementioned 2003 film, Finding Dory essentially tells a familiar (and overly cute) story, although it relies a bit too much on its original source. The film still visually enchants and allows the moviegoer to sit back and enjoy the humorous adventure as one little fish conquers its own disability to find inner strength and happiness. Perfect family fare and beguiling in its under-the-sea eye-popping technicolor beauty, Finding Dory is not a top-tiered Disney / Pixar classic, in the lines of Toy Story, Up, or Ratatouille, but it is a very fine addition to the studio's cinematic resume.NOTE: Showing with this film is an animated short called Piper. The film is charming and a shoo-in as an Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Short Film. Wordless and gorgeous in its splendid details and textures, the film tells a story of a little sandpiper gaining courage against the forces of nature. Delightful.￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, But Far From Pixar's Best","The friendly but forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.I suspect what you get out of ""Finding Dory"" depends on what you put into it. I went in knowing nothing and still came away disappointed. While the movie has plenty of funny parts, and the animation is amazing, it doesn't seem all that memorable or like they really covered new ground from the first film.And it is not just because it is a sequel. Some would argue that ""Toy Story 3"" was the best in that series. I doubt anyone could argue that ""Dory"" was anywhere near as good as ""Nemo"". If it weren't for some interesting new supporting character, it would have been quite a rehash. Dory, the protagonist, is not really all that interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
There's something in the water at Pixar!,"There must be something in the water at Pixar! After their 2003 triumph Finding Nemo, Pixar continued the famous aquatic trios' adventure in the sequel, Finding Dory. Pixar uses their ability to create realistic animation mixed with the voices of many famous actors to hold their spot at the top of the cartoon universe. In this similar but different sequel, Nemo's heroine Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fun, lovable, but often forgetful fish has an adventure of her own. Dory suffers from short-term memory loss, but she starts to have short flashbacks of where she came from. As she ventures to find her family, Dory is joined by Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence) and Pixar's newest eight-legged hero, an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neil) who helps her in many tight spots along the journey. She is also reunited and helped by some of her old childhood friends along the way. As far as sequels go, the plot to Finding Dory is far too similar to Finding Nemo. Pixar follows almost the exact plot line, except for parents looking for their child, it is a child looking for their parents. There is no creativity in the plot set up for this movie, however the similarity is not a disappointment. It allows for Pixar to up the ante when it comes to the new animation technology, the script, and the actors, and they did just that. With the advancement in technology, and the ability to create animation increases in movies, adds to the wonder of this movie. Compared to the 2003 movie Finding Nemo, this film has many more intricate details regarding the animation. The primary background of the ocean water flows extremely fluidly. Also, way the fish maneuver throughout the water is remarkably life-like, one might think they are swimming with the fish. Not to mention the ray of colors within this film are as vibrant as ever. Pixar deserves an A+ with this one! Besides the amazing animation, the cast line up for this movie is also absolutely incredible. Day time talk show host and comedian, Ellen DeGeneres is flawless as Dory, while the hilarious Ed O'Neal and Ty Burrell (stars of ABC's Modern Family) are along with her throughout the adventure. Not to mention countless of other familiar voices such as: Kaitlin Olson, Albert Brooks, and Diane Keaton, help add to the light heartedness of the movie. The cast chosen for this movie are high quality actors as they add many raw emotions throughout movie, giving it the ability to appeal to the emotions of people of all ages.If you are looking for a movie to watch alone, with friends, or even with family you can't go wrong with Finding Dory. If you missed the showings while it was in theaters do not worry as it is now out on DVD, and as of February 2017 it is up on Netflix making it accessible for everyone to watch and enjoy the ""tale"" of the fun, lovable, but forgetful fish, Dory.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as it should have been.,"Finding Nemo was ground breaking. Not only was it considered one of the best animated films ever made, but it was universally loved by kids and adults alike. For years people begged and begged for a sequel, and now, here it is. Finding Dory. *sigh* I want to be able to tell you that this move hit the high expectation I held for it. I want to be able to tell you that this is a worthy successor to Finding Nemo, but it just isn't. What Finding Dory is, is an over-hyped mess. Granted, there are some pretty funny moments, and Ellen As Dory holds her own as the main actor of the film. But it really feels like Pixar didn't really care about making a good movie. I feel like, because this was such a long awaited film, Pixar knew whatever the outcome of the film, they were still going to make the cash. And at the end of the day, that's what it's really about. The characters are fine, and decently voiced. The story is okay, but drags after a while. the animation is definitely one of the better aspects of the film, but to wrap this up, overall Finding Dory is an average family film. It doesn't carry any of the magic that the first film had. There is nothing here to make me recommend this film, and I'm sad that this movie is getting such high praise when it truly isn't that great of a film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Better than you'd think, good sequel.","This is surprisingly much better than I remember. The last time I watched this was in a 6th grade classroom with a bunch of friends, and we made fun of this movie relentlessly (the girls all got pissed). Now that I had a chance to actually WATCH it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Obviously, it's not one of Pixar's best, but it's very solid. There's a lot of fun to be had here, there are some awesome scenes that are really funny and make you feel various emotions. However, Finding Nemo will forever be superior to this. It just doesn't have the same magic. In the end though, I think this was a success from Pixar.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disappointed,"I watched this movie with very high hopes. I was a kid when Finding Nemo came out and it defined kids movies at the time. Finding Dory was significantly less impressive. The good: The move was very cute and the characters were fun. Ed O'Neill as a cranky octopus was especially nice.The bad: The whole movie feels as if Pixar was pressed to come out with a solid movie and just threw this one together really fast. It felt very rushed and therefore the story line, which had a little potential, was hard to really get into and appreciate. 3/4 of the way through, though it felt rushed, the movie became very redundant and predictable. I was pretty over it personally and could have stopped the movie then and been a happy camper.One of Pixar's lazier films and it's disappointing considering the astounding work they have done before it. If you want to enjoy a movie like this, just watch Finding Nemo instead. If you want to see the sequel to they aforementioned and terrific film, your imagination of how the movie should play out is probably better than the real thing.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
I don't think it's as good a film as the original; or nearly as great as the best of Pixar.,"'FINDING DORY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the blockbuster Pixar hit 'FINDING NEMO'. It once again stars the voice talents of Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks. It was directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane; and it was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson and Victoria Strouse (Stanton also co-directed and co-wrote the original movie). The story, this time, revolves around the amnesiac Dory, as she goes on a quest to find her parents. I don't think it's as good a film as the original; or nearly as great as the best of Pixar.The film picks up shortly after the events of the original movie. Nemo (Hayden Rolence) is now safely, and happily, living with his father, Marlin (Brooks). Dory (DeGeneres) still lives with them as well, but she also still longs to reunite with her parents. After a sudden flashback, Dory decides to go on a quest to find them. Nemo and Marlin go with her.I think it's a little odd for the filmmakers to have made a sequel, to 'FINDING NEMO', that has such a little amount of Nemo in it. He's also voiced by a different actor (due to the fact that the original actor matured so much). Dory is an interesting, and entertaining, character though; and DeGeneres is the biggest star, of the original movie, to market the film as your lead with. So I understand Disney's (and Pixar's) financial motives. Even with these doubts, I still had high hopes. I was sadly disappointed. It is still a visually stunning, and funny, film though. But the story (and adventure of it) didn't intrigue me that much. I also was expecting a lot more heart.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_3w7EWxV5vg",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

She makes friends along the way and inspires them too.This may be the most gorgeous animated movie ever and though Encanto is equal to it in all ways.Finding Dory is an underrated gem .

"A Slight Let Down, But Good As A Whole","Finding Dory is directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane and is Pixar's latest sequel, following up to 2003's Finding Nemo. In this film, Dory begins to envision flashbacks of her childhood, including her parents and activities she would do with them. She remembers where she used to live, and, along with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (Hayden Rolence), swim across the ocean once again to find her long lost family.After 13 years of waiting, I was pretty pumped for Finding Dory, despite the underwhelming trailers. However, from the trailers, there were a few things to look forward to, such as the, once again, amazing voice acting, bright, vivid animation, and intriguing quest to find Dory's parents. Although I enjoyed the film, I couldn't help leaving the theater somewhat disappointed. There were more than a few elements that I felt could've been done better, despite the film being good as a whole.The best thing about Finding Dory has got to be the voice acting, specifically the lines delivered by the voice of Dory herself - Ellen DeGeneres. If anyone were to ask me what I would consider as a perfect blend between voice actor and character, I wouldn't hesitate to give them my answer, that being Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, from both Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016). DeGeneres brings a hilariousness, as well as a sincerity, to the character of Dory, completely bringing this character to life.Most of the other voice acting was pretty great too. Albert Brooks reprises his role of Marlin, the clown fish, and Hayden Rolence has taken over as Nemo on behalf of Alexander Gould, whose voice has changed since his turn as the character in '03. The film introduces a few new characters as well, such as Destiny, the near- sighted whale, voiced by Kaitlin Olson, and the beluga whale named Bailey, who can't echolocate due to a past injury, voiced by Ty Burrell. However, my favorite of all the supporting characters was that of the octopus escapee named Hank, voiced by Ed O'Neill, whose hidden care for Dory and her ultimate goals was expressed greatly through his brilliant character arc throughout the entire run time of the film.The animation - need I say - is produced by Pixar, therefore it looks incredible. Each and every fish (that matters) pops out on the screen exactly as the animators want them to. Each time the audience is supposed to see something important, we see it, thanks to the fantastic animation team working on Finding Dory. All of the colors magnificently stand out from the overall bland backgrounds, and make the film look astounding.My main complaint with the film is the pacing of timed events. Every once in awhile, the film finds itself standing still for a good few minutes, before it begins to pick up again. These stuck-in-the-mud moments are usually supposed to be emotional ones, which, I oddly didn't connect with too much, which is strange to say about a Pixar film (without ""Cars"" in the title, at least). The pacing wasn't the greatest, and seemed to drag the film down a bit, which was disappointing.Another problem I found in Finding Dory was the elements it took from its predecessor, that being Finding Nemo (2003). Much like the 2010 film Toy Story 3, many elements depend on the nostalgia of the viewer. Being a child when Finding Nemo came out, I should've been struck with nostalgia when watching Finding Dory. However, I decided to take off my nostalgia goggles for this one, and was surprised by how much the film relies on the nostalgia of the audience. Although it isn't a huge issue, the similarities between this plot and Finding Nemo's stood out quite a bit.The last complaint I have with the film, which is a small one, is the lack of characters from the first film showing up in this one. We get to see a bit of Crush (Andrew Stanton) and his son Squirt (Bennett Dammann), Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), and a glimpse of Gill (Willem Dafoe) and his friends, but no other original characters show up in Finding Dory. Personally, I would've liked to see Bruce and his shark friends, more of Gill, and even a bit more of Crush; his appearance was more of a cameo. The film spent too much time developing a multitude of new characters that it forgot to include the older ones, it seems.Overall, I did enjoy Finding Dory, it just wasn't as good as Finding Nemo, which is one of Pixar's best. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first film, because you will appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Did We Really Need A Sequel To Finding Nemo? No. Am I Glad That It Exists? Yes.,"Finding Nemo was love at first sight. It was a breathtaking, bewitching & beautifully balanced underwater adventure that didn't just dazzle viewers around the globe with its emotionally rich tale about parenting, friendship, trust & determination but also cemented Pixar's position as a pioneer of quality cinema and a powerhouse of originality, creativity, imagination & groundbreaking computer animation. Add to that, it is still counted amongst the greatest achievements of animation filmmaking.In all honesty, I never wanted a sequel to Finding Nemo. That classic is perfect in every way, and I believed its sequel to be an unnecessary risk that would end up denting the legacy of the original. And yet, a part of me is pleased that it exists because Andrew Stanton has crafted this follow-up chapter with same passion, heart & dedication with which he crafted the first one. By all means, Finding Dory is no match to the original but then it also is no cash-grab sequel like Cars 2 was. There's a sense of déjà-vu in this tale but it also brims with just enough freshness to qualify as a welcome successor to a beloved masterpiece.Set one year after the events of the first film, the story of Finding Dory follows Dory, the regal blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss who starts having fragmented dreams & flashbacks of her life before she met Marlin & Nemo, and ultimately decides to find her family. Heading to the place where she vaguely remembers having seen her parents last, Dory is caught by volunteers of a Marine Life Institute and is put into the quarantine section where she meets a seven-legged red octopus named Hank, who agrees to take her to her loved ones in exchange for something. Meanwhile, Marlin & Nemo try to get into the institute in an attempt to rescue Dory.Co-written & directed by Andrew Stanton (best known for Finding Nemo & WALLE), Finding Dory opens with a flashback segment that introduces us to our titular character as an infant, covers her separation from her family, and then follows her journey over the years until she finally meets Marlin for the first time. And this opening sequence wonderfully sets the stage for the rest of the picture as Stanton sensibly addresses the themes of family, separation & identity, returns to Dory's childhood whenever possible, and although it results in some sort of fractured narrative, it also influences the next set of events that unfold afterwards, thus working in favour of the story.The screenplay is brilliantly penned down as well, for it retains the heart, soul & wit of the original, while adding more emotional weight & depth to our forgetful fish. While it is more melancholic than its predecessor, that element isn't overused and the story remains a fun-filled entertainer throughout its runtime. The oceanic life is revisited only briefly since majority of its plot unfolds in a marine institute, and yet the fauna beneath the sea is gorgeously rendered & meticulously detailed. It also adds an ample amount of new characters with Dory promoted to lead role while both Marlin & Nemo settle for a seat behind a couple of fresh arrivals amongst whom Hank leaves a lasting impression.Jaw-dropping 3D animation has always been Pixar's default setting from the start and this aspect remains unchanged with Finding Dory as the animators have done a terrific job once again, whether it's the underwater backgrounds, character designs or overall rendering of even the most minute details. Camera is splendidly utilised, images make use of all the vivid colours available in the palette, while pixel-perfect lighting gives it a more vibrant appearance. Editing skilfully interweaves Dory's past & present into an easily accessible storyline although the trimming of a few slow patches in the middle would have resulted in a more rigid narrative structure as well as improved pacing.As always the case with Pixar films, the voice cast for new characters is wisely chosen while the reprising cast exhibits no trouble in immersing themselves into their given roles. Ellen DeGeneres was easily the standout in Finding Nemo and she is easily the standout in Finding Dory, for her character gets to play with deeper emotions this time without discarding her good-hearted, optimistic & delightfully charming persona. Rest of the supporting characters, both reprising & new play their part convincingly, And last but not the least, Thomas Newman contributes with a calm, touching & emotionally resonant score that stays within the realm of the original.On an overall scale, Finding Dory is undoubtedly an accomplished sequel despite falling short of matching the greatness of its predecessor. Stanton's decision to go for a fresh & organic storyline instead of rehashing the same stuff is commendable and although not every attempt at humour works out in its favour, it remains a joyful ride from start to finish that will amuse both kids & adults alike. Did we really need a sequel to Finding Nemo? No. Is its existence justified? Somewhat. Am I glad that it exists? Yes. It doesn't take away anything from the original but it strengthens Pixar's position by a great deal, while simultaneously conveying to us that it is still capable of churning out sequels that are more than mere cash-grabs. Nostalgic, poignant & hilarious in rhythmic doses, Finding Dory marks yet another win for Pixar Animation Studios on critical, commercial & emotional scale. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation

Why Pixar??,"Well it's been thirteen years but we finally have the movie that no one asked for, 'Finding Dory'. Following the huge success of 'Finding Nemo' it's hard to imagine that this film wasn't going to happen. Even if we all got down and begged Pixar not to, they still probably would have made this movie. So this time around, Dory is our main character. Yes, Pixar has completely made up a story to give to the side character that everyone loved so much. With in the first ten minutes Dory magically remembers that she has a family and goes on the hunt for them. Sound like the first the film? Well it is.It's exactly like the first one. Only the difference is that this one is really stupid. 'Finding Nemo' happened because Nemo was taken away from his father. Him and his father were the only survivors after some fished killed their whole family. So it made sense that Nemos dad would trek across the whole ocean to find him.The problem here is that you don't really care about what is going on at all. The story the film builds around it's characters is absolute nonsense. You mean to tell me that in the entire year that Dory was living with these guys no one bothered to ask her about her family? And that all those phrases that triggered her memory she was hearing for the first time in her life?I don't think so Pixar. As I watched this film it was apparent that this film was farted into existence. The film makers clearly just used this characters handicap to make up a pointless story. I mean they seriously could not think of any better way to tell the story then to just have her flash back like one hundred times?Not only is this incredibly lazy but it made the whole movie feel incredibly convenient. The films story is only taking place because of something that was completely random and ridiculous. Not only that, but they seriously could not have come up with anything better than just rehashing the same story? It's exactly the same story as the first just, the characters are playing slightly different roles.How on earth do the film makers think that one can be invested in this film if the first one was not only the same, but better? The first had real, relatable emotions and experiences going on. It was easy to connect with the characters and sympathize with their voyage. But this film doesn't do any of that. It just expects you to be blinded by nostalgia and love everything that is happening simply because you remember those characters.Which it does nothing new with either. There was really only one new character in the whole film that had any kind of personality. Aside from that every new thing we are introduced to is only just as a plot device. Other than that, their main purpose was to be comedy relief. Which was mainly pointed at making fun of other handicapped animals. If this film isn't subtly telling your children that you should make fun of handicapped people I don't know what is.While I certainly did not enjoy this film it isn't without its few saving graces. For starters, the voice acting is once again great. Ellen as Dory is closest thing to perfect casting I have seen. Her and the other actors involved really seemed to commit to their performances. And while the story as a whole isn't good there are a couple of great scenes in there.The scene in the kid zone is particular great. Seeing how these fish view these kids poking them and grabbing them is pretty ingenious. As a whole it is also very well paced. There was very few dull moments here. That being said, this film should not have happened. Not only is it a symbol of how far Pixar has fallen but how much they actually care about their audience. No longer do they desire to make quality pictures, no, it's all about the money now. This is very apparent thanks to how little thought was put into this movie. If you have kids, they might enjoy it. But if not, this one really is not worth your time.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good But A Real Step Down from the Original,"Finding Dory (2016)*** (out of 4)Delightful sequel to FINDING NEMO has Dory remembering her childhood and the fact that she got lost from her parents. With the help of Marlin and Nemo she sets out to find them.FINDING DORY isn't nearly as good as the first film but there are certainly enough cute moments to make it worth sitting through. I'm sure kids will be blown away and enjoy every minute but the adults might be feeling some deja va as we've basically got the same story as the first one and not nearly as many memorable characters. In fact, I'd say the weakest thing about this film is the story, which is just basically a rehash of the first and the adventure from start to finish isn't nearly as good.With that being said, there's no doubt that Pixar has delivered another winner as once again a lot of credit has to go to the animators. It's really amazing to see how far the animation has grown since TOY STORY and it looks even more marvelous here. The graphics in the animation are just amazing to look at and the scenes in the ocean at the start really make you feel as if you're right there splashing around.More credit has to go to the vocal talent as well as Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Hayden Rolence are all very good as Dory, Marlin and Nemo. You've also got a nice turn by Ed O'Neill as Hank and Diane Keaton as Jenny. There are some nice comic moments involving the sea lions but I must admit that I thought the film lost some steam once we hit the Marine Life Institute. Some of the adventure is lost here and it just can't compete with that in the original movie.",,Anonymous,Animation

It's visually stunning, with PIxar pushing the limits of animation continuously.

A good one time watch. Very endearing plot.,"Finding Dory (2016)My rating : 7/10Dory is a blue fish who suffers from short term memory loss. She gets lost from her parents as a kid. She wanders far and wide and grows up into an adorable fish. She makes friends with Marlyn and his son Nemo as we see in part 1 (Finding Nemo) of the franchise. In continuation to that, in this movie, Dory goes out in search of her parents and gets lost from her friends in the process. So while Dory is searching for her parents with the help of an octopus, a cute short sighted whale and a baluga fish, Marlyn and Nemo search for Dory and her parents. They all unite marvelously at the end and it all ends on a note of hope, love, warmth and peace. :) Even a forgetful fish like Dory could achieve anything she sets her mind to with a little help from Destiny. :)But I think the Finding Nemo was a better picture in comparison and it has become one of the benchmarks for good animation movies. Still, this is Dorys show and she is absolutely lovely n special!!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Our 5-year old loves it, but it's no Finding Nemo for the rest of us","We've watched this film 10 times because our 5-year old really enjoys it. There are a few too many slow and silly times that make it not nearly the quality of the great Finding Nemo, but it carries a lot of the charm with it somehow 13 years after the original. There are times where I feel this film falls on some weak and simple plot movements--but that is why it likely fared poorly during awards season. This is a good film, Nemo was a great film. Better than most kids films, but a bit of a messy direction.",,Anonymous,Animation
Quite possibly the best Pixar sequel ever ( just hear me out ),"Hold on, my fellow film fanatics, critics and viewers. I've heard all of the bad reviews of this film. I am not oblivious to the fact this is a big budget Hollywood animation sequel, and I know that when some of you hear the word sequel, big budget, or even Hollywood, you automatically dismiss it as a trashy entertainment cash grab. But Finding Dory is more than a cash grabbing Hollywood sequel. It is the passing of the torch between generations. The older generations gift to the young generation, a chance for the young to experience the laughter, emotion and nostalgia of Pixar, and in particular, these characters of the finding Nemo universe.Is it better then Finding Nemo? Of course not. It's an unwritten law that the sequel can't be better. But is it unnecessary( as some of my fellow reviewers claim)? Well, it is just as unnecessary as Finding Nemo, or any other film for that matter of fact. In other words, it's not. When I was walking home from the cinema, I too questioned the necessity of this film. I thought for a while and came to the conclusion that this film does what any film does ( and what most sequels don't do). It tells a story, it grips us with adventure,comedy and emotion, it expands the characters and adds new lovable ones. What is unnecessary about that? Isn't that why we got to the cinema- to be entertained and to be moved?One reason why I believe this film has received negative reception amongst the older generation( I am too aware that there are many lovers of this film too, maybe more so than haters) is that they thought this film was made just for them. They thought that this will be the nostalgic hit made specifically for them. But that is not what films ( and especially Hollywood and animated films) do. They speak to everyone from everywhere. They communicate messages and emotions that all ages from all countries can understand ( provided that the correct subtitles are in place!) I saw posts on Facebook saying ""Parents: please don't take your kids to this film. I want to enjoy it. They won't understand the meaning of it!"" And I agreed to this, especially when I was sitting in a cinema half full of 18-25 years old and the other half full of little kids. But it wasn't until I heard the laughter of the children during the film and the smiles on their faces afterwards that I truly understood the purpose of this film. It was Pixars way of allowing the young people of this generation to enjoy what the last generation of young people enjoyed. And that's the magic of a Pixar film, and as I said before, it was a way of connecting the generations to help both generations understand each other's love for this ""universe"". To understand and feel the magic, laughter and hopefully, one day a shared nostalgia and love for this great animation company and its characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The opposite of boring.,"Surprisingly enough, Finding Dory managed to impress me even more than Finding Nemo did many years ago. It's palpable that the high-quality Pixar always delivers is still present in strong form. Finding Dory tells its story in an imaginative way, filled with clues and flashbacks that help Dory decipher her own origins. It's a type of wild adventure that only animated pictures can offer that is truly satisfying to watch, it's a thrilling ride so fantastically translated to the screen, the animation is precious. The newly added character, the octopus (well, septipus) Hank is nothing short of incredible. First off, it was greatly voiced by Ed O'Neill and his octopus mobility was perfectly captured, I was tremendously impressed every time Hank was moving around like a ninja or a trapeze artist with such effortlessness that it was engrossing to watch.The film itself is highly entertaining, it does not bore nor tire at any particular moment, it is carried by a strong visual narrative that manages to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. The visuals go along really well with the story of Nemo and Marlin trying to find Dory, and Dory trying to find her parents.The scene standout for me is without a doubt the truck scene where it falls to the river, freeing the fish. That is simply a stunning and inspiring scene, done so cleverly that is no surprising that it came from the masters at Pixar.Check out this wonderful sequel to a Pixar classic, you may even like it a bit more, or maybe not, depends on you. But rest assure that you will have a great time with this fine animated film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Had me in tears,"Finding Dory had me in tears, and not just me, but several others in the theatres as well. Dory is a character that steals your heart without meaning to. In the first Finding Nemo, she is purely comic relief, but in Finding Dory, you really get to know her story. From her innocent upbringing with her family, to her separation from them, and her persistence in finding them. Dory isn't perfect, yes she is extremely naive, yes she is happy go lucky, and as one other reviewer describes, ""bumbles along,"" but she faces fears and anxiety just like everyone else. Does she like her predicament? No. Does it frustrate her? Yes. You see this time and time again in the movie.But there is hope, and this is where the tearjerkers happen. Despite all the struggle, there is hope. Dory has friends, and somewhere out there she has family. It's a fun adventure from beginning to end, and it's fun for all ages. You also don't necessarily need to see Finding Nemo first to watch Finding Dory, although it does help, as there are some references to the first movie and some plot holes from the first movie that get filled in this one.Loved Finding Dory. One of my all time favourite Disney films. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finding Dory has some stellar, heartfelt moments, but it's not as interesting as Finding Nemo.","""Finding Dory"" has some stellar, heartfelt moments. I don't think the story is as interesting as Finding Nemo, but the movie is still great.Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movies ever, and I never thought it needed a sequel. After watching Finding Dory, I still don't think it needs to exist.The beginning of the story is an easy example. The first several scenes of the movie re-live some of the major and minor moments of Finding Nemo. Every one of those scenes I like better in their Finding Nemo versions. The story gets more interesting after these initial boring scenes, and I thankfully had a huge investment in the story over the course of the film.I liked the characters of this movie and didn't have a problem with them. But a friend reminded me of the profound impact the minor characters of Finding Nemo have on the story, themes, and humor. The characters in this movie are great, but against the unforgettable cast of Finding Nemo, they can't compete. So many scenes in Finding Nemo are brief, yet set up important lessons that drive home the theme of the movie. After watching Finding Dory once (not enough to give a final judgment), I can't say the same.Crush the sea turtle and Nigel the pelican in Finding Nemo are better than their closest competitors in Finding Dory. Same for the major characters like the tank fish in Finding Nemo.The visual beauty didn't seem to be there. In Finding Nemo the first instrumental on the soundtrack is called ""Wow"". There's hardly any Wow in Finding Dory. The story doesn't facilitate much beauty with the locations it's set in. Part of this is my bias. Early on, some fish are in a kelp forest. I prefer a colorful coral reef instead of a dark green kelp forest submerged in dark green water.Maybe awesome visuals don't need to be in this movie. Finding Nemo still exists, and Pixar just made The Good Dinosaur. But what should fill in that gap is still lacking. Story, characters, theme, etc..",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's cute fluff - Nothing more; nothing less,"'FINDING DORY' was directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neil. ​Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is a wide-eyed, blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss every 10 seconds or so. The one thing she can remember is that she somehow became separated from her parents as a child. With help from her friends Nemo and Marlin, Dory embarks on an epic adventure to find them. Her journey brings her to the Marine Life Institute, a conservatory that houses diverse ocean species. Dory now knows that her family reunion will only happen if she can save mom and dad from captivity.This movie will satisfy children and adults alike for its run time. If you hunger for something more than basic satisfaction from an animated feature, however, I cannot say I recommend it. Good voice acting, stunning animation and lovable characters are all things that this movie succeeds at while the humour and emotional payoff both lack substantially.One thing I will award credit for, however, is that they don't completely copy the plot of 'Finding Nemo' and actually attempt to change things up. That said, I didn't find the plot for this film that interesting or exciting. An instant thing I noticed that differs from 'Finding Nemo' to 'Finding Dory' is the claustrophobia of it. In the original, we had a wide, amazing ocean to explore and meet colourful characters. In here we meet colourful characters but the enclosed space we're limited to negates from the sense of wonder and amazement found in the original.Something that they improved in this movie, for me, was the climax. I hated the original's climax so I am glad they opted for a more inventive and interesting(to say the least) conclusion.Ellen DeGeneres was, of course, great as the titular character 'Dory' and continues her hot streak of playing the character to perfection. Part of the fun with Dory's character when she was introduced was her short term memory loss. That is what made her an inventive and unique character. That is why it was frustrating for me that they turned a key CHARACTER trait of hers into a nothing more than a meaningless plot device that only happened whenever the plot demanded it. I am not an avid supporter of the majority of changes between the two movies but this one takes the cake for me, as far as how unnecessary and annoying it was.Albert Brooks reprises his under-appreciated role as Marlin and still delivers a strong performance to a character that didn't need to be in the movie. Other than to bloat the film's run time with a Marlin/Nemo(who they recast by the way and I guarantee you did not notice) subplot that feels unnecessary and like just a way to pad run time. Pixar - you are above run time bloating!Ed O'Neil debuts the character of Hank and does a great job at it. I loved the character of Hanks and, to be honest, if this movie existed just to set up 'Finding Hank', I would be totally on board for that. Katie Olson also debuts another character, in the form of a blind whale called 'Destiny'. The performance is perfectly passable but the character is so weak and dull. Pixar try to catch lightning in a bottle twice by giving Destiny a 'craaaazy quirk' in the hilarious form of blindness. She isn't totally blind but she's pretty darn close and they use this to get a couple of laughs but it just doesn't work, at least for me.Animation for this movie is stunning and Pixar continues its noble tradition of making other studios step up their game. One thing I find quite funny, however, is that the water effects in this movie, a movie about FISH and WATER, has lower quality effects than that of 'The Good Dinosaur', a film about dinosaurs. Not to say that negates the wonderful animation put to use in this film, I just thought it was kind of funny.The cinematography is great, as is the editing and lighting.I will say that I laughed around 4-5 times in this movie, which is really not a good batting average. Obviously children will be crying on the floor with laughter(If your kids do then may God bless your soul) but I just don't find it that funny. They run jokes into the ground and fail to create any new ones. I may very well be the only one alive who doesn't think this film is 'funny, poignant and thought provoking' but I must express my opinion with complete honest. I didn't laugh at this movie as much as I wanted to.Pixar's strong suit is milking pathetic humans for their tears and films like 'Toy Story 2' and 'Up' show an inane ability to make me well up with tears from just a single scene. I didn't care about the characters in this movie. I wasn't invested and I didn't feel an emotional connection to any one particular character in this movie. The emotional payoff is not strong with this one.Personally, I think this movie would work so much better as a 15 minute short accompanying a special edition of 'Finding Nemo'. Cut the filler fluff and redundant side plots and create a nice, compact story about Dory finding her parents in the OCEAN. Obviously they did not go down this road and thus I must judge the movie on its other merits. I recommend this movie for children but not really for more mature audiences because I doubt you'll find a connection to any character or really find much of the film's content funny. I'll rate the movie 6 Pointless Sequels out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Utter disappointment,"I don't care whether critics say it is nice or not. It may look great visually, but truth be told, there isn't much more to it than that. The lines get too repetitive, too redundant. The plot is too thin, and the characters pretty annoying. The forgetfulness that was cute in finding Nemo got to a point where it is plainly dumb and irritating here. The trick gets old, it loses its value. It is just like ""minions"". The small yellow guys were cute in despicable me, but they should not have gotten their own movies. Same here.

While the film has some similar enough references to the first film, it has a whole different story that focuses on the origins of Dory herself.

The film overall has interesting wit, pretty decent humor, and of course a classic feel from one of Pixar's biggest successes back in 2003.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Following almost every single sentimental moment was a moment of pure joy and positivity. The scenes were filled with absolute breathtaking and blissful renderings. The characters seemed to move almost flawlessly and gracefully through the water. The animation was exceptional. Thomas Newman's score was obviously stunning. He reprised the score so well. Andrew Stanton definitely directed a beautiful movie and I'm sure fans of the Finding Nemo franchise will be immensely proud and grateful for it.

"A fun flick that's genuine and expertly crafted, but isn't too funny and has a pretty weak plot: it isn't as good as the first, but still worth your time.","'Finding Dory (2016)' is the both long-awaited sequel to 'Finding Nemo (2016)', one of the most beloved animated films of all time, and the latest entry into Pixar's archive of (mostly) stellar movies. Their work has almost become its own genre, with many critics referring to something as 'Pixar-esque' as a high compliment, and has frequently set the bar in terms of quality. They have had a bit of a slump recently; even last year's 'The Good Dinosaur (2015)' fell short of the studio's own standard. Luckily, 'Finding Dory (2016)' is a competent and enjoyable picture with some fantastic animation and voice-work. It doesn't come close the the quality of its predecessor, but it's still good and fun to watch throughout.The plot initially seems like a rehash of the first, and becomes generic after a fairly compelling opening. The first act goes on like this, with all of the necessary story beats being hit in a conventional way. It doesn't exactly remove you from the picture, but it does create a bit of a disconnect between the film itself and the story it's trying to tell. Luckily, this doesn't last long. After the familiar first act, the film kicks into gear with its second. An out-of-place chase scene leads the titular Blue Tang to stumble across a marine-life rescue centre. This is where the majority of the flick takes place, and also where it's at its most interesting. This act is much more engaging than the first, with its scenario making for some unique set-pieces and additional characters. By taking the action out of the ocean, the team at Pixar are able to mould a different experience from 'Finding Nemo (2003)'. It's when the movie differs from expectation that it's at its best, leading to a level of investment that renders the conventionality of some plot points almost unnoticeable. The final act is a little far-fetched, but features a lot of fast-paced action with slapstick humour peppered throughout. It's enjoyable, but a little brash and seemingly at odds with the film before it. The main issue with the plot arises because of one of its key components. There is an inherent frustration present due to Dory's condition, a character trait which also means that there is a reliance on coincidence and repetition. For me, some of the 'fun' from the forgetting isn't there and the joke becomes tiring quickly. Still, it's handled well on the whole, with sincere moments sprinkled throughout to keep the film and its themes authentic.The writing here is very good, Andrew Stanton and Victoria Strouse are great at making these talking fish relatable and likable. Every aquatic animal is anthropomorphised excellently, with their smaller quirky interactions working the best. There's snappy banter between couples on more than one occasion, and the smaller roles often provide some of the flick's most memorable moments. It is refreshing to find a script that's consistently well-written, each role treated with the same amount of care (no matter how small). The voice-work is also exceptional. Each cast member gives a believable and natural performance, which - paired with the great writing and animation - makes every character feel rounded and real. Ellen DeGeneres is really good as the lead, giving an emotive and personal performance which adds a level of credibility. Albert Brookes, Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell and Kaitlin Olson are marvellous in supporting roles. O'Neill especially breathes life into an interesting character that frequently plays to his vocal strengths. Idris Elba, Dominic West, Eugine Levy and Diane Keaton all play smaller parts but their presences are all keenly felt.Animation-wise, the movie is sublime. The ocean looks like the ocean, both from in its depth and above its surface. I can't emphasis how nice the water looks; it's realistic - in both its viscosity and in the way it interacts with the environment - but still suits the cartoon-esque aesthetic. The lighting is really great, too. The characters are very well realised, with the lip-syncing looking perfect and their movements being complex. The twelve principles are clearly on display, with timing and exaggeration being especially prevalent. I like the design of all of the characters. In fact, the returning ones have never looked better. There are more people on display this time and they are brought to life well; they're probably some of the best humans in a Pixar film, looking stylalised yet refined. In terms of the music, Thomas Newman delivers a welcome and ranged film score that's unfortunately rather forgettable. It works in the moment, always complementing what's on screen, but sums up to some fairly nondescript music that doesn't rank very high among his prior work.Overall, 'Finding Dory (2016)' is a well animated and voice-acted film that feels genuine; it has been expertly and lovingly crafted. Its plot takes a while to get going, is a little unbelievable and isn't all that funny, but the overall piece is still a worthy sequel to 'Finding Nemo (2003)' that's never quite as good but always tries its best: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"We were both 50/50 on this movie. It could have very easily flopped. Good news is it never does that. While it is not perfection it definitely is a worthy sequel. All the voice cast return (excluding Alexander Gould, who would be too old to voice Nemo now.) Ellen Degeneres returns to do the voice of the annoying, but lovable Dory, Albert Brooks returns to voice Marlin. In this one, however, Marlin and Nemo are both supporting actors and just there to give Dory a helping hand whenever she loses her memory or is in trouble. Dory is the lead this time round.We all know the plot...Dory trying to find her parents. The film does introduce us to brand new characters, including the self centered, cranky octopus by the name of Hank (voiced by Ed O Neil). Let's not forget about Dory's lovable, childhood whale friend. All of them get plenty of screen time and no one gets little screen time.The film has loads of flashbacks to Dory's childhood and how he struggled to fit in with the crowd, but at the same time did not care about her short term memory loss problem and loved just being happy and had no plan and would just do whatever she wanted and whatever came her way.We all knew it wasn't going to be the classic ""Finding Nemo."" However, it's a very worthy sequel. Funny, heart warming, and very charming. Take the kids and family to watch it, you'll have a great time. 4/5 stars. 8/10- Autistic Reviewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun but nothing close to original,"I knew to go into this film with realistic expectations. For starters, I loved the short as usual-pixar knows the right formula for these well. Piper was a perfect way to get the audience ready for the actual movie. The movie begins with the audience being introduced to Young Dory- who was very cute and it was nice to get some background on her character. Sadly though, none of the new characters seemed all that interesting. The plot was predictable and it did not hold the magic of the first one as well. Love Ellen Degeneres as always in this role, and overall it was a good movie for the summer, it will not go down as one of pixar's better movies though.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth the Ticket,"Historically, Pixar Animation Studios isn't known for its sequels. The Toy Story films aside, the California based production company has almost always found more critical success with an fresh, original idea than with second or third iterations. Films like Monsters University and Cars 2 feel as if they miss a certain spark that make their predecessors so iconic. While Finding Dory faces a few of these same problems, it is for the most part, a fun and enjoyable return to the reef.Set one year after the events of Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory begins by telling the childhood tale of the titular blue tang and her parents, as well as their subsequent separation. Done in such a way that makes very clear that this is indeed Dory's story, the opening minutes are very reminiscent of Up: they set the emotional tone of the entire work. As the adventure to reunite Dory and her parents begins to unfold, flashbacks return the viewer to wide-eyed baby Dory and her childhood experiences. The flashbacks feel needed, and they rarely intrude or interrupt. They add an emotional backbone, one that explores feelings and sentiments that the first film did not.Despite being released thirteen years after Finding Nemo, the characters in Finding Dory feel fresh as ever. All of the returning characters look and sound the same (even if, as it was in Nemo's case, the voice actor has changed) and they act and react the same as they would in any scene from the first film. Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role to a tee, as do all of the returning voices. It's an achievement that should not be overlooked; recreating characters to the near perfect degree that Pixar has done in this film is a feat for the sequel business. The fact that it was done more than a decade after the original is equally impressive.While all the characters return in stunning form, I often found myself wondering if some needed to return at all. While I did enjoy their scenes, the sections featuring Mr. Ray or Crash felt a bit too much like a nostalgic merchandise move to be ignored. These scenes are sparse however, and I suspect it only feels like a problem because the new cast of characters shine so brightly. While Ed O'Neil's Hank and Kaitlin Olson's Destiny (an octopus and whale shark respectively) are standouts, every new creature the clown-fish/tang trio comes across adds their own degree of character and wit to the film.This is where Finding Dory shines its brightest. When it's allowed to forge new ideas and a fresh story, the narrative soars and the jokes land. The ""annoyed teenager"" dynamic between Marlin and Nemo is particularly well done. But, while the film does have its fair share of emotional moments, there is a certain sentimental attachment that is missing. As I watched Finding Nemo I cared, deeply and truly, about whether or not the father and son were reunited. I anxiously awaited that moment when it would finally happen. As I watched Finding Dory, the only thing I found myself waiting for was the next joke. And, while they did indeed make me grin and chortle, hilarity can only carry Finding Dory so far. All too similar to Pixar's other sequels, that all important spark is missing. The lamp light doesn't shine quite as bright.The animation work and sound design is top notch, and I was once again reminded why Pixar is the best in the business. The uncanny ability to add human-like emotion to the face of a clown-fish or octopus is still outstanding thirteen years later. The swirls of fish alongside new locales and marine life make Finding Dory a delightful underwater feast for the eyes.Finding Dory is definitely worth the watch. In typical Pixar fashion, viewers of different ages will walk away with different favorite moments. It's funny, it's immersive, and, despite missing an emotional resonance of the first film, it's genuine. And, while five years from now it will more than likely still be the original that you pull down from the shelf, this sequel should not be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not Finding Nemo good!","This movie's marquee was that it was one of the few sequels that was, ""better than the original."" I loved it, but *spoiler alert* - it wasn't.Finding Dory picks up a year after the original film and gets to the point quickly! Through a series of events, Dory remembers that she has a mom and a dad and that they live in Morrow Bay, CA. Marlin and Nemo decide to help her and voila, we have our premise.The movie wastes no time as Marlin, Dory, and Nemo meet up with the turtles and ride the East Australian Current presumably west where they land in the murky, garbage and kelp filled Californian coast. I won't give any more spoilers, but I will say that the trio quickly meets up with a villain who is unfortunately not as interesting as Bruce the white shark.Without giving the plot away, I will say that the new supporting characters introduced in Finding Dory are just not quite as lovable, memorable, or funny as Gil and the tank gang. The slapstick humor was there and there are absolutely some laugh out loud moments throughout the movie! My daughter and I were cracking up!The reason ""Finding Nemo"" was so darn successful was because of how simple it was. A neurotic, scared of his own shadow type of fish (Marlin) is forced into crazy scenarios because of Dory's reckless abandon and because the love of his son keeps him going. You feel the emotional attachment from the first minute the movie starts. Unfortunately, ""Finding Dory,"" throws a ton of crazy scenarios at you without establishing a super strong emotional bond with the audience. While it makes for a good movie, it's not NEXT LEVEL good like ""Finding Nemo"" is. In short, Dory is a much more interesting supporting character than lead character (in my humble opinion). It's very hard to take her seriously with the whole short term memory loss thing!Please don't mistake me for one of those guys who thinks the originals are always the best, I really don't think that way (Empire Strikes Back is the best!), but to me a superior sequel needs to both continue and improve upon the best aspects of the original which this movie did not do. Also, please don't view this as a negative review! I still loved this movie and will definitely be purchasing it when it comes out on DVD!!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Precious film of my childhood revisited... and it was wonderful,"I was seven years old when 'Finding Nemo' came out, and now I am twenty... Wow does time go by fast.I used to watch this film nearly every day and never get sick of it. The sea has always been a fascination with me, and so I naturally loved the film because of it; with it's breath- taking animation, details to every underwater creature, laugh out loud moments mixed in with the perfect amount of emotion felt throughout. It was just another amazing Pixar film, but my personal favorite.When I found out about the sequel years later, I was excited, but skeptical. Dory is of course my favorite character, so I liked the idea of her being the main character this time around.Pixar in general doesn't fail to impress people with their surprisingly good sequels. 'Toy Story' 2 and 3 somehow surpassing the first, 'Monsters University' wasn't as great as the first, but it definitely had the familiar Pixar charm to it, and I really enjoyed it, but...there was one that fans were not pleased with: 'cars 2.' Though to be fair, I didn't really care for the first film either.Anyway, this film is definitely in-between the 'Toy Story' sequels and 'Monsters University', where it is an amazing film and sequel with even better animation, likable new characters, some very heart-felt scenes, but of course not as amazing as the first movie, but I already figured that.Like I said, the animation was somehow even more improved in this movie from the first (which looked beautiful in 3D). The park itself surprisingly looked quite real.The characters old and new were memorable, funny, and each had their moments. And to me, Dory being the main character actually worked well unlike Mator in 'Cars 2.' You cared about her journey...and who doesn't like Dory?The emotion? Oh jeez, don't get me started on that. As if tearing up from nostalgia wasn't enough, the movie can make you cry a river at times...or 'ocean' if you will. Luckily I brought tissues. I especially love how it carries another message about family like the first film. That to me is where the heart is.The humour was also fun. Some miss, but mostly hits!Overall, this film luckily did not disappoint. Me, my mom, aunt, and cousin all loved it. No it's not as great as the first, but it's pretty hard to compete with the wonders of 'Finding Nemo.' It's still a spectacular kid's film, Pixar film, and sequel. I highly recommend it!Overall: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boring,"This had to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Both my wife and I fell asleep. There was almost no humor. It was just a ridiculous ""adventure"" (if you could call it that), and it seemed to go on and on. If you are going to make an animated movie, there should be some humor in it for the adults. After all, adults are the ones PAYING for the movie.My nap was the best part of the movie. While I was awake, I had to suffer though the annoying voice of Ellen DeGeneres. The Dory character was okay in the first movie as a secondary character, but they should have never made a movie around this obnoxious character.The only good think I can say is that my 6 year old thought it was okay.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory,"Finding Dory is a G-rated film that is a sequel to the popular movie, Finding Nemo. The movie is based on the character, Dory, and her short-term memory. Her short-term memory is what I love about Dory the most since it makes her humorous. In the film she begins to sleep-swim. During her dreams, she sees her parents and memories of her childhood. What sparked Dory's memory of finding her family was the conversation that Nemo had with Dory about family, than she later hit her head which sparked a flashback of her parents. One day Marlin and Nemo are unable to find her after they awake. The movie shows Dory's adventures in the aquarium and Marlin and Nemo's journey trying to find Dory. Along the way she finds out that she was born at an aquarium in Sydney, Australia. Turns out Dory ends up in an aquarium where she was born which is ironic since her short-term memory lead her astray. I enjoyed this movie due to its humorous, innocent jokes and its sense of nostalgia. It introduces new characters, such as Destiny and Hank. These new characters' play key roles in helping not only Dory get to her family but Nemo and Marlin in getting to Dory. Also, the movie's graphics were bright and detailed which captured the audiences attention which is necessary to capture children's attention. There were only a few scenes where the movie failed to make us laugh. Somehow even after a series of serious moments, the dialogue and personalities of the characters were able to make me laugh. This film did a good job at making a sequel to a well adored movie, which is often not the case. Also, I enjoyed how there was a surprise appearance of Sigourney Weaver as the announcer of the aquarium at Sydney, Australia. Definitely would recommend to all ages!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but forgettable sequel","Given how great Finding Nemo was, my expectations were really high for this film. When I saw Finding Nemo in the theaters, I was just blown away. While I originally walked out of the theater disappointed and thinking my hopes were simply too high, I realized at home that Pixar has delivered plenty of times in the past (i.e. Toy Story sequels). Finding Dory is just not as good as the original. It is a decent movie, but easily forgettable.Early on in the movie, much of the story seems far too familiar. We see Nemo's coral reef, a journey with the turtle across the ocean, and a chase scene by a scary sea monster again. It is all stuff we have seen before, which made for a slow start. When the movie arrives at the aquarium, we finally see something new, but it is only mildly entertaining. At that point Dory's story-line really takes off, which I found to be really sad and overly serious. In the original movie, Dory was quirky, and full of heart and sweetness; she almost personified optimism. Her character does not change in this movie, but the directors' approach toward her mental affliction does. What was a silly but funny affliction in the first movie is now treated as a serious disability. We now see Dory and the characters around her sad, confused, lost, and really scared most of the time. I completely understand what they were going for in this film, especially for families dealing with special needs family members. At the same time, this movie never makes the strong emotional impacts of many other Pixar films. It's more of a downer than a tearjerker.Finding Dory still has enough working in its favor to be entertaining. My kids walked out decently satisfied, but I did notice some fidgety behavior midway through the movie. Ultimately, the movie is okay, but it is not a Pixar classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"not so good,but enjoyable","This film is sequel of legendary Finding Nemo,the expectations was really big.The Finding Dory is not so good ad F.N.,but it wasn't disappointment (for me).

Middle-of-the-Sea Pixar Outing,"Finding Nemo was a groundbreaking feast of state-of-the-art oceanic visuals and piercing emotions. With Dory, Pixar used 13 years of experience to take the animation even further, while slightly bogging down with overly familiar storytelling. Luckily, that familiarity is mostly forgiven. Through some smart retrofitting of our absent-minded protagonist, they've managed the difficult task of taking a comic-relief side-character and giving her pathos and passion (take note, Minions). Outside of Toy Story, Dory is the best Pixar sequel to date. We pick up one year after Nemo made it back home, with some distant memories of her parents conveniently creeping back into Dory's memory, leading her on a journey to find them. She is still the lovable short-term memory loss loser we grew to love, but director/writer Stanton takes her disease a much more seriously here. Surprisingly, the film has some really insightful things to say about dealing with mental illness, both for the individual and the people who care for them. This being a Pixar film, the tears flowed freely (i.e. an emotionally wrecking scene involving paths of shells). Not that this purely a dreary occasion; far from it. Dory is arguably one of the LOL funniest films in the Pixar cannon. Including an effective horror movie spoof in the form of a fish-touching pool, a perfect use of Louis Armstrong's ""Wonderful World"", and a hilarious use of Sigourney Weaver, it's filled with clever humor. If only that cleverness spread into the plotting a little more (Dory's memory loss is full of inconsistencies to further the story), this may be slightly more unforgettable. So while Dory's not top-tier Pixar, it's still solid family fare.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The worst of Pixar,"For a studio that has a brilliant track record, with incredible movies like Wall-e, Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Cars, and others, Finding Dory is a complete embarrassment. It is, in fact, too bad to be considered with its prequel. There were a few scenes that did touch the heart, but overall it was more of a joke. The original film brought several new ideas that all of us liked, this one doesn't bring anything substantially new. The same Dory which was cute in the first part is too annoying in this one. Sometimes, she is just unbearable. The dialogues are mostly boring. I rarely feel like sleeping while watching a movie, this one did make me fall asleep two times very briefly. I loved the first part and I was so excited with this one too. As the movie started, I tried to make myself believe that it is not bad, but by the interval time, I felt like leaving before finishing it! I will always agree that some scenes were really good, but they were acutely insufficient to save this movie. For me, a movie that had Pixar with its name was automatically considered as a must-watch, but now, you've destroyed your name Pixar.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Spotlight is now on everybody's favorite forgetful fish in this lovable sequel to ""Finding Nemo""","""Finding Nemo"" is really one of Pixar's best efforts. So a followup to the 2003 undersea adventure would really set a lot of standard. For that, I'm proud to say that its sequel, ""Finding Dory"", is not as bad as I expected it to be. In fact, it is actually great.Well, part of the skepticism I had for this followup to ""Nemo"" is that it centers on the predecessor's instant scene stealer Dory. To admit, Ellen Degeneres truly made the lovable blue tang as an iconic character as she is now. And to turn the spotlight to a forgetful comic relief does show corporate cynicism for Pixar, as demonstrated by ""Cars 2"". At least that's my first reaction to a sequel to ""Nemo"" that centers on Dory. More than thankfully, Dory makes up for another compelling adventure, with Marlin (a game Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence), in search of her parents as she retrieves memory of them from her birthplace in a Morro Bay marine reserve. Kudos to Ellen for bringing heart to every funny, tearful and motivating moment.There are new characters along the adventure, like Destiny (an enthusiastic Kaitlin Olson) and Bailey (a clumsy Ty Burrell). But the definite breakout is Hank the octopus or septopus (a gallant Ed O'Neill), who provides an undeniable presence of a scarred but redeemed character. Though his back story is kind of vague (an octopus who wants to stay in captivity), the mollusk is more than interesting, and a great companion to Ellen's beloved blue tang. Just the animation of its design and movements is something Pixar has always stepped up to create.Always a Pixar standard is its quality animation as not only the ocean became the main attraction, but also the detail of the so-called ""jewel of Morro Bay, California"". Andrew Stanton and team are really aware of the environment they are in. Kind of reminds me of ""Jurassic World"" of how life size the attraction is. Also, watch out for sudden twists and turns, just a showcase of how unique the movie is.Though this may not be as momentous as ""Finding Nemo"", ""Finding Dory"" is still a worthy continuation of the adventures of everybody's favorite clownfish and forgetful blue tang. Pixar finally gave us a fine sequel to their property. And I am sure to hold hopes for their next film""Cars 3"". Hmm.Ellen, you deserve the movie you took years of campaigning.",,Anonymous,Animation
7/10,"""Finding Dory"" meets our favorite fish characters one year after having found Nemo (Hayden Rolence). Life seems pretty great and ordinary for Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), Nemo and Marlin (Albert Brooks), yet suddenly Dory is amazingly triggered back to her past and starts remembering little bits of her youth, most notably she remembers her parents and sets out on a journey in search of them with an enthusiastic Nemo and a slightly reluctant Marlin.Not to be in anyway hyped for a Pixar film would prove stupid, especially considering their enormous achievement with last year's ""Inside Out"", which proved to be for me the best movie of the year, not to mention the amazing sequel work they have done with the ""Toy Story"" series. With ""Finding Dory"" we arr unfortunately far away from the brilliance and top notch filmmaking Pixar has produced, yet that in no way detracts from the enjoyable and occasionally touching ride we are offered.After reviewing so many Pixar films, I find myself once again having to mention at the forefront the animation. It might be obvious, it might be almost routine by now, but that in no way should take away from the brilliant work these animators put forward every single time. The frame is rich and beautiful, yet never looses the viewer, it is always there to tell a story and the complexity of what is conveyed through it is both overwhelming and magical. The coherent tone they always manage to craft is something that is not to undersell since we have seen many animated films fail at it in the past. There is hardly a moment to get your eyes off screen and that is both because of how engaging the frame is on a basic composition level, but also because of how smartly every character and action is brought to life, resulting always both funny and intelligent.Furthermore and, might I say, once again, we are carried in a world that is incredibly fun, filled with jokes at every corner, pop culture references peppered throughout, running gags that develop character and excellent slapstick humor. But the best part is that all of this is, as always, done uninvasively. Hardly ever does the story stop to make way for a gag, the story is the focal point of everything, the characters and their struggle are always o the forefront, all of the above is just an addition that enhances the film and gives it this incredibly adventurous and funny tone which always leaves a big smile on my face when leaving the theater.Still what ultimately makes everything work is the affection for the characters both old and new, the way they are treated and how they act. No matter how off the rails the film is going at times, and it really does, the banter between these fish is so sharp and electrifying you just don't see fish and you don't want it to end. Moreover, Dory is funny and genuinely works as a main character, if only a little one beat, yet her comedic value is inexhaustible.As I said the movie does go off the rails, the action portrayed on screen is simply too far fetched too many times to keep the audience suspending disbelief. The difference with ""Finding Nemo"" is exactly in how the predecessor manage to weave character, emotion and plot so seamlessly into a deeply touching tale. ""Finding Dory"" has good intentions, but the scene weave is just to extravagant and unmotivated to have any kind of deeply thematic effect on the viewer.No doubt everyone in the family is going to have something to enjoy in the film, everybody will have loads of fun and a really pleasant time, even if it won't leave any mark the predecessor managed to leave on everybody.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Keeps hitting walls,"The film is very funny, and there is wonderful creativity and imagination at play here. But these movies, all movies, are about the building of momentum, and Finding Dory can't seem to link it's set pieces effectively. It reaches a jog but keeps stumbling. You clench in your seat, you want it to keep moving. I can't believe 3000 people can work on a movie but no one sat the director down and told him there are too many slow, stirring scenes with piano twinkling in the background where characters convince Dory that she is special. There are at least four and every time they murder whatever rhythm the film had going. They tread on the groove. They are dull, superfluous. This message is built into the plot, we feel it, we don't need to be told it. There needs to be only one of these scenes, and it needs to come before the climax. The climax has THREE. Heck I was antsy, god knows what the 3 year old's will be doing.Like I said, the movie is very funny, it almost feels like it was written for adults. The jokes are for the internet generation. They feel like memes. When a truck flies off a cliff in slow motion spilling fish everywhere and a salmon slaps two sea lions to the tune of ""What a wonderful world"" the movie becomes absurdist. I felt like I was watching a video that would crop up on my Facebook feed, edited by a stoner. Frankly the jokes might be a touch too strange, they undermine the reality of this world. They are funny but phony. Too meta. Perhaps they belong in a different film.Look, the point is you will enjoy this film. It's thoroughly enjoyable. But I just don't think there is enough adventure here to have kids coming back, and kids are really the only ones who come back.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fantastic , but lacks something","I remember Finding Nemo, it was great, I remember seeing those vibrant fish and the true story of family and love.Finding Dory, takes a different route, while its still about family and friendship, it does have more of a darker story and is more deeply emotional. Dory, who is a blue tang fish suffers from short term memory loss. Her parents, Jenny and Charlie lose her. Dory, than meets Marlin, a clown-fish who's looking for his son.

But Dory's memories of her long-forgotten parents come flooding back to her. Dory than asks her old friends and new to help her discover her past. The story is very simple but decent , the screenplay was fine too, the editing kind of bothered me, but what did bother me the most was the characteristics.

Brilliant!,"Another brilliant Pixar movie. Incredible animation, excellent voice acting. However a nitpick towards the Nemo voice actor, obviously its a different kid voicing him but its too noticeably different but it really doesn;t matter. Pixar takes on a character that wasn't really interesting in the original finding Nemo, and makes something pretty great. The movie has an emotional story line and manages to make Dory likable and slightly interesting. The main problem with this movie is that it's just another Pixar movie, it's really nothing unique, there's no tension, there's a scene involving a chase with Marlon and Dory and it mirrors the original chase with the angler-fish in the original Finding Nemo except it has no tension. You never feel like anything is going to happen to these characters and it makes it tension-less. The movie makes up for that however by being fun, and it does not feel incredibly long, it feels quite short. The plot is quite simple but heartwarming with some fantastic music at the end. Overall the movie is very well made highly recommend, it just feels like another Pixar movie, not what could've potentially been done with a Finding Nemo sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The film's voice cast is also excellent, with Ellen DeGeneres giving a standout performance as Dory. The film's humor is both clever and silly, with plenty of laughs throughout. However, what really sets Finding Dory apart is its emotional depth. The film explores themes of family, identity, and disability in a way that is both poignant and relatable. The film's ending is particularly touching, bringing tears to the eyes of even the most stoic viewer.

Good,"Right from the start, it is possible to notice the structural change implemented in Finding Dory: the film starts with a flashback, with the little fish dememorial beside his parents and learning to deal with his constant forgetfulness. In addition to historically situating the new protagonist, the opening also serves to correlate this sequence with the original film. That's when we know that the new adventure takes place exactly one year after Nemo's rescue.The presence of flashbacks is very important in this new film: it is through them that Dory, little by little, receives clues about who they were and where their parents are. In addition to dealing with the past explicitly, Finding Dory reverses the proposal seen in the original film: if before an overprotective father left desperately in search of his son, now it is the daughter who is looking for her parents. In both cases, the need to have the family around is the main motivation - remember, Pixar is a Disney company, with all the merits and demerits it brings. However, if Finding Nemo shone with originality, its continuation is extremely dependent on the elements already known to the general public.It is clear that issues with the whale and Dory's constant forgetfulness are present once again, as well as Marlin's always worried air, now relegated to the post of supporting (and sometimes forgotten in the story itself, along with Nemo). Well-known characters, such as the hippie-shaped turtle, appear in small spikes. As much as such ideas even yield some fun sequences, they always sound like something reheated. The same joke is insisted, changing only the context in which it is presented.Such dependence is made even more explicit by the fact that the new characters do not stand out so much. If the Hank octopus even has an interesting side due to the dubiousness of posture, it is also wide open that his choice had a lot to do with the need for locomotion out of the water of Dory herself (in juggling that does not always convince, say in passing) . The itinerary is also concerned with instructing minors about marine fauna, as shown by biological curiosities scattered here and there and the presence of the beluga Bailey, with her powerful ""natural sonar"". In other words, there is a constant concern to have fun and also to transmit messages, whether emotional - connection with the family - or educational - the setting in the California aquarium is another example.Originally, Finding Dory is in just two moments: in the brilliant sequence of the ""touching tank"", where reality is presented from the perspective of the beings who live there (an inversion of the point of view similar to the aquarium in the office, in Finding Nemo); and in the contrast formed by the shark Destiny and the aforementioned Bailey, involving questions of vision. In addition, they are the same situations already known, presented by an impressive quality of animation - note the difference in brightness at the bottom of the sea, depending on how deep the characters are.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm reviewed on June 14, 2020.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For a film set in the ocean, it somehow even manages to throw in a car chase sequence.","One year after helping clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) find his missing son Nemo (Hayden Rolence), blue tang Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) embarks on her own adventure to search for her family. During a school field trip with Nemo to watch the stingray migration, Dory is cautioned about the strong ""undertow"" - and the word triggers memories about a similar warning from her parents, Jenny (Diane Keaton) and Charlie (Eugene Levy). Determined to remember more and locate her mother and father, Dory heads to California, with Marlin and Nemo in tow. Once there, the trio discovers the Marine Life Institute, a massive rehabilitation center and aquarium. With the aid of new friends Hank (Ed O'Neill), Fluke (Idris Elba), Rudder (Dominic West), and more, Dory begins piecing together snippets of her past to discover the fate of her parents.Everyone's favorite short-term-memory-loss-suffering fish is back, this time starring in her own show and getting to relive and redeliver many of her hysterical routines. Although her disability here is even more severe, generating significant, almost stressful amounts of affliction, it's all part of the theme of overcoming setbacks. She may be disastrously forgetful, but a major part of her voyage is to figure out ways to transform her misfortunes into boons.And in doing so, her tale becomes a very human, very emotional one of enlightenment, identifying inner strengths, never giving up, and establishing new friendships with indispensable allies. It also leads to one of Pixar's most mesmerizingly poignant sequences, rivaling even the opening scene from ""Up,"" which is now renowned for its exceptional beauty and stunning heartbreak. There's an emotional wallop here that goes beyond any single moment in ""Finding Nemo,"" which gives this new picture an undeniable edge and consequence rarely seen in sequels (or animated features, or cinema in general).But Pixar sequels are no ordinary follow-ups. Even though many returning bit parts make an appearance (including a bucktoothed, bug-eyed, nerdy classmate fish, the surfer-guy turtle, and the singing manta ray teacher); the plot retreads familiar terrain to repeat the basic concept of an epic, cross-sea expedition; or a menacing squid replaces an out-of-control shark, a detrimental, loss-of-creativity sense of repetition never seeps into the proceedings. Instead, the dialogue gets cleverer, the quirky jokes about specific species become more creatively bizarre, and the character designs grow ever more caricaturized and comical. Hank the octopus is one of the most impressive CG creations so far in the industry, utilizing photorealistic textures, spot-on movements, and a camouflage gimmick that is so sensational, the filmmakers chose to showcase it again in the closing credits.Where the first film was a harrowing odyssey across the vast unknown, this continuation shifts into a monumental mystery, retaining the themes of friendship, trust, negative reinforcement, and confidence, while also adding the notion of manipulating adversity into resolve. In its mix of superior visuals, a recognizable and endearing voice cast, laugh-out-loud gags, and a level of pathos not witnessed since ""Toy Story 3,"" ""Finding Dory"" becomes a technical and artistic masterpiece. For a film set in the ocean, it somehow even manages to throw in a car chase sequence.The Massie Twins",,Anonymous,Animation
"Another great Pixar film, but the original is still the best","With John Lasseter at the helm, it's hard for Pixar to make a bad movie. But some are better than others and resonate more with the viewers. All of them are entertaining, and the best bring a fresh perspective on what it means to be human. Finding Nemo was (and still is) a brilliant piece of art, not only one of the greatest animations of all time, but one of the greatest movies, period. The core of Finding Nemo was a parent having to finally let go of his child so that the child could grow, something every parent could understand and every child could relate to. I'm hard-pressed to say exactly what Finding Dory is about, though. Some reviewers have said it's about dealing with disabilities. Some have said that it's about family. And there are certainly moments where that's true. But I never got a sense of a strong theme that carried through the entire movie and gave the coherence that Finding Nemo had.There are many exciting showpiece moments, the requisite chase scenes and threatening creatures. There are lots of comic relief moments. But throughout the movie I kept thinking that I had seen it all before (ironic considering Dory can't remember one moment to the next). Many scenes so closely echoed the original that occasionally I wondered if Pixar had simply copy-and- pasted them from the original and then changed a few characters and scenery pieces.Even though I know talking fish with front-facing eyes is a hard premise to swallow, I could accept that. In Finding Nemo, I never once questioned many of the improbable things that happened (like the dentist office escape), because the story made it all seem possible. But in Finding Dory. too many of the scenes seemed so impossible -- even in the context of an animation -- that I simply couldn't accept them. Instead, those moments came across as convenient plot devices when the writers had backed themselves into a corner.I did like how Andrew Stanton was able to connect certain elements from the original in a way that formed a deeper backstory about Dory. But I never found myself connecting with the characters the way I did in the original. I read an article about how the movie's creators wanted to make the film have a heart. Well it does have that, but I think it needed a stronger spine.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent and enjoyable mix of old and new,"This animated movie was exceptionally made in every way. I can't give it as many stars as Finding Nemo however, because there were some slow scenes and the new characters, with the exception of the octopus Hank and the highly amusing addition of Sigourney in the story, were not as memorable as the many fun characters introduced in the first movie.There were some funny ""walk on"" characters that did come back from the first movie, which was nice but they were not part of the main story. It definitely felt more like a Disney movie than Finding Nemo did. The interactions of some of the animated characters were more standard fare than the highly original Pixar used to produce. Overall though, this was a fun movie to watch for an adult. The young children with us lost interest about 3/4 of the way through (during a slow period while Dory was lost) and could not appreciate much of the humor in the movie older viewers could, such as reappearances from Finding Nemo and the ubiquitous presence of Sigourney during the final search.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dory's Journey: 'Finding Dory' Delivers a Heartwarming and Entertaining Sequel,"""Finding Dory"" is a heartwarming and entertaining sequel that continues the story of the beloved characters from ""Finding Nemo."" The animation is stunning, with vibrant colors and intricate details that bring the underwater world to life. The story is well-written and emotionally impactful, following Dory as she sets out on a journey to find her family. The characters are lovable and relatable, with Ellen DeGeneres once again delivering a standout performance as the forgetful fish Dory. The humor is clever and will appeal to both children and adults.

Finding Dory is good fun to enjoy but not the best one,"Finding Dory (2016): Finding Nemo.....One of the best animation movies of all time.I love that movie and I watch it every time it comes in TV.Now its time for its sequel Finding Dory.I had huge expectations on this.So how is it???Plot: Finding Dory picks up a year after the original film.Dory is a wide-eyed, blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss every 10 seconds or so. The one thing she can remember is that she somehow became separated from her parents as a child. With help from her friends Nemo and Marlin, Dory embarks on an epic adventure to find them. Her journey brings her to the Marine Life Institute, a conservatory that houses diverse ocean species. Dory now knows that her family reunion will only happen if she can save mom and dad from captivity.Plus Points: 1)Animation: Of course there will be no flaws in movies of Pixar and Disney.They always give best quality animation.Finding Nemo is visually beautiful with bright colors and perfect view of underwater.I loved it.2)Funny Moments: Finding Dory has lot of funny moments.As Dory suffers from short term memory loss we have lot of funny situations which will make us laugh..But wonder is that it reminded me of Bhale Bhale Magadivoyyy (where hero also suffers from memory problem).3)Climax: Climax is awesome and gives us ultimate fun.I constantly kept laughing through out the climax.Climax is as thrilling and funny as first part.4)Voice cast: Well Voice cast is not changed from original.So they gave their best output for the roles.Minus Points: 1)Only one thing is that it is not the best one as Finding Nemo.Its good but did not reached my expectations.So Finding Dory is good fun to enjoy but not the best one.Funny thing to say is that Finding Dory is bit like Animated version of 1 Nennokadine with comedy like Bhale Bhale Magadivoyy (I mean that some series of situations bears similarity)My rating 7.25/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent fil to enjoy with the family,"Finding Dory is the sequel to the well-known film Finding Nemo. It is an animated adventure/comedy film directed by Andrew Stanton who was also the director of the first film a while back in 2003. It stars Ellen DeGeneres, among others.
 The movie is about Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss who remembers short clips of what it seems to be her past before she got lost in the ocean. As she travels back to find her family, she keeps remembering this memory that helps her find her way back.
 There are a lot of new characters in this movie. There's a grumpy septopus (he only has seven tentacles) who can mimic things, which is helpful for Dory to find her family. There's also a whale shark who can only see close objects. Moreover, also some old characters have come back

Please- be kind to people with special needs!,"My 4 year old daughter loved this movie. She loves fish, and she knew all the characters' names before watching it. My daughter has autism, and hyperactivity disorder, but she was able to sit through most of this movie, which makes the movie a success in my book! The only thing that disturbed me and may keep me from buying this movie on blue ray is the way Gerald the seal is treated by the other two other seals. They refused to share their rock with him, even when he was sad about it. They tricked him several times, yelled at him, and treated Becky the loony loon better than they treated him. They could have made fun of the fat seal, but that would have been mean,yes? So to get laughs, which the children in the audience did, they zeroed in on the seal who was not the same as them. In a time where society is more aware of bullying and trying to take measures against it, where the affect of bullying is being splashed across every media outlet, and where more children than ever are being diagnosed with special needs, I feel that movies do not need to generate laughs by having characters be cruel to each other. There is never a reason to treat another cruelly, and Pixar needs to find another way to create a funny scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A little of this character goes an awful long way,"Perhaps it's because I'm a soulless husk of a man and dead inside, but the Pixar formula just isn't cutting it for me anymore. You'll find no argument here that the animation studio's heroic run from 1995's Toy Story through Up in 2009 was all but unprecedented in its consistently enchanting assembly of wondrous new worlds. (So great, in fact, that we'll let them take a mulligan on Cars. Even Babe Ruth struck out sometimes.) But Finding Dory arrives in theatres not long after Monsters University, and you might be a bit unnerved to learn that The Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4 and Cars 3 are all already on the way.Pixar settling down into a sequel factory is, I suppose, the way of all things Disney these days and maybe wouldn't be as troubling if even their original films weren't starting to feel like sequels, too. This particular heartless bastard shed no tears during last summer's Inside Out, which transplanted the final segment of Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex into yet another Pixar movie about two mismatched characters separated from their group and learning to love one another during endless contraption-like chase sequences. A widely circulated internet meme adroitly pointed out that once toys, bugs, monsters, fish, cars, rats and robots all have feelings, the only logical follow-up was for feelings to have feelings. (Also, Bing Bong was annoying and I'm glad he's dead.) Finding Dory inverts Pixar's beloved 2003 Finding Nemo by replacing a father's search for his son with a daughter trying to find her parents. Dory, the absent-minded blue sidekick (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) takes center stage for the sequel after a bump on the head triggers a flashback to her long-lost mom and dad. Presented as comic relief in the first film, Dory's daily struggle with short term memory loss is fairly harrowing here, and certain scenes should probably come with a trigger warning for parents of special needs children.It's no easy feat building a story around a character who can't remember anything that just happened, with the screenplay constantly required to cheat its own premise (this isn't Memento) and work around the fact that a little of this character goes an awfully long way.Undeterred by her disability, Dory sets out trying to find her folks at a massive California marine preserve, once again travelling with worrywart old clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his plucky son Nemo (newcomer Hayden Rolance, because I assume the original kid's voice changed sometime over the past thirteen years.) The first thing you'll notice about Finding Dory is that the ocean sure got a heckuva lot smaller between films, and now can be traversed in mere minutes of screen time instead of an entire feature. That speeded-up quality is emblematic of the sequel, in every way bigger, louder and more action-packed than its predecessor, which isn't necessarily for the best.Quickly split-off from Marlin and Nemo –both could probably have been excised from the story without much fuss– Dory soon finds herself navigating the confines of an eco-friendly aquarium in the company of the film's finest creation; a curmudgeonly seven-armed octopus named Hank, voiced by Al Bundy himself, Ed O'Neill. (The missing limb makes Hank technically a ""septopus,"" which Dory keeps reminding him as if for the first time.) It's a smart move giving us a crotchety audience surrogate who's allowed to get as exasperated with our heroine as we do, even if that means this becomes yet another Pixar movie about two mismatched characters separated from their group and learning to love one another during endless contraption-like chase sequences.I honestly zoned out during a lot of the action and found myself focusing on the miraculously detailed background animation. Whether we're talking about the slight residue of gunk on these fish tanks or the shimmering reflections of light upon water and glass, Finding Dory is a technological astonishment. I got more out of contemplating each magnificently rendered grain of wet sand than I did trying to figure how these small aquatic creatures have suddenly become capable of performing such outlandish stunts. The best parts of the film are the too few occasions when it pauses for long enough to let us drink in the majesty of what we're being shown.Pretty sure I checked out for good when the octopus started driving a truck. You may have more patience than I.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Dory is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped !

Good for those of you who wanted more Dory and Marlin,"I watched this in theaters and enjoyed it a lot. More of the clownfish family and their friend Dory. I wasn't bored in the slightest and I loved all of the different marine animals, especially the octopus and the beluga. There were edge-of-your-seat moments but it added more meat to the movie's bones. It's also kind of that quest for your past story where you have to find those special to you, even if you've only known them for a short while. Who hasn't had that experience or event in life? The movie may not be for everyone, but it's good for those of you who want more Nemo, Marlin, and Dory.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding kids' movie,"I know Ellen De Generes mainly from clips of her best-known sitcom and her talk show, and from several movies and some of her stand-up comedy. I won't say she deserved an Oscar nomination because she's really just being herself, though she's really good at creating a funny and adorable personality. And yet on two occasions she goes above and beyond. One of those, after she makes a very important discovery about a terrible event in her life, doesn't last very long, but she really shows acting ability. In a more serious Oscar-caliber adult movie, such a performance might have lasted quite a while.And then there is another scene which I will only say shows the most blue fish in the present day up to that point in the movie. It's one of several scenes that make me doubt whether younger children should be watching this movie. And yet even as the tone really changes to serious, and the quality once again looks like something we would see in an Oscar clip, it really will be all right.Sloane Murray as young Dory is so absolutely adorable, and yet her first scenes end up being so sad I began to wonder if young children would be able to handle that. But the tone quickly changes once Dory gets older. The parents have such a positive attitude you just know Dory will be all right. And yet there's one flashback where Dory's mom is crying, wondering if the poor child will ever make it in the world. The parents do such a good job of trying to convince Dory she will be all right.On the subject of Dory's disability, I was concerned the movie was being insensitive to people with Alzheimer's or some other memory problem, but between the writing and the acting the disability makes the movie absolutely hilarious and i have to just accept it. I do wonder about the consistency of Dory's ability to remember things. Maybe when she specifically makes an effort to remember something, she can. The science doesn't have to be perfect. It's just a movie.Can those trees, roads and bridges, and vehicles, and the sky and the clouds really all be art? Surely not! Surely those are all real and the animate characters were just added to that. As real as it looks, it is apparently all created by amazingly talented people and software designers.There is an enjoyable adventure with the expected obstacles, and even a vehicle chase worthy of ""The Fast and the Furious"". This time, no stunt driving was required and animators could so almost anything and no one would get hurt.I considered skipping to the end, since I recorded this, to see who everyone was. I didn't recognize any voices other than De Generes. I thought Marlin was David Koechner, but he wasn't. Albert Brooks did a very good job.And while I didn't know the voice until the credits, Ed O'Neill is one of TV's finest grouches. He delivered here is ""septopus"" Hank. Is there an actual octopus species that can change color to match its surroundings? Who cares? We're not trying to be scientifically accurate and it gave us some interesting and even funny situations.Kaitlin Olson? Really? Such a nasty person in ""The Mick"" and ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"". Destiny is so nice and friendly.And there were many other fine acting performances where I didn't recognize the voice, and that was just fine. It's better if we know these voices as just the character and not think of the actor. Except when the actor is so much like the character, of course. So many fun characters.There is one more reason I am reluctant to say young children should watch. There was one two-word insult that I have heard people say shouldn't be allowed on TV when it used in wrestling. And they put this expression in a kids' movie? Other than that, I don't think there is any cursing.I can't believe I didn't notice the music. But I'm sure it was great. What I did notice was a performance of ""Unforgettable"" that I would like to forget. I knew Billie Eilish was not yet a star so it couldn't have been her. It was what I believe to be sort of like her style.Overall, it's a great movie for kids, and I suppose adults too.",,Anonymous,Animation
Solid and simple fun buckles under own weight.,"This sequel introduces some memorable new characters, and sets them up within some really quite funny scenes. From scene to scene, and through a child's eyes, this film will deliver.However, the weight of this jumble of frenetic scenes threatens to collapse the thin narrative and simplistic emotional framework underpinning it all. The scenes and dialogue are great, but there are too many ideas being thrown at a rather flimsy concept. The film feels long, there is too much geographic back and forth. Parts of the film, though entertaining, seem unnecessary in the larger scope of the tale.It's a fantastic ride for the most part, but the adult in me can't help wonder whether this essentially basic story really needed an entire movie to tell.For many, this film will provide an entertaining outing into a world we haven't heard from in 13 years. Sadly, while I can appreciate the film's many positives, it feels all too long, tries to do too many things without enough narrative drive, and the main plot was not enough to keep me absorbed throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Can't match up to Finding Nemo,"I have always liked watching children's film, animated or live- action since most of the time they are fun or well-written or both. I have no problems suspending disbelief when it comes to movies since I know that cinema is a different art form and it can be just pure entertainment and escapist fun (that has to use some unbelievable action sequences or scenes). A good film, for me, does not need to please the critics all the time or be too realistic and philosophical. I can enjoy almost all movies as long they are not pretentious and just want to tell a good story, whether in a profound way or in an entertaining way.However, I had to suspend my disbelief too many times while watching Finding Dory and the story is not compelling enough for me. I also find Dory so annoying here though I liked the octopus very much.Maybe I expected too much since I enjoyed Finding Nemo even though I also had to suspend my disbelief when watching it, but the suspension of disbelief did not make me question the plot too much. I also thought that Finding Dory would be a good sequel since I enjoyed the sequels of famous animated films like Toy Story 2, Ice Age 2, Kung Fu Panda 2. Well I thought wrong!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Completely unnecessary rehash,"I never understood why people loved Finding Nemo so much: the story was unexciting and the main characters (Merlin and Dory) were fairly one-dimensional. So I went into ""Finding Dory"" with low expectations... and I can't really say that I was far off.Dory really is a one-trick pony (fish?) - she forgets things... and that's it. To make matters worse, the film ensures we don't forget that by driving the point home until it grates.The film does pick up a bit and provide a few laughs when a motley crew of quirky secondary characters like Hank the curmudgeon octopus or Becky the loony bird come to Dory's aid, but you have to worry when Pixar needs to rehash a story line around forgettable characters. Luckily, the intro short is a lot more endearing than the main feature. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Finding"" the right words","So Finding Dory was probably one of the most anticipated movies of the last few years along with Star Wars and the Suicide Squad. This movie was great visually, which is what we have come to expect since the first one went places with animation no one else had even thought of yet. Also the audio was top notch, as far as hearing things like side chatter in the background during scenes, the flapping of a birds wings, and even the idling of a cars engine. So the audio and video in this movie is what saved it for me. As far as the actual movie I was not impressed at all by the story line and I mean AT ALL. I don't know what I was expecting this movie to be but I know I was expecting it to be more than what was given to us. To me the whole story line seemed rushed. Yes I know Finding Nemo came out in 2003 and it has been 13 years I know this. Which is exactly why I expected so much more. That is a long time to be in development I just feel like with that much time and money they could've given us something so much better. I'm not saying this was a bad movie at all because it was good hence the 7 rating. They gave us things like new characters, new selfish marine life other than the MINE birds, and even whales! The new characters made it worth while to me. If you haven't seen the movie yet look out for the octopus (Hank) he was hilarious and definitely is my new favorite character. Overall it wasn't a bad movie but I definitely wouldn't say it was good either. I saw Finding Nemo maybe 18 times in one week when my brother was a kid.

Another hit from Pixar that has something different for all ages,"Sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo but set one year after the events Dory remembers her parents and where she lived before meeting Marlin and Nemo all three go on a journey across the ocean and through a fish hospital to find Dory's parents.After 13 years the geniuses at Pixar have released the sequel to Finding Nemo this time centring around the forgetful supporting fish character of Dory. So with Dory now taking centre stage do Pixar make another successful dive or do they violently Belly flop for the first time? To be honest there's not even any need to ask that question, it's Pixar of course the film is going to be good! Yes Pixar once again deliver another film that causes the audience to feel all kinds of emotions. They can laugh with the characters and they can also feel for them when the film gets a bit emotional. Pixar once again do one of the many things that they do best and that's providing adventure, animation and laughs for the kids and for the adults a different deeper story and moments and some laughs specifically targeted at them. Basically Pixar return and do what they do best and that's provide top quality animated films that appeal to all ages. Finding Dory is funny and has a feeling of the original film but is also able to feel like it's own original film ,which it is, and this is something that Pixar are able to do with all their sequels they have a feeling of the original film but the sequels are their own original story and plot. The start of the film does feel a bit rushed and a lot like the original but this is mainly to build up the plot of this film and rushed is slightly understandable but still a bit distracting but seeing as this is at the start and the film wants to jump straight into the plot it's a bit excusable but not completely excusable. There are many laughs throughout the film and nearly all throughout the film are successful and the same can be said for the emotional parts of the film ,mainly intended for the adults that are watching the film, are successful and get a different point/ side of the film across to the rest of the audience.Brilliant characters and once again with something for kids and something for adults, Pixar strike high again with their newest film that's both funny and emotional, Finding Dory is another Pixar hit.*** <-- Three Stars",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
below average movie,"i used to be a be pixar fan, and loved classic films like Nemo and Monster. However, since Steve Jobs sold Pixar to Disney, the creativity and imagination have died with the trade. Dory is no exception, feels like a recycled Nemo but with much worse plot, worse cgi, worse pretty much everything. It is pretty hard to believe, 15 years since the original Nemo, the quality of the animation actually has become worse.The only bright spot of the movie, was the 5 minute mini movie Piper.

An adequate sequel from Pixar but had some story issues.,"So Finding Dory is the sequel to 2003's brilliant Finding Nemo and we rejoin our main fish friends Dory, Marlin & Nemo as they go on an adventure in the waters of California. I really like Finding Nemo, I think it makes the ocean really interesting and encompasses the vastness of it really well along with giving us investing characters to enjoy. I was a little concerned with Finding Dory however as Pixar has only had success with follow-ups in the Toy Story series; both Cars 2 and Monsters University were average at best.This sequel though, isn't too bad. Finding Dory is mostly an entertaining and well-made movie. As with all Pixar films, the animation is some of the best in the business. The sand, the water, the textures on the animals is all so breathtaking to look at (even more so in the short-film beforehand) that the visuals alone make the film worth watching. Fortunately Finding Dory also has a top- notch script filled with funny moments, really good life lessons and mottos, all delivered wonderfully by the cast.Ellen DeGeneres obviously is the highlight as the titular character and she is just as entertaining as the first time we met her and you really feel that she is always so genuine in everything she says and does, you want to be friends with Dory. I actually enjoyed a lot of the new characters introduced also; Hank the octopus makes for a visually interesting character with him being able to change colour and manipulate his body and they allude subtly to things from his past which was a nice way to build the character. Destiny the whale shark is also introduced and I wasn't the biggest fan of her character, I felt the 'clumsy friend' thing wore off quickly and some things she did didn't make sense in terms of what animal she is. Her friend Bailey the Beluga however I thoroughly enjoyed, he had some great lines and entertained me whenever he was on screen, and proved to be educational in some respects with cool visuals. Two more characters I'll quickly mention are the two sea lions voiced by Idris Elba and Dominic West; they were great, I'm always happy to see Idris in stuff so this was a treat and their scenes were very funny together.Moving onto one or two negative points now; the story has some issues. I really enjoyed the beginning and the majority of the main story but pacing was a problem every now and again. For instance, I won't spoil it, but the whole reason they had to find Dory happened so quickly and rushed it kind of felt they were trying to make a reason to call it ""Finding Dory"", if I were honest it's more like finding Dory's parents, which isn't a spoiler as that is the synopsis of the film.Another point is that Finding Nemo took place almost entirely in the ocean which made the adventure seem that much bigger and exciting whereas here it all happens in an aquarium which makes sense I guess as they don't want to rehash the same things and try something new but one part did require them to cross the ocean and it made it seem as though it takes just a few minutes whereas in the first film it took the entire movie to get to somewhere much closer than where this takes place. And a final thing I wasn't a fan of was the climax. Now obviously it being a children's film I have to suspend some disbelief but the whole final bit just didn't fit into the world Finding Nemo set up, I thought it went a bit too far.In the end though Finding Dory was an adequate sequel; I was entertained and it was certainly better than some of Pixar's recent entries. Nostalgia still makes me prefer the first film but when you've been watching it since the age of five, it's hard to root that out.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adoryble,"This is my review of Finding Dory (spoiler free)***** (5/5)Cast: Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brookes, Ed O'Neill, Kailtlin Olson, Hayden RolencePlot: The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish reunites with her loved ones, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.Let's spare a thought for the bazillionaires at Pixar and duty they have done to make marvelous masterpieces, also the amount of Oscars they have won over the past 20+ years. Finding is just one of the many sequels to come over the next few years like Toy Story 4 (2018 was 2017) and Cars 3 (2017), this isn't like the Monsters Inc. sequel that wasn't really a sequel and also wasn't very good. This however even though it is set 1 year after Nemo gets his father but really that was 13 years ago. It isn't often that Pixar make flops unlike last year's The Good Dinosaur but other than that not many Pixar are just one of the few film companies to actually make brilliant films.We all know who Dory is at this point she is a blue tang fish with a little bit of a curse she forgets everything and it's not her fault but we go along with it anyway and she has grown in popularity ever since Andrew Stanton's Finding Nemo came out, for some the director wanted to take a spin on live-action so then he made John Carter back in 2012, which saw a huge drop in the box office. The first we see on the screen is Dory living alongside Marlin (Brookes who is still as stern as ever) and Nemo (Newcomer Hayden Rolence) who is outstanding as Nemo but not as good the previous Nemo, played by Alexander Gould now 22 years old. Dory lives alongside their vicious anemone (such a hard word to say) Dory has dream of remembering her family in her mixed up way. As usual DeGeneres was an excellent choice for Dory, so then we see that dream of when she was a baby when you see baby Dory it will just make you go ""awww"" at how cute she is because she is adoryble. That dream sequence along with many other sequences in the film is one of the best.Off she goes to find her parents and even with a few flashbacks along the way, she meets all sorts of new characters in the film and they are all amazing in their own way, the friend she keeps for some time is an angry cephalopod Hank voiced brilliantly by Ed O'Neill he helps her find her family and the story just plays beautifully from there, She also thinks of a new creature for Hank she calls him a Septopus because he has lost one tentacle, the two get along so well and is another list of lovable creatures for you add to the Pixar list which might be getting a bit full at the moment.Not only doe you see the film from Dory's point of view but also Marlin and Nemo's point of view. From then on of course there are a few silly moments which is to be expected the most silly part which you will probably laugh at, are the lazy Sea-lions Flubber and Rudder resting on a rock voiced by the wonderful Idris Elba who has changed his way from playing Shere Khan in Jungle Book (2016) he and his friend Rudder (Dominic West) are just wonderful and they change the story so much.Other characters she meets are Destiny and Bailey (Kaitlin Olson and Ty Burrell) they are to whales that she meets and conveniently Dory helps Destiny to swim and as for the criticizing Bailey who isn't much help at all is always bring her down, these two characters are just charming and lovable everything they do just makes the story a whole lot more to watch and to enjoy. Throughout this Pixar sequel you're never bored and it doesn't suffer the fate as many other sequelitis in fact this is just as good as Finding Nemo way back in 2003 which only if you a teenager in your late teens you will remember Nemo, and the brilliance that, that was back then.Dory finally sees her family again voiced by the remarkable Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton, then of course she has to save the day again and this possibly is the most human Pixar sequel ever and when it ends you'll clapping your hands and begging for an encore. Pixar is back and it's here to stay.Verdict: An adoryble sequel with plenty of charm and lovable characters another masterpiece from the geniuses at Pixar, well done guys. Oscars 2017 anyone? 10/10 a charming delight.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't miss it,"""Finding Dory"" was created in 2016 by Andrew Stanton with co-direction by Angus MacLane. The voice of Dory's is interpret by Céline Monsarrat for the french voice and by Ellen DeGeneres for the original voice. The type of movie is an animation movie. The film is happens in seabed.The main caracters in this film is Dory, Marin and Nemo. Dory is the amnesiac fish who journeys to be reunited with her parents. Nemo and Marin (his father) come with Dory to find her family. Throughout the story they will meet other character who will help them.This film is very interesting because the plot give us to have the same answer as she is looking for. The movie is full of emotional moments.
However, the story as the same as ""Find Nemo"", so it's a little bite repetitive. It's a spin off. The decor is very similar and the character too. But for the children it can help us to learn the sea animals.
This film is very humorous because of the funny scenes. The colors is very amazing.
To conclude, we should you to see this movie, as for parents than children. Don't miss it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sequel that does justice to the original.,"Dory now lives with Nemo and Marlin. From time to time, she even tags along with Nemo's class on field trips. On one of these trips, Dory gets knocked out while witnessing a mass stingray migration - and reawakens her childhood memories. After recalling that she was separated from her parents at a young age, she sets out on a journey to California with Nemo and Marlin to find them.""Finding Nemo"" was lightning in a bottle - not only does it contain a wholly original concept but it also managed to shift many of our perceived attitudes on the art of animation. It was a perfectly contained story - one immune from getting the franchise treatment. Before this year, I honestly believed that making a sequel or prequel to this brilliant film would have been a bad move on Pixar's part.Thankfully, Pixar proved me wrong. Although I still believe that no sequel/prequel to ""Finding Nemo"" can stand up to the original film, I wholeheartedly welcome ""Finding Dory"" with open arms.The film is directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton - the mastermind behind the original ""Finding Nemo"". For ""Finding Dory"", Stanton and his team bring their A-game: the animation is wonderful (as always), the voice-acting is top-notch, the euphonic score by Thomas Newman is Oscar-worthy, and the cinematography (lighting, camera angles, etc.) is breathtaking beyond words.Unfortunately, the story is overshadowed by those elements (as well as the original film). Dory's plight still tugged at my heartstrings and her journey made me laugh multiple times; however, I can't help but think that Stanton and his writing team may have squandered the story's full potential. The story is written rather haphazardly, but still comprehensible. Some viewers may be disoriented/annoyed by the film's constant cutting among the separated characters and time periods, as well as the sudden shifts in mood.""Finding Dory"" also introduces an entirely new cast of characters – and they're just as entertaining and enjoyable to watch as Dory herself. The additions of Hank the Octopus, Destiny the Whale Shark, and Bailey the Beluga are outstanding. Not only do all three of these sea creatures have their own unique personalities (leading to some hilarious situations), but they each have their own distinct character arcs!On a final note, the last quarter of this film was without a doubt the single most exciting thing I've seen in theatres in a long time.""Finding Dory"" is a gorgeous film filled with suspense, laughs, heart-wrenching moments, and thought-provoking sentiments. The story is a bit of a mess, but that shouldn't keep someone from enjoying this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing Sequel,"Wow. A sequel to Finding Nemo. When I first heard of this movie, I was very skeptical of its ability to be entertaining. For one, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's best films. Everything from the visuals, to the story, to the ambient music was top notch creative design. To feel the emotions that this film is meant to evoke, you will have had to watch Finding Nemo, as it contains many aspects of Dory's younger self in an ambiguous form. Lots of moments in this movie make you think back to the first and say to yourself, ""ohhh that's why..."". There are lots of small points of humor that can be missed if one is not really paying attention, although most of them are quite obvious. The plot is amazingly fluid, at no point do you ever feel a pause or break in the story. One of those movies that it is hard to add commercials to if aired on TV. This is reflective of Dory's character in that she just keeps ""swimming"". Every obstacle she faces is taken in perfect stride, just as every scene in the movie flows from one to the next. And the music is so perfectly fit to the situations and story; it creates a real feeling of immersion that you can only really enjoy if you let the film play in front of you, instead of picking it apart as you watch. If anyone hasn't seen either movie, please watch both in order, feel the story as it happens, don't sit outside of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Fin""-tastic Sequel! (Pun-intended)","For a sequel, this movie is actually really good. The voice acting is still great, the animation is more impressive than ever before, Dory's character development has increased, and the humor is still hilarious. We get to see Nemo, Marlin, Dory, the Tank Gang (even while their roles are rather small), and the sea turtles once again after such a long time. Not only that, but we were also introduced to new characters, such as Hank the cranky but good-hearted octopus, Destiny the nearsighted whale shark, Bailey the beluga whale with the inability to echolocate because of his big head until the big climax, the sea lions, Becky the offbeat, kooky loon, and of course Dory's parents.There are also hilarious moments, like Hank hijacking the van, a fish suddenly sneezing after saying ""I feel fantastic!"", that running gag where Fluke and Rudder shout ""OFF! OFF! OFF!"", Destiny and Bailey making puns out of each other's names, and the entire touch pool scene.It's been 13 years since the original movie was released and I waited so patiently for it, and I gotta admit that it was worth it. Dory's backstory was really emotional, and it was great for those who have remembered or forgotten something, and it plays like a big adventure just like the original movie. It was kinda harsh that Marlin blamed Dory for almost getting Nemo attacked by a squid, which she didn't remember, and told him to just forget. Ouch! Otherwise, great sequel! :)9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Could be an Oscar nomination for best picture.,"""I suffer from short-term memory loss."" Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres)Just to intimidate you and me, the statistics show that Finding Dory is the largest grossing animation in film history, currently at about half a billion dollars and moving up. Yes, more than its companion, Finding Nemo. However I make more demands on the film with that kind of pedigree, and this one exceeds my demands as few other animations have.Dory is the cutest fish you've ever seen, a blue tang with a disability. The genius of this warm, family comedy is that her short-term memory is a source of affection for her family and friends and the audience. She struggles to remember from moment to moment, most prominently after she has lost contact with her family.The film becomes her odyssey to find her family and, in existential terms, herself. The companions who accompany her are eccentric and lovable, most notably Hank (Ed O'Neill), whose gruff octopus exterior masks a heart as big as the ocean.Overcoming Dory's disability and re-connecting with her family are the prominent motifs, not that the latter is at all foreign to the Pixar empire. It's just that Dory's lack of self awareness and genuine love of her fellow fish predict she will be a winner no matter where she lands.""What would Dory Do?"" is a refrain that tells us we have a self-directed heroine here who has a reasoning ability better than her mortal man's. Everyone is smarter for asking that question, regardless of the death-dominated consequences.I don't usually dwell on the technicals, but this film has art work to make even kelp beautiful. The undulating vegetation and synchronized fish schools are marvelous to behold.In the end, this is a film not to be missed if you want to keep up with the best of cinema. Who knows if an Oscar nomination for best picture will follow?",,Anonymous,Animation
High expectations to low expectations,Anticipated for this movie long time ago with high hope since I love Finding Nemo but this is such a huge disappointment. The 'short-term memory (remember-y here and there) lost' joke is getting old and at some point become annoying. Not until half way through the movie I got bored and wondered when the movie end. Couldn't laugh or at least chuckle at jokes thrown in the movie and the story seems to be put in a rush. Marlin and Nemo were also featured all the way in the movie and they were just fine. The dynamic between three of them were still there too however the adventures portrayed didn't really exciting and the thrill of the journey helping Dory on her quest finding her parents couldn't evoke emotions at all. I remembered myself laughed a lot watching Finding Nemo and at some point in tears too but not on this one. It's certainly not easy to be on par with a great movie with great visual effects and story line like Finding Nemo in the first place but at least this should have come close to it which sadly that is not the case. Definitely disappointed,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should include it in your short term list of things to do,"Hello! My name is Meeza, and I am going to now present you my movie review of Disney Pixar's sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" called ""Finding Dory"". This time around the primary fetch star is the lovable, short-term memory loss blue fish Dory. Hello! My name is Meeza, and I am going to now present you my movie review of... Wait a Second! I am ADoryble myself, as most of us are who reach our mid 40's with our short term memory. Anyways, ""Finding Dory"" is very similar to the original in narrative content but does not exactly reach Nemo's depth. Dory's dilemma in ""Finding Dory"" is that she suddenly is aware that she has a mother & father and goes from sea coast-to-coast to try to find them, Nemo and his neurotic dad Marlin do help Dory in her sea quest. There are new characters in this one including a wonderful octopus named Hank who Dory meets along her search for Ma & Pa. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton, who also scribed & orchestrated ""Finding Nemo"", did a fine job also this time around; but the originality was not as creative as before due to similar plot line of ""Finding Nemo"". Ellen DeGeneres nailed the Dory voice once again, and the Ellen Show was one of the main reasons what baited me into liking the picture. Albert Brooks was also superb in his vocal performance as Marlin. Ed O'Neill also was quite the modern squid with his voice work as Hank. Right now there are not too many movies in the ""to see"" tank from what's playing in theaters; however, ""Finding Dory"" is one you should find. **** Good",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great squeal,"Disney and Pixar have a tendency to create bad sequels. Finding Dory is not one of those movies. It follows Dory, Merlin's sidekick in the first movie. The Movie has some sadder parts to it, but these parts are few and never get to the levels of other classic Disney flicks. The Movie is mostly funny, I found myself laughing a lot. The comedy mainly surrounds the Character Dory and her chronic memory loss. The bit is done enough to get plenty of laughs, but not enough to get old. The movie brings back many of the characters from the first movie including, of course, Merlin and Nemo. A hand full of new characters are added and play well of Dory and the other characters. It's paced well and the plot has a few twists that keep it interesting. The climax is epic but you know everything is going to turn out fine, which does take a little away from the climax. I don't think is has to be said but the animation is stunning and the movie looks great, I mean what did you expect its Pixar.Overall the movie is excellent, Its great for kids and its great for adults. It isn't the most epic movie of 2016 or the most thought- provoking, but it is one of the most entertaining. If you have the means check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This year isn't going so well for animated movies,"Well, last year's movies weren't so good, this year's movies have improved a bit but they still aren't anything great. Zootopia and Finding Dory both have pretty long runtime (running for about an hour and 45 minutes) which is too long for a kid-friendly comedy. And they didn't have that much drama either.The story starts off with a young Dory (at about 2 or 3) and she announces that she's suffering from short-term membory loss. Then, it shows her playing with her parents, before out of curiosity, she looks at a shell or something and then gets whisks away (in the same vein as Nemo in he first film). Since then, Dory has been asking other fishes and have been looking around for her parents.Then, she gets lost and Nemo and Marlin have to consistently reunite with her as Dory tries to remember what has happened in her early years.This is the unnecessary, pointless Pixar sequel of Finding Nemo. Kids may enjoy this but don't expect much new out of this, it's pretty much the same plot of trying to find your family relative, kind of like The Good Dinosaur but done in a slightly better and more heart-warming way.I guess it's nice to see Dory, my childhood favorite character come back but even Marlin seems to have gotten more overprotective and Dory has gotten a bit more forgetful than the first one (although, that doesn't seem to be much of a problem since the film is about Dory recovering her memories)... And the voice acting isn't the best, while newcomer Sloane Murray does alright as the voice of Young Dory, Hayden Rolance tries to sound like the original voice of Nemo but ends up coming off as high-pitched.The animation was also okay but the character design was beautiful.I would put this on the same league as Monsters University. It's like a mediocre Dreamworks film. I don't understand the appeal this and Inside Out has already, even though it did have some touching and heartfelt scenes, but the only thing it's missing is some originality.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ties in well with its predecessor.,"After hitting rock bottom with the release of Cars 2 and the mostly disappointing Monster University, I'm happy to see how Pixar was able to capture the essence of what made Finding Nemo so memorable yet again.I always wondered where Dory came from and all that stuff. And how that journey was strung together is yet again filled with memorable characters both old and new.The flash backs used for Dory's steady recall of who her parents are and how she got away from them was a clever choice of narrative, because that was how it was supposed to be in ""Nemo"" about how Marlin lost his wife and children. It works so well in here because of the short-term memory loss of Dory.With that said, I must address a few problems with the movie. You see, I loved how both Nemo and Marlin figured out there escape plans in the first movie, and that is only occasionally the case in Finding Dory. Many times it just seemed like something just happened to go that way or that just happened be there. It made me feel like: ""oh, that was adequate"".But aside from that, it captured all the things that made me love the original, so all in all it is a solid movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant fun for the whole family! 7/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this film. Its full of energy and originality right from the beginning, and the different characters made it a joy to watch. Pixar are definitely back on top form, because they get the mixture of comedy and drama, exactly right so it's great for all ages. The animation also looks terrific and the attention to detail, especially with the octopus (Hank) was truly amazing. Although the first film, Finding Nemo, looked terrific, I must admit, I did prefer this movie, mainly because of the new characters which covered every element of the sea world. The story writers didn't waste time on the fact that Dory had a memory loss problem, and that he was lost in the middle of the ocean, so it gets straight on with Dory trying to find his parents, which I really liked. Every character had there own mission, and they brought there skills on board to help Dory on his wild journey. Even Sigourney Weavers 3-step message played a big part in the film, so they really had everything covered, which is why it made such a profit at the box office. The only downside of the film, was that it seemed to end very abruptly, after following Dory on such an epic journey. With all his new friends, I was expecting a big singalong or something to end the film on a high. Anyway, it's definitely a feel good movie which has something for everyone, so it gets the thumbs up from me. Great!Round-Up: With such a hefty budget, Pixar took a big gamble with this movie, mainly because the first movie was such a big hit but in this case the gamble seemed to have paid off. It was directed by Andrew Stanton who brought you a Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, Wall-E and the awful John Carter. He also contributed his writing skills to the Toy Story franchise and Monsters Inc., so he's a big player in Pixar, whose vision has played a big part in Pixar's success. With some great actors supplying there voice to the cast of this film, and some great bonus material, Stanton has definitely comeback from the terrible loss that John Carter made.Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $1billion (WOW)I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill, Ty Burrell, Kaitlin Olson, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, Idris Elba, Dominic West, Kate McKinnon, Bill Hader, Sigourney Weaver, Andrew Stanton, Willem Dafoe, Austin Pendleton and Allison Janney. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unexpectedly worthwhile sequel,"Finding Dory is another case of a Pixar classic getting a sequel it didn't initially need but thanks to the film finding a worthwhile story to explore and answering questions that only enhance the original, it quickly earns its place in Pixar's filmography. Even if some of the new characters feel a little too kid friendly, it's balanced out by how mature everything surrounding Dory and her condition is played.Ellen DeGeneres remains really likeable whilst taking the lead role this time which is impressive considering everything now known about her. Albert Brooks is still overly cautious as Marlin and has to learn to put his faith in others. Ed O'Neill's grumpy yet eternally loveable Hank is easily the best new addition and it's a classic case of the more openly kind Dory gradually getting him to open up in a heartwarming fashion.Andrew Stanton's direction circles back to the adorable flashbacks throughout so the film never loses track of the emotional core and even though the plot is driven by Dory making mistakes, it never gets frustrating because there's so much empathy and every mistake leads to an important revelation for the characters. There's a few running jokes and the one involving Idris Elba and Dominic West as Sea Lions is a highlight.The lighting and sheer level of detail in the animation when characters are submerged in the water or surfacing from it is breathtaking and it always looks extremely vibrant and is constantly having to find new pools of water within the main aquarium setting so the characters can continue to advance the plot. Thomas Newman's score doesn't always stand out but there's a noticeable ethereal quality to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A heart-wrenching story of a fish... I'm serious.,"Finding dory was a great, fun, and emotional journey from start to finish. While the film is definitely aimed at family audiences in 2016, the people who grew up watching Finding Nemo when they were younger will definitely appreciate this film as much as everyone else.Pixar for the most part stayed true to the original film. We obviously have the same characters, the same actors (except for one) and the same overall universe. Pixar did a great job of connecting the dots between the two movies. Some of the same scores from the last film. For instance in the last film when Marin followed the boat, the same score is used when we see Dory's perspective of how the two met. It's a nice little touch, and it really shows how much detail the writers went into creating the character. It really is a puzzle how Pixar manages to create these visually stunning animated films every year. The picture was great! Really tiny details such as dust particles, or individual grains of sand, and other fine touches really add to the great depth the animators went into making the film from the ground up.As usual, Pixar had very little flaws in their work. I felt like Nemo was poorly used. Sure they make references to the other films, but it's the way Nemo says things to his dad that anger me. For instance, Nemo tried to tell Marlin he should trust people because he keeps making him feel like they can't do it. And then they just drop it there, and don't say anything about it again.For the second time in my life, I had the joy of being able to go see a Pixar film. This, and Tou Story 3 are the only two Pixar movies I've ever seen in a theatre. And I'll go ahead and say that I love Pixar's work even better on the big screen. Truly a sequel worth seeing, and a sequel that everyone should love.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Remarkable,"After a decade since Finding Nemo we finally get the...sequel? Spin-off? That we've been looking for. Pixar proves they can still make outstanding masterpieces. Lets hope they keep this going, and build back some momentum...we'll see how Cars 3 works out...but Finding Dory may become one of the greatest animated sequels or spin-off (call it what you want) ever. Here's why. Unlike some other studios who would make this a full-blown comedy like Minions with nudity, and fart jokes. Pixar shows how mature it is with their films and reminds us why we fell in love with the characters from Finding Nemo in the first place. Virtually every character is likable and none have lost their niche despite over a decade of time between this and FN. However, when it comes to Dory, she obviously is the star. Now, this is risky because sometimes when you make a supporting character the main character it can majorly backfire making you wish the supporting character stayed just that. Pixar wonderfully makes Dory extremely likable even though she has short term memory loss which you would think could get annoying, but somehow Pixar finds the right balance to keep it charming and even, yes, funny. I can also tell the animation has significantly improved from 2004, sometimes making me say, Wow, this looks like I could swim amongst them in this realistic environment. But here's what I personally love about the film is Baby Dory. She is so cute, but not annoying and awkward. Baby Dory adds this innocence to Dory as an adult making her that much more effective. I do feel like however they do seem to exploit the fact she has short-term memory loss. I thought I was going to get irritated. Even though I said it has a good balance, it did get a little bit annoying, but maybe I'm missing the fact that it is her character trait. She forgets every 10 seconds or so. As for the other characters like Hank, I felt nothing special towards him and typical grumpy character who helps the main character, I've seen those many times before. Everyone else was justifiable, Marlin's role was downgraded but still the same worry-wart he has been. Nemo is the same as the last film, and has a stronger connection to his dad. As a whole, this film is definitely worth seeing. If you miss this one in theaters, you will regret it. Beautiful animation, Dory is likable, other character are good, and the story is well crafted.

Doesn't Compare To Finding Nemo,"Sometimes there are films that are untouchable and I think something like Finding Nemo was one of them. Whilst Dory was a beloved character in the film, I believe it was a stretch having her become the star of her own film in Finding Dory.The other problem with creating spin-off films (or sequels and remakes for that matter), is that you find yourself consistently comparing them to the original. This can be detrimental if the original was close to perfection. I found that the things I loved about Finding Nemo were missing from Finding Dory. One of the great things about the first movie was that the adventure was never-ending. We started with the loss of Nemo and we followed his father Marlon and his sidekick Dory on a quest to find him. Along the way, we met various characters and encountered differing scenarios that kept us on our toes. The gnarly surfer dude sea turtles, the immense field of jellyfish, the creepy creature that lured the two protagonists with a distracting shiny light dangling from the tip of his head and the group of wannabe vegetarian sharks (lead by the intimidating but friendly Bruce). Not to mention what Nemo was going through and the friends and foes he was encountering at a dental surgery in Sydney.Finding Dory didn't really have any of that. Whilst Dory did meet a few quirky friends along the way, I felt like the flow of the film was missing. Either the interactions were brief (like when she met a couple of fish who were trying to help Dory but couldn't figure her out because of her condition), or they were long and laboured (like when she met Hank the octopus and subsequently Bailey and Destiny at the Marine Life Institute). For me, it seemed like Dory was quick to move from point A to point B (from Australia to the United States) but then lingered on point B for a very long time.Visually, as was expected, the film was faultless and despite all of the above, there were still some delightful moments that made you laugh and made you cry. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to keep me interested and instead of wanting Dory to find herself, I found myself looking at my watch and waiting for the end credits to begin rolling.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Definitely enjoyable, but a lesser effort from Pixar","When I heard about this film, I thought to myself that it really wasn't needed, and that creating a film out of another character getting lost would be too similar and repetitive. As it is, I do give props to the filmmakers for not really repeating the same beats as Finding Nemo. In this one, it's not as much that Dory gets lost, but rather that she is on a mission of her own. Still, I never found it anything more than good. I think the script is a bit over-stuffed, and some of it just seems tired. I do like the message but I wouldn't consider this one of Pixar's best efforts by any means. The voice performances are great as always, and although there are some flaws and none of it really hits greatness, it is still a very enjoyable film that families can enjoy together.

Light 7,"This film is funny, emotional, exciting, and beautiful. There's a lot to love about this. They've done a great job at connecting Finding Nemo with this sequel and you become attached to new characters and reminisce with old ones. However, Dory's memory loss is a major factor in the plot and even becomes a little redundant that the plot almost becomes somewhat boring in the middle as a result. As the film moved on, the excitement and stirring of emotion increases to wrap up the film very nicely. In addition, the animation is stunning and beautiful, it's almost hard to believe. The biggest and most obvious draw back to Finding Dory is that it is automatically compared to Finding Nemo. Sequels are rarely as good as the originals and this is no exception. With that being said, Finding Dory does provide a nice new twist on an already explored plot and keeps fans well familiarized with characters loved by millions.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Five-word Review: Funny, Cute, Emotional, Appropriate Sequel.","Upon its announcement, this sequel to the 2003 bonafide classic was met with apprehension. Nevertheless, with the return of Ellen Degeneres as the titular blue tang and Albert Brooks as worried father Marlin, plus the introduction of Modern Family pair Ed O'Neill and Ty Burrell, all helmed by a team featuring the likes of Wall·E/A Bug's Life director Andrew Stanton, it seems hard to mess up.The good news is they don't. A sequel - unless the tone is drastically different, like Cameron's 1986 Aliens to Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien - is always going to feel like a retread of its predecessor, and if it suffers from the condition of sequelitis, then it will make everything bigger and less interesting. Finding Dory, however, like the Toy Story sequels, is not a shameless cash- in but rather an appropriate companion piece to Finding Nemo. Before the film begins there is a Pixar short as befits tradition, entitled Piper. This shares there oceanic themes of Dory, and is gorgeously animated, with some cute visuals, but it's certainly not one to remember. At its heart the story of Finding Dory is a deeply tragic one, with an introduction which showcases a heart-meltingly cute baby Dory losing her family in unexplained circumstances and traversing the ocean in a wretched, barely remembered state before her memory is finally jogged one year after after helping to rescue Nemo, and the team set off on an adventure to California to find her parents.What unfolds is nothing less than classic Pixar. The humour is as good as it's ever been in a Pixar feature - the gags are perhaps better than in any other Pixar film, with the standouts Idris Elba as a delightfully lazy sea lion, O'Neill's grouchy octopus (well, septopus), Burrell's clueless beluga having trouble utilising his echolocation, and a silent bird named Becca. The extraordinary setting is a step up from dentist's office in Nemo, and the animation is the very definition of dazzling and flawless - especially during one of the best scenes, where a marine life centre touch pool is re-imagined as a terrifying slaughter ground which evokes the deadly playtime of Toy Story 3's Caterpillar Room.So, technically jaw-dropping, check. Fantastic humour suitable for children and adults, check. Unexpected maturity and emotional intelligence, check. Impressive voice cast, check. Sounds like a classic Pixar film! On the subject of the voice cast, Degeneres truly excels. Her passion for the character is evident, and she expertly combines the naïve, innocent and cute humour of Nemo's Dory with her new tragic backstory.As she pieces together her past from fragments of half-remembered memory, it almost begins to feel like Memento - a refreshingly different style amidst the rest of the film. Another refreshing thing is the lack of villain - like in Inside Out - which is a good recent trend in films that allows for a more character and plot based story that doesn't get bogged down in clichés. There third act is relatively a little weaker - with the notable exception of a few scenes - yet this does not stop Finding Dory from ranking amongst several of Pixar's greats. It is occasionally a little too similar to Nemo, especially during lost fish scenarios, so it's not quite amongst the very top tier of the likes of its predecessor, the Toy Story trilogy, Inside Out or The Incredibles, yet it's still a wonderful film and a must-watch for any Pixar fan (which honestly is any fan of film). 83/100.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sentimental and Funny, at the same time. Charming!","The real beauty in Pixar's FINDING DORY lies beneath the elaborate tapestry of immersive adventures, played in plethoraic array of comic efforts pulled off by what could be now one of the most sprightly animated characters to ever grace the big screen. Dory's adventures might singularly win hearts through laughs, but there's a bracing sentiment lurking at the depths of its story that can never be less of a heart-rending emotional gem.Coming thirteen years after the critical and commercial success of its predecessor, 'Finding Nemo', 'Dory' displays a zealous effort to replicate a similar success by pulling off an essentially similar drama. Only this time, Dory (Ellen deGeneres), whose colossal allure generated much of the overall comic charm in 'Finding Nemo', is the one trying to find her way home. Her journey is depicted in equally vivid, albeit chaotic, adventures that don't only concern about her finding her way back to her family, but more thematically appropriate, about her attempt for self-discovery. In the opening sequence, the sentimental heft of her story is already gaining some volume, but what comes next, no matter how engagingly funny, provides an even more crippling notions of friendship, courage, trust, and family.Much of the film's comic glamor rests on Dory's forgetfulness, itself, but the incredible charm from new and returning characters, can't be counted out, easily. The biggest surprise is Hank (Ed O'Neill), a cranky anti-social octopus, whose chameleon like ability, could actually be Dory's brightest chance in getting back to her family. Marlin (Albert Brooks), and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) are now mostly relegated to the sidelines, but other memorable characters are put in their places to deliver equally indispensible appeal.In the end, what the film accomplishes could not be even close to what it aspires to be. There is a big part of its charm that doesn't quite satisfy its own ambitions, but what comes brimming beyond such effort can never be rudimentary. 'Finding is Dory' never able to deliver a piece of thematic complexity, but the depth it is able to dig, is utterly unforgettable.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adorable enough,"After years of speculation and doubts about whether a sequel to Finding Nemo (2003) was coming to screens, Finding Dory finally emerged. While visuals are amazing, and the voice acting full of personality, the recurring theme of short-term memory loss got a tad annoying.DeGeneres carries the film, and her voice is very recognizable as Dory. She is definitely a perfect fit for the character. Having said that however, I sense that she 'babied' her voice a little too much. At times, it felt like too much effort went in to trying to make her voice sound more adorable. Adding to the fact that she says the same few lines about a hundred odd times in the film can be pretty tiring. Other voice actors did a good enough job with their characters too. Hank (Ed O'Neil) is very impressionable and provides some spy wannabe drama to the movie. Though she only had a few lines, the addition of Sigourney Weaver was a fantastic idea, and provided probably one of the best laughs for me.Animation is great, as expected. The colors are all very vibrant and aesthetically pleasing. The sea lions are fun to watch, and especially the quirky one, whose name I believe is Gerald. Becky is another such character, who like Gerald, doesn't have any lines, but provides much comic relief.While animation, and voice acting is done well, the characters are pretty much stock types, and reactions are often over exaggerated because it is a kid's film. As such, I found it somewhat enjoyable yet tiresome to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One Big Cliché,"One huge problem about Pixar is that they have been releasing too many long awaited sequels (and a prequel) like Toy Story 3 (which was even better than One and Two), Monsters University and recently this one.PLOT: The plot is too similar to Finding Nemo. Firstly, our protagonist (Dory) gets lost, her friends (Marlin and Nemo) go on a long journey to find her, at the aquarium she makes new friends, including an octopus who wants to escape and her old friend a whaleshark, she is briefly reunited with her friends and family, she is rescued and the gang returns home with new friends. The only differences are she gets lost while looking for her lost parents,it takes place in an aquarium in California, the new friends are the octopus, the whaleshark and the orca, and in the climax she is saved from a truck.CHARACTERS: Film makers will never learn that giving the comic relief character his/her own story is not a good idea.HUMOUR:Nearly half the jokes in this film fall flat, like Sigourney Weaver is the host of the aquarium. COME ON PIXAR YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT!!!! In conclusion, Finding Dory robs the audiences worth $1.056 billion worldwide and felt like remake, not a sequel.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even better than its predecessor.,"Finding Dory is a sequel to Finding Nemo(2003). It takes place one year after the events of the previous film. Dory(Ellen DeGeneres) starts recollecting memories from her past, despite her short term memory loss. She starts remembering her family & where she is from. Dory takes the help of her friends Marlin(Albert Brooks) & Nemo(Hayden Rolence), to help her find her long-lost family.Finding Dory is a fantastic movie. Pixar delivers another flawless sequel that improves upon the previous installment, after Toy Story 3(2010). Finding Nemo(2003) is a classic. However, Finding Dory is better. This film is more humorous than its predecessor. Directors Andrew Stanton & Angus MacLane made a great decision, by making the lovable yet forgetful Dory, the protagonist in this movie. For me, Dory was the highlight of Finding Nemo. Dory is definitely the highlight of her own film, as well. All the new characters in the sequel, are excellent additions. There is as much heart in this movie, as there is in the 2003 original. This film imparts a great message to all of us that, we should never give up no matter what the odds are. The animation looks extremely realistic & is another highlight of the movie. The 3D definitely gives you a more fun & engrossing experience. The voice cast, is the reason this film is filled with hilarity & heart. Ellen DeGeneres is outstanding as Dory. Albert Brooks is awesome as Marlin. Ed O'Neill is spectacular as Hank. Kaitlin Olsen is amazing as Destiny. Hayden Rolence is good as Nemo. Ty Burrell is brilliant as Bailey. Diane Keaton & Eugene Levy are superb as Jenny & Charlie, respectively. Sloane Murray is adorable as Young Dory. Idris Elba & Dominic West are hysterical as Fluke & Rudder, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. The animated short film called Piper(2016) that came before the movie, is stupendous. Finding Dory is a must watch for the whole family. Go for it immediately, if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"OK, but not up to the expectations","Watched this with kids in 2D. We are a big fan of Pixar in general and Finding Nemo in particular. It was rich in story, characters and visuals.We enjoyed this one but I found it to be a lighter effort from Pixar. Story itself did not impress. Characters were a bit meh. Dory has a prominent role but both Marlin and Nemo felt like cameos. Both the sharks (?) were dull. The Octopus and the Sea Lions were the only bright characters. Visuals were OK but the setting itself was kind of grimy, so nothing memorable there. The story was serviceable but nothing great.All in all, an average effort but nothing great. Perfectly fine to catch this on video.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
My review for Finding Dory,"This movie was great - a nice story that's more nerve-wracking than the first one, with Dory trying to find her parents and her friends trying to find - and save - her.The animation style is the same, but the graphics have improved and it looks really nice.There were funny moments that were hilarious and also some moments of sadness for Dory. And to see these characters again was enjoyable.If you haven't watched the first film, do it before you watch this.Finding Dory is great, just as good as the first, with some really tense, fun moments, and great humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Long Term Memory,"Finding Dory is a charming, colorful and entertaining film that will be loved by all ages. Starring Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and Ed O'Neill, Finding Dory is packed with laughs and sentimental moments that will keep you laughing and tearing up during the 97 minute running time. In ""Finding Dory"", Dory has sudden memory of her long-lost family, she goes on an adventure to find them. Directed by Andrew Stanton, Finding Dory will be favored by your kids over the Summer.The voice cast is absolutely perfect, and work so well with the characters. Dory stands in as the protagonist in this film. This transition was not made perfect by Pixar in Cars 2 or Monsters University, but they have finally made protagonist changing perfect. Dory is played not played for laughs like the first, but more an emotional, yet well thought out character. A new character is introduced for comedy, which is Hank, an Octopus played by Ed O'Neill, who steals every scene he is in.Andrew Stanton returns to direct after Finding Nemo, Wall-E and John Carter. Stanton proves once again that he is an avid story-teller. Stanton decorates the film with marvelous, attractive colors which are appealing to the eye. Andrew Stanton marvelously mixes laughs and emotion to make a memorable trip to the movies.The third act was when all the greatness stopped and the film started to decline. The third act ruined the consistency of the movie and almost turned it into an action film. Although, the film gets you back in the last five minutes and gets you feeling all bubbly again.Despite a disappointing third act, Finding Dory was a beautiful trip down memory lane. The voice cast, directing and animation is to be commended. After some recent difficulty with Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University, I think it's safe to say that Pixar are back on top again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dory Never Reaches the Same Depths As Nemo, But It's Still a Lot of Fun","Whilst Pixar has a deserving reputation for being one of the greatest animation studios of all time, their sequels have tended to be a lot more hit and miss. The second and third Toy Story films are some of the studios best works, but its other sequels 'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' are probably the studios biggest disappointments. As for finding Dory it's probably somewhere between these two extremes. It doesn't quite live up to Finding Nemo, but it's still a worthwhile sequel that still better than the mediocrity of 'Cars 2'.Taking place about a year after the first film, Dory (Elen DeGeneres) has started a happy new life with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence). But one day when helping out with a class trip at Nemo's school Dory see's something that remind her about her family and she realises she has to find them. Knowing what it's like to lose their family, Marlin and Nemo go with Dory on a journey across the ocean to find her family. Their search quickly leads them to an aquarium (wisely changed from being located at Seaworld after the Blackfish documentary) where Dory rediscovers her roots and remembers her life before she found Nemo.It's a good story and one that does feel like an organic development from the first film, but it does feel like a step down from Finding Nemo. Whilst the journey still allows for a lot of emotional moments, there's never the same feeling of urgency or danger as there was in the first film. Plus everything just feels like it's happening on a smaller scale this time. Instead of focusing on a vast adventure across the sea, it's much more scaled down from Finding Nemo taking place almost entirely within the aquarium. It's still a fun setting, but it fails to recapture either the epic scale of Marlins adventure across the ocean, or Nemo's hilariously confined setting of a dentist's fish bowl.Unlike Cars 2 where Mater never felt like he was a strong enough character to be the lead, it really felt natural to have Dory become the lead. Dory has such a likable personality and DeGeneres' incredible comedic timing makes it difficult not to love her. Plus she's still able to have a lot of powerful emotional moments, including one dramatic sequence that shows her before meeting Marlin and searching the sea for years slowly forgetting her family across her lifetime. It's also a lot of fun to see Albert Brooks return as Marlin and it's nice to see how he's become Dory's surrogate family. But Nemo's return was a little more disappointing. He's still the cute and kind clownfish that we knew from the first film, but he never really has much to do in the film other than just tag along.There's also a range of new aquatic creatures that the gang encounters when they're exploring the aquarium. There's Destiny (Katilyn Olson) a blind whale who Dory knew as a child who offers a friendly glimpse in to Dory's past. A pair of kind sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) who want to do nothing but nap on their rock. Though the best addition is a octopus with a missing leg named Hank (Ed O'Neil) the loner who is says he's helping Dory for his own gain, but is shown to be a creature with 3 hearts of gold. He's also a real scene stealer with a dry wit and some really creative and over the top sequences showing him getting around the aquarium. Seeing him blend in to environments and sling himself across the aquarium does lead to the most visually creative sequences of the film.Parts of the film does seem a little too over the top at times. Even for a film with talking fish, some moments where we see fish flying through the air or at one point even driving a truck seems a little too unbelievable. But it does always remain fun. Plus whilst the film shares several story ideas and characters to its predecessor, it's still able to remain wholly original by introducing its own ideas about family and has several scenes that will be able to resonate with audiences of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dull and unnecessary repetition of original,"I'll come out and admit up front that ""Finding Nemo"" is not one of my favourite Pixar movies. When it was released I found it quite easily the least funny Pixar movie to date and, having followed ""Monsters Inc."", I worried that Pixar were shifting their focus to the kids in the audience without delivering so many of the clever references and gags that are the core of their appeal to adults. Happily ""The Incredibles"" followed the subsequent year, still the best movie the studio has produced.Critical reception for ""Finding Dory"" convinced me to give it a go, but I wish I had listened to my instincts to avoid this one. Much like its predecessor, the film is generally lacking in humour and barely raised a chuckle from me throughout. Not much thought seems to have gone into making clever gags, exemplified by the oft-mentioned use of Sigourney Weaver as voice talent. It's like someone at Pixar said ""Hey, wasn't it funny when we had Sigourney Weaver as the voice of the ship's computer in ""WALL-E""? Well, yes, it was - because that was a clever reference to the film ""Alien"". Here, no such reference exists, so it's just unfunny name-dropping.The lack of humour compounds upon a really weak story line that is soul-drainingly repetitive. It is no spoiler to say that the vast majority of this movie consists of the three main characters being split up on their way somewhere, managing to get back together again and then immediately being split up again. It happened over and over again until I was internally screaming at the film to come to a merciful end. The film's emotional core is a simple rehash of the original and never rises above the bargain-basement ""Family is good"" and ""You can do it if you try"" tropes of a million other kids films. It's a far cry from the subtlety exhibited by last year's ""Inside Out"".Possibly most damning of all is the fact that this movie doesn't even push the visual boundaries of the original. Considering that it's been 13 years I was expecting to be wowed by some great underwater visuals, but this film doesn't look any better than its predecessor. Disappointing to say the least.Overall this is definitely one to skip unless its to keep young children occupied for 90 minutes. Given that next year we have an unwanted 3rd ""Cars"" movie, we'll have to hope that original IP ""Coco"" can demonstrate the qualities that we've come to expect from Pixar - they're in short supply here.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great film for the whole family!,Everything about this movie was delightful and truly was a treat for the whole family. Just do your best to not suffer from short term memory loss and follow the sea shells or the roads (if you live above sea level) back home after it's over. I have noticed some overtones that might offend people in other recent Disney movies but I really don't think there was an offensive thing in this entire movie and it will tug at your heart strings as well. Pixar brings you back to the magical underwater world that Finding Nemo was lost in. Pixar usually knocks them out of the park and they definitely did a great job with this flick too! So go grab a friend or the entire family and come out and see Finding Dory!,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another lesson for another generation,"Like one should expect from a traditional animated film, this is a story that teaches another lesson to another generation. Disney always tells us the stories about being nice and friendly, so does ""Finding Dory"". It has delivered us once again the feeling of affection and care that once ""Finding Nemo"" brought to us.""Finding Dory"" is directed by Andrew Stanton, a job well done like he did in ""Finding Nemo"". Albert Brooks as Marlin did excellent as expected. Although i think Ellen DeGeneres as Dory could have done little more with her character in this sequel, the additional characters like Hank (Ed O'Neill) and Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) have carried her well enough to make us not feel the doubt. We all were attracted by that innocent adorable blue tang Dory in ""Finding Nemo"", this movie is exactly about the same Dory trying to find her long lost parents.So, after the successful venture of Marlin and Dory to find Nemo, they are all back home happy and playful. In the homey environment, Dory starts to miss her mom and dad. Then she decides to go on a search for them in spite of the dangers she might face in the open ocean and with the disease she already possesses, short-term memory loss. Even thought Marlin, paranoid as always, doesn't want anyone to leave the sweet home anymore but for Dory, it is a very different situation. Darlin and his son Nemo joins Dory anyway to help find her parents.The movie is as expected is family friendly, admirable and worth watching. Same as its initial sequel, it touches our heart and soul.The animation is as usual the best Pixar can provide, casts are perfect and the story is well written. Although it is sometimes hard to catch things about how characters move from one place to another, as long as it teaches us the essentials of living life, it is fine with me.Friends are the ones that make our journey of life better in every aspect possible, family is what matters the most, there's nothing we can't do if we are destined to do it, the movie is all about these lessons presented in the most adorable way possible. There could not be another better way to teach our kids as well as ourselves about the beauty of life, living with kindness love and adventure, then this movie itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Before Nemo, a long ago another child got lost in the open ocean...","Whoa! 200 million dollar film, 1 billion box office collections worldwide. The 27th film to do that so and the 5th animation film. This sequel was made after 13 years, surely a long gab, but 'Finding Nemo' was one of my favourite animations, tell me who does not love it those who love animation. Nevertheless, I liked the idea of having a sequel, but I scared it would go to flop terribly. Now, after watching this, I totally stunned. This is not a greatest animation ever made, but the way the screenplay handled, along with other stuffs, this makes one of the best among its kind.Firstly, when I heard the sequel's title, it made me laugh. Like, whaaaat? Once again the story is going to repeat. I did not think it would bring a big change. Actually, it was a different tale, especially I was not expecting it to be emotional. Tell me how many tearjerker-animation you have seen. Once again the Disney-Pixar jointly did it. I think appreciation must go to the director who also made the original film. Great casting too, I mean the voice- over artists.We know that Dory is severely suffering from the short term remembory (memory) loss. Now this tale is going to reveal her backstory. From her childhood to till she meets Marlin and then Nemo, there was a series of forgotten events. She slowly regains some of those memories and begins her quest to find out more. This is where she gets lost, but the title defines that she was lost before and now looking a way to get back where she really belongs.For me, after 'Frozen', this film is what emotionally got me. The value of having family and friends beautifully disclosed. It might be an animation, but still a meaningful story from many perspectives. Lots of new characters were introduced and those were really cool ones. I expect theirs short animations to make its way about their origins, particularly Hank the octopus and his story about how he lost one of his tentacles.The Oscars is the quarter of a year away, but releasing nominees would come weeks ahead. So it's about time to learn where this one fit in. But I'm anticipating close contest between this, 'Zootopia' and 'Red Turtle'. Coming back to the review, this is a good watch, for everybody, so I highly recommend it. I hope there will be a third film, but like I had felt before this, I desire it and then I'm not sure it would extend its legacy to further. So fingers crossed!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory is a spy thriller with fish,"Beneath its cute facade, Finding Dory is a spy thriller. Impulsive and daring Dory (swimming not stirred) must stealthily navigate the secret tunnels of the Marine Life Institute. A horn-heavy soundtrack and Sia's belting rendition of Unforgettable would effortlessly fit into any Bond film. Instead of Q, Dory has Hank, the ""septopus"" who can assume perfect camouflage, drink coffee, and drive vehicles.

"It's sweet and consistently funny, but never breaks new ground","Hollywood's fascination with lost and found themes is unendingwhether literally, or figuratively when characters go on cathartic journeys to 'discover' themselves. Finding Dory, sequel to Pixar's gorgeous, emotional classic Finding Nemo falls somewhere in between. Dory, the Blue Tang fish with a short-term memory problem does get lost, and clownfish father-son Marlon and Nemo have to find her. But Dory is also looking for her lost identity here and searching for home.Is Finding Dory the visual sucker-punch that Nemo was 13 years ago? No, but it is a solid sequel – the film has its share of teary moments, there are many hilarious characters, and some dazzling animation on display. All of this makes up for the fact that the film feels overlong and has an unmistakable been-there-seen-that quality to it.Kooky amnesiac Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) finds herself remembering flashes of a childhood spent with her loving parents (Eugene Levy & Diane Keaton), and sets off all the way across the ocean to California's Marine Life Institute to find them. When her friends Marlon (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (Hayden Rolence) lose her, we watch two parallel sets of misadventures. Dory gets help from Hank (Ed O'Neill), a cranky scene-stealing octopus who has incredible camouflage powers. Meanwhile, Marlon and Nemo rely on the kindness of two cockney-voiced sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) and a madly eccentric bird named Becky. A near-sighted whale shark Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) and her Beluga whale pal Bailey (Ty Burrell) regularly step up to help Dory navigate her way out of danger. And there's also Sigourney Weaver, making a terrific voice-only cameo as herself.This being Pixar, we get multiple subliminal messages delivered over the course of the film – that you can dare to be different, how not to let your disability stand in your way, and that friends can be your family. Director Andrew Stanton, who also helmed Finding Nemo, does a great job conveying these themes and ideas, but Finding Dory also gets sucked into the sameness of the scenarios that dominated the earlier film.Ellen DeGeneres is once again the heart of the film as Dory. Her scatterbrained ramblings sound a little old when the film opens, but she flies (literally!) as the story progresses. As for Hank, the moody octopus, he deserves his own spin-off movie – somebody make that happen!. It's sweet and consistently funny, but never breaks new ground.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory Among Pixar's Magic,"The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.Finding Dory is written and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, returning to Pixar after the live-action fiasco of John Carter. Pixar movies have been so consistently good for so long now that they carry the burden of infinite expectations. Anything less than a masterpiece is eventually a disappointment. That's why Finding Dory is fine. It's not Toy Story, The Incredible, Finding Nemo or even Inside Out. But it's a perfectly enjoyable family film, a little bit like what we got when I was younger – back in the 90s, Disney used to ship straight to DVD/VHS those Lion King spin-offs. Unfortunately, you also feel a sense of déjà vu. Dory's quest to be reunited with her parents is more or less the same exact fate that a little clown fish named Nemo.Dory, that adorable, excited blue tang fish, suffers from short-term memory loss. The slightest distraction or break in concentration wipes her mind clean. The creators have done something better: they figured out how to take an already perfect character and deepen her in an exquisitely satisfying way. In a flash, a character with a singular funny trait comes at us in a whole new way. She's no longer a (daffy) amnesiac. She's a child fish with a serious disability.There's real emotion. You feel every (ounce) of Dory's panic and her parents' desperation – something that any father or mother who's ever taken their eyes off of their children in a supermarket can identify with (I assume). On her own Dory grows up and matures into the impressible, caffeinated stammering of Ellen DeGeneres – who is the heart and soul of the movie. Like Robin Williams before her in Aladdin, Ellen DeGeneres has this gift as a comedian to keep the film moving and speeding along. Dory's glory is that her amnesia makes her completely responsive to life. This film eventually is about how the past, for her, isn't really so past. It's just the ability to remember life as we're living it, one moment at a time.As surely as the death of Bambi's mother, the premises of this movie rips a small emotional hole in the audience's heart. One of this film most important messages is how resonant Dory will be for parents of children with disabilities. To them, life can feel like a lonely struggle where anxiety constantly affects their state of mind. If you are invested hard enough, the film's message to these parents is: you are not alone! Dory's failing memory may be a handicap, but it's also the key to her resilience. Finally, this movie like many before it invites you to dive in with your eyes, which is why these movies are submersive daydreams for children. Who needs 3D glasses? Even if you – like me – happen to see this film in 2D, just about every shot in it pops out at you with beauty.Overall through her journey Dory learns to remember what life is all about. This film doesn't quite fit in the top drawer as it lacks that full-on audacity of imagination. Yet, it has so much soul and heart-of-the-ocean visual poetry that some of us will cherish it as a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unforgettable journey she probably won't remember,"The first film Finding Nemo (2003) is a fantastic Disney Pixar animated film that is funny, entertaining, and heartfelt from beginning to end, so having a sequel thirteen years later did make me worry a little bit; after watching it, though not better than the first film, this sequel is still excellent and is almost as good as the film before with it being just as funny, entertaining, and heartfelt as the first. The sequel Finding Dory (2016) is just as enjoyable and funny as the first movie, with its excellent voice acting, fantastic 3D animation, likable characters, heartfelt/touching moments, and an investing story about Dory remembering her past and trying to find her family; they did a great job making Dory less of a comic relief side-character to an interesting and likable character, especially with how they handle her disability not just for humor but for touching moments and is used to keep the movie going at a nice fast pace, with an occasional slow moment that works nicely.Once again Ellen DeGeneres is fantastic as Dory, with her having this wonderful journey to find her parents which leads to a Marine Life Institute, and I like how we slowly get more fragments of her memories with her parents as the film progresses letting us put things together; she is a likable and funny character who has her short term memory loss used both in a comedic aspect and a heartfelt/serious aspect for the story, which was nice to have a good balance because it could have gotten annoying if they did it poorly. We have Albert Brooks doing a great job again as Marlin and have Hayden Rolence as Nemo, it was nice seeing these characters again and having them help Dory find her parents, but later must try and find her in the Marine Life Institute; I still like the friendship between them and Dory, and that they have to put more trust in her to do certain things. Lastly, there are new characters like Hank grumpy but likable octopus voiced great by Ed O'Neill who helps Dory around the Marine Life Institute to find her parents, a whale shark named Destiny voiced well by Kaitlin Olson who is Dory's old friend, and Bailey voiced well by Ty Burrell who is Bailey's neighbor.The 3D animation is excellent, with the sea creatures having real-looking but animated designs, and the look of the ocean water looking pretty with it being shown during different times of day and how it shows them going in and out of the water, along with the Marine Life Institute being nice to look at with its different exhibits and/or locations; the emotional/touching moments are highly effective with it showing Dory's backstory and her relationship with her parents, and the movie is funny from beginning to end, both the emotional/touching moments and the funny moments blend well together, especially with the short term memory loss aspect of the film which does not get annoying and is used very well. I like that there is no real villain in the film, and that it is just Dory trying to find her parents while trying to escape the Marine Life Institute, along with the ways she gets fragments of her memories and uses them to go from location to location is handled nicely and used cleverly; this is good because it easily could have gotten annoying after a while with her forgetting things a lot, but luckily it does not.The sequel Finding Dory (2016) is just as enjoyable and funny as the first movie, with its excellent voice acting, fantastic 3D animation, likable characters, heartfelt/touching moments, and an investing story about Dory remembering her past and trying to find her family; they did a great job making Dory less of a comic relief side-character to an interesting and likable character, especially with how they handle her disability not just for humor but for those touching/heartfelt moments, and it works very well. I am glad this is a very good Disney Pixar sequel, because you never know how a sequel to a fantastic film will go, so that is why I highly recommend giving this a watch; Disney Pixar fans who love the first film will like this film, and it is worth rewatching just as much as the first.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The first Pixar sequel to best the original,"In all honesty, like many others, I went into Finding Dory without much anticipation. While I expected it to be a good film, this is Pixar!!, I did not expected to be amazed, and boy was I wrong. Finding Dory is not only an improvement on Finding Nemo, but I would say it ranks among Pixar's best films. The magic of Finding Dory is found in its surprisingly emotional story and its colorful characters. The way the story is presented with the use of flashbacks, and the emphasis on short term memory loss adds a great amount of emotional weight to the typical ""searching for my family"" storyline. The importance of family is stressed through both the flashbacks, and some callbacks to Finding Nemo which forces the viewer to quickly become attached to Dory's personal story. The execution of the plot is done just as well as the film moves at a perfect pace, never appearing rushed or dull at any point. The well constructed story is further helped buy an amazing cast of supporting characters. Each character plays a particular role in the story, and the awareness of knowing the capacity of the role each character has helps in the development and balance of these characters. The inclusion of a slew on new characters makes Finding Dory really feel like a Dory film, and the chemistry between Dory and each new ally feels genuine! Finding Dory is yet another victory for Pixar as they once again prove their ability to blend mature, emotional stories with wildly entertaining characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fun adventure, both don't expect to witness a magic of the first one","Greetings from Lithuania.""Finding Dory"" (2016) was a very colorful, fun and always entertaining animated feature. Surely it isn't as smart and amazing as the ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) was, this one is more to kids. As crazy as it sounds, the first movie was more realistic (did i just said that?) and smart, this one takes its premise more optimistic and one over the top adventure follows another. Script was pretty OK, it has its moments and it is sometimes funny, but more this is just a sweet and very colorful adventure to the youngest audience.Overall, i enjoyed ""Finding Dory"". Voice acting was superb, visuals were amazing and there were some interesting and very impressive ""action"" sequences (""Hands!"").

Even better than the first one,"In 2003, ""Finding Nemo"" became a legendary film as it would soon become the best selling DVD of all time! That would be a tough act to follow, right? Luckily, they made a sequel just as awesome. I am so glad that Pixar is more like ""Inside Out"" this time instead of ""The Good Dinosaur"". Interestingly enough, the movie isn't really about finding Dory, but about finding Dory's parents. It helps that this is probably the best animation that Pixar has ever given us. I was afraid that this movie was going to just be a reprise of the original. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it really did use all new stuff.The best part is how I really felt for Dory in this. I wanted her to be happy! I wanted her to find her parents! We get a few other characters from the first movie, but only in cameos. It helps that there are tons of funny moments and great new characters. Even the credits build up to the rising of the surface. In the first movie, it seemed to show the humans as villains. I found this to be an improvement as it instead showed the humans as sincerely wanting to help the fish. It just wasn't quite in the right way. I'm really tired of PETA's influence. All the characters are lots of fun, but Dory herself truly steals the show, as expected. It was just a movie where you had to see what would happen next. You want it to go on as long as possible but not to the point where they would run out of ideas.

A heartfelt underwater journey,"""Finding Dory,"" directed by Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, takes audiences back to the enchanting underwater world of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo."" This time, the spotlight is on Dory, the forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, as she embarks on a quest to find her long-lost parents.The film's animation is stunning, capturing the vibrant and diverse marine life with meticulous detail. Ellen DeGeneres brings warmth and humor to Dory, making her journey both touching and entertaining. The supporting cast, including Albert Brooks as Marlin and new characters like Hank the septopus (Ed O'Neill) and Destiny the whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), add depth and charm to the story.While ""Finding Dory"" is packed with heartfelt moments and humor, it occasionally feels like a retread of ""Finding Nemo,"" lacking some of the original's novelty and emotional punch. The plot is straightforward, with a focus on themes of family, perseverance, and self-acceptance.Overall, ""Finding Dory"" is a visually beautiful and emotionally resonant film that offers a delightful underwater adventure, even if it doesn't quite match the impact of its predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awful!,"I love Finding Nemo so for me, this movie was a disappointment. The plot was weak and it seemed like they couldn't think of a proper way to end it. The graphics wasn't as good as last time and Dory seemed to have lost her charm. They played on her forgetting to bring forced humour. In Finding Nemo the characters were all lovable and unique but in this one they were all similar and uninteresting. After all the buildup of Dory trying to find her family, when she finally did it wasn't powerful enough. I had to roll my eyes when Dory was driving the truck with the octopus because it was so cliché. The only scenes that were good were Dory's memories of when she was a baby, she was adorable! Overall, a good movie but nowhere near Pixars' normal standards.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dory is a fun-loving, energetic fish who embraces the essence of family and perseverance.","Bubbly; heartwarming; a classic. While many teens may opt to watch the latest depictions of extreme horror or unrealistic romance, Finding Dory presents a fundamental lesson about perseverance that teens often neglect as they grow older. Dory is a fun-loving, hilarious fish with a condition of ""short term memory loss."" When Dory gets separated from her parents as a child, she spends her whole life trying to remember where she came from and how to get home. When she meets Marlin and his son, Nemo, they embark on an adventurous journey to get Dory home. Despite encountering multiple obstacles and dead ends, Dory does not lose hope. She does whatever she can to pursue her lifelong goal: to find her parents. The film is full of whale calling, sea lion flapping, and seagull soaring through Dory's wild adventure. Stanton beautifully combines an important life lesson with cute humor and energetic talking fish to convey a story that will satisfy everyone's taste. Nemo, Marlin, and Dory are irresistibly cute characters, and Dory's comments will leave you laughing until you cry. This is a perfect movie if you are looking for a cute, heartwarming story about a little fish, the vast, dangerous ocean, and the power of perseverance driven by the force of ""family.""",,Anonymous,Animation
Not like the first one but still sweet and emotional.,"Everything that happened with Dory in this movie made you feel for her as a character quite a bit. It was for sure an emotional journey to watch and follow throughout the whole film. The voice actors did well too, and more notably, the not so subtle presence of Sigourney Weaver in the film portraying her very own voice.The negatives of the film are mainly that I felt a bit more connected to the original, and the first one felt more urgent and dangerous/threatening the whole time, primarily in a more creepy and mature way even. Back then, kids movies took a larger risk with its audience and I like that as an adult looking back. The first one came across as a more creative story than this installment and very outlandish and downright ridiculous things happened that came across as unbelievable even for a kid's Pixar movie (especially toward the very end). How do fish and sea creatures know about so many surface-level things that they shouldn't know about??Overall it's not the best sequel but at the same time, not that bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Twizard Rating: 98,"Boy, Pixar sure needed this one. After mostly marginal efforts since 2010's Toy Story 3, they had to deliver something to raise our expectations back up. Something undeniable.This sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo acts as an origins story for everyone's favorite absent- minded fish, Dory. It shows her as a cute little baby, stumbling over her words and innocently gazing into her parents' eyes. Then, one day, her short-term memory loss gets the best of her and she loses her family, unable to remember how.While most animated films abandon the cute, young version of the main character early on in the film, Finding Dory finds a way to utilize it throughout the whole thing, in the form of of Dory's flashbacks.It's not necessarily as phenomenal as its predecessor, but Finding Dory is definitely a fantastic movie! We get some new characters who are just as hilarious as the ones from the last-- including two British sea lions who won't allow Gerald to sit on their rock.It's the funniest Pixar film since Toy Story 3. Some jokes had me laughing long after the credits rolled.The one and only things that really bothers me are the one or two contrived plot devices. In a deus ex machina fashion, the film takes minor liberties with echolocation and features a ridiculous scene where an octopus drives a truck. But I guess, in Pixar's world, where even toys can talk, anything is possible. But the studio has always been good about walking the line between realistic and impossible--even amidst their own well-crafted impossible universes. But the octopus car sequence throws all that out the window. And it's kinda silly. Your kids will get a kick out of it though.Still, Finding Dory is something to behold. It's so enjoyable and packed with unforced emotion and unique outlooks on mental handicaps, that we can shrug off even the largest of its minor pitfalls. You can only quibble so much before you realize that the pros far outweigh the cons. To the point where you just can't deny how good it is. it's undeniable.Twizard Rating: 98",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Finding Dory made me laugh, giggle, cry and laugh some more.","Likes: Everything about this film!! Hahah!! Characters - of course,Dory is given to be the funniest character in Finding Nemo but in this film, I get to know her even more. She's more than that. I also loved Hank the octopus (septipus), Becky, Destiny and a lot more. Plot - even though it's more on of finding Dory's parents, at the end of the film you'll understand why it's Finding Dory. :') Humor - of course, it's not gonna be such a huge hit if Dory's antics won't be funny but more than that, new characters brought more laughs in this film. I would love to have a Finding Hank or Finding Destiny sequel. LoL. Hank is just so funny.Dislikes: Pacing/Editing - there were just some scenes where I got bored for a few seconds, maybe because I wanted Dory and her parents to meet already. :DOver All Impression: Finding Dory made me laugh, giggle, cry and laugh some more.

A Journey Over Waters Not to be Easily Forgotten,"To tell the truth, I was at first worried about how Finding Dory would turn out. I originally feared it would become nothing besides the writers taking advantage of nostalgic fan service to overuse the famous character's short-term memory loss solely for laughs. Worst of all, it would dumb her down into an offensive stereotype toward people who actually have her condition. But you know what? Finding Dory instead did the opposite, showing how tragic short-term memory loss can really be for a poor little fish.It all appropriately starts with Dory as a cute little tyke being taught by her parents how to explain her short-term memory loss to others. Then this touching opening turns immediately devastating as she wonders if she would ever forget her parents. Mom and pop simply affirm to her: follow the shells to find her way home. Then suddenly, she unexplainably appears in the middle of a dark kelp forest, separated from her parents. What happened to them? Where are they? How can she find her way home?It would be easy, except she doesn't remember.Now little Dory has nothing to do other than wander the ocean asking random fish where her mommy and daddy are. Yes, only five minutes in and it's already the second most devastating way to start a family movie (number one being Up). Eventually, she forgets what she's even searching for, left only to wander the ocean for the rest of her life, questioning her own existence. Here is where Marlin comes in. ​ One year later, she's living in a coral bed across Marlin and Nemo's anemone. Life seems just fine, until a freak accident causes her to remember something: her parents are in California! Thus, she talks Marlin and Nemo into going with her across the ocean to find her parents. Once a traumatizing giant squid attack follows after a trip through the EAC, Dory gets separated from her clown fish friends, ending up in the Marine Life Institute, quarantined and tagged for shipment to the Cleveland aquarium. Yet she'll stop at nothing to find her family! Picture Yes, it is unbelievably tragic to see how her short-term memory loss got her into such a bad place; it makes her character in Finding Nemo so much deeper, accomplishing exactly what any sequel should accomplish. But she thankfully has some friends to help her along the way.There's Hank the cranky octopus, whose slippery tentacle movements create some phenomenal visual gags with his camouflage ability. There's Destiny the ditsy whale shark, who can't stop running her head into things. There's Bailey the beluga whale, who adds some fantastic comedic material with his whale shark friend. There's Becky the silent loon, who pecks at anything that moves. There's Rudder and Fluke, the lazy sea lions who are relatively weak in spite of some definite hard-hitting laughs. There's the irresistibly cute otters who you just want to cuddle with. Then there's Dory's loving parents, who undeniably care for their little girl.Along with the memorable new characters and intense emotion, the world's setup also adds tremendous influence on Dory's journey of literal self-discovery. While it's not in the ocean, it's for the majority of the part in the amusement park reminiscing Sea World. The film's director Andrew Stanton has stated that Finding Dory features a new upgrade for their usual RenderMan system, allowing the animators to craft indirect light. Now let me tell you something: it pays off— each individual location has its own set of colors and textures to brim its own unique feel, making you feel like you're there. It's incredible to see how the barnacles and kelp decorate the environment, as well as how the soft, vivid memories of Dory are rendered as they come back to her. The aquarium's brilliant blue fish tank looks the most visually satisfying of all the set pieces, all even more of an immersive delight in 3D. It almost seems like computer animation exists specifically for underwater animation.In the end, the stunning animation adds so much power into Dory's discovery of her past. It's all a matter of asking, ""What would Dory do?"" I felt surprisingly empowered while seeing a seemingly hopeless fish like Dory resolved a major issue independently by learning the way around her disability. Contrary to my thoughts coming into the theater, the mentally disabled can learn quite a bit from Finding Dory.Whether if you have Alzheimer's, dementia, down syndrome, autism, Asperger's, or even are a bit short on remembering things, keep in mind one philosophy for you to live by: whatever seems to hold you back from everyone else will never hold you back from yourself. If Dory can ignore her mental situation to make it all the way to a Californian aquarium, then you can do similar. If Dory can remember little things by seeing related items, you too can do similar. Dory has her own unique way of remembering things which works toward her survival. As for you, you too have that one unique thing to help you to overcome your one unique obstacle. Therefore, I recommend Finding Dory to family, kids, teens, everyone.You've already heard this said many times before but here it is: Pixar, you've done it again!Overall Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Hit By Pixar,"First the negatives: 1) I found the first half hour of the film boring. 2) I have concerns that the film might be too scary for younger children, so ask others who have seen it first to determine if your child can enjoy it. 3) Some parts of the plot felt meandering. 4) Some aspects of the story felt like clichés (and very reminiscent of ""The Wizard of Oz""). Not every aspect of the story must be original, but this felt particularly derivative.That said, I enjoyed the film after the first thirty minutes. I especially thought it picked up when the characters voiced by Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill (""Modern Family"" costars) entered the story,Pixar's animation, as usual, is tremendous. Some of the sequences feel like ""Mission Impossible"" and they are rendered with inspiration.Watch for Gerald, who steals the show during the brief scenes when he is on screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A bland sequel - as to be expected by Pixar as of late,"Pixar has not had the best track record as of late releasing mediocre films such as ""The Good Dinosaur"", ""Brave"" and lifeless sequels such as ""Monsters University"" and to an extent ""Toy Story 3"", so going into this one I did not have high expectations. While somewhat more enjoyable than the previous films mentioned, ""Finding Dory"" just does not have much going for it, which is to be expected considering how unnecessary this sequel is. Finding Nemo was a great film on its own and it seems that Pixar is cashing in this time by attempting to ""expand"" the side character of Dory, and the result was not great.In the first 10-20 mins Dory is excruciatingly annoying, having all the conversations revolve around her, the short-term memory condition gets painful really fast, especially in the attempt to make brainless, lazy ""jokes"". This just goes to show that Dory's character was never intended to be front and center, but rather as comic relief, and similar to ""Cars 2"" with Mater, while it works in the first one it is simply tiring in the sequel. Pixar knew this well, and tried to fix it by having the movie spend wasted time with Marlin and Nemo with little attempt to expand their characters.Although, rather than expanding Dory's character, they just rehash her arc from the first one, and instead give her an uninspired backstory relying purely on Dory being ""cute"". What ensues is another typical, generic Pixar ""adventure"", plagued with unnecessary flashbacks that only serve to interrupt the flow of the movie.I will say however that the most enjoyable part of the film were the various humorous parts of the movies such as the Seals and also Octopus, a character that endured more growth throughout the movie than the lead. On the other hand, there were also the film's fair share of brainless jokes, such as the Sigourney Weaver announcement that was repeated so many times that it had a numbing effect, alongside the rehashed jokes from the first one including the whale calling and ""just keep swimming"" song that only remind the audience just how far Pixar have fallen.Overall, ""Finding Dory"" is by no means awful, it is however an extremely mediocre, average and forgettable film, adding yet another blemish on what used to be Pixar's quality track record. The future for the studio is not looking bright with 3 out of the 4 movies in production being more sequels, but let's hope that they have the capacity to try something different or at least slightly straying from the norm.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The bar was to high for Dory to swim through,"This animation tells the story of a young fish who has a severe anterograde amnesia. She loses her parents, and spends a very long time looking for them.I find myself constantly amazed by the quality of the animation. Not only is realistic, it even has appropriate depth of field according to the distance of the objects from the viewers!As for the main character, I find Dory a little annoying because the amnesic jokes are far too frequent and overly repetitive. She's not as cute as Nemo either, but cute enough. The children in the cinema maintain their concentration, didn't talk or run around. However they are not overly excited either. I guess that also reflects my opinion of the film. It is an adequately entertaining animation, but not as engaging, touching or fun as expected. I guess the bar was to high for Dory to swim through.",,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining,"The animated sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) reverses the plight of the main characters: this time it is the memory-challenged bluefish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) rather than clownfish Nemo (Hayden Romence) who gets lost during a search to find her long-lost parents. Nemo and his father Marlin (Albert Brooks) try to find and rescue Dory with the aid of many other new characters. As this is an animated film, there are many antics, perils and troubleshooting that ensue.Like its prequel, this film has beautiful animation especially in the beginning as the camera follows the sea creature characters through long and fast journeys. The main characters and the array of new ones are quite funny and entertaining. The delightful DeGeneres is quite enjoyable throughout especially her high-energy flow of humour at the start. At times, she reminds one of the benchmark for animated performances: Robin Williams in ""Aladdin"" (1992).There are times ""Finding Dory"" is less than what it could be especially a pivotal scene in the second half. This scene began with the right emotional impact but then became too casual too soon. But by the end, the movie does what a Pixar/Disney cartoon is supposed to do: entertain. When the climactic scene is met with Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"", we know we are entering goosebump movie heaven. What a wonderful world, indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"While it May not have the Same Sense of Adventure, the Heart is Still Strong,","Finding Doey is a terrific movie with a well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It was the correct choice for a sequel, as we follow Dory, who takes the spotlight in this film, struggling to remember her family in order to retrieve them. She was a highlight of Finding Nemo, despite the fact she was underdeveloped, so giving her the lead role was a wise choice from Pixar as it gave her character time to expand.I was disappointed by the lack of adventure in this film, in Nemo they travel across the whole ocean and it is quite thrilling, not so much with Dory, as it all takes place in a Marine Life Institute, it made me feel confined to this space. I felt the story should have been stretched out further.As well as that, many characters from the original do not appear. Dory, Marlin and Nemo are present, of course, but there are several other characters, such as Bruce the Shark, Nigel and Squirt, who do not appear which let me down as I would love to have seen how they were. Even Crush only appears briefly and feels thrown in.The voice cast is one of the films highlight, Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks are still in great form in their famous roles. They are joined by an excellent new cast that includes Ed O'Neill as a sarcastic octopus, Kaitlin Olson as an optimistic whale, Ty Burrell as a pessimistic beluga, Idris Elba as a lazy seal, not to mention Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton as Dory's parents. Sweet, funny and beautifully animated, the biggest downfall of Finding Dory is that Finding Nemo must be compared to it, it's a great ride, a mostly pleasing sequel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.Dory seeks Marlin and Nemo's help to find her parents, who she lost a long time ago as a result of her short term memory.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It does have laughs and heart touching scenes, but Finding Nemo had more of both and stronger supporting characters. Oh, I saw Finding Dory today. I liked it, but not loved it.

Family,"At this point, I'll wait another 10 years for Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4. Instead of unnecessarily cranking out sequels every year or two to capitalize on box office success, Pixar waited 13 years to give us Finding Dory. For me, it was well worth the wait. With plenty of heart along with a well-structured and poignant story, this Pixar sequel will give you all the feels.Refreshingly, I went into the film knowing and seeing little to nothing from the film. I watched the trailers when they were released, but I wasn't wowed by anything from the marketing campaign. With that said, being a huge fan of the original back in 2003, I definitely had high expectations going in. I won't go as far as saying it's one of the best films of this year, but it will be difficult for any film this year to flood me with the amount of nostalgia and emotion that Finding Dory did.There were a great number of skeptics going in about Dory, a great side character, carrying a film on her own. While the supporting cast certainly helped, I didn't have a problem with the heavy focus on Ellen DeGeneres' famous blue tang fish. Not only is her comedic charm back but the tragic backstory of Dory is what sucked me into the film. The first 10 minutes rivaled some of Pixar's most gut- wrenching moments.Besides Ellen, most of the original voice talent is back, and much like the first film, it's impeccably cast. Sure, it's great hearing Andrew Stanton back as Crush, a fan favorite, but bringing in Idris Elba, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, a few SNL cast members, and one hilariously meta-cameo was brilliant. But dissimilar to other animated features, the cast doesn't overpower the importance of the story being told.Finding Dory isn't without its problems, however. Perhaps it was due to my attachment to the original, but it takes a while to get used to some of the supporting fish and animals. Eventually, they each serve an important and unique purpose, but their first few scenes are sluggish for sure. Similarly, there was something special about the trip Dory and Marlin took around the ocean in the original, and the adventure here never reaches the heights of the first. That's not to say I didn't appreciate the new spin they took with Nemo and the crew, but it just didn't feel the same.Lastly, there are quite a few leaps of faith you have to take as an audience member in the final act. As we reach the emotional climax, it does get a little messy and convoluted, but the overall emotional arc isn't lost. It just takes a few too many jumps at the end in what is otherwise another gem for the studio. It doesn't necessarily meet the original on many fronts, but there is a certain rush of emotion every time I hear Thomas Newman's score. So Pixar just keeps swimming to greatness as Finding Dory is one of the best films of the summer and certainly of the animated genre.+Voice talent+First 10 minutes+Poignant and meticulously crafted story+Beautiful score once again-Spin on the adventure story didn't have the same effect-Some suspension of disbelief is needed for the finale8.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

it's ok,"Not as bad as it's made outLove Albert Brooks.It is all stuff we have seen before, which made for a slow start. When the movie arrives at the aquarium, we finally see something new, but it is only mildly entertaining. At that point Dory's story-line really takes off, which I found to be really sad and overly serious.In the original movie, Dory was quirky, and full of heart and sweetness; she almost personified optimism. Her character does not change in this movie, but the directors' approach toward her mental affliction does. What was a silly but funny affliction in the first movie is now treated as a serious disability. We now see Dory and the characters around her sad, confused, lost, and really scared most of the time. I completely understand what they were going for in this film, especially for families dealing with special needs family members. At the same time, this movie never makes the strong emotional impacts of many other Pixar films. It's more of a downer than a tearjerker.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar Finding Sequel Form,"It's with great pleasure and relief that I'm pleased to report I very much enjoyed Finding Dory.Pixar in recent years have gone back to their hugely successful films seeing sequels to the likes of Cars and Monsters Inc, but unlike those sequels the end product of Finding Dory is a property certainly worth revisiting and was a huge relief to me, yes it can't live up to Finding Nemo, but then again how many animated films can? But what it can do is stand on its own two feet and still be a very entertaining animated feature that really when you look at this years animated films is pretty much head and shoulders above what has been this year, although I'm sure in the coming month or so Kubo and the Two Strings may up the ante in the quality animation stakes.So what does the film get right? Firstly I'm glad they didn't try to go bigger with the story/plot, they didn't try to travail the ocean yet again because we would of just been retreading old ground (or should that be old ocean?) instead they use that kind of plot just on a smaller and possibly more intimate way.The plot focuses on Dory trying to find her parents who of course she has forgotten the location of, in doing so we end up at a sea life rescue centre/park where of we meet an array of new characters who each have very positive effects on the film.The voice work is just another level when it comes to Pixar and this film is no different with Ellen DeGeneres on blistering form as the amnesiac Dory and Pixar have done it again when it comes to casting children in their films because in the flashback scenes where we see Dory as a child they cast seven-year-old Sloane Murray the daughter of this films producer Lindsey Collins and an astonishing unforgettable baby Dory will never be gone from your memory, just superb work.Also like I said earlier the supporting character all have entertaining moments, my particular favourites were a Beluga Whale played by Ty Burrell, a couple of sea lions played by Idris Elba and Dominic West therefore making it a mini Wire reunion, but special mention has to go to Sigourney Weaver who plays...well herself as the park/aquarium intercom announcer, it was funny every single time.It kind of doesn't even need saying but the quality of the animation is outstanding and breathtaking at times, a little mention on this does need to go to the short film Piper that played before the main feature which featured animation that if you were to blink you may struggle to determine whether it was animation or actual footage, phenomenal.Yes it can't compare to Finding Nemo for absolute 10/10 high end quality but its an unfortunate comparison it does have to live with.But overall it was funny, it was heartwarming and briefly it was gut-wrenching, it never overstays its welcome and you are entertained from beginning to end, I mean what more can you want from a film?It's definitely Pixar finding sequel form just at the right moment in time with upcoming project sequels to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles to come in the next three years.It is Pixar doing the business.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
finding dory,"Finding dory has two sides,for a pixar solo film it is good story shown in a cool way,other side is that it isnt so great sequel for finding nemo,some of the jokes didnt work for me and it didnt have so ground breaking effect that first one did,some parts of story get repipative and it felt like they dont have such fresh ideas anymore so they satisfied themselves with copying it but unfortunetly not me,and film felt like just a cashgrabe to get some money from great film before and milk it,some new cast did a good job in voiceacting and animation looked great but that was expected since this is picar,problem is that they didnt give us something new or original to enjoy",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
aDORYable,"The Disney magic has been unleashed once more, and this time they bring us yet another sequel. Today's review takes to the depths of the ocean, to a reef that ten years ago served as the stage for the adventure of three fish in a great blue ocean. Yes, today we review the ever anticipated Finding Dory. Will this sequel be everything you wanted? Has Disney cheated us out of quality once again? Please read to find out.Is it any surprise that Pixar has surprisingly managed to bring comedy to their works? If it is, then shame on you for not watching more of their films. Finding Dory has a little bit of something for everyone that had the audience (including yours truly) laughing up a storm. Kids will love the exaggerated, goofy, slapstick comedy and guttural noises, often repeating the words over again as if a second time will make it even funnier. Adults, however get the better end of the deal for once, with plenty of references that older audience members will relish in, while their kids will just stare at the pretty colors and cute fish.Speaking of cute, despite some of the more adult references this film maintains that charm and magic that Disney brought with the first film. Dory is adorable, her innocence and sincerity by far the most endearing quality of the film. Her flashbacks to her younger self had everyone in the audience going awwwwww, and her moral compass brought the emotional tearjerker to the eye. Outside of the blue tang, Nemo is still as cute as a button and the new addition Destiny was sweet as well.But all of this factors down to the legendary talk show host Ellen providing amazing voice work. Ellen's dynamic personality carries over into Dory and keeps the film fun and energetic (yes like a dog). Her delivery is jokes is perfect and very Ellen like and the more emotional moments are laced with a strong talent Ellen has. Yeah, the other actors did a great job, each providing their own zing, spin, and emotion to the mix, but Ellen as the headlines was the thing that won me over. In particular, the interactions between Hank and Dory were by far the most entertaining of the bunch.As for the animation, there are no surprises that Pixar did a fantastic job as always. The fish move just like fish, delicately floating in the sea until something massive attempts to make dinner out of them. The water itself is also fantastically brought to life, each component of it looking incredibly realistic in terms of texture and fluidity. These detail even carry over to the environment itself, as the reef, wreckage, and the marina are brought out into the high definition detail Pixar is famous for. If only the humans looked better, then everything would fall into place.Okay, I know I'm probably committing a sin by calling out some of the weaknesses to the film, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't provide a full report. Finding Dory's story is one area of improvement that Pixar should have looked into a little more. Think back to Nemo's tale, his dad transversed the whole ocean with Dory facing dangers and uncovering areas of the reef we only saw in documentaries. It was exciting, it was exotic, and it was incredibly detailed. Not the case in this one. Finding Dory had a lot of emotion and the comedy was there to make it fun, but it wasn't as exciting as its predecessor. The dangers of the deep were a little more lax, and the aquarium while stunning, didn't have the same edge we got all those years ago. Seeing Dory's flashbacks were great in the character development strategies, but the obvious foreshadowing and diluted suspense had me feel something was missing.In addition, while the comedy was fun for all ages, it got overdone at times. Yes, little kids can't get enough of anything and from a market standpoint it makes sense. However, in terms of quality, blasting the audience with whale noises, silly sounds, and smacking into walls begins to lower the scores a bit. Most will probably be okay with beating the dead house, but for me I like a little more balance in the comedy than what I got in this film.Jumping back to the story, I felt manay characters got the short end of the stick in this film. No surprise that Dory takes the center stage, hence the title, but does that mean that characters like Marlin and Nemo have to be reduced to a shell of what they once were. Again, think back to Finding Nemo, a good balance between Marlin's adventure and Nemo's struggles in the tank. In this film, Marlin and Nemo are more side characters with some humorous moments, but seldom important for the story. I'm sure this was to help give the movie a different feel, but they could have done better to balance their characters.Finding Dory is still a great addition to the Pixar library. It's fun for all ages, very sweet, and packs the same animation punch this studio is famous for. Unfortunately the story is not as exciting as the first travel into the blue void and some of our characters get the short end that is disappointing. Overall though, I'm happy with the adventure and I hope that many will enjoy this movie as much as I did. Worth the 3-D showing? I can't say it makes the total experience, but the visuals promise even better detail in 3-D. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Yesyes it is.Scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Excellent sequel,"Finding Dory was undoubtedly the most awaited animated movie of the year as it returned to screen after 13 years of Finding Nemo. Getting back in the water 13 years after Finding Nemo, Finding Dory is a supremely delightful sequel. The film defines loss and separations but never make us bore at any point of time. Andre Stanton after his failure with John Carter, came back strongly for which he is best known (Animations). Finding Dory doesn't create new standards for Pixar line of movies but surely makes it worth watching for children as well as Adults. I enjoyed the movie very much and definitely it is one of the best movies of 2016. My overall rating for Finding Dory is 5/5. Highly Appreciable.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just Okay!,"Finding Dory is the sequel to the now 13 year old film, Finding Nemo, which is hailed by some to be one of the best animated films ever. So how does the sequel follow up to such an iconic film? Well I'd say it is a pretty good follow up to a great movie. The film features a strong cast of voice actors including the returning voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, as well as newcomers such as Ed O'Neill, Kaitlin Olson and Idris Elba, who are all fantastic in this film. The movie takes a place a year after the events of Finding Nemo, catching up with Marlin, Dory and Nemo, as Dory begins to have flashbacks to her past, which sends her on a hunt to find her parents. Going into this movie I didn't really know what to expect, a large part of me, didn't have any desire to this film, I knew it would be good cause it's Pixar, but I felt this was a sequel no one was really asking for and felt like nothing more than another cash grab by Pixar, similar to what Cars 2 and Monsters University were. And though at points thats what this sequel felt like, luckily the film felt like it had a proper story to tell and could stand on its own. My biggest worry going into this film was that there creators were taking a side character and making it a protagonist and usually that doesn't work, particularity when the character is one that is of comic relief but this movie manages to pull it off (for the most part) and that is due to inclusion of Hank the octopus who acts as Dory's character foil, similar to what Dory was to Marlin the original film. Though Hank was great, he never came to be as good as Marlin was with his sarcasm and that is how I feel about most of this film. It is definitely good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't great. Apart from the few scenes that packed an emotional punch, I didn't feel a lot during this movie, it didn't have as high of stakes nor did it feel as grand as Finding Nemo did. That may be due to the film taking place in one location for most of the movie, as with Nemo Dory and Marlin's journey took them right across the ocean, encountering unique characters and crazy situations, it felt long and adventurous, like the pair endured so much just to save Nemo. However because this new adventure only takes place in one day and the journey to the aquatic centre took a matter of mere seconds because of the sea turtle travel, the end result didn't feel as epic nor impressive. I would have much rather seen the journey to the centre rather than having the trio travel with Crush across the ocean to their destination, maybe he would have served best if they met along the way in a fun cameo, rather than right at the beginning. The only other complaint I have about this movie, is that the ending was sort of a cop out, I felt like it would have went in a serious ballsy direction but rather it took the easy route leading to me predict exactly how the ending would play out, also the climax to the film was a little goofy but then again the little green alien dues drove the Pizza Planet truck in Toy Story 2, so I cant knock one film for its unbelievability if I give it a pass to another movie. Other than that this a good, fun sequel, although it isn't quite clear exactly why this movie had to be made, when the final few minutes were playing out before the credits, I felt a sense of relief and that the chapter to this story will finally be closed in a nice way, that leaves everyone, including myself, happy. Overall I did enjoy this film, and didn't view it as a total step back in the wrong direction for Pixar, I just hope that even though Pixar's slate for the next few years are sequel heavy, that they wont turn out to be similar to Monsters University. I do recommend this film, it is a good Pixar film and with that being said Finding Dory gets a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I had high hopes,"As someone who adores Finding Nemo and has waited YEARS for a sequel, I must say I am disappointed. Finding Dory definitely has a sequel feel to it. This didn't feel like a story that is worth a thirteen year wait. There are certainly cute and funny moments, but nothing solid enough to become a favorite. I've seen Finding Nemo so many times, but Dory is one I'll probably never watch again unless it's with my nephew or something. I didn't feel like this was a Pixar movie for all ages; it seemed more appropriate for younger audiences (I'm 24). As much as I hate admitting it, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Near the last quarter or so of the movie it just got redundant and all I could think was, ""Ok, this can be over any time now."" I enjoyed seeing characters from Nemo make appearances, and a couple new characters were charming, but overall it's not enough to make Dory an instant classic like Nemo. Pixar outdid themselves with the animation but you can tell this is a sequel for the sake of a sequel, not because they came up with a great storyline.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Laughed Until I Cried,"OK here goes. Saw Dory last night and I have to say it was better than Nemo. Going in, one should know the basic plot, hence the title. Without giving anything away, let me say that Pixar has a way with supplemental characters stealing scenes, and Finding Dory is no exception. The story starts innocently enough, giving us a bit more background on Dory and why she is why she is. The movie moves at a frenetic pace, and while Dory is the main character, her supporting cast is really what steals the show. There are plenty of scenes only Pixar could pull off, and do they ever! The ending scene made me laugh so hard I cried. I have seen every Pixar movie, and never have I laughed until my belly hurt. Dory is hilarious; kudos Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory: A Delightfully Worthy Sequel,"Thoughtful, humorous, moving and inspired. Finding Dory sees a familiar return to the deep blue, offering a new array of wonderful characters and locations. However, despite it's emotionally driven narrative and engrossing demeanor, Dory can't help but reveal some obvious flaws.In the opening sequence alone, Pixar shows off it's ever-improving technical abilities in the world of animation. From the detail of coral to the skin bumps of Hank the Octopus, Finding Dory boasts an incredible wealth of creative achievement and visual splendor. Even the adorable short beforehand, 'Piper' showcases the incredibly immersive technical wizardry of today's CGI.Though nothing captures the heart of the film more than it's lovable characters. Forewarning: Dory, depicted in her early childhood years, is the cutest baby fish you will probably ever have the pleasure of watching on the big screen. Aided by Marlin and Nemo, Dory finds herself in a race to rediscover her past and, along the way, stumbles across a fresh set of entirely new and often hilarious personalities. Stanton, who penned the story, does an excellent job of working and developing new characters into the film's narrative without ever feeling like they're overcrowding their space.The story itself, whilst admittedly not the most original concept ever conceived, delivers and extends upon the typical Pixar formula. This ultimately creates a satisfyingly engaging piece of cinema, if not more slightly disjointed than it's definitive predecessor. All criticism aside though, it's undeniable that Dory plays on multiple emotions, from euphoria to heartache, and even moments of frustration. Finding Dory, however, seems to rely a little too much on it's jokes and low points to drive the narrative, sometimes it works gloriously, and other times it doesn't. Sometimes the realism and context of the extreme situations just feels a little to uncomfortable for entertainment pleasure. But overall, and more often than not, it works, and that is what Pixar does best.Overall, this is an undoubtedly worthy and enjoyable sequel to the high-status original. Whether Finding Dory holds up the standards set by Finding Nemo is simply up to interpretation. It is unquestionable, however, that Dory is a solid film and another great addition to the Pixar canon. It exhibits strong underlying messages of perseverance, love, friendship and family, and is suitable for anyone wishing to indulge in some great moments of heartfelt entertainment. Words of advice: go see it, leave your expectations at home, have fun, don't talk. You wont be disappointed.My overall rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sweet, fun movie","Dory is a forgetful young fish. She was separated from her parents as a child and now she is out to find them. Through the help of a diverse bunch of friends, including a 7-tentacled octopus named Hank, she sets off to find them.Sweet, fun movie, made as a sequel (or prequel) to Finding Nemo. Has many of the same qualities as Finding Nemo - good family fun, some great comedic moments and wonderful animation - incredibly vivid colours and seamless movement. Once again, the voice casting is spot- on and goes a long way to making the movie as good as it is.Not quite as good as Finding Nemo though. The sentimentality in Finding Dory was laid on a bit thick and feels empty and manipulative at times. Finding Nemo felt more subtle and genuine in that regard.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A more mellow and slow-paced follow-up, which certainly isn't a bad thing","Finding Dory is the long awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic Finding Nemo. While Pixar aren't well known for the quality of their sequels and prequels (with the exception of the Toy Story films), this one was actually very good. It's a more mellow and slow-paced follow-up, which certainly isn't a bad thing.Six months after the events of Finding Nemo, Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) suddenly remembers something important about her childhood and sets off to her original home, located in Morro Bay, California. Due to Dory's frequent short-term memory loss, she has great difficulty trying to piece together the fractured remnants of her memories and often forgets things at the most important of times. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), with his son Nemo, follow after Dory to help her along with her journey to discover what it is she is really looking for.Beautiful to look at and quite touching at times, Finding Dory is a worthy successor to the excellent original film. Being more slow-paced than its predecessor, this allowed for more poignant and atmospheric moments to really take effect. The voice acting was great as well, particularly from Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. I also enjoyed many of the new characters introduced, my personal favourite was Hank, a cynical Octopus voiced by Ed O'Neill. If you enjoyed the original, then I recommend seeing this one.I rate it 8/10. Special mention also goes to the cute animated short at the beginning titled ""Piper"", which is about a baby Sandpiper learning how to feed itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Finding entertainment,"Sorry but this just didn't work.. the story line was tired to say the least. Whilst there were a few subtle pastiches to keep parents interested there weren't enough. and even my four year old got down from their seat and came over to ask me ""Is it finishing soon ? I'm bored."" My nine year old managed to keep awake throughout which is his usual way of showing his view on a film so maybe it's not all bad. But with the current cost of Cinema (movie house) tickets (£30 $40) in London I did feel somewhat disappointed. This was a Disney Pixar production was we had our anticipation set by their previous material, but this was a low point on their output. From Finding Nemo a sequel was obviously going to make an appearance. This admittedly didn't give the writers much scope for a story. But they needed to have included more comical asides within the main story and increased the pace of the second quarter.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, Touching, and Beautifully Animated","Finding Dory, the long awaited sequel to Finding Nemo is here and while it's nowhere near as good as the original it's a pretty solid follow up. It should be stated that a solid follow up by Pixar is still a great film, as they've shown that they have making amazing films down to a science. Finding Dory is funny, beautifully animated, and often touching. It should be stated up front, that Finding Nemo is a nearly flawless film, and that when comparing them, Finding Dory doesn't quite live up, but on it's own merit it is still a great film.One major reason that Finding Dory is so good is that it's hilarious, and not just a few moments of humor, but hilarious throughout the entire film. Much like Finding Nemo the film gives voices to animals we see and throws their own wit into what those characters would say and do, much like the crabs and seagulls from the first film. It isn't as consistently hilarious as Finding Nemo and never reaches the same range of pure hilarity and heart stopping moments, but it does have quite a few of both. Above the humor of the film another major element that worked so well for the film is the animation which is gorgeous.This is true for both the film and it's short, both were gorgeously animated, so much so that it's becoming more and more realistic. Animating people still seems to be a work in progress, and we may never get that right, but when it comes to animals, Pixar seems to have a firm grip on making them look flawless. The only problem I have with this film is the story, which is okay, but coming from such a talented studio that consistently focuses on story, the story had some liberties and plot holes that aren't common from Pixar. That is the major area where Finding Nemo was so great and Finding Dory fell a little flat.However, Pixar's greatest strength over the years has been it's ability to make mass amounts of people feel something watching their films. This is an amazing accomplishment, because some people are easily invested in a film and get immersed easily, while some find it very hard to get immersed in films, but Pixar seems to know how to make everybody feel something watching their films. There are multiple moments in this film that do that, and convey as with many other Pixar greats an amazing amount of emotional depth. I typically say if a film can make somebody have a visceral reaction then it's a great film, I wouldn't say this film does that but it comes very close, which is impressive in it's own right.For those who loved Finding Nemo I wholeheartedly believe you'll love this film to, but restating the obvious don't expect it to match Finding Nemo. This film is hilarious, beautifully animated, touching, well paced, and features great voice acting. The film isn't as good as Finding Nemo, as it's story isn't quite as good and frankly was probably never going to be as good. That being said for all who love Pixar films, families especially, this is a great film to go see.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but with a sense of deja vu.","Let's face it, a sequel very seldom is as good as the original. Although the animation was equally great and the lovable characters are back, I did get a sense of deja vu here. It was pretty much an ""Oh, I've seen this before"" feeling. Although Dory, who was my favorite character in 'Finding Nemo', is now the main character, the plot seems all too familiar. It was nevertheless enjoyable, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the original,"Finding Dory (2016) is even better then the original film, Finding Nemo. This movie is just fun and OMG it is so heartwarming! I cried more than once while watching it. Ellen of of course is still awesome as Dory, and her parents were so great! Diane Keaton was great as Dory's mom, perfect choice for her mother, and Eugene levy is good too. The comedy here is even better than in the first movie, there are definitely moments of pure hilarity. Along with those funny moments, are the scenes that are heart warming and beautiful. The dialogue here is spot on and it just goes to show the talent of the writer for this film. The adventures and different obstacles that Dory, Nemo and Marlin go through to find dorys parents are fun, engaging, and well done. It's tough to find a sequel that surpasses the original, it just simply does not happen a whole lot, but here, in my opinion, this one did surpass the original. Don't get me wrong, I love finding nemo, but finding dory is just better I think. 9/10 for Finding Dory, this is the perfect family film to go and enjoy, suitable for all ages really. And there is a great positive message to go with this movie. Part of that message is revealed in the credits. ""This film is for all families - every kind"". That is so awesome, and it teaches children that all types of families are good and loving, and that we don't all have to be the same. So go and have some fun with Finding Dory!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very Avarage But Funny Nonetheless,"Finding Nemo was a very sweet movie. So much so that I still remember some aspects of its adventure, which I watched years ago. In other words, the producers are very dear to my heart, which guarantees that there will be a sequel, but it is obvious that there are no strange characters in this movie, no universe that cannot be finished by telling. After thinking about what they could extend, I type Finding Nemo 2 on the internet and see that there is no such movie. They acted very smartly and made a movie about the other three characters who were already in the movie.Of course, the plot is a bit cliché, but there is nothing to be done, I don't know what else they could have come up with, they put the characters on top of the first movie, which is surprising in this business that seems to have been made almost to make money from the first movie. In fact, I can say that the main feature of this movie is that it is surprising, that it surprised me. In other words, although they did not make a revolutionary movie, they were able to continue a series that I thought they could not continue. Of course, Dory is a very interesting character, she is so interesting that you could make a series of her if she were a human, not a fish. Her only feature is not forgetfulness, she also stands out with being a very good fish. We love it, no matter how much we get used to the stereotype of making characters who are slightly lacking in intelligence and extremely well-intentioned. Normally, when I talk about movies, I can't help but mention the plot, but you see that they embark on one of the most normal adventures in the world. Of course, it's fun to watch, the adventure is exciting, but that's it. Not every movie is an idea movie, although I can't get mad at it for not telling something, it's actually a pretty good movie for kids. It's just a little bit standard, I guess. Although the scene where they save Dory from the fishing nets wanted to give a nice message, I don't know, it felt too plain. I guess as you watch more movies, people want their experiences to be special. And I'm sure I'm having a hard time writing this because I watched this movie with my girlfriend and had a lot of fun. However, after some time, what I remember is not the movie but my girlfriend's cuteness.What the movie does well is the unique comedy of the characters, but this will probably get old after a while. It's definitely a quality production, but as I said, there's nothing new, it's just a fun adventure.The animations are very good, so they've made one of the best in the style they wanted and they're continuing in this style, good job. The sound effects are also good enough that I don't question its reality. I didn't like the music very much, but normally animations have good music.The Turkish dubbing is incredibly successful, but I don't know the original artists, so I don't know how good it is.It's a fun adventure, it doesn't last long, maybe it's more fun when watched together, but I don't remember anything different from this movie, I only recommend it to those who have free time or those who like the character Dory.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A sequel we did not need, yet I'm not complaining.","This sequel repeats the same formula from first film. Characters gone missing and protagonist has to find them. It's fast paced, tons of adventures just like the first movie, but it felt very repetitive. The first half was slightly poor, nothing interesting happenned, the adventures were simple, but in the second half the adventures turned more crazy and then it became great. It even reminded me of ""Over the Hedge"".

Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable,"13 years (yes, it's been that long) since 'Finding Nemo' the talented folks at Pixar again decide to break their 'no sequel' rule and bring us 'Finding Dory'.'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' had their moments but weren't great, so I was going into this film with low expectations.However, despite there being quite a few similarities between the plots of both films 'Finding Dory' is entertaining enough, with lots of charm and humour.I did find it a bit repetitive at times though. We lost Dory, we find Dory, then something else happens to Dory. It almost seemed as though they were padding the story out.Is 'Finding Dory' set to be a classic? No. Could you just watch 'Finding Nemo' and forget this sequel was made? Yes. But for a better than average film then this is a good one to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just as good as the first one,"Pixar has this habit of telling the exact same story with their sequels, yet doing it in such a way that it doesn't bother us. This is a usual sequel problem where the story is the exact same and nothing has changed. And perhaps that's the trick. Because things do change in Pixar movies, yet the characters end up in the same kind of situations despite having grown as people.Take Finding Dory, for instance. The characters we know and love have evolved. Marlin has relaxed a little bit due to the events of the first film, Nemo has matured and Dory has finally found an anchor point for herself. Yet, as you might surmise from the title, Dory ends up lost and this time it's up to Marlin and Nemo to look for her.And it works. It really works. In my mind this is very much on par with the original film. If I was forced to choose, I'd pick the original, but that's solely to the novelty of it, and in this case that counts only as a tiebreaker. The animation quality is still superb, the returning characters feel the same, the story is just as exciting as before, the ocean is still a great place to have an adventure, the new characters are all interesting and it just feels familiar.Is it among my favourite Pixar films? Not really, but that's like saying that you prefer chocolate ice cream over strawberry one. Both are amazing, but the one is just more to your liking. I honestly do think that both this and Finding Nemo don't necessarily need the big action endings they both have, and I'm not a huge fan of Marlin nor Nemo. This film has a bigger action ending, but on the other hand Dory's emotional struggle with her memory loss is some of the best drama Pixar has ever done, so it evens out.

An extraordinary sequel that manages to be just as good as it's predecessor,"""Finding Dory"" is a 2016 animated film directed by Andrew Stanton and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neil, Ty Burrell, and Kaitlin Olsen. it's a sequel to 2003's ""Finding Nemo"", and it tells the tale of a fish with short term memory named Dory (who was one of the main characters of the first film) as she one day remembers her parents and decides to go find them while bringing marlin and nemo (the main characters of the first film) to help her find them while meeting new memorable characters as well.This movie is a great movie. it shows how much effort can be put into a sequel to a movie that was just simply amazing. all the effort pays off to show us a heartfelt film that manages to capture the humor and beauty of the first.the story is a good story, and while it copies the first film in terms of a journey, the all around theme is very original. while I will not spoil the message I will say it's a serious topic to carry a plot and it works here.the animation soars here and you can see how much PIXAR has stepped up their game with their craft and it shows. everything looks perfect to the character animation from the way the characters move and how the ocean looks in it's best. it's incredible to look at and beyond amazing and it brings out the best of PIXAR's craft.the characters here are just as memorable as they are in the first film. we have dory the main character of the film and she has to be the most developed character in the entire film as we see her backstory in this movie such as how she spoke whale, to where she learned the song, ""just keep swimming"". it's an interesting and sometimes sad look at her disability in the movie, that being she has short term memory loss. we have other characters as well: a septopus named hank who is a grumpy octopus that helps dory try to find her family, a whale shark named Destiny who can't see very well and has trouble swimming, a beluga whale named bailey who can use echolocation to see things from far away, and two sea lions named Fluke and Rudder who sit on a rock and rest away. all these new characters are memorable as they are funny, since they are provided voices from a good cast. they shine here and they make this movie.while it can copy certain elements from the first film it does it in a way that is spectacular and it is a great example of how a sequel can be just as amazing as it's predecessor. it's a great film and people who love the first film should go check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming,"The characters were great, each with their own distinct personalities. These include: Hank the Octopus who only had 7 tentacles, Destiny the Whale Shark who was short sighted, Bailey the Beluga Whale who had problems with his echolocation, and many more interesting creatures, many of whom could have their own spin-off. The voice cast is a terrific collection of voices. There are jokes aimed towards the kids, but also some subtlety aimed toward the adults. The general plot isn't that original, it's similar to the original Finding Nemo. It's an adventure movie about a character trying to get home. Sometimes there is silliness and comedy, and sometimes there are sad moments. Its main positives are its characters and its use of various emotions. On the whole, an amazing sequel where the main character from the original is pushed aside and the supporting character take over like in Monster Inc, Cars 3 and to some extent Incredibles 2. I wonder why they do that but it's doesn't matter as it's very effective.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good but not magical,"Finding Nemo is one of the movies that made my childhood, I won't forget the happy sensation that I felt when I saw it, so I was waiting for this sequel.In my opinion, Finding Dory was a good movie and gave us a thrilling adventure with some of the best Pixar's characters, but without the surprise and the beauty of the first film, and I missed the another good characters (I was hoping to see more of the Tank Gang instead a small scene). I can't say it's a bad sequel, because it isn't and stills better than some new productions from another animation studios, however it's not what I was hoping to see.

Most Moving Pixar Film Since Inside Out,"This is honestly the best Pixar movie I've seen in my whole life.

She still was in my system-- amazingly.But let me tell you, I will never, ever, EVER, forget this film. It's one of this year's best, PERIOD.Now to any people who think Finding Nemo is better than this one, you better think again. Finding Dory has twice the emotional heart wrench than I thought it would have. I mean, I was actually sobbing in the first half of the movie.

Ugh,"Finding dory has a lot to like honestly, the characters are fun, some pretty good jokes and (kind of irrelevant at this point) the animation is spectacular. This is really shown of with the creative ways they use hank, who is far and away the best part of this movie
What bothers me about this film? Two things; a completely irrelevant cash grab and it is goddamn boring. First of all, I absolutely love finding nemo. Nearly everything about it is great, including the ending which capped of the film well. No Sequel Needed.
And sure the film isn't painfully boring, but the plot gets really really repetitive and you wonder why it's so long
I blame this in part on the setting, which is almost incomparable to the ocean in finding nemo. Each set piece in that film was spectacular, and here we have a couple of animal enclosures.
This might be good for you, but if you are huge fan of the first film like I am then you will be sorely disappointed",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finind a reason for Finding Dory,"Took my two children ages 5 and 9 to watch. The opening Pixar Piper was awesome!They can really convey a story with no dialog and be totally entertaining. However, Dory with all the dialog just fell flat. I think many would agree that there are many movies that don't need a sequel, no matter how much money they made with the first.Some movies, like Nemo, already complete an original story and tie up the ends nicely. Pixar really hit the underwater CGI at 100% with Nemo. I believe that, combined with lovable characters, good main plot, and very cleaver idea interactions (sharks, crabs, gulls, dentist office and aquarium scenes, all the mini-struggles along the way, and the development of the character arcs like Marlin/Nemo, Marlin/Dory, etc) made Nemo an innovative cartoon movie for all ages, hence the immense success. Sure, writers can contrive any number of plot lines into a sequel, but form without substance renders a somewhat lackluster sequel=Dory. The movie is highly colorful and continues Pixars excellent water CGI but can't top what was already done to perfection in Nemo. The story re-acquaints the old characters with some as-expected new characters, with a brief turtle Crush cameo. The sea lions were cute, the octopus made for a few laughs, but the whole ""I can't remember.."" Dory character was so overused that it overshadowed the movie with a somber melodrama. I could hear many kids groaning in the theater as the movie dragged on, my two barely stayed awake. The Dory character in Nemo had a purpose, was used skillfully and moved the movie along with some slapstick lines by DeGeneres almost like Robin Williams' Aladdin. But to make that a core plot and centerpiece is not enough to carry a movie. I guess it makes sense to Hollywood to take a move like Nemo, that cost $94mil and grossed probably a billion with marketing and toys, is enough reason to stretch for a sequel. Did it work for Kung Fu Panda, Ice Age, Chipmunks, Happy Feet, Shrek, Toy Story, Despicable Me, Madagascar, How to Train Dragon? Admittedly sometimes yes, but not this time.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good,"Finding Dory is a surprisingly GOOD sequel that captures the spirit of the original with beautiful animation, but a pretty lazy story that rehashed the plot of the original and some downgraded characters. I will start off with the film's biggest weakness, its predictability and lack of focus. The film would mostly juggle between Dory's past to get repetitive and unfocused very quickly. The story is predictable once Pixar rehashed the plot of the first. But, its still can stand well on its own with some emotional scenes and fresh comedy.

Bumbler Survives To A Happy Ending.,"Adventure in Fantasyland sums this up. It's cute, it's cuddly, it's silly. It's a cartoon. It's Disney.So, stay on the surface if you want to enjoy this movie but don't dive deeper into it b/c it's unpleasant.Every movie has a villain/difficulty for the protagonist to overcome. Dory's short term memory loss is the ""villain"". It separates her from her loving parents and plagues her throughout the movie with a gnawing sense that she's not where she's suppose to be. It causes her to trust strangers, some who are natural predators - one who does not have her best interest but eventually gives into her plight. The message: Even predators will help you if your persistently cute and innocent. Not a good message in reality.Her memory loss leads her into dangerous situations as she is physically lost. But the main, clear message is ""Just bumble along in life, you won't get hurt, and everyone is there to help you. Life is a happy adventure."" The reality is she would have been victimized or killed each step of the way.Inaccuracies abound. Salt water fish surviving in fresh water. Sea Urchins in a touch and play tank - ouch. Shark whale called a whale. A fish has the capability to read English but can't remember moment to moment - that's just stupid.More and more movies are coming out that are too much like video games. Action without consequences. Story lines abandoning reality - even physics and the natural laws - promoting moralities based upon dangerous falsehoods. First thing you learn in middle school English is ""What is the moral of the story?"" What IS the moral of this story? It's not just wrong, it's dangerous.So, if you really want to enjoy this movie just be like Dory! Just bumble along for the ride and don't think much. La-la-la. Weeeee.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Enjoyable film even if it's predecessor is vastly better,"Out of all of the 2010s Pixar sequels (other than the cars films which were garbage, and the toy stories which were great) Finding Dory is easily the most lackluster when compared to the original. Finding Nemo was so great for it's heartbreaking journey of a father trying to find his lost son. Finding Dory is literally just Dory thinking ""hey I wonder where my parents are."" I get that large amounts of emotion are triggered by its ending, but the entire film doesn't feel very necessary because of greatly finding nemo ended.
But overall it is an enjoyable film with some very funny and exciting scenes. The introduction of new characters was great since they were well written. The ending scene of the film is quite funny because of its absurdity which I think is what they were trying to go for.

Finding Dory (2016),"A sweet, fun, and enjoyable sequel- Finding Dory may not be as good as the original, but is a more than worthy successor to one of the greatest animated films of all time. Ellen DeGeneres and many other supporting cast members return as their roles from the original, including Albert Brooks and Marlin, and Andrew Stanton as Crush. The return of the beloved characters from the original is done quite well, with it never seeming too forced, but also drawing attention that this is a sequel to the original events. It's plot is a little on the thin side, with the film seeming more like a map than having a true script, but nevertheless is is still very enjoyable to watch, and quite entertaining. My favorite thing about the film is Ed O'Neill as Hank the Octopus, whose chemistry with Dory provides for some hilarious and amusing situations, and whose presence I always enjoyed on screen. It does seem a bit corny at times, and a bit formulaic, but Finding Dory makes the best of its problems and provides for a simple, but enjoyable animated sequel that I wouldn't mind watching again.

Dory suddenly remembers the past and present- short term and long term memory, but continues to claim memory problems.Also, those of you claiming this is bad for foster, adopted children- Dory was not a foster child or an adopted child. She was just lost. Of course foster children or even adopted children fantasize that they are really loved by their birth parents. So do abused children, neglected children, children of drug addicts, and orphans.It doesn't hurt anything. It is natural. It Is normal. It is in good taste.

Pixar's Fish Still Got It,"Finding Dory is the 2016 sequel to the beloved Pixar film Finding Nemo. In this movie, the lovable Dory, a blue tang fish with short term memory loss voiced by Ellen Degeneres, starts to get fragments of memories about her long lost parents and sets out on a quest to find them. She is joined by Marlin and Nemo (Albert Brooks and Hayden Rolence) as they travel to California. There, Dory goes to a Marine Life Rehabilitation Center and meets Hank (Ed O'Neil) a Septopus and Destiny (Kaitlin Olson) a whale shark with farsightedness who help her navigate the facility. This movie, as with all Pixar films, had a lot of heart. The story felt important. The stakes felt high. It didn't pander to kids. There was no real enemy or bad guy. This was an isolated story about what a home and a family really means. Baby Dory is adorable. And adult Dory is sweet, and sad. Anyone watching can feel her emotions. You understand her pain, and her insecurities. The animation, as always, is gorgeous. So much detail. The Ocean feels like it's there. It feels alive. There's so much to take in, and you can tell the animators really put in a lot of love to make this. The voice acting and scripting is top notch. The words and the characters give an almost perfect balance of comedy and drama. The emotions are genuine. The plot points are put together quite well. This movie is not as emotional as Finding Nemo. The stakes are nowhere near as high. However, it is still a quality film that is worth seeing, and felt as if it had a place in the Pixar world, and the Nemo lore. I'd say it was about as good as the Original Film. And would give it a solid 8/10. Go See It.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

But only just enough to feel like short breaks from the usual punishment of ""I keep forgetting, What is wrong with me, I keep forgetting, What was I doing, I keep forgetting, I am all alone, I keep forgetting, I need to remember what I was doing"", etc.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
'Dory' makes up for a little sequel unoriginality with lots of heart and a great message,"The talented storytellers and animators at Pixar are too creative to be devoting so much time to sequels like ""Finding Dory,"" but money talks. At least they're clever and thoughtful enough to turn an easy payday into something entertaining and heartfelt.Created 13 years after ""Finding Nemo,"" at least filmmaker Andrew Stanton had some time and space to let his vibrant animated underwater world and colorful characters breathe, and find a story that needed telling. That story centers on sidekick character Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the blue tang fish with short-term memory loss, who suddenly uncovers some long-term memories about her family and goes off in search of them.One of the more lovable supporting characters in Pixar's short but storied history, Dory makes for a great subject, and her disability allows for a really powerful and uplifting message. ""Inside Out"" changed the everyday discussion about emotions last year; ""Dory"" continues the studio's impressive focus on social values and teaching utility that should inspire so many of its younger viewers or at least give adults the tools to discuss these challenges with the children in their lives.""Dory"" is also clever and entertaining, even if the story structure relies heavily on convention and repetition. Dory's search for mom and dad takes her to a California marine life park, where almost all the action takes place. It's a very Pixar move to put these characters in an environment we know with humans in the background oblivious to the story unfolding (think ""Toy Story""), but it kind of takes away from the majesty of the open water that made ""Finding Nemo"" so epic. That film was truly an odyssey, a long and winding, exhaustive journey, whereas the ""Dory"" plot feels as though it is stuffed with predicaments and complications that prolong the end point that we know is just within reach (and inevitable).Essentially, Dory – and Nemo and Marlon, who are chasing after her – find themselves in and out of dangerous situations (or in jeopardy of their plan failing) with minor breathing room in between and the help of more new supporting characters, most notably a camouflaging ""septopus"" named Hank (Ed O'Neill). Their escapes are preposterous, which is no shocker, but the filmmakers' ingenuity loses a bit of sparkle the more frequently it occurs.But these criticisms come with the high bar Pixar has set for itself. If the studio is going to go for the sequel cash-grab, it needs to justify the choice through creative, thoughtful storytelling. ""Dory"" does this better than ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University,"" but there's just enough of a sense that it was produced by a sequel machine.All this makes the film's heart and social welfare component all the more vital. In this area, Stanton and co. do not falter one iota. Leaning on a story formula is less of a sin than creating a family film that has nothing original to say and doesn't pull at the heartstrings. ""Finding Dory"" avoids this most important sequel pitfall and its emotional factor proves, in the end, to be the only justification Pixar needed to bring us Nemo, Marlon and Dory once more.~Steven CThanks for Reading!

How the hell do Pixar do it?,"After 13 years Pixar have been cooking up something amazing.Finding Dory is the sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo (A Disney Classic). A year later Marlin, Nemo, and Dory are living peacefully together until Dory begins to remember her family and becomes determined to seek out her parents.Directed by Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, A Bugs Life, WALL E), Pixar have resurrected a classic animation and brought it to new depth. Supported by a outstanding new team f voice actors, Finding Dory introduces hilarious new characters to enjoy. In Finding Nemo, Dory's short term memory loss was touched upon and joked about, but now we have the real tragic emotional story behind Dory's memory problem, which really makes you feel for the character. What is also most unique is remarkable score by Thomas Newman, which is so good I didn't even have to listen out for it to hit me.Of course without Pixar, there also comes the marvellous comedy made me laugh very frequently, out loud ad well. But what makes the film is the emotional story of Dory losing her parents which is made up by numerous powerful emotional moments which was twice close to drawing tears from my eyes.Lets be honest, this film was not made for children of the current generation, but for all of us who witnessed the first film 13 years ago. Only we can purely understand the emotional depth of the film.The film however does try to do too many things as once, in being a sequel, but also its own film, and hence becomes unbalanced in trying to create the theme of the first film, but also new and independent. Both are good but together can make the film messy.What makes Finding Dory shy away from being perfect is its unbalance but also certain scenes that have a mixture of humour and emotion which sometimes spoils the atmosphere. But just for once couldn't Pixar try to just aim to be mature audience film, so the easy child friendly atmosphere wasn't there so the film could be perfect with depth and comedy on an older scale.But how do Pixar do it? in creating beautiful, fun, and marvellous films which we will never forget.

Just keeps swimming to your heart and pulls on your strings.,"Pixar's animated film this summer, Finding Dory is the sequel to Finding Nemo and this time focuses on Dory as she tries to find her own family and prove that she can actually remember things. Now, Finding Nemo was a personal favourite of mine and is actually in my top ten favourite animated films of all time so my expectations were high. Thankfully, this film was not a letdown! It's safe to say that Finding Dory is another great Pixar entry and does not lose the charm of the original. Ellen Degeneres is back as Dory and is witty as ever, this is her film and she holds it all together. Great to see many returning characters but it's actually the new characters that make the film refreshing (especially Hank the Octopus). The animation is stunning, probably Pixar's best animation yet...so much detail and the camera going in and out of focus is a great touch and definitely defines certain details. The script is witty with many, many funny scenes that will make everyone laugh and that's one of the great things about this film and Pixar in general, everyone can enjoy it! Not only is the story comedic and witty, but it's also very emotional and makes you feel. I did notice many getting out their tissues to dab their eyes (not me though, I'm heartless...). The soundtrack was relaxing and suited the environment, so thankfully it was not radically changed from the original. The only flaw I felt was that it was too similar to the original. Sure, some may say the whole ""don't fix it if it isn't broken"" but the plot is exactly the same which means certain aspects will be predictable. Overall, this is a heartwarming, funny yet emotional adventure that everyone can enjoy albeit very similar to its predecessor.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jumps the shark.,"Hah ... yes I went there.But seriously Finding Dory oozes sequel syndrome. It desperately wants to be bigger and better, funnier and intenser but ends up being a disjointed bland soulless pastiche of the original.It's also a completely unnecessary rehash and if Pixar wasn't in the habit of milking sequels no-one would've ever asked or cared for a sequel.The animation genre, by nature of it's medium, is inherently never fully realistic. And most animation films also don't really try to be all that realistic. But the good ones aim for something plausible, something grounded, something that colors neatly within the lines of attainable suspension of disbelief. And when the setting or story premise isn't those things then at least the events that transpire and the characters actions within are.Finding Dory however is one long succession of fish getting launched in the air, bumping off things, hopping fish tanks and fountains, taking rides in bird-flown pails, piloting strollers and ultimately driving a truck on the freeway.See the first movie had this fun ingenious subplot where little Nemo and his group of unique quirky aquarium buddies plotted their prison escape while father Marlin and his tag along sidekick Dory had a varied riveting road trip adventure. It was fun, tense and exciting. Realistic? No. But done subtle enough to not really care.But like I said in my title: Finding Dory jumps the shark. It makes the typical sequel mistake of trying to outdo the original but ends up overdoing it. It constantly tries to be high octane but doesn't know how to pace itself and becomes a hyperactive frenetic mess that quickly grows tiresome.This time around Nemo and Marlin are barely there let alone important. It's all Dory and Dory is a perfect example why side characters should remain side characters. She's plain annoying, too happy go lucky, too random, too gimmick-y.Most of the action happens in a single spot, namely a marine rehabilitation center. At the same time the setting limits the possibilities for story telling and events that can happen, while also forcing the writers to keep coming up with new contrived ways for the fish to get around.Point in case: the entire movie (and by extension the events of the first one) rest on the premise that Dory as a baby fish got sucked out of her aquarium because the holes in the grating of the filtration system were too big ... You'd think that the designers of a fish tank that is to house 100s of little fish would consider this and put in some finer grating or lower the current.The pipes play another role as they were the method of communication through which baby Dory learned to speak ""Whale"" with her then yet unseen friend Destiny. At some point Dory get thrown into Destiny's tank by one of the human staff members together with a bunch of dead fish clearly intended as food for said Destiny ...... who turns out to be a whale SHARK ... Which is not a whale ... Nor a pescatarian/carnivore ... Nor do they vocalize whale songs. It's an incredibly stupid decision on the creators part that immediately creates multiple massive plot holes. Which could have been avoided with some very basic research. It's almost like they deliberately tried to screw up on that one because when most people think whale they don't think whale shark. No idea how they got to that one.Another flagrant thing is how literally everyone Dory meets is instantly ready to help her out, risk their lives in the process, even when they're species that eat fish.In comparison the first film had a fun segment with 3 vegetarian sharks who wanted to change the negative image of sharks. Though it didn't make much sense, at least there was an explanation why these sharks didn't instantly want to eat Marlin and Dory. And then the sharks still struggled not to do so anyway while other predatory fish such as the barracuda and the angler fish didn't have such qualms.In the sequel multiple species that eat fish (the seals, the otters, the bird) are all instantly down to help our fish protagonists without anything to gain for themselves.I haven't seen many newer Pixar movies, or sequels this last decade but recently I've been wanting to catch up.I hope Finding Dory isn't the norm or that doesn't bode very well.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A sequel on par with if not, bettet than the original","I saw Finding Dory several weeks ago, and I have to admit, I can be slow at making reviews, but that's not the point. I really enjoy Finding Nemo for its great concept, humor, and heart. Similar to the gap between Toy Story 2 (1999) and 3 (2010), this comes 13 years after the original. Because of the long gap and how most sequels aren't as good as the original, I thought I would enjoy it but it wouldn't be as good as the original. I was wrong, and here's why:In this movie, Dory, (the blue tang who suffers from short term ""remembery"" loss) remembers that she has a family and sets off to find them with her two friends, the clownfish father and son Marlin and Nemo, and Dory (while trying to find her family) gets separated from Marlin and Nemo, and the father and son duo must FIND DORY (get it). From this summary, I will admit it has similarities to the original, and it can get a little predictable. However, the story has depth, (no pun intended) and true heart of a Pixar movie, especially when we see Dory's struggle with short term ""remembery"" (I meant memory) loss. It is also enjoyable, with some cleverness and it isn't very predictable.As for the characters, everyone's favorite blue tang is back, and she's better than ever. She's three dimensional, therefore well developed, and still very enjoyable with a good personality. However, Marlin and Nemo are still enjoyable and funny, however not as well developed as Dory in this one. Hank the octopus (or septopus) is a very funny character who is grouchy, but later shows that he does in fact have three hearts. Destiny and Bailey are like the tank gang, and are enjoyable as well, however not as great. Mr. Ray is as funny as ever, and other characters from the first one get cameos. This may not be the best cast of characters, but it is good to see some old ones again.For other things, the animation is better than terrific. It upgraded the original animation by giving out even better textures, backgrounds, and design. Pixar delivered a whole new level of high by animating Hank and his camouflage well and detailed. Also the humor is really funny, mainly from Marlin, (no pun intended)Mr. Ray, Dory, and Hank.Finding Dory isn't as good as Zootopi, but is close with a 3 dimensional plot, characters that not even Dory herself could forget, and stellar animation. I definitely recommend it. Pixar has rebounded from the let down the good dinosaur.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Pixar classic has been made!!,"When I saw they were making a sequel to Finding Nemo called Finding Dory I was excited and skeptical at the same time. Although all the Toy Story sequels are spectacular, I couldn't help to think about how much Cars 2 was a mistake.I guess this is why they needed a more than a dozen years to work on Finding Dory to make sure they get it right, and they did get it right.Like the title states, the movie was focus around the supporting character from Finding Nemo, Dory, a fish suffering from short term memory loss, brilliantly played by Ellen DeGeneres.Who didn't love Dory in the first movie and now, they made an entire movie that centers around the character.Finding Dory was so much fun and so funny all the way through. I was worried that they would not be able to take the magic of what DeGeneres did with Dory in the first film and keep it going for an entire feature, but that's exactly what happen beyond my expectations.I was not expecting to laugh out loud so many times. Though Dory's adventure to find the parents she finally remembers was not as impressive as the adventure of Melvin Finding Nemo, the entire journey was filled with fun and very heart warming.It's definitely worth a trip to the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Best Movie,"The much awaited ""Finding Dory""5 star for the movie! Highly recommended and worth your penny! Watch it on the big screen and if you can afford 3D please do so.Some people posted about parents bringing their babies to watch it. I Totally agree with it. It's a serious business! But of course as we watched in the movie house there's still some babies who were crying but anyway so much for that.As per my own perspective, this is the Best movie of all time as of the moment for myself. It's actually my first time to cry in a movie house and me and my cousin ran out of napkins lol. It will make you laugh so hard and of course CRY.Finding Dory talks about life, family and friendship. Most importantly, it taught us to never give up despite of our impairments or weak points in our lives whether it is a disability nor an imperfection in ourselves. Instead, Dory taught us to use it as our main key and strength to be successful in whatever it is are we looking in oneself if we ever felt lost in one point of our lives. We sometimes don't recognize the people that surrounds us, can be the piece of the puzzle we are looking for.As what they say, ""Just swim and swim and swim till you find it."" Alright people, Let's do the ‪Cuddle Party!If I can give a 20 star for the movie I will do it. I will watch it again, but the next time there should be no babies crying in the movie house LOL.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory,"Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter, Bob Peterson, Jeremy Lasky & Thomas Newton came back together after thirteen years to make a prequel to Finding Nemo, and it just didn't pay off that well. The first set was great! Stanton did all the right things to drag us in, and want more. As for the rest of the film, it was slower paced because there was much more going on this time around. On the downside, I felt as if Stanton got a little lazy, and borrowed some content from the first film, so a few scenes just felt unbalanced. The major downfall I had with this film, I can't have Dory as my main protagonist! She serves much better as a side character; her character is a close comparison to Mater, just not as annoying. It did the same thing Cars 2 did, and they both flopped.I can truly appreciate the effort the team put in, into creating new and original characters, but some of them were hit and miss. The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson & new comer Victoria Strouse, didn't have as much charisma throughout, as the first one did, having pretty bad jokes, and just lacked heart that the first film spewed cranked out.The one thing that was better than the first film, was the cinematography and animation. The lights and darks, the texture in everything, to the fish, to the water, to the sunlight, was just spectacular, and breathtaking!I usually stay away from mentioning the endings, unless they really mean something, but this ending made this film plummet real fast. It was just too over the top, and tried to flesh out too much, because they realize they overstuffed the narrative to begin with.Overall, Finding Dory may not have been as fresh as the first, and took FOREVER to release, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other trash we got a few years ago.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Perfection,"This film has completely met up to the hype and exceeded expectations. This film broke the rule that sequels are always worse. Finding Dory includes brilliant humor, child friendly themes as well as amazing animation. Every detail of the underwater world was perfected right down to the scales on Nemo and his father. The backstory of Dorys life was extremely touching, giving awareness to children that people with mental disabilities (such as Dorys memory loss) can do just as much as normal people and their qualities are even to be admired. This movie is great for adults and children, with constant adventure and humor no one could be bored during this movie. The Finding Nemo sequel is just as good as the original, adding more moral lessons and even better animation tithe franchise. I recommend this movie to people of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dory a great character,"Dory is a blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss. As a baby, she got separated from her family. After the events of 'Finding Nemo', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is living with Nemo and his dad Marlin (Albert Brooks). Mr. Ray is teaching school about migration and home which refreshes her long dormant memories. Marlin reluctantly agrees to help her find her parents.It starts off great with little Dory all the way up to the turtles. Then Dory gets captured. I'm not saying it's bad but part of the magic fades in the human world. I know the fish tank was a part of the original but it wasn't my favorite there either. So much of this is hopping from one aquarium exhibit to the next. On the other hand, Dory is a wonderful lead character. DeGeneres' voice work is terrific. Destiny and Bailey are great additions. The animation is sharper than ever. The quest is touching and poignant. This may not be the sequel I expected. I prefer the quest to be in the natural world but this is good nevertheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
WORTHY Sequel,"""Hi. I'm Dory. I suffer from short-term ""remembery"" loss.""These are the very first words we hear in Finding Dory. And we hear them SEVERAL times throughout the film. Look, I love Dory as much as everybody else, but I was really worried this was gonna suffer from ""Minions Syndrome"". You know how the Minions kinda work in Despicable Me in small measures but a movie filled with them was just annoying as hell?. Luckily, Finding Dory finds ways to avoid that and I am glad to say it succeeds as a sequel.Finding Dory is able to introduce NEW, MEMORABLE, COOL and FUNNY characters to the universe and it proves that this was not a cash grab by Pixar by selling a well established brand (Cars 2). Destiny and the other whale are funny, Hank the Octopus (or whatever you call an octopus with seven tentacles) is awesome, we are introduced to some pretty hilarious sea lions, and more. One particular scene involving a clam had me laughing HYSTERICALLY.The ultimate flaw of Finding Dory is that it relies a lot (too much if you ask me) on call backs from the original. It is a sequel and you have to have that connection to the first movie (I get it), but it seemed that all this movie was gonna do was do things that we already knew from the original, especially in the opening of the movie. ""Oh, remember the cool turtle who talks like a surfer? And remember Dory talking to a whale?"" Things like that are scattered throughout the film and it appears as if they are just there for the sake of people remembering how great the original Finding Nemo was.So the question everyone wants to know is is it better than Finding Nemo? NO. Not by a long shot. But here's the thing. Finding Nemo is the Lion King of Pixar in terms of scope and epicness. It is as perfect of an animated film as I would ever want any animated film to be. But in the end, I can say with confidence that this is a WORTHY sequel. I was invested in the story, I was thoroughly entertained, I laughed, I didn't cry but some scenes got pretty emotional. And the story is worth experiencing. If you liked the first movie, I can almost guarantee you WILL like this one too IF you don't go in thinking this will be better than arguably the greatest Pixar movie ever made. That's just a dumb mindset. Enjoy Dory for what it is: A good, entertaining sequel to a perfect (or nearly perfect) movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I Found Dory...but it wasn't 'anyfin' special,"If 20th Century Fox's Ice Age: Collision Course valiantly attempted to keep up with the series by throwing as many ideas into the mix, you would think an animated studio steeped in success as Pixar is would be more than capable of stepping up to the plate and besting themselves with a sequel.I'd say not after seeing Finding Dory, which is essentially the script of Finding Nemo (2003) re-hashed for a generation who either missed that film the first time around or the passage of time has led them to forget it.Some smart new characters make their debut here but the few-and-far-between ingenuity that is usually the hallmark of Pixar is overdone in a film as barren as the Dead Sea.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Welcomed Return to the Deep Blue Sea,"It's been 13 long years since the release of Finding Nemo, Disney/Pixar's instant classic that turned every clown fish at a pet store into ""Nemo"". Now, we return to the ocean, this time to follow the story of everyone's favorite Dory, and in large, Finding Dory is able to recapture the magic that was harnessed 13 years ago.Finding Dory brings a lot to the table that its predecessor also did, none more so than the film's terrific animation, which, like the first, captures the beauty and dangers of the ocean in spectacular fashion. The atmosphere is vibrant and alive, and the characters are animated splendidly, especially Hank the squid (who I'll talk more about later). Pixar has a near perfect track record when it comes to its animation, and with its gorgeous ocean setting, Fining Dory is no exception.The story, obviously, centers around Dory, the lovable, forgetful blue fish who decides to set out on a journey to find her long lost family, and reunite with them once again. While a simple premise is to be expected with an animated kids film, I found the overall plot to be less memorable and less intimate than Finding Nemo, with more sporadic pacing as well. Finding Dory was heavier on goofy jokes, which isn't bad by any means for a kids movie, but as an adult viewer, I would have been more satisfied with a more emotionally engaging plot. The movie definitely has its heartfelt moments, and like I said, there is plenty of humor to keep viewers of all ages entertained. So at the end of the day, Fining Dory has a story solid enough to be worth the view.Finding Nemo introduced a slew of memorable characters, from Bruce the shark to the star of this film, Dory. The supporting cast helped fill the enormous space of the ocean and made it feel alive, keeping you excited to meet the next set of characters on the journey. In Finding Dory, there are plenty of enjoyable faces, both old and new. Ellen DeGeneres returns to voice the title character, and really is perfect for the role yet again. The dialogue isn't as memorable this time around, but Ellen is stellar in her delivery. Nemo and his worrisome father Marlin (Albert Brooks) also return, this time in smaller roles, but still are important enough to the story and fun enough to watch that I didn't mind too much of their lesser involvement.Then there's my new favorite character, Hank, a seven-armed octopus who's grouchy demeanor and charming heart won me over as the film's best character. He's grumpy, funny, and loving at the same time and you can tell how much work Pixar had to put into his animation to make him move like a real squid, and really pop on screen. Ed O'Neill is wonderful in the voice role, and gives Hank the perfect personality. What's a bit unfortunate, is that the rest of the supporting characters we meet either aren't memorable, or didn't get enough screen time to convince me that they were. Dory fittingly had the most screen time, but aside from some very brief cameos and Hank, I was not sold on the new supporting cast.There have been loads of sequels in recent years coming out 10-20 years after the original, and most have proved that if you don't have a legitimate story to explore, it's not worth the time. Finding Dory, however, is a rare exception, where, even after a long wait, is able to deliver a strong enough film to be worthy of its predecessor. Fantastic animation, plenty of humor, and a strong enough cast of characters combine to make Finding Dory a return to the deep blue sea that was worth the 13 year wait.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not the same magic, but enough of what makes these stories special","While Finding Dory is not the same magic that Nemo was back in 2004 (it's hard to catch that kind of lightning in a bottle twice), it's safe to say it's it's own awesome little movie, and as far as a sequel goes, passes with flying colors. It's more or less structured the same way as the first in terms of plot, adding it's own twists, new characters and a core message that relates to previous themes while intrepidly covering new ground. My only complaint is I wish it were longer. It seemed to be over in a flash, even for a reliably slim Pixar running time. It would have been nice to have an extra 15 or 20 minutes to flesh out a few scenes, and elaborate a bit more on one particular character. Even so, what we get is completely charming and inspired. It starts off pretty much where we left off, with Nemo, Marlin and Dory living happily on the reef, intercut with scenes featuring an infant Dory who is most likely the cutest little thing to ever be seen in a Pixar movie. It's revealed that a long time ago she was separated from her parents (Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton), and has grown up lost, adrift and afflicted by her relentless memory disorder. When an interaction triggers memories of them, she sets off with Marlin and Nemo in tow, on a merry quest across the ocean to connect with her roots. A great deal of this one is spent in a Sea World like habitat, which is another change and leaves room for many more new jokes and creatures. An octopus named Hank (Ed O Neil) begrudgingly helps her out, as well as a nearsighted whale shark (Kaitlyn Olsen), and as beluga (Ty Burrell) whose echo location is busted, providing one of the best jokes. There's also a couple of exuberant seals played by Idris Elba and Dominic West, a few returning familiar faces and an epic cameo by a huge star, dead panning the voice of the aquarium tourist announcer in classic Pixar good humour. The film stresses the importance of acceptance and resilience, putting forth the idea that someone with a debilitating condition can in fact find their own unique method of coping, and achieving their goals despite the symptoms of their ailment. Trust Pixar time and time again to take mature, lofty themes and mold them into totally relatable fables that never preach, and are distilled to a point where the little ones can absorb them right alongside their parents. Like I said before, the film needs a bit more padding in its narrative to feel complete, which may materialize in an extended DVD version. What we have here is brilliant enough though, and didn't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing New About It,"With all the awful adult films available this summer, we went to this. Having seen ""Nemo"" several years ago, I expected something new and exciting. I'm a big Ellen DeGeneres fan, but the lame script and lack of punch made her offerings of little import. Once again, we have the fish, defying all the laws of nature. Dory is looking for her parents. If she were human, she would need constant supervision because her memory situation. She is supposedly capable of livings her life, but has no coping skills. I know this is an animated feature, but the very idea of finding her parents is so far-fetched, even to stretch the limits of this medium. Things are so contrived, including the whole business of quarantine and shipping fish to Cleveland and that octopus and so on, that I lost interest. Unlike the original movie, there was almost nothing funny here. Apparently Dory got older and bigger but Nemo is still a child and still the same size he was before. Has anyone asked about this? Visually, some of the movie was striking, but, when it was over, I didn't feel any emotion. There are so many superior animated features out there and Pixar didn't follow through on this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Deep blue sea search,Having grand kids we definitely wanted to see this film - and we are happy we did. I think that the feelings for the original film about Nemo is still there - just has another focus this time around. Dory still has her memory problems and this time you really want her to find her home. I love Hank - the animation of him is incredible - stay for the ending credits as they are so much fun. As Pixar usually does these well. The animation of Dory appeared to be more plastic to me - we did not see the 3D version but the last movie was better in some instances because of that. The notion that Dory was looking for her parents and slowly remembering things was good for kids. They cheered when she found her parents - the shells were a great way to have her find home. A well done animated movie - just not the same as Nemo.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory was a worthy sequel to Finding Nemo,"So after Finding Nemo, Disney/Pixar decided to make a sequel in which the short-term memory fish Dory suddenly remembers that she has parents and goes out looking for them. Along the way, she encounters a septopus (an octopus with a missing appendage), a near-sighted whale shark who was her pipe pal, and a male beluga whale who has a radar. Also, Marlin and his son Nemo are also along for the ride. There are a few laughs and plenty of touching drama during Dory's search. It's quite a ride as she journeys through various aquariums and oceans, not to mention a few motorized vehicles and strollers. I enjoyed most of what happens here along with my movie theatre-working friend who had watched this before. So on that note, I recommend Finding Dory.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, Heartwarming But Lacking Realism","Simply adorable. Everyone's favorite blue tang fish is back in this sequel all about her. Finding Dory is all about Dory and where she came from and how she came to meet up with Marlin and Nemo. Going back to Dory's origins, the audience gets to see Dory as the cutest animated baby in the world. I mean let's just give the animators here a round of applause for getting some of the smallest details correct, mirroring real fish and lighting and the like, perfectly, but also they created one of the cutest little fish in the world that completely fits with the character. Dory is great, and this film highlights everything about her that makes her so great. She kind, she's loving, she's generous, and she never lets anything keep her down. Dory is a strong character who has never ending hoping and optimism. She's carefree much like Ellen DeGeneres. Ellen was perfect for the first movie, and she was perfect here too, she gets the characters, she knows which emotions to bring to life to the character with perfection. I cannot stress enough how heartwarming that was, to see Dory back on the screen on an adventure to find her home and her family.Probably the biggest problem — yes, while the acting was perfect, the story was not — of the film is the over-the-top story. Finding Nemo took the audience on an adventure through the ocean. It was very much an adventure. Here, the audience is taking a trip to an aquarium. There is no sense of adventure here. It's fun, it's heartwarming, but the adventure, that sort of tension, it's massively diminished once they are out of the ocean. Then there is the realism of the film. You would think that going to an aquarium would be realistic. Unfortunately not. Once again, Finding Nemo was more realistic. It almost seems as though the writers were trying to balance out the lack of adventure with fun, outlandish antics, but that only resulted in the film being unrealistic. You've got a septapus driving around the Aquarium, a whale shark and beluga escape the aquarium, and much more somewhat ridiculous things are going on in the movie. Is it fun to watch? Totally, kids will love it, but the realism is gone, and that detracts from the overall potential of the film.There is so much heart in the movie, even scenes that will make the audience cry and it's a film about family, so it's great. But, if you ask me, Finding Nemo is still better.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Finding Dory"" fish-tails nicely with its predecessor, but has different strengths.","Movie Fans are always searching for something when we go to the movies. I mean, that's why we go to the theater, right? We're looking to be entertained, touched, inspired, educated, and more. Filmmakers are more than happy to facilitate our search. In the past three decades or so, we Movie Fans searched for Spock, spent time searching for Bobby Fisher and for Sugar Man, and engaged in efforts aimed at finding places called Graceland and Neverland, finding people called Forrester and Mr. Right and, of course, finding a little lost clownfish named Nemo. But all that looking was easier than actually finding a sequel to the Best Animated Feature Oscar winner ""Finding Nemo"". One of that film's voice acting co-stars, Ellen DeGeneres, spent years on her talk show calling for a sequel. You wouldn't think it would be difficult to find the motivation to make a sequel to one of the highest-grossing and best-loved animated films of all time, but the original's director and co-writer, Andrew Stanton, felt he needed to find a decent story first. Eventually, he did, and now Ellen and her co-stars, along with all of us Movie Fans, get to enjoy ""Finding Dory"" (PG, 1:37).It's a direct sequel to the 2003 original, but is also part prequel and part sidequel. At the beginning of this film, we get a short origin story when we meet the adorable titular regal blue tang fish, who's even more adorable as a tiny, young swimmer (voiced by Sloane Murray and Lucia Geddes). Dory is struggling to navigate life under the sea as a small fish with comical (but not overdone) short-term memory loss but she has the help of her patient and loving parents, Jenny and Charlie (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy). Sadly, Dory forgets about the dangers of the undercurrent near her home and she ends up getting swept away from mom and dad, and just lost. As an adult, Dory (Degeneres) meets a clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is desperately working at finding his lost son, Nemo (now voiced by Hayden Rolence), and the kind-hearted Dory offers to help Marlin find Nemo. (That's the sidequel part.) A year after Nemo is found and returns to life off the coast of Australia, Dory is living right next to Marlin and Nemo's anemone home and regularly accompanies Nemo to his school of fish. During one of the lessons taught by Mr. Ray (a spotted eagle ray, voiced again by Bob Peterson), Dory flashes back to a memory about her parents. She decides that she needs to find them and asks Marlin and Nemo to help her – even though it means swimming to California. Marlin is reluctant to embark on another adventure in the open ocean, but he kinda owes Dory for helping to save Nemo and all, so Marlin agrees. With the help of their old friends the sea turtles, led by Crush (again voiced by director and co-writer Andrew Stanton), and with his son, Squirt (now voiced by Bennett Dammann), Dory, Marlin and Nemo make it all the way to an educational water park at Morro Bay, California... but have no aquatic idea what to do next.As with ""Finding Nemo"", in ""Finding Dory"", creatures of various species show themselves to be more helpful and compassionate to each other than most members of the species homo sapiens are. After Dory gets herself scooped up by people harvesting fish off the coast, a couple of lazy sea lions (Idris Elba and Dominic West) lift their heads off of their favorite rock long enough to hook up Marlin and Nemo with a (literal) loon named Becky. She scoops Marlin and Nemo up in a pail and helps them get inside the Marine Life Park in hopes of finding Dory. Meanwhile, Dory has been tagged and taken to a quarantine area, where she waits with the other sea creatures to be shipped to a new large aquarium in Cleveland. Dory meets a grumpy octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill) who is set to be sent back to the ocean, but wants Dory's fin tag so he can be sent to Cleveland. (And why not? With a world-class arts scene, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, improving sports teams and terrific zoo, what's not to love?) Marlin and Nemo spend the rest of the movie overcoming obstacles to find Dory as she, with Hank's help, tries to find her parents. Dory gets additional aid from Destiny (Katilin Olson), a nearsighted whale shark who turns out to be a long-lost childhood friend, and a beluga whale named Bailey (Ty Burrell) who lacks confidence in his own echolocation abilities. Guided by additional flashes of memory, the signs within Marine Life Park and the educational loud-speaker narration of Sigourney Weaver (as herself), Dory slowly zeroes in on finding out what happened to her parents, even as all of the characters learn some lessons about determination, helpfulness and valuing each other's individual qualities.""Finding Dory"" is a true sequel to its predecessor, but has different strengths. While ""Finding Nemo"" was a revelation in its animation and story-telling, ""Finding Dory"" keeps the action more confined and tighter. The first film has more interesting characters and more laughs, but the sequel has more heart. Of course, the sequel also benefits from the significant advances in computer animation over the previous dozen years. The backgrounds are wonderful, the textures on the sea creatures are remarkable and the colors are vibrant. I definitely recommend ""Finding Dory"" (whether you saw the original or not) – and I'd also recommend that you get to the theater early enough for the adorable animated short ""Piper"" (which is deserving of an Oscar nomination, along with the main attraction) and stay long enough to see the cute and funny post-credits scene. From the end of the previews until the screen finally goes dark, it's all worth it for ""Finding Dory"". ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth a Gander,"So this is it. It's been 21 years since Pixar first released its maiden film and captured the coveted cross-generational appeal and universal acclaim that brought unbelievable success to a once fledgling animation studio. Within those 21 years there have been some stumbles (cough, cough Cars 2 (2011)) yet to date none of Pixar's films, full feature or otherwise have been critically panned to the point where audiences stay away in droves. Will Finding Dory be the one to put down the giant? Like everything that turns 21, will Pixar stop growing and slowly slide into ill-health?I'm glad to say that despite being a sequel, Finding Dory is a solid, visually striking and thoroughly entertaining feature. Dory (DeGeneres) the Blue Tang with the heart of gold and a memory of...well a fish, begins to remember where she comes from after connecting the dots of past traumas. She, along with clown fish Marlin (Brooks) and Nemo (Rolence) make the long journey from Australia's Great Barrier Reef to California in order to find her family. Along the way to Dory's ultimate self-discovery they meet a cast of colorful characters including a grumpy octopus named Hank (O'Neill), a nearsighted whale shark named Destiny and the recorded voice of Sigourney Weaver which drones over the loud speakers of the California Marine Life Institute.Finding Dory hits just the right amount of familiar story beats to keep children rooting for their favorite characters while introducing new themes, characters and emotional textures as to not seem repetitive. Very little of the film focuses on the journey to get from the anemone to the shores of the Golden State (despite it being far further than P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney). Instead much of the movie takes place at the aforementioned Marine Life Institute where our protagonists split for a spell. By that point Finding Dory more closely resembles a game of Zelda than a road movie with characters solving a multitude of problems within a finite time frame.It is the scenes where Dory and Marlin come up with out-of-the-box solutions and take bold risks that remain the most entrancing thematically. While many children's films follow the mold of a moral about perseverance despite adversity, Finding Dory takes things a bit further. With the help of the camouflaging Hank, the echo location skills of Bailey the beluga (Burrell), the unique (let's say) abilities of Becky the sea bird et al. we get the sense the movie is telling us that we can all use a little help from our friends from time to time. Friends who through a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and abilities can help you figure things out.There were some small missteps many of which stem from the dicey proposition of having the goofy sidekick play the lead roll. In Finding Nemo (2003), Dory's short-term memory loss was an endearing (if occasionally annoying) little quirk that worked well against Marlin's growing perturbation. Here however, Dory is left to fend for herself one too many times. It may sound heartbreaking on paper but on film, Dory's constant struggle to realize where she is and what she was formerly doing gets frustrating after a time. Luckily Hank fills the straight-man void while Marlin and Nemo hurriedly try to find Dory.In comparison to Pixar's other features, Finding Dory arguably sits comfortably in the middle of the pack. It doesn't reach the narrative nadir of The Good Dinosaur (2015) but it's certainly no Up (2009). The stakes aren't as grave as the original and the emotional core of the film feels slight by comparison. That said, the film's keen ability to solve problems creatively, coupled with some new and interesting characters keeps the film incredibly entertaining to watch. Additionally the takeaway in this case is sincere, will executed and not all that common. Overall, Finding Dory is worth your time to see in theaters and proof that not everything begins to dystrophy after 21.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Generic, but a Satisfying and Beautiful Sequel","Pixar has once again strengthened its brand on delivering quality animation, though lack of highly original featured in Inside Out but definitely not repeating the sequel misfire just as the Cars franchise. The plot itself seems a bit generic, familiar and sort of predictable but the combination of both positive and negative core values about determination, love, family, friendship, memories, sadness, lost and regret have contributed to several thought provoking moments. It is a bright, clever and simple thanks to the adorable main character, Dory and introduction of new characters full with heart; audiences might have mix feelings of sweetness, inspiring and sadness throughout the adventure of this little blue creature under the sea with spectacular and colorful visual treats. It might not match the classiness of Nemo and full of kids imagination especially at the final act, it still works well for family goers and delivers the messages which the film intends to. Just like what Dory says ""The best things happen by chance, because that's life""; the best animation happens by teamwork, because that's real effort.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful,"What in the hell is wrong with the haters??I'm starting to believe they missed the point of the movie entirely. Some say Nemo is better, I actually like Finding Dory a lot more than Finding Nemo and here is why. This is the first movie for kids (and adults) that I've seen where they tell you that your illness is not an obstacle in your life, that whatever problem you have you can turn it into a positive thing and something unique that makes you who you are. In a world of bullying and discrimination, I think it's an incredibly beautiful message to give both to kids and adults. Marvin and Nemo love Dory for who she is and Dory realizes that everything she accomplished she did because of who she was. Apart from this, the movie is funny, sweet and really entertaining. The cast is also superb!! So, please, please go watch Finding Dory, no matter how old you are, and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finding Dory makes for a fun splash, even if the wonder and emotional punch isn't as strong","Thirteen years ago, Pixar gave the world one of the biggest animation hits of all time, Finding Nemo. People went nuts for the beautiful animation, the father-son story that parents related to so much, and probably the biggest selling point, the use of Ellen DeGeneres as the fish with short- term memory loss. As much of a surprise as it was to some people, I originally didn't care for Finding Nemo. I was a freshman in high school at that point and was the wrong age to get into a story about a little child trying to be found by his worrywart father. It wasn't until several years later that I gave it another watch and really started to appreciate what it gave us.When Disney announced that a sequel would be developed, I wasn't sure how to react. The tract record for Pixar sequels has been a mixed bag. The Toy Story sequels are amazing movies that built upon the world of toys, but Cars 2 took a step back by giving the uninteresting side character his own story while Monsters University did all right showing us an origin story. Lets take a dive back into the water to see where Finding Dory ranks.It's been about a year since the events of Finding Nemo and Blue Tang Dory (played by Ellen DeGeneres) has been living peacefully with Clownfish Marlin (played by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (played by Hayden Rolence). While she's still suffering from short-term memory lost, she's been experiencing occasional flashes of old thoughts. While helping out on field trip for Nemo's class, a view of the sting ray migration triggers a sudden urge to find her parents. With the only clue being that they might be off the coast of Morro Bay, California, Marlin and Nemo accompany her to help.They arrive, but are separated when Dory is ""rescued"" by marine biologists. It turns out that the coast is right outside of a Marine Institute/Aquarium attraction. It's here where Dory also comes across a grumpy Octopus Hank (played by Ed O'Neil), a near-sighted shark whale Destiny (played by Katlin Olson), and a beluga whale whose sonar is broken Bailey (played by Ty Burrell). They all try to help Dory see where her parents went while Marlin and Nemo try to find Dory.Finding Dory seems like a sequel that doesn't have much reason to exist, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. Thanks to the same team from the original movie returning, they give Dory a pretty solid background on where she came from. Parents of children with disabilities will probably relate to this story given how much Dory's parents go through to make sure their daughter is happy. While part of me misses some of the characters from before, it makes up by including some likable new animals. Ed O'Neal seems to know how to use his ""grumpy"" personality to his advantage. Of course this movie belongs to Ellen DeGeneres who is not only funny, but a pretty good dramatic actress (she much love doing her talk show, as I've always wondered why she hasn't done more movies).Finding Dory is a very good movie, though not a great one. To be fair, the original movie is tough to top. I think the issue falls on two things. First, the story of Dory finding her parents can feel a bit repetitive to the first movie. And also, while Finding Nemo gave us a vast ocean off the coast of Australia, here were stuck at this Marine park for most of the story. It's nice looking, but it does limit how much these fish can do.I'll give this eight Dorys out of ten. This movie will definitely please families looking for a fun animated movie and movie fans that have been waiting for a sequel. I myself was laughing at several jokes and even hoped that Dory would find what she was looking for. It may have not had the emotional punch the original had, but Finding Dory is a solid effort, come on in with the fishes and keep on swimming.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Rare Pixar Sequel That Can Be Emotionally Riveting,"In the past, Pixar movies I've come to know as a kid since the 90s have introduced many funny and versatile characters going on the most riveting adventures. Now, Pixar has produced a sequel that may possibly be worthy of reaching the same ranks as the successful Toy Story film series. 2003's Finding Nemo spin-off sequel 'Finding Dory' is a movie that can reach an impactful emotional tone in its own right.The story takes place about one year after blue tang fish Dory helped clownfish Marlin search for his son Nemo. She now lives with the clownfish family, but feels she needs to piece together the whereabouts of her own long-lost family. As before, it's a desperate search which this time ultimately leads them to another side of the Pacific, a marine life aquarium in Monterrey, California.Admittedly, when I first heard the title, I began to sneer at such an idea since the studio's last two sequel/prequel efforts like Cars 2 was disastrous in terms of story. Whereas Monsters University was pretty average. Thus making me think ""what gives them the idea this sequel will be any different?"" Of course, when I first watched 'Dory,' it was something I found just as emotionally driven if certainly not better than its 2003 predecessor. I feel it is something as poised as Pixar's recent Oscar-winning hit Inside Out, namely on its importance of family. There were times in the movie where I felt lost and had some predictable scenarios as well, but this felt more than just a sequel where they throw in new characters or settings, it's the issue of how one can comprehend loss or separation, especially if the individual has an impairment in short-term memory at a very young age. Ellen DeGeneres gracefully reprises the role as forgetful fish Dory with such believability in making her look vulnerable and helpless with such a condition. With Marlin and Nemo tagging along for the ride, they are assisted by their de facto guide Hank (voiced well by 'Modern Family' star Ed O'Neill), an anxious octopus (or ""heptapus"" as Dory humorously calls him regarding missing a tentacle) wanting to escape to Cleveland as she continues her search around the aquarium. What gave a nice touch to the whole movie was actress Sigourney Weaver serving as the aquarium's hostess (similar to what she did for Pixar's Wall-E) and especially highlighting how Dory's personal journey clumsily, yet fatefully intertwined with Marlin's own journey when they first met in the 2003 original. Pixar easter eggs are also worth pondering over in various parts of the movie, too.This is more than just a ""kid's movie"" and I emphasize on that. I would recommend this to adults with children of their own to see that because Dory has an impairment, she is easily misunderstood by many. But that doesn't mean it should be taken for granted. Instead, it's more about the values and what longing to be with a family truly feels like after so long.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pixar hits my nostalgia button, and it works.","If you're around my age, there's a pretty good chance that Finding Nemo was a part of your childhood, and there's also a good chance that you really enjoyed it both then and now. It is an incredibly heartfelt and emotionally rich story that just happens to be incredibly well-animated. It also stands quite well on its own.So, naturally, when Disney announced that they were making a sequel entitled Finding Dory, I was more than a little skeptical of how they were going to proceed. Finding Nemo to me was so self-contained that there wasn't much of anywhere to go with the story. I mean, I know that Pixar has done some good work with sequels before, but they've also misfired big time (anybody else remember Cars 2 or Monsters University?).Thankfully, Finding Dory definitely fits into the better half of Pixar's filmography. It is surprisingly engaging and a natural progression of the first film's story, and also has some of the best animation Pixar has done yet.How does Pixar make this story work, you ask? It's quite simple (and quite spoiler-free as well): everything revolves around Dory's condition of short- term memory loss. There's not a real villain or even a mild antagonist anywhere to be found in the entire film. This makes it a much lighter and simpler journey than Finding Nemo, but it also makes character development suffer a little bit. Granted, there's plenty of good characters that are developed quite well in the film, in particular an octopus named Hank as well as Dory herself. I'm just of the opinion that an antagonist makes a good character into a great one. That being said, for the kind of film that Finding Dory is trying to be, it actually kind of works and is not something noticed while actually watching it.This is mostly because of the stellar voice acting. Pixar has always had a knack for finding great voices to fit their characters, but Finding Dory has some particularly good choices. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory was a great choice in Finding Nemo, and seeing the back-and-forth between her and Albert Brooks as Marlin is quite refreshing and quick-witted. As far as new characters are concerned, all of them have great casting behind them. In particular, I enjoyed Ed O'Neill as the aforementioned Hank, Ty Burrell as Bailey, a beluga whale, and Kaitlin Olson as Destiny, a near-sighted whale shark. All of them had great emotion and really made their characters come alive.What always sets Pixar's films apart from every other animation studio's is the quality of the animation. Finding Nemo was so gorgeous when it was released and remains an incredibly groundbreaking step in animated technology. Finding Dory takes this even further. The sheer quality, depth, and texture of the animation present here is astonishing. It might be their best-looking film to date, which even to someone who understands how far computer animation technology has advanced in the past few years might be surprising.You might be asking yourself at this point whether or not I'm going to find any significant flaws in Finding Dory. As hard as I try, I can't; however, that doesn't mean it's perfect. It's mostly just really, really good all around. It never quite reaches the stellar narrative heights of the best Pixar films that have come before it and can't seem to tug on my heart as much either, but that doesn't diminish it as a standalone film. Even though it's not the best thing Pixar has ever made (which at this point would be an incredibly hard thing to make), Finding Dory is a well-animated and emotionally tugging film that will entertain both children and their parents that bring them to see it.Grade: 89",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sadly disappointed..,"I was expecting more than this as it is true that Finding Nemo has been one of greatest in my list. This sequel lacks humor, desperate situation, suspension, delightful moment which was all there in the original one. it was long time ago like thirteen years first I seen Nemo and when I see his name or character in anywhere, it brings me smile and make me thinking about the movie again. but this one...sorry...you got too many people to find now.

"I laughed, I cried, I love it more than Finding Nemo.","After reading one of the negative reviews, I had to step up and say how much I loved this movie. I can't wait to see it again and again because there are so many details I want to see again that I might have missed.I laughed, I cried. My heart is warm and fuzzy coming out of the movie.I loved ""Finding Nemo"", but honestly, I love this movie more. I don't know if it's because I love Ellen so much, or I like the idea of Dory finally getting credit for finding Nemo in the first place, or the story of overcoming adversity and disability. I LOVED IT ALL!!!!Without giving away any of the details. The reason I loved the movie so much is because I came away with a great feeling of hope. If Dory can do that, I can do anything. I often get distracted in my own life and go off on a tangent, and don't accomplish what I set out to accomplish initially. So when Dory overcomes an obstacle, I feel encouraged about my own obstacles. If Dory can do it, I can do it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why supporting characters are supporting characters,"As we learned from Cars 2, bringing a supporting cast member - in that case, Mater - to lead a sequel often essentially makes the side the entree. Watching 2 hours - and wow, is this thing too long - of Dory doing cutesy stuff and forgetting stuff becomes grindingly tedious. The miracle of ""Finding Nemo"" grew out of the animators finding a way for small fish, who are essentially prisoners of the vast and largely featureless water, to have often land-based adventures without unduly straining credulity. ""Finding Dory"" lacks the inventiveness when it comes to working around the limitations of the aquatic by employing an octopus who luckily doesn't need to be kept wet, who breathes are, can drive a truck, can match any background he squishes against, and who happens to have fine motor skills. Sure real octopi can open a jar to get a fish out but riding a stroller like a wheelchair comes across as a wincey bit unrealistic. The underwater seascapes drawn by the animators are amazingly realistic and if you just turn down the sound of the humorless and dull dialog, the movie is on whole beautiful to look at. There's just too much of it to look at with a runtime that features way too much swimming of small fish through pipes or underwater paths or sunken freighters. In short, Pixar needed to spend more resources on the script and less on the animation.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A beautiful, hilarious, and touching new adventure","Wow. I am amazed at some of the negative comments about this movie.It's been 13 years since Finding Nemo swam onto the big screen and immediately captured the hearts of people everywhere - young and old. I always felt like there was something special about Finding Nemo. Now, Pixar has created a truly wonderful sequel, Finding Dory.At first I was somewhat hesitant about this new film for two reasons: 1, How could it ever live up to its predecessor? 2, Everyone knows sequels are never that great.But it's important to address that this is not Finding Nemo. It is supplementary and should not really be negatively compared to it. I thought this film was stellar. From start to finish, I was locked in. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was darn close. I laughed and cried, embracing this new sequel for what it was: a new adventure. Halfway through, I told my movie buddy that I felt like this was a film you had to see again in theaters. The animation was beautiful, the actors were wonderful, and the idea of the rehabilitation center was interesting. It was nice to see Marlin and Nemo working together, and Hank was one of my favorite characters.For someone who grew up on Finding Nemo, I can honestly say that I'm so happy about this sequel. It will never replace Finding Nemo, but I don't think that was its intention. This film was fueled by different intentions. In Finding Nemo, Nemo's goal is to prove his worth, while in Finding Dory, Dory wants to find her long-lost parents. And maybe I'm just naive, but at times I really didn't know what was going to happen next. I enjoyed tagging along for the ride as new events began to unfold left and right!I really loved this movie and am not ashamed to say it! I will definitely be seeing it again soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who cares if it pickles their imaginations by conjuring up a non-world, something that could only exist in the swarming collective brain of a gigantic corporation?I recommend running early Pixar or classic Disney for your young ones.

There roles were too funny and also very much delightful. Most important thing is that the movie makes us realize how much a family is very important to us! specially Dory's love for her parent.

Pixar.......did it again!!!,"2 August 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Finding Dory. I have been looking forward to this film for soooooo long. A sequel to Finding Nemo what could be better. It did not disappoint. There were a lot of children in the audience and I'm not entirely sure they got it all but I also espied a white haired lady who must have been in her 80s so that just goes to show how Pixar entertains the generations. As the title suggests this film is all about Dory, how she remembers that she once had a family and the journey she takes to find them again. Now you have to remember we are talking about fish here.....they cannot survive out of water......yet our heroine and her friends constantly gain access to buildings, travel on highways and generally do stuff that fish wouldn't do!!!!!!! Yes I know it's animation but let's have a big shout out for the imaginations of the writers who feed the creative minds of the animators and together they constantly bring us characters we take to our hearts, and ultimately to our DVD collections. Executive Producer John Lasseter who must be the Godfather of Pixar brought to us a film with great characters, the cutest baby Dory, and a good simple storyline which was both touching and funny.

Proof that not every successful film automatically needs a sequel,"I went to watch this with my man and his employee and it was disappointing. I have Finding Nemo on DVD and like it very much. My only merits for this film are for the noble intentions of Nemo and his father, besides that, this is almost 2 hours of my life I won't get back, this film drags on so much that by the first hour I felt like I'd spent a full day watching it and on top of that I still had very little connection to the characters and their story hadn't even started. Second hour hit, still nothing, I was almost asleep. hahahaaha an octopus that is missing tentacles, not really. I might as well have been asleep, the story was still stagnant. As a sequel, it's like watching paint dry, it just doesn't get going. If you have the time to spare and have nothing better to do or watch then by all means, watch this film, but if you have something better do with your time then please, avoid this film. The length of the film doesn't justify the lack of story or the cinematic prowess, this could very easily have been a half hour short film. I can say none of us enjoyed much about this film.

A Charming Continuation of a Classic,"Finding Dory does something pretty special: it finds a way to organically continue the story that was left off from the previous film without compromising what made the first film so special in the first place. Dory's backstory is such a natural question to answer that it's amazing this movie wasn't made sooner.There's a lot more slapstick this time around, and the actions of the fish out of water and a slippery octopus seems worlds apart from the world in Finding Nemo, but the heart is still there, and so are the great characters and voice work. Plus, I just love the color the Ocean provides. Scenes in the aquarium are bright and lively and I could watch a whole movie just exploring that tank and meeting the various sea creatures that reside in there.Young Dory is maybe the cutest character I've ever seen, and her determination to find her family is what made her such a breakout character 13 years ago. This film doesn't really reach the great heights of Nemo, but it certainly adds a whole lot of charm to an already charming world. I hope Pixar continues to make original and creative movies, but if they want to make more sequels they need to look no further than this movie to get an idea of how they should be done.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unforgettable and deeply enjoyable adventure...,"Whilst the gorgeous animation, impressive voice cast and technical skill are all incredibly important and central to the film's overall success, it is the subtlety in its inspiring themes that make Finding Dory work so profoundly. The plethora of messages - home, identity, love, family - gives something for all the family to appreciate, and learn from, without ever feeling heavy-handed or out of place. Finding Dory is evidence that it takes multiple elements to make a film successful and Pixar pass each of them with flying colours. I can nit-pick and go searching for flaws but at the end of it, Dory's own determination reflects that of Pixar's to craft another incredible tale and, like the theme song suggests, it really is unforgettable.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/08/finding-dory-3d-2016- review.html",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than expected,"My expectations for this were it would be OK at best. From the trailers it looked like a straight rehash of the first movie. Main character gets kidnapped and put in an aquarium and other main character(s) go to look for them. I'm happy to say that it's not like that all. The plot is actually pretty original. Baby Dory is a-Dory-ble. The cutest Pixar baby since Baby Mike Wazowski in ""Monsters University."" The way they showed Dory's backstory leading up to Finding Nemo was done very well. Sometimes too many flashbacks can kill a movie, but these didn't feel forced or excessive. One problem I do have is the writers/director seemed to have forgotten that Marlin learned not to be overprotective at the end of Finding Nemo. He still has some overprotective tendencies. I still say the original is better, but Pixar has made worse. ""The Good Dinosaur"" wasn't near the big spectacle it promised to be. ""Dory"", however had enough familiarity for those who grew up with the original while at the same time bringing something new to the table Grade: B. 8/10. 3.5/5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Good Sequel,"Finding Dory had some pretty great humour. Not laugh out loud comedy, but more along the lines of ""that was funny, I'm going to smile now because that was funny, well played Pixar"". Here are some jokes which I can loosely remember: ""Don't bail on me, bailey"" and ""You trust Becky? Becky is eating a cup"". The stronger laughs came from the visual humour- the slapstick. I would expect this since when I watched the movie the majority of the audience were children. I found myself being entertained the most by the subtle, ""adult"" jokes that came mainly from the voice acting and animation.The new characters were all really likable. I loved the sea-lions as well as the octopus. However Nemo and Marlin (returning fish) felt stale and boring: they created so much conflict in the movie which felt unnecessary and forced, also they hardly added anything to the humour and were mainly there to be damsels in distress. The movie would have been much better without them. Dory on the other hand was great, her quirkiness worked well with every character she encountered and it never got old for me. The only thing that I didn't like was the whale noise she had to make in one scene that made me cringe a little. Her growth as a character was really enjoyable to watch and I found myself rooting for her. The moral message of the movie was quite weak. Unlike Zootropolis which did a great job providing a strong, meaningful message emphasised the importance of treating every person equally, to not discriminate on what somebody looks like and not to stereotype. On the other hand, the only message for children and adults alike in this movie is that you should not overthink your life and follow your dreams no matter what. I know this is a positive message but the movie could have done so much more! They could have made a social commentary about how fish should not be used for profit and how their enclosures are unnecessary small so that the paying public can easily watch miserable animals. However, by being anti-sea world they could have potentially faced some sort of law suit for slander and/or deformation. There was one scene which I really enjoyed and that was partly anti-sea world. Dory and Hank the octopus found themselves trapped in a petting pool for sea life in the children's section of the aquarium. It was kind of epic how the movie portrayed children as extremely rough, deadly and terrifying, kind of like a tentacle monster. Hands thrusted into the petting pool and created an explosion of water and sand as star fish cowered under rocks and buried into the sand. It compelled me to start a petition to end petting in aquariums because sea-life are not really into touching. A comparison must be made to the original movie because this is not a stand-alone movie; it has numerous throw-backs to Finding Nemo are not unwelcome. However, the whole tone of the movie was rather different. Finding Nemo was about a desperate father who would stop at nothing in order to find his son. Marlin went through many dangerous and deadly trials as well as traversing so many miles of ocean. Finding Dory is a much more contained experience since the focus is around an aquarium. I remember early in the film Dory says that she is desperate to find her parents and she must reach California to see her parents again. Marlin reacts in a manner that would indicate that California is literally thousands of miles away. Next couple of scenes, boom! They're in California. I can understand that this was done in order to fit more of the aquarium story line in but it kind of takes away from the first film. Let's talk about Hank the octopus. I love Hank the Octopus. He was so cool; he could transform into any object via camouflage, had a selfish bad-ass personality, could perform stunts similar to a special agent and had lost a tentacle (like a decorated war hero). He was always there to help characters out and he was compassionate even though he had a tough exterior (because octopuses have three hearts), he was also beautifully animated because even though octopuses don't have a visible mouth on the front of their face I could always tell what emotion was being expressed. Another character that really stood out was Gerald the sea lion. An absolute lad. He had a mono-brow, a bucket and a very sassy personality. Resented by the other sea lions Gerald always plotted the next opportunity in which he could bask on the beautiful rock which was always occupied by Fluke and Rudder. I was rooting for Gerald. He was the most interesting and unique character I have ever laid eyes on in an animated film.

Whether their biggest gem is their stellar technical abilities or their gift of bringing their heart-touching stories to life before our very eyes, Pixar never stops delivering the goods. Easily one of their most classic entries is director Andrew Stanton's 2003 feature 'Finding Nemo' which took audiences everywhere in an under-the-sea odyssey of a lovable clown fish in search of his lost son while acquiring the help of a funny, amnesiac blue tang. 13 years have passed and Pixar has managed to bring back most of our characters from the original and take us on another ride for relatively similar adventure. The biggest change here is unlike the predecessor which found Marlin and Dory searching for the young titular character, this one finds a new character in the Nemo's former position. And that is character is no one other than the lovable Dory, the fish suffering from her notorious short-term memory loss. Set one year after the events of the original, clown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voiced by Hayden Rolence) are home with the latter attending school and Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) being a helping hand with raising Nemo. Meanwhile, Dory is haunted by the memories of her family who she lost as a child, prompting her to set out to reunite with them. However, when she is unexpectedly kidnapped and placed in a Californian public aquarium, Marlin and Nemo was set out to rescue her.When the original hit theaters back in the spring of 2003, Dory is by far the biggest show-stealer of the feature. Bringing on non-stop hilarity with her short-term memory loss and constantly being a burden to Marlin's search of his son due to her inability to remembering anything longer than a few seconds, why wouldn't it be a good idea to explore deep into the origins of this lovable character? This film opens with a long flashback of Dory as a young child with her parents, and how her parents coped with her short-term memory loss which is handled surprisingly well. Rather than establishing Dory as a source of utter annoyance, the story maturely handles her mental predicament as sympathy. Some time later, she finds herself separated from her parents and struggling vigorously to find them. Afterwards, the film jumps to the present with her living with Marlin and Nemo from the previous entry and that is when the story finally kicks off. Like the original film, her amnesia still lingers and is constantly struggling trying to memorize simple things longer than a matter of seconds. But as the adventure begins and the characters making fateful efforts on helping her reunite with her long-lost family, the film not ingeniously handles her amnesiac disorder with substance but effectively established Dory as a self-aware burden who knows her mental disability causes trouble. And this easily stands as one of the most emotional and heartfelt elements of the story. There is plenty of fun (including a ridiculous car chase at the end) and certainly plenty of laughs to be handed on this adventure. And as this is Pixar, the film also holds a fair share of touching moments, though it never reaches the level of being a tear-jerker like 'Up' or the 'Toy Story' series.While we witness the return of our characters from the original entry (some of which are reserved for a post-credits scene), we also encounter a range of some new colorful characters along the way. First of which is Hank the Red Octupus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) who becomes a faithful companion for Dory on her wild adventure through the aquarium. Similarly to Dory, he provides a good share of laughter throughout his time on screen. Then there is some childhood friends of Dory including Destiny (voiced by Kaitlin Olsen) the Whale Shark and Bailey (voiced by Ty Burrell) the Beluga Whale who both become helping hands along the way. Idris Alba and Dominic West both provide the voices of sea lions who have a few good laughs but spend most of their time lying on a rock while hogging from a another sea lion in a comedic competition (they are not much help). Becky, a black-furred bird and piercing red eyes who doesn't provide much dialogue other than a series of loud squawks but also slips a few laughs for the kiddies. Each and every one the characters here are vastly likable and the film makes a rare surprise to providing a story without the presence of an actual villain (at least not in character form. With all great intentions, it works astoundingly well. And who can forget about the photo-realistic computer animation used to bring both the world and the characters to life.Finding Dory is a heartwarming animated adventure that delivers a surprisingly touching continuation to Pixar's classic 2003 original. This film is a joyful sure to please both children and adults alike. Predictably so, it may be not endure as memorably as it's predecessor. Regardless, it doesn't have to be. Anyone who enjoyed the previous film is almost guaranteed to enjoy this one without a single noticeable flaw.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Dory is Disney Pixars's 17th feature film and a triumph in animated storey telling.,"Finding Dory is Disney Pixars's 17th feature film and a triumph in animated storey telling. Set after the events of Finding Nemo writer and director Andrew Stanton takes audiences on a greatly emotional yet heart-warming adventure alongside Dory voiced by the incredible Ellen DeGeneres who, this time round, sees herself as the picture's leading protagonist. The film begins with a young Dory and her parents. She resembles an adorable small blue fish with bulging eyes however this isn't the overly happy, slightly annoying yet funny Dory we are used to this is a young child who is suffering with a disorder; that disorder being short term memory loss and is reliant on her parents. When being caught under an undertow of manta rays Dory is separated from her parents and can't find them as she has no recollection of their names or where she saw them last. Dory searches the ocean un successfully, asking fish if they have seen them until she meets Marlin for the first time. This is when Finding Nemo takes place, this film however is set after these events. Realising how much she misses her parents Nemo and Marlin accompany Dory to help her find them, facing various obstacles along the way. Of course there are a few familiar faces on their journey furthermore various new characters are met such as Hank (Ed O'Neil), an octopus who is missing a tentacle and is therefore an septapus and Destiny (Kaitlin Olson), a whale in which used to communicate with Dory via the pipes of her marine exhibition.Ellen DeGeneres's vocal humour is something unique, particular to this film, I couldn't imagine any other actress fulfilling the role of Dory and doing it justice simply because I've grown accustom the character from a young age and her energetic and excitable tone of voice. However unlike Finding Nemo, Ellen no longer is in that supporting role. She finds herself as the films protagonist and my God she owns it. There was always a risk with this character that at times she could become annoying or perhaps just a little over the top, based on her supporting role in Finding Nemo however director and screen writer Andrew Stanton ensures this is not the case, adding much more depth and emotion in which was never really explored in the original film. Finding Dory has a focus on Dory's short term memory loss and presents it as a serious condition unlike the first picture where it was more so a humorous trait. Of course Stanton interprets traditional Pixar themes in this picture such as the most obvious theme of loss, notorious in other films such as Toy Story 2, Wall-E, Up and of course finding Nemo. Not only this however Dory finds her calling which is to search for her parents, a character finding their calling is a theme which is followed in pretty much all Pixar films.Audiences will be blown away by Pixar's revolutionary animation. The sea flows realistically and naturally whilst coral reefs look like something out of a beautiful acid infused trip. The fish swim and move so naturally and fluently whilst light reflects from the surface and from the fishes scales as if it could be real. Animation wise finding Dory is an absolute spectacle and a stoner's dream, I would certainly place it up there alongside Inside Out which is a tough one to top simply based on the art which I loved. Finding Dory is a well- deserved sequel to an iconic piece of animated cinema which does its predecessor justice even if it doesn't quite manage to top it. I therefore rate finding Dory an incredible 8/10. I would also like to add that I have been inactive for a year and almost considered giving up whatstheplot.info, I realise that it's something I don't want to give up and can ensure readers that this is no longer the case.

Was Not Disappointed At All...,"I registered to this site just for this review! Why? Because the movie was seriously good. I'm really impressed. So, firstly, plot was really good. A sequel to ""Finding Nemo"" as ""Finding Dory"" was pretty much a good idea. And all of the scenes was beautiful and creative. They both appeals to eyes and memories, and they were not cliché either. I also want to refer that this movie was a good choice both for kids and adults who watched Nemo before since for kids, it has cool and creative scenes, which are also funny, and for adults it has moments that are emotional, deep and motivational. A person who watched Nemo in his childhood times could easily like this film because with generation, i can claim, this film has grown up too...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow!,"When I first heard they were making a sequel to finding Nemo I really was not that impressed. Sequels is not really a Pixar thing, but eight years ago when I was in kindergarten, I adored finding Nemo. I am 14 now and wanted see it! And wow! I was blown away! This is a great Pixar movie! It blew away all expectations! I really loved the idea of it being in a aquarium instead of the open ocean like in the first one! That worked great! Pixar nailed the opening scene with baby dory! This movie has some flashbacks with Dory and when she was a child and I loved how they tied everything related to dory to her in the first one! It was very clever. It introduces new characters which are great and hilarious! Catlin Olsen, Ed O'Neill, and Ty Burell worked terrifically. It is a fun and well written story which can entertain adults and kids. It also has good morals and some serious parts to it as well. Kids can learn good lessons watching this movie. The characters are very likable too, Ellen DeGeneres as dory and Albert Brooks as Marlin gave great performances. You will also love how funny it is, not just the adult humor (which by the way was hilarious) but all the jokes can work for everyone! At the end of the day this movie was so awesome and so fun!

"Awesome, highly emotional","Excellent movie to watch, PIXAR movies make people laugh as well as cry, DO NOT listen yo the haters, please watch the movie first, and then see for yourself how bogus the statements of the haters are! People, it is a good movie, a class on its own. I rate it 10, not because i'm insane, but because the rating of the well-deserving movie is going down. $200 million already, you need haters to tell you how the movie is?? Statistics is far more reliable, please do watch it!! Dory, haunted by memories of her parents, her love for her parents, are sure to move hearts. The underwater scenery is astounding!

What an epic adventure...not!,"I'm a huge fan of ""Finding Nemo"", with its many awesome scenes (""Sharkbait! Uh ha ha!"") and interesting characters (Ex: Bruce the shark), but this movie has none of that. The story is paper thin weak: Dory suddenly remembers that she had parents and misses them, goes to meet them, finds her old house in like 5 minutes, even though ""it's on the other side of the ocean"", and then the movie spends all its time with the characters missing each other in this big aquarium facility while I was checking my watch. That's it. No epic adventure, No nothing. New characters and dialogues are also very poor. A huge disappointment.Check out more of my reviews at http://www.crosstastemovies.com",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Far Better than Its Predecessor,"I just watched ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Finding Dory"" back to back, having never seen ""Nemo"" but wanting to get in on the plot line before seeing ""Dory"". I found ""Nemo"" to be a fun movie, and I gave it 8/10 stars--but ""Finding Dory"" is a far superior movie, and of a quality that is very rare for a sequel.If you've not seen ""Nemo"", I'd say that it wouldn't hurt to watch it before going to see this film. There are certainly lots of elements of the two movies that do carry over from one film to the next, and seeing ""Nemo"" will definitely enhance your appreciation for ""Dory"".But that having been said, ""Dory""'s storyline makes it stand head and shoulders above Nemo. There is a lot more interaction with the human world in this film, but even more significant is the compelling story of Dory's attempt to find her parents, and her befriending the prickly octopus named Hank along the way.All in all I've decided to give this movie a 10/10 stars, which is a rarity for me. I did so because I feel like ""Nemo"" deserved an 8/10, and ""Dory"" is so much more enjoyable that I had to go with a 10/10 to do it justice. It's as good of an animated film as I think you may find. Top notch!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forget me not,"Finding Nemo was a big hit with kids and adults alike and led to a surge of interest in clown-fish.Finding Dory is set a year after the events of the first film, as the forgetful Dory, a blue tang fish gets flashbacks to her early fish years in Morro Beach, California and strives to find her parents.Marlon and Nemo assist her but they soon become separated and a lot of the action is set in an Aquarium with narration by Sigourney Weaver. There Dory meets Hank the Octopus who is a master of camouflage and reluctantly decides to help Dory in her quest.It is clear to see how much the CGI animation has improved since Finding Nemo, but this sequel is less charming and also has less originality. Too many scenes are contrived so you see familiar faces or have Dory getting flashbacks with her parents. The finale with a truck chase sequence is just far fetched.My kids enjoyed the movie and found parts of it emotional as well. Interest in clown-fish will still be around for a few more years.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let's swim,"While not as visually dazzling as its predecessor, ""Finding Dory"" is still colorful and it's got terrific performances from a strong voice cast. The script, while predictable, makes a truly touching film in its exploration of identity and family. It is entertaining and beautifully animated, with some amusing set-pieces that will thrill children and the truth is that Dory's story will not leave a dry eye in the cinema. It is another Pixar mega success, and maybe it's not as good as ""Finding Nemo"" but is amazing for viewers of all ages. In few words it is a solid animation film, with impressive visuals, emotion and lots of excitement. nikisreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was really good!,"Firstly, to get it out of the way, I watched the film in English. This movie was what I expected it to be. Funny, heart warming and with a strong theme of family. The plot is very similar to the first film in the sequence, however focuses on Dory trying to find her parents that she forgot about before finding Nemo and Merlin. The characters were funny, the story line made enough sense to appeal to everyone and was simple to follow. This was a solid film, which I would give 8 stars usually. However, this movie made me cry. The reason is simple, it hit home for me, hence why I gave the film a 9 star rating. If you are looking for a good time with a film, or need something to watch with kids that you can enjoy yourself, I would highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unexpected gem!,"I went into this movie expecting something like Cars 2 but instead got something closer to the Toy Story sequels. I had two main concerns first was will this character be able to carry an entire movie and keep it interesting? Or would this end up being a situation like where they try to force-feed a character with a bunch of shtick? My second concern was whether or not the story itself will be strong enough to keep me interested? Well the answer to both of those questions was a most definite YES! I found myself really being invested in this story and the character's journey. I also felt that they wrote Dory great. Nothing too over the top, no schlock and the over-the-top elements were that way for a purpose not just some random gag. In addition, the supporting characters were great as well, highlighting both the emotional and humorous aspects of the story. Nemo and Marlin were of course fantastic, but I really found Fluke and Rudder one of the comedic highlights of the movie. In summary, Finding Dory was a delightful, well-written, funny movie with fully developed characters that you care about and a story that will keep you interested.

Found a true gem,"We return to the Great Barrier Reef, thirteen years after Pixar's marine adventure with Nemo and friends with the story's focus now shifting to that forgetful blue tang, Dory. Co-directed and co- written by Andrew Stanton ('A Bug's life', 'Finding Nemo', 'Wall-E') and Angus MacLane, both accomplished Pixar films' creative geniuses, Dory's story is more a complementary one rather than a sequel. It's richer, funnier, wackier and lightly emotional with our investment in its animated characters that are nimbly voiced by capable actors. Like every Pixar film, Finding Dory too has its lessons for life for children and adults alike and this is especially, an unforgettable one.An adoryble young Dory is nurtured and protected by her loving parents who train her to cope with her 'short term memory loss' issue but there was always that lingering fear that she would forget it all and wander away from them unknowingly. The inevitable thus happened and now, a year after Nemo was found, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) wanders away as usual but this time, farther away from Marlin and Nemo until she revives a distant memory of her parents. She relates that to her home being in the Jewel of Morro Bay which of course, was on the other side of the great ocean. Riding on the turtles, they embark on the California current in search of Dory's parents as they encounter various creatures including Hank (Ed O'Neill) the Septopus, who serves as Dory's guide and savior at the Marine Life Institute even though with a vested interest, Destiny the whale shark who was Dory's pipe-mate, Bailey the Beluga whale that has some mutant-like sonar senses, the outrageously funny sea lions and their eccentric bird friend who is just.. well, odd.Hank is truly the hero here with extensible tentacles that can ride strollers, pick up and transfer items including Dory, out of one peril to the next. There is even an incredible talent he possesses that shapes the climax in the most exciting, incredulous manner that only Pixar can pull off. Marlin and Nemo get separated early on from Dory and have their own entertaining adventures in their search for her. Their encounter with the hilarious sea lions and the awkward seabird is the funniest scene of the year. On the other hand, Dory's journey to find her home engages many of her friends and acquaintances with progress being made along the razor's edge for the most part. Dory's search for her parents and the clownfish duo's search for her happen at a frantic pace that rarely spares a breather while we are completely amazed by the beauty of the world that they swim, hop or fly in.There isn't a villain in 'Finding Dory'. Just like most Pixar films, there are challenges upon challenges in a journey that teach many of us some simple lessons while creating those everlasting memories with impressionable characters against a richer canvas. Directors Stanton and MacLane have thus tackled the short term memory loss problem with a lovable little Dory and depicted it as a frustrating element as she grows up and embarks upon her quest for home-coming. As she suffers from low self esteem due to her memory, she never loses the will to just keep swimming and that, is a brilliantly crafted transition that hits all the emotional cords. Besides, the way the multitude of creatures offer help is also showcasing the goodness that adds to the film's charm for both children and adults alike. Those elements are impeccably enhanced by the mesmerizing animation of the imaginative world underwater. From the various types of fish and sea creatures to the coral reefs, plants and Dory's big round eyes.Pixar just keeps breaking new ground in animation and with Dory, they've taken us through a memorable journey of a forgetful fish and her friends in a timeless tale that has life's essential learnings, charming characters that are voiced by a brilliant cast and in the end, the incredible entertainment that has brought several 'awwww' reactions, laughs, hysteria and relief after a daring escape from a peril. 'Finding Dory' will go down as one of the best Pixar films and animated entertainers but one must also applaud the brief opening clip that showcased some striking animation that was completely real-looking. 'Piper' is not to be missed.9.211 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dull - contrived - Cringe-worthy,"The animation is fine - as is expected of modern films.As stories go it is the worst cartoon I've seen - only lifted by the great scenes containing Hank the Octopus, but they are not enough to make a movie.Nothing to match it's predecessor: Contrived, dull, cringe-worthy.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
More like Toy Story 2 than Cars 2.,"Okay. The original was a flawless Disney masterpiece, and is arguably the best Pixar film of all time (rivaled only by Toy Story). This one was a bit like Toy Story 2. Fun, but not as good as the original. Finding Dory is fun, and great entertainment for parents and kids alike. I do recommend this, and it's fun, but it's not without its flaws. The memory loss thing gets a little repetitive and annoying by the end, and realism is nonexistent here. But it's full of heartwarming, funny and fun moments, and while it's not as good as it's predecessor, it's enjoyable, and it's a fun film. And Hank is great. I've seen so many bad reviews on this film, and I don't understand them. Okay, it is a little long, and I already mentioned the memory loss thing above, but ultimately it's a good, enjoyable Pixar film. If you love Pixar films, and you love the original characters, then you'll probably like this one, even though it doesn't match the flawlessness of the original, it's worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is the epitome of a forgettable film!,"""Finding Dory"" (2016), after the huge mind-blowing surprise of ""Finding Nemo"" (2003), it left me perfectly satisfied and gave me perfect closure to that world and characters. Since it ended on such a perfect and happy note, I didn't need anything else. A sequel hadn't even crossed my mind! So, I moved on to other things, including other movies. But then, when the first announcement for ""Finding Dory"" came out, I was shocked about that. It was the last thing I expected to happen. Keep in mind, there's a 13 year gap between ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Finding Dory"". 13 years! That is absolutely insane! To be fair, sometimes a lengthy period of time between films in a franchise is necessary. What do I mean by that? Well, sometimes movies need extra time to be put together and develop in order to bring out a good result. To put it simply, ""Finding Dory"" did not use those 13 years wisely and all we got was a lackluster disappointment at the end of the day. It has a convoluted story, average to horrible voice acting and boring locations. The plot is, Dory misses her parents and goes on a quest to find them, while learning the true meaning of family. Yeah, it's pretty much every bit as boring as it sounds. I will give it some credit though, the writers were on the right track with trying to keep the story simple, just like the first movie. Yet somehow, they still managed to screw it up! The plot did have potential, because Dory is such a great character. She could very easily handle her own film! The biggest problem, is that Dory doesn't get enough focus. Most of the new characters introduced add nothing to the ""movie"" and just slow everything down. Even Marlin and Nemo add nothing to the story. Whenever they were on the screen, the whole ""film"" just came to a screeching halt. To be honest, if they were written out of the plot, it probably would've been better! Now, to be fair, you can reference them. Or, if they have to be in the ""movie"", just have them appear as brief cameos. Both of them literally serve no purpose whatsoever! The only aspect of the story I like, was Dory's quest to find her parents. Had that been more heavily focused, then maybe the plot would've been more on the right track. However, at the same time, this is one of those stories that was just unnecessary. No one asked to see Dory's backstory, and no one asked to see her parents. On top of that, as soon as the credits roll, you immediately forget everything about the ""film"". You just sit there, and think: ""wait a minute, what did I watch again?"" How ironic, because one of the biggest aspects is short-term memory loss! Seriously, before I wrote this review, I had to look into more details about the plot synopsis. That how forgettable this ""movie"" is! As for the acting, it ranges from average to just plain horrible from the whole cast. The only ones who seem to be trying, are: Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Albert Brooks as Marlin, Andrew Stanton as Crush, Eugene Levy as Charlie, Diane Keaton as Jenny and Kaitlin Olson as Destiny. Everyone else is standard to just plain obnoxious! Probably the most annoying one is, Hayden Rolence as Nemo; replacing Alexander Gould who did the voice previously. To be fair, he does sound like he's trying his best. That being said, Alexander Gould would've easily aged out of doing the character and needed someone new to do Nemo's voice, I get that. But, Hayden's impression of Nemo is just jarring to listen to. Seriously, most of his lines he screams at the top of his lungs! The locations in the ""film"" are standard to just plain dull to look at, but that doesn't mean it isn't beautifully animated. We'll get into more details about the animation right now. What do you say that we get into the only two positive elements in this pile of filth? The animation in this ""movie"" is outstanding, which is a given for Pixar Animation Studios. All of their movies are beautifully animated, and this one is definitely no exception. Although, to tell you the truth I think the first film looks more appealing than this one! But overall, this ""movie"" is still stunning to look at on any screen. Finally, the soundtrack by Thomas Newman is excellent. Most of the film scores he writes and composes are great, and this one is no different. My personal favorite song from the soundtrack, is ""...Shells"", because I can very easily picture the scene that plays along with it and it brings out a lot of emotions. Not just for that scene, but for many other realistic scenarios. I won't go into any details about it, because it's one of the very few highlights of the ""movie"" itself! As a whole, the soundtrack was very well-done. Props to you, Thomas Newman! ""Finding Dory"" is a huge letdown in the world of Pixar films. Is it the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen? No, not by a long shot. Is it the worst CGI film I've seen? Not even close! But, at the end of the day, it's still a lousy movie by my very high standards. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from ""Finding Dory""? No, I think my review makes that very clear. The tagline ""An unforgettable journey she probably won't remember"" is almost accurate. But, it really should say: ""A journey that you probably won't remember"", that would make more sense! If you do see it, then you'll wind up forgetting about it. You'll forget it just like me, and Dory as well!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nostalgia+ brilliant writing & plot + great cast= Brilliance.,"I have a ""rule/guideline"" when it comes to movies, if they make me cry, then I like it. Finding Dory had me in tears in 5 minutes. 5 Minutes!The movie had the nostalgia, which makes either a movie great or suck beyond belief, thankfully, the film falls in the first category.The cast are brilliant. With Ellen Degeneres returning as our favourite forgetful fish, we feel for Dory, she's not some side character who gets her own movie after 13 years. Dory has layers, she wants to belong, Degeneres & the writers gave her the exact lines & the performance in a lot of the scenes will pull at your heartstrings & give you a bad case of the feels.The storytelling is top notch, the new characters don't feel tagged on, or 2 Dimensional, they have feelings & goals in life too!There are some hilarious scenes in the movie too that will make you laugh & cry at the same time.It's a movie both kids & grown ups will love.

Another wonderful effort from Pixar.,"Finding Dory is directed by Andrew Stanton & Angus MacLane and stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill, Hayden Rolence, Kaitlin Olson and Ty Burrell.The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish begins a search for her long-lost parents, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.It's been 13 long years since we've visited the colourful world under the sea, wonderfully created by the Pixar Animation team, yet it feels like we never left. The story picks up 6 months after the events in Finding Nemo (2003), and takes us on a whole new journey with our favourite characters; Marlin, Nemo and of course, Dory. After the first film being such a hit amongst children and adults alike, it was always going to be a challenge for a sequel to live up to the greatness laid before. It's been rumoured for years and carefully discussed by the imaginative minds behind the scenes, thus it's been greatly anticipated by all fans of Pixar. Finding Dory may not tick all the boxes, but it has heart (three of them, in fact) and looks incredible. If you have the chance, 3D is something I highly recommend - which is something I don't usually do - because it simply works. There's a lot of vibrancy and depth created in this world that can only be truly witnessed in this format. That said, there's still a lot to love, regardless.We're all pretty familiar with the returning three main characters, so I don't need to tell you about those. What's really nice to see, and something Pixar are really skilled at, is the introduction of new characters you can instantly attach yourself to. Most notably, is Hank the Octopus. A very fun and friendly presence that really wouldn't have been possible to include in the predecessor 13 years ago, due to his impeccable detail. Also, Destiny and Bailey are particularly quirky and humorous additions to the line-up. Idris Elba and Dominic West both make great appearances as Fluke & Rudder and feel a lot like previous characters we've seen before, which isn't a bad thing. They actually deliver some pretty funny jokes during their screen time. Diane Keaton & Eugene Levy also give nice performances as Dory's parents.Everyone knows that Pixar strive in their incredible talent with computer generated animation. This movie looks absolutely amazing, just as the first feature did back in 2003, but with added texture and using techniques that just couldn't have been implemented at such times. Now that computer technology is so advanced, Pixar can really delve into some of their best ideas and create some more unforgettable characters and stories. Some of the only movies I bother watching in 3D are from Pixar, and this is because they know exactly what they're doing with such a format.Thomas Newman returns with another atmospheric and heartfelt score that flows peacefully in and out of scenes and touches on the action, comedy and drama throughout. A lot of the material is brand new which is great and as expected from Newman.Of course, when you go to see a Pixar movie you expect a message that's weaved into the story and this doesn't disappoint, by keeping the tradition alive. Its touching moments may not be as dramatic as seen before, but it's still relatable and pleasing to see. I'm very satisfied with this sequel, as a huge fan of the original (it being my second favourite Pixar feature, following Ratatouille) and I'm sure a lot of other fans will be pleased as well. I can't wait to watch it again.My verdict; Finding Dory is another wonderful effort from the hard-working men and women at Pixar Animation Studios, and a worthy sequel to a much loved movie by many. This is one to sea.Finding Dory, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Finding Dory"" Moves Like A Fish In Water","Quickly, I want to praise and honor the exquisite work of the Disney's animated shorts, simple and plain but with a soul and a perennial and vital message in a young's life. It is indisputable the years of preparation in textures, colors and effects that look like real life. ""Piper"" the short film directed by Alan Barillaro prior to the screening of the film, has the same heart and essence to the film of the surgeon fish, maturity and the acquisition of independence in a person's life.Days leading up to Finding Dory's premiere I felt too excited, and although fearful of find a bad surprise, love for Pixar films and especially to ""Finding Nemo"" - one classic with whom I grew up - only did increase cravings. Minutes before of the movie's beginning, something within me was nervous, and it's logical, I was about to see a sequel of a true classic. The air conditioning was warmer than normal, I was uncomfortable in my seat and my whole body exuded; but like a divine tranquilizer, Disney's castle appeared, Pixar's iconic lamp jumped and unexpectedly on my cheeks are slid a few tears, the adventure had begun again.Lately, in American films has been divulged one rumor that affirms that the famous and costly sequels, prequels and remakes have been a fiasco, for which reason, the major studios are rethinking finish these projects and start a new original boom. Although this statement is quite true - on account of revenues at the box office -, there are unique gems which deviate from this path fully (""The Conjuring 2""). ""Finding Dory"" that personally, isn't a sequel, since Nemo and Merlin does not return in the main roles, and for that reason, we can't judge it based on the original. It's a successful Spin-off that meets with the long wait - 13 years-, providing the same anticipation, the same connection with the characters, a wonderful and new adventure and a remarkable technological improvement.One year more after what happened in the first film, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) lives agreeably with help of her friends, an almost normal life, has a house next to them, she gets a family and is happy with the lifestyle that has. The problem lies in the moment in which brief memories came to her head about her childhood, reminding immediately that she had a real family. With courage, joy and a little of short term memory loss - interesting fact, she hasn't forgot her purpose - begins with her faithful friends an oceanic adventure without precedents that will bring back to the most famous fishes in the film world. On the way different and beautiful characters are added to the trip with the same connection and coupling than the previous. Crush (Andrew Stanton), who leads the marine turtles and Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson) teacher stingray are the characters already seen that momentarily do presence, but the new and fantastic heroes are an inattentive bird (clear substitution to the seagulls), a duo of unique sea lions, the octopus Hank (added to the list of ""best characters""), a beluga whale and a whale shark with loss of vision. Throughout the film, acceptance of the peculiarities of each fish, learning to live with these defects and keep swimming to achieve self-determination or freedom underlie, a clear message to every family who has a child with special conditions represented in the film by the shortcomings of each marine animal,In 2003, the computer effects were still in its foundations, even so they provided visual landscapes never seen before. However, thirteen years later, long enough so that these techniques mature , ""Finding Dory"" surpasses its predecessor. Beauty and perfection marine is illustrated with a detailed and fine brush, carefully from every ray of sunlight that penetrates into the water to each color and size of the hundreds of fish. Andrew Stanton and his team have recreated one of Disney's best sequels , narrative and visually.""Finding Dory"" despite not being a direct sequel, tends to take elements rendered, made up meticulously for its benefit, but these are obvious. From the replacement of characters to the pools and tanks of the ""Quarantine Section of the Institute"" a clear synonym for the fish tank of the dentist. I must confess that a human character of the magnitudes of Darla was not present.A sense of humor more relevant and a fluid and ingenious script makes of the adventure a real enjoyment. Dory's flashbacks are captivating and poignant - trick that Disney has continually exploited in its films - and although sometimes the reaffirmations of her loss of memory becomes a little repetitive, it finished them on time and fun arises.""Finding Dory"" is a film crammed family, soul and intelligence, the quest for independence, love to each person and the enjoyment of the moment are mixed of heterogeneous way with a sound and visual landscape of first-class.It's ""Unforgettable"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Remember ""A clockwork Orange""? Well, ""Finding Dory"" shares absolutely nothing in common with clockwork, and clockwork is the better movie.

Mjssmith12876 wrote the stupidest review I've ever read!!!,"Let me begin by saying I'm adopted and I also have a short term memory loss do to a head injury. OK now let's begin. It was her fault she was lost but saying it like that is messed up. You don't understand memory. But that isn't the main reason I'm mad with your review. The adoption part is absolutely stupid!!! This has nothing to do with adoption... Absolutely nothing!!! Dori isn't adopted! Those are her birth parents looking for her and they didn't want to give her up! They didn't choose for her to leave them. Birth parents who choose adoption want to give them up, many times for a better life; therefore, they often times don't look for the child. That's OK. Would I love to meet my birth mom... Yes! But I have learned to accept the fact that I may never because she chose to give me up. I can't believe you are seeing this as something to do with adoption! Dori isn't even adopted so how can this insult adopted people!!! Stop being so sensitive and reading into things. Try to enjoy things.By the way, I thought the movie was very cute.

Inspirational,"Finding Dory is one of the most inspirational Pixar movies of all time. It shows that one should not give up even if he/she has no idea how to proceed. You might think that this is a movie for kids, however, there is a great lesson for people from all ages to learn in it. You will not be disappointed. It was clearly well thought and produced. From beginning to end, it is constantly reminding the viewer to not give up and ""keep swimming."" Of course, we are not fish but it can be applied to our lives. After watching the movie, you will probably keep repeating to yourself ""what would Dory do?"" like I did. Again, great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Every bit the powerhouse that its predecessor was.,"Finding Dory isn't so much of a sequel, as it is a continuation of Finding Nemo. This time our favorite blue Tang hero has enlisted the help of her best friends to help her find her family. One that began remembering in a series of flashbacks.Their odyssey leads them from the sanctity of their beloved reef, all the way to the State of California.The animation this time around is much more sumptuous, and is just one of the many joys of this film. Another joy is the irascible but big hearted Octopus ""Hank"" (voiced by Married With Children's Ed O'Neil) who is a welcome addition to the new cast of characters.Of course on its ""surface"" (pardon the pun) this is a big, kid friendly adventure that my kids loved. As you delve into this film's sunlit zone, however, you will find a well nuanced film, predicated on the simple truth that we are all important, regardless of any afflictions we may be suffering, and we should never let these afflictions prevent us from overcoming and ultimately triumphing!Parents of children with developmental disabilities will find special meaning in this movie...and everybody else will love it as well. A movie full of promise and hope...something we can all use a little bit more of right now. Another Pixar masterpiece...9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Most unnecessary Sequel becomes Necessary. Video Review.,My Video Review for Finding Dory is at the bottom just copy the link and it'll take you to it. The Video is way better then my typed review just sayingFinding Dory holds to the spirit of the original and respects the original. It can hold a little too close to its predecessor and feel repetitive but that being the only flaw. This movie is near perfect and has some of the best character interaction for whenever you encounter other sea creatures. As Dory searches for her parents you are also reminded of the deeper meaning to the movie which is that Dory is overcoming her disability of Short term memory loss to find her family. It really speaks to people in this modern era and I love how they acknowledge this in the film in a really subtle but interesting wayI am not the best typer and I would strongly recommend just watching my video instead hahahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9NCpeuRrH8,9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Very Solid Sequel,"I was excited when I heard Pixar was working on a sequel to Finding Nemo. The first film was fantastic. My kids were both young when it was released and we watched it many, many times.I was a little worried about the sequel not living up to the original. I don't think Pixar would ever be able to top Finding Nemo but they did a very nice job on this one. It was a fun movie with many people in the theater laughing quite a bit.The movie is well paced and has a lot of interesting and funny characters. The octopus was a great new character. The young version of Dory was about the cutest fish you could imagine. She was about %75 eyes. Most of her body mass were just the massively cute eyeballs.If you are looking for a good family movie and you liked the first one, go ahead and go for this one. I walked out of the theater feeling good about spending the money to see it. That is not always the case with me and movie theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Memorable Dory""","This sequel might not be as great as the original but that doesn't mean the film is bad but instead its another Pixar movie that deserve the praise.Finding Dory is a amusing,touching,moving and a intriguing film that delivers an amazing animation that Pixar is known for and a significant continuation of it's predecessor.The voice works here are appreciable and the characters are just lovable and entertaining.This sequel will feel identical from it's predecessor but some of it are new additions that were worthy enough to make this film great and a touching moments that made people weep but some emotional scenes didn't intrigue me.The movie has also fantastic emotional connection to the characters.Finding Dory is another example that there is more ideas in a franchise if the people making it has effort and passion to do it.Finding Dory might have some identical story and a some emotional scenes that didn't intrigue audiences but overall the film is near to the ""one of the best animated films"" very very very,very far from the worst",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the better Pixar sequels,"Toy Story 2 aside Pixar struggles with justifying their fellow-ups and the sequels have an odd relationship to the first films. Cars 2 has very little connection to Cars 1 in tone or theme. Monsters University basically doesn't link up to the first film. etc. This film is the most organic and worthwhile follow-up. I like it almost as much of the first film. The animation is still just gorgeous and you can once again get a painting from basically any shot. Best of all the film largely doesn't repeat beats or ideas from the first film. The trip across the ocean is much quicker in this film.The new characters-Hank and Dory's parents-fit in well with the prior cast and the voice work is again top notch. DeGeneres manages to find a real depth to Dory and manages to make the memory problem not annoying. Likewise, O'Neil is just great as the crusty, cautious, cynical Hank. Levy and Keaton hit the needed core to pull at the heartstrings.In some ways I like the story of this film more than the first one. This one really lives in Dory's disability and it is built around demonstrating how the characters cope with it. As a person with a learning disability I found this take on the material comforting to see it handled with such care. And the shot of the Dory's parents' work to get her back to them is most moving moment in either film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie for the special needs fish in your life,"Finding Dory centers around Dory, a fish with a memory disorder on the search for her parents.Dory is a rather pitiable character, and honestly, at first I found the storyline a tad depressing.

Review for Finding Dory,"This was a film that Jaime and I decided to put on for your daughter, since with a little bit of convincing she got through Finding Nemo. She enjoys the bright colors and fish, so we thought this might hold her attention. It took convincing again, but she was hooked enough to eat her snack without complaining about putting on a different show.What we're getting here if you couldn't tell is a sequel to Finding Nemo. We set the stage for Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres). When she was a baby, Sloane Murray was the voice. Her parents are Jenny (voiced by Diane Keaton) and Charlie (voiced by Eugene Levy). She was separated from them and due to her memory loss issues, she cannot find her way back. We then see what led her to meeting Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and helping him find his son, Nemo (voiced by Hayden Rolence).This story is trying to find her family. This leads her along with Marlin and Nemo on an adventure. Dory uses techniques to help her piece things together. There are elements that come back to her during this. It leads them to California to the Marine Life Institute. She has to find a way in. It also reunites her with friends she forgot she had, in hopes of finding her parents.Now that I've set up what we're getting, the creative team behind this did an excellent job at taking the basic premise of Finding Nemo and then altering it to tell a different tale. They follow similar plot points, but instead of having a father try to find his son. We have a fish with memory issues trying to piece things back together. This tugged at my heartstrings as this would not only be terrifying, but sad to get separated like this. You could correlate this to humans when they're displaced for whatever reason.An adventure movie like this is aided by having a great cast of voice actors to bring their specific characters to life. Brooks, Rolence and DeGeneres are all solid here. I did like Ed O'Neill as this rogue octopus. It is fun having Keaton and Levy in their roles. We also have the likes of Ty Burrel, Kaitlin Olson, Idris Elba, Dominic West, Kate McKinnon, Bill Hader, plus a slew of others. I think that they do well with making these animals look like their human counterparts or at least bringing in their personality.Then to finish out with the filmmaking, even though I don't love this type of animation like the classic style, they do a great job. The colors and bringing these different underwater worlds to life. It does get implausible at the climax, but since this is an animated feature, I can overlook it. You can tell there is money here and the talent behind bringing this to life is great. This isn't as good as the first movie, but as a sequel, I like what it does as a follow up.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
10/10,"I laughed, I misted u
Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hopelessly Generic, Forced, and Meaningless","Finding Dory follows the events of 2003's Finding Nemo, where this time Dory goes on a journey in search of her lost parents, whom she forgot about until now.The movie on occasion made me laugh. It was funny from time to time, but not funny enough to be considered much of a comedy.I really hated how rushed this movie was. I thought the trailers seemed rushed with getting into the main plot, and I hoped the movie wouldn't be like that. And yet it was. Mere minutes into the movie Dory remembered her parents and was immediately swimming out after them. It was incredibly rushed, unlike it's predecessor, and came off incredibly forced.The movie tries to be funny and connected to it's prequel by referencing it a lot. Sometimes the references were subtle and fun, but most of the time it's just Marlon saying ""I have bad memories with that"" instead of having actually well-thought out dialogue that directly connect the two movies. Marlon often came off forced because of this, like he existed for connection.Speaking of Marlon, I wish he and Nemo weren't in this movie. Dory's story was vastly more interesting, Marlon and Nemo just kind of showed up to take the audience out of Dory's story to show a much less interesting (or fun) story. I didn't care for their characters at all, and it seemed like they only existed in the movie because they were in the previous one.The movie, in terms of comedy presentation, became hopelessly forced more often than not. Finding Nemo never tread in totally serious waters, everything was fun. But there was a level of tension and seriousness to an otherwise lighthearted premise. Furthermore, it just tried to make everything flow together really naturally, and paced itself really well as a result. Finding Dory was filled with forced gimmicks and plot points that existed for the sake of a joke more than they did a part of the story. Nothing connected, and thus it became a very boring, unnatural mess where many jokes fell flat.The story as a whole just lacks the realism that the prequel had. When the characters went out of water, it was s big deal. It created tension for the characters. In this movie, it's just how most of the movie is spent. The vast majority is spent above water, wandering around an aquarium. That's not realistic, nor does it make any sense at all. Again, it forces it so hard. There were way too many people in this movie, and it just didn't work in a movie about fish.Also, this movie didn't need to happen. All loose ends were tied up nicely in Finding Nemo, so why did this need to exist? It's connection to the prequel is loose and unnatural, and it's just not nearly as engaging as a plot. It's a cash grab, and that's it. Disney was as into this movie as I was, it seems.Overall Finding Dory isn't a good time at the movies. The comedy is forced, the plot is forced, the setting is forced, the characters are boring and so is the movie as a whole. There really isn't a lot going for the movie, but as a whole I didn't really hate it. I just didn't enjoy it. In the end I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie. Pretend it doesn't exist, and just watch Finding Nemo.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"You lost a tentacle? Then you're not an octopus, you're a septopus. I may not remember but I can count","Set one year after the original, this follow up centers on Dory.Her ADHD makes her sympathetic, even if Ellen DeGeneres is not, given her buddying up to war criminal George Bush Jr. She's also compelling in her attempt to find her parents, and finds herself in a marine biology lab where the various sea creatures stand in for the patients of a hospital. Some are eccentric, others insecure about their ailments - at least one wants to remain institutionalized though he no longer physically needs it. All of them deserve our empathy.Not everyone is neurotypical and it's extremely important to teach tolerance. This is exactly how to do it. It explores how difficult it can be to focus and recall, the joy felt when something comes back to you, the necessity for assistance, how it can help to use mnemonic devices such as songs, how other people treat you, including ones who at least a lot of the time have patience for you, and also the happiness you can spread. Like everything Pixar, it breaks your heart, makes you laugh, has something for everyone, is exciting, not to mention the animation. The colors, the shadow, the way that they simulate sunlight as it appears through the ocean. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sequel with purpose an flair,"For its grandiose reputation as a creative mecca, even Pixar has been unable to resist the Faustian bargain of a sequel every now and then. While Ellen DeGeneres' popularity and ""Toy Story 3""""s Oscar nomination made a sequel inevitable, it shouldn't be discounted that Dory (DeGeneres) was deservedly a breakout character in her own right when she debuted thirteen years ago as Marlon's (Albert Brooks) memory-addled sidekick. The circuitous dialogue resulting from Dory's short-term memory loss makes for the kind of back-and- forth of an updated Abbott and Costello routine. Similarly, Dory's chipper attitude in the face of her (presupposed) inability to accomplish anything outside a 30-second window makes her a spunky can-do everyman.The challenge coming into ""Finding Dory"" is similar to nearly every TV spin-off from Gomer Pyle to Joey: Can the comic relief carry their own storyline? In this case, yes: It turns out there's a lot of depth to Dory when you factor in the potential that her memory could resurface and, indeed, that's the route we go down.Dory begins to experience flashbacks that take her, Nemo, and a reluctant Marlon (taking each other for granted is a theme here) all the way to a Seaworld-like aquarium in California where Dory, Nemo, and Marlin find themselves in and out of various rooms and fish tanks. Lack of opposable limbs or bodies larger than three inches be damned, this is the Pixar universe and pesky human contraptions like doors are no match for you if you have determination and some crafty friends to help. These include a beluga whale (Ty Burrell) with echolocation, a near-sighted whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and a curmudgeon of an octopus whose congruence with voice actor Ed O'Neill's screen persona makes him the film's breakout character.If you're someone with a deep-seated love for aquariums and Jacques Cousteau like me, there's an enchantment in the animation that you would never get from the renderings of toys, ants, superheroes, or dystopian garbage piles that Pixar has previously done. There's also the added bonus of the biological accuracy and the clever ways in which these traits are ingrained in their characters.High-quality animated flicks typically come with moral parables and the original one here is the way that people with disabilities can contribute to society and are capable of surprise. Although Dory couldn't really navigate the freeways of California, it all feels surprisingly organic here.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

An uninteresting sequel because of the absence of a really good story.,"In the universe of animated cinema, it has been established that a good supporting character in a film that has been a success (box office and critical) will, sooner or later, be entitled to her own film. I could name several examples of this. Dory, a friendly marine creature with serious memory problems, was adorable in ""Finding Nemo"", and is the protagonist in this film, made specifically to exploit the character's popularity.The script is relatively simple: after the events of the first film, Dory is living with her new friends, Marlin and Nemo, but she feels something is missing: she doesn't know where her family of origin is, she knows she's lost, and therefore decides to go in search of his own origins, which can be a challenge for a fish with a short memory. Of course, Nemo and Marlin will have to go in search of her when she disappears.The movie works on the basis of how cute and likeable it can be because the script has little to give us, and it feels like only a partial rewrite of the first movie. There are several moments when the story rings false or seems to fray because it is so sparse, flaws that Pixar makes up for and hides with a high dose of cuteness. All the characters are cute, nice, the world is pink, and it seems incredible that no malevolent characters appear. In fact, the closest thing to a villain or a dubious character is a sly octopus, determined to get out of an aquarium, and who is a master at the art of camouflage.The film is visually magnificent, Pixar quality, with excellent visual work, good CGI and magnificent drawings, vivid colors and a wonderful deep blue. It's a good movie for the family and especially if there are kids because there's nothing offensive. The original voice cast is much the same as in the first film, with Ellen DeGeneres standing out in the lead voice, closely followed by Albert Brooks and Kaitlin Olson.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pity about the casting but the rest is fine.,"I never like admitting to liking a pixar movie but this was better than even it had a right to be.Memory is an aspect of the first movie because it's one character who cannot remember much at all paired with one who is haunted by a specific memory.So there's this thematic link but it's really about exploring more of this character; about how we lose so much by the loss of memory, gain much and ultimately it is what you make it. Dory feels a lot more like someone who is disabled and yet oddly handicapable instead of really a gag character but they're not douchey about it.Without giving too much away, they do a lot take us visually away from the first movie as we discover new types of landscapes with impressive set pieces, humor, the new characters fitting in naturally and just the right amount of fan service.It actually makes the first movie make more sense.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's way more action-packed than I expected, with Dory exploring the vast ocean, meeting all kinds of quirky creatures, and facing unexpected challenges, which kept me super engaged. I laughed hard at the silly, charming sea creatures and their wild antics. But it wasn't all giggles - the movie really dove deep into Dory's past, unearthing emotions and a story about family and belonging that made me shed a few tears too. It was this awesome mix of an exciting adventure and touching moments that just stuck with me. Great watch for sure!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding 3D Animation,"Nice plot twist, great storyline, cute characters and the best 3D Animation ever. This Disney Pixar character is one of my favorite movie since I was childhood. Great Job, Finding Dory Animation movie is deserve to be success",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Continuation of the Story,This movie is ultimately the sequel to Finding Nemo as it picks up right where the latter leaves off. Excellent decision to expand on the story line of what has to be one of Pixars most lovable characters. I was slightly disappointed to see them move away from open ocean towards marine life but was also blown away at how well the movie depicted human impact on ocean life. Would watch this movie again anytime!,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An equally amazing follow up to the original,"I don't understand the hate on this one. I found this movie to be absolutely amazing! It was so sweet. Dory is such a sweet character and I always wanted to know more about her background. She doesn't remember anything in the first one so we don't really know much about her. In this one we really delve into her past and learn everything about her. She is such a likeable character, and I really feel like Pixar did it again with this one. For anyone who's a fan of the first one, I feel they will definitely love this one. I know I did!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Unexpectedly Good,"Pixar has a long list of beloved movies, and several of them have gotten sequels over the years. Finding Nemo isn't exactly the first movie that comes to mind when talking about Pixar movies that deserve sequels, but it's easy to understand why it was selected. It's a great movie, and it is remembered well as one of Pixar's best movies. Still, it doesn't exactly lend itself to having a follow-up, especially when people had been waiting on other Pixar sequels like Incredibles 2, which didn't happen until 2018. As the title would suggest, this one isn't about Marlin and Nemo, but rather Dory, who was a comic relief in Finding Nemo.The premise is that Dory can't remember her family and sets out to find them. In the process, she ends up being taken to an aquarium in California, while Nemo and Marlin follow her. This little blue fish is remembered for having short term memory loss, which was played for laughs in the first movie, but is taken quite seriously here. Dory is given a very nice character arc, on a quest of self-discovery. She is accompanied by an octopus named Hank, who's missing a leg. He's mostly a comic relief character, and a good one at that. Most of the other characters are just kind of there, but that's alright - the focus is on Dory. Like most, if not all Pixar movies, the ending is very touching, predictable though it may be.The animation is Pixar quality. Pixar is perhaps the greatest animation studio in the world, and their animation shows it. Everything looks spectacular, especially underwater.As far as Pixar goes, it's one of the weakest. That isn't quite an insult though, as the bar for Pixar films is much higher than it is for other animated movies. That being said, it's nowhere near as good as the first movie. It is, however, a pity that this made a billion dollars while Inside Out and Coco didn't. It's also funny that Finding Dory, the sequel no one asked for, is better than Incredibles 2, the sequel everyone asked for.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fine,"I never really liked Dory in Finding Nemo, though she was fine in it and I could stand here. She was a slightly charming character. However, not charming enough to make a full film about. Unfortunately, this sequel/spin-off of Pixar's classic does not deliver enough to be held next to Finding Nemo. But the animation is great as usual and I do like many of the characters and at the same time, it is very emotional and delivers a fine experience at the end of the day and isn't just something to put on to entertain kids for two hours, its good for adults too.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Very Fun Addition To Finding Nemo,"Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role as Dory in ""Finding Dory,"" the sequel to ""Finding Nemo."" DeGeneres has flashbacks of being a young fish and having parents, so she decides to find her parents based on the miniscule clues that her limited memory gives. With the help of little Nemo and Marlin from the previous movie, Degeneres starts a long, dangerous, crazy and fun adventure that may give her closure, or may find her lost forever.My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when we first see Hank, the octopus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) do his trick of blending in to the environment. The character easily steals the show in this movie, being the most interesting and most fun to watch with his stealthy, ninja/secret agent moves and tricks.I found ""Finding Dory"" to be almost as good as ""Finding Nemo,"" with Hank the octopus being the most interesting, animated character I have seen in years. As usual, Pixar has hit another home run, albeit this one doesn't go as far as some of their other movies have.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The sequel that everyone hoped for,"Finding Dory is an extremely delightful sequel to the 2003 classic animated film, Finding Nemo. Aside from the great Inside Out, I found Pixar's films to have lapsed slightly in quality in recent years, with films such as Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University not reaching the feats that Pixar has often reached. However Finding Dory is not only a welcome return to form for Pixar, but certainly one of Pixar's best movies to date. The story is strong, and thankfully is not just a rehash of the previous film. But what makes the film so memorable is the excellent characters and voice cast. Ellen DeGeneres is fantastic as Dory and hits every note very well; Albert Brooks as Marlin and Hayden Rolence as Nemo are both great also; and the entire cast of supporting actors (which includes Idris Elba, Dominic West, Sigourney Weaver, Bill Hader and Ty Burrell) are all very memorable in their own right - it is the characters that really make this film swim, and swim it does.As you would expect from Pixar, the animation is top-notch as always. But what surprised me the most about this movie is how genuinely hilarious it is. The gags are non-stop throughout the film (which is something you cannot say for many modern comedies) - some of which are extremely funny, and the running jokes all work very well. It is also a surprisingly emotional film that almost had me crying at one point, and is a film that certainly has the same heart as the original did.In conclusion, Finding Dory doesn't feel at all lazy or like a rehash - instead, it is original in its own right while still paying homage to its predecessor. It is hilarious, heartfelt, and has some of the best characters in modern animation. It is exactly what a sequel should be.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A nice compliment to ""Finding Nemo""","A sour look crossed my face as my friends and I pulled into the parking lot of the Rave Theater in Little Rock. While I wanted to lose some sleep over ""The Conjuring 2,"" the rest of my friends had their sights set on the newest Pixar flick.Bitterly inhaling my package of raspberry sour straws, I slumped into my seat and made a valiant attempt to dislike this movie. However, much like with last year's ""Inside Out,"" Pixar won me over yet again with ""Finding Dory.""Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role from ""Finding Nemo"" as Dory: a kind, easygoing blue tang fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. All is well under the sea until Dory randomly experiences a flashback from her childhood of her and her parents. Remembering that she was separated from her family long ago, Dory races off to find her parents, relying only on her poor memory to guide her.While this film is not a retread of ""Finding Nemo,"" it provides a few nods to the original, and many of the characters from ""Nemo"" return in supporting roles or cameos. The film also implements the voice talents of Idris Elba, Ty Burrell and Sloane Murray, who plays an adorable baby Dory in the flashbacks.The most interesting character addition, however, is that of Hank, played by Ed O'Neill. The irritable, pessimistic, yet kind-hearted octopus warms up to the spastic, forgetful nature of Dory, and their interplay throughout elevates the film's drama and humor.Is it as good as ""Finding Nemo?"" Perhaps, but much like ""Monster's University"" in 2013, ""Finding Dory"" differs in many ways from its predecessor and compliments it well. With sequels like ""Cars 3,"" (2017) ""Toy Story 4"" (2018) and the highly anticipated ""The Incredibles 2"" (2019) on the horizon, I am eager to see where Pixar takes our imaginations next.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hollywood really needs to find unknown voices,"Pixar is amazing. First of all.Secondly, the cute babyish face of the little Dory to go with the cuddly equally voice of the baby Dory was just way too a(dory)ble.And then Pixar went God mode into flashbacks of fast cuts of memories of Dory.But then they frikkin lost it.Ellen DeGeneres has a way distinctive voice. Admittedly I am not the slightest fan of this person, but the thing is I want to go and watch movie to suspend disbelief. Not be frikkin reminded of man- girl Ellen every time I see a babyish animation.Why the **** does Hollywood think it is okay just because you are an A-list celebrity you deserve to be anchored into a feature voices in cartoons and animations?Same with Eddie Murphy's voice in Shrek. *Cue haters saying I am homophobic and racist*That's not the point at all. Hollywood is just playing favorites by cherrypicking the people they like automatically thinking since they made it big in one department they will automatically be stellar in other department.Pixar.

This beautiful Disney Picture takes us back to the world of Finding Nemo with an explanation of the forgetful yet widely loved Dory.,"To start, Disney animation has improved immensely over the years- transforming from amazing to even better. The overall quality of film is outstanding. The picture is crisp and clear, giving an amazingly realistic view of the ocean. As always, every character, no matter how insignificant, is adorable and brilliantly thought out. The animators did an outstanding job.Next, the story brings you right back to Finding Nemo. We see the same side characters presented in a slightly older position. Additionally, this movie fills in some gaps of the characters that were left by Finding Nemo. For example, we discover the past of many characters and gain insight to the world that these films are set in. We also gain some new characters to provide comedy relief and slight conflict throughout the story.Overall, Finding Dory will be a hit for families and older adults alike. With hilariously endearing characters and a rich story, there is really nothing to not like. Everything down to each note of the soundtrack and every pixel on the screen is planned with amazing precision and skill. I would give Finding Dory a ten out of ten.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Don't believe in the negative reviews!,"And yet again the critics are here with the most ridiculous reasons on why this movie is bad.Who would've thought that someone had been turned off by this movie because it was too realistic?? WTH??Oh and we can't forget the typical ""I hate this movie because they got the science wrong"" excuse.It's a kids movie FFS, not everything should be portrayed realistically, nor should it be taken seriously, seriously. That one review here about the movie offending orphans is an example of someone taking this movie way too seriously.Anyways, I actually never had the intention of watching this movie but I was bored so I gave it a shot, and it really exceeded my expectations. This movie is about grabbing onto every last bit of hope and aspiration and never letting go of it. This movie also emphasizes the moral importance of friends and family. At heart, this movie portrays all sorts of kindhearted and altruistic morals which I believe is what everyone needs every now and then, whether you're a kid or an adult.Also this is the second movie I have seen with Thomas Newman as the soundtrack composer. Newman definitely hit my feels in this movie and -- to be honest -- is probably the main reason why I liked this movie so much. His idiosyncratic style fills this movie with a truly unique and sentimental and almost idyllic feeling, something that I exactly wanted at the time of watching this movie.Overall 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another example of Pixar's dwindling efforts,"If we look back just a few years ago, Pixar really still was the company that seemed to be able to do no wrong but in these last few years for whatever reason the Pixar brand has taken a little bit of a hit.Sure there's still the great original films like Inside Out but there's also been miscued films like Brave, Monster's University, the tiresome Good Dinosaur and now the long talked about and hyped Finding Dory.2003's Finding Nemo is a film fondly remembered by many, I know I for one still very much remember witnessing the film for the first time at the cinema and enjoy every minute of it, but taking a character that was fine as a support to the films leads and turning them into the figurehead of this return to the sea really brings down the chances Finding Dory had of being much more than a pretty animated adventure that leaves nothing of a lasting impression.The forgetful fish Dory, once more voiced here by comedian Ellen DeGeneres, on a journey to find her parents that she's somehow remembered doesn't make for much of an engaging tale even with her quest taking her all the way to a sea life park where she meets colourful characters like Hank the octopus (stealing most of the films best scenes), Destiny the whale shark or Bailey the beluga whale.Finding Nemo won audiences over with its great voice acting, memorable characters and simple yet effective central idea, Finding Dory feels tired as it tries to pay its respect's to the original whilst paving its own path out through the open storytelling waters but as has sadly become the case with Pixar's reliance now of bringing back past properties, this feels like a cash grab rather than a genuine attempt to create something fresh to wow audiences of all ages with. It's a problem the animation power house never use to have but with expectations come great pressure's Pixar currently aren't living up to.Finding Dory looks great (as do all Pixar films) and there are some inventive scenarios at play here but this sequel which has taken too long to come to surface fails to live up to the name we've come to expect from its classic forefather and with an annoying forgetful fish as our main point of contact, Finding Dory is more arduous for adults than we'd have liked and is one for the kiddies only.2 learning on the job truck drivers out of 5",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar has done it again!,"Finding Dory has the perfect balance between flashbacks, callbacks, emotion, adventure and running jokes; that doesn't get boring or seem like they are dragging on for too long. This movie and it's characters made you believe that you were helping Dory find her parents and you believed that you were part of the movie. It is a beautifully crafted, movie with incredible cinematography and direction - I could clearly see the amount of time and effort it took to get this movie made; I'm very happy that they waited such a long time and didn't rush in with a sequel that would've been very disappointed; but maybe they shouldn't wait so long next time.I could not review this movie without mentioning the performances by all of the voice actors; especially Ellen DeGeneres' as Dory; I say performance because the amount emotion and strength that went into was incredible. She made you feel every emotional Dory was feeling, whether she was happy or sad or crying at times. Ellen DeGeneres has said in many interviews that she was actually crying while reading certain lines and I felt that throughout some of the most key scenes. Her performance is one of the best voice performances I have ever witnessed and I honestly believe that she deserves an Oscar nomination for her role as Dory.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy entry in the Pixar universe,"""Hi. I'm Dory. I suffer from short-term remembory loss.""The movie may not feel like the magnum opus of Pixar movie as Finding Nemo was, but it still has enough fun and humor to qualify as a good movie to watch. While this movie is one that focuses less on heart and more on fun and adventure, there are still moments that appeal to the emotions. They mainly occur with the childhood flashbacks that Dory has from time to time. Every time I saw a scene with a baby Dory and her parents, I found myself lost in the cuteness and just couldn't bear to think that something bad is going to happen to them. I also felt inspired whenever Dory, young or old, could overcome something without being limited by memory problems.

"Finding Dory, Losing Entertainment","These days, it's too much to ask for a genuine Pixar gem. The glory days are long past. The creative fire that sustained the animation studio's best films is out. We won't get another Finding Nemo. But when an ill-gotten Nemo sequel comes along, is it too much to ask for something reasonably entertaining? Finding Dory retains the talent from the 2003 Pixar classic, but the 2016 sequel, like others before and after it, drops the passion. Sure, it's passably drawn, and it gave me some chuckles, but It's not as funny, not nearly as charming, and simply not as good as its predecessor.Finding Dory purports to have come from an original story by Nemo director Andrew Stanton, who also happens to have directed Dory. Honestly, I find the credit dubious. There's a good story here, but original? I don't know. In Finding Dory, a fish is taken off to a human world, other fish come to its aid, and things are wrapped up in an affirming message of love. This time, however, it's Dory that needs finding. Whatever, if Stanton wants to deliver the same beats in Nemo 2, that's all well and good by me. We know the story works. I'm just here for a good time, so shoot. Now if only Dory could have delivered the same personality, humor, or heart.Dory doesn't get those notes right. It's not a lack of effort, really. Finding Dory introduces new characters like Ed O'Neill's camouflaging octopus, Hank, and a whale shark voiced by Kaitlin Olson, but they are forgettable. It stages new escapes, but they aren't very exciting. There are new emotional beats featuring Dory and her parents, but they don't ring very true. The new elements of Finding Dory, as welcome as they are, are pale. With the exception of Ellen ""Why doesn't she do more movies"" DeGeneres, the voice acting is lifeless, the character designs are obvious and kiddy, and the writing and direction seem flat out lazy. Case in point, the humor. I'll admit to chuckling one or two times during Finding Dory, but I never laughed. Half the jokes are recycled from Nemo, and the rest are uninspired guesses at what makes for good cartoon comedy. The reality is, I spent more time cringing than smiling. Why they decided to take a hilarious one-shot gag from Finding Nemo (Dory's whale speak) and stretch it out for an entire film, way past its breaking point, is beyond me. But it's not just the incessant whale noises that left me grinding my teeth. What about a wacky bird that exists solely to transport Marlin and Nemo around? Not funny, not memorable, not voiced by Geoffrey Rush.If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times, when the passion isn't there, the product suffers. Like Cars 2, Monster's University, and Incredibles 2, Finding Dory is good ole' apathetic Pixar. Not as shockingly Disney Junior-ish as Monsters U, Finding Dory doesn't quite qualify as a ""bad"" Pixar movie. The animation is lovely to look at, and the settings are colorful and detailed. It's a nice little world they cooked up in this film, and I can't say I didn't enjoy being there. That said, there is a real lack of entertainment value in Finding Dory, which coasts along a familiar track while sloppily throwing together some ""funny"" new characters, ""exciting"" new situations, and a ""message"" about family. I came into the movie with open arms. I had absolutely no expectations that it would approach Nemo's greatness. All I wanted was a fun afternoon at the movies. And still, I left Finding Dory in an indifferent funk.55/100",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's Fine, but too Similar to the First","It really isn't a bad movie, but it's much too close to the original without actually improving on anything from the first. The beautiful atmospheric presence of Finding Nemo was a big part of the movie. Those still shots that had close focus on Marlin and Dory in the first were a big part of what really drew many people in. It was stunning to look at and it offered a sense of calm while keeping the viewer engaged. It was also better paced and made the movie more about the journey with an overarching goal.Finding Dory somehow lacks that charm, in part because that whole part of atmospheric presence was skipped in favor of getting to the busier location in the California rehabilitation center within the first 30 or so minutes. It felt rushed when compared to the more relaxed feel of the first movie, even though there was a greater sense of urgency to reach the goal in the first movie. This one somehow lacked that same feel, probably because the circumstances for Dory when compared to Nemo are vastly different. Even Crush's scene in this movie was rushed to simply offer a convenient time skip to the next part of where most of the movie would take place, rather than using it as character development like in the first. It didn't offer the same build up to the ultimate goal. The characters were also somehow less engaging and memorable.Dory's friends from the Rehabilitation Center are likable, but not very memorable. They were more devicive to explain Dory's excentricities and less endearing than they could have been. Dory's parents are nice. They're well developed and likable. They are the better characters of this movie. Still, it's not enough to save the movie from mediocrity.Unfortunately, I have to liken this movie to that of Cars 2(and to clarify, I don't hate Cars 2), and Dory is like Mater. A great character in her own right(just how Mater is a great character in his own right), but not so great as a lead. There's something interesting there, just like there was in Cars 2, but it wasn't executed well enough to be interesting or likable. This movie really only fails in terms of execution of the story and, somehow, the presence. Even though they had newer equipment for this movie, with presumably better graphics and software, Finding Nemo looked more polished. It looked more complete. You could feel the dedication to the first movie and the desire to make it right. Finding Dory looked rushed and felt rushed by comparison. The concept was there. It just wasn't developed well enough to tell a great story.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Film tends to drag on a bit, Snooze-fest for me.","I'm not going to say that this movie was just a total waste of time...but about 85% of the film was. Coming from me, a person who is extremely passionate about science and biology wouldn't appreciate the constant factual errors in the film. Dory and other fish friends of hers could never tolerate the constant changing in water quality from hopping from tank to tank. Whale sharks are not whales, either. One thing that got to be a bit annoying was the tank jumping, because that's almost all that we see. Every couple of moments, either Dory or Marlin and Nemo are hopping from tank to tank at the aquarium, or flying in a bucket of water carried by sea foul. It's a constant aspect. Not to mention we have an octopus who can breathe for an undetermined amount of time.Also, forgive me but, how did no one notice an unattended baby stroller with tentacles flailing about from it, and no nearby adults? I understand most of the American population is rather dunce, but jeez, give commoners some kind of credit.Anyways, it was a sweet story and heartwarming ending, but the movie was mostly repetitive nonsense and persistence.

"Ridiculous, not in a good way","This movie is about Dory, the sweet forgetful fish from Finding Nemo, finding her family. There is a very touching ""Pixar"" moment when this is resolved. But the rest of the movie...OK, we do not expect movies to be realistic. But we expect some level of plausibility. In Finding Nemo, a large portion of the movie is dedicated to planning how to get one fish out of a fish tank. In Finding Dory, every move the characters have to do (like getting from the ocean to a tank, or a tank to another tank) is about 100 times more difficult, and is solved with about 1/100th of the effort. There was the same problem with dreadful Cars 2: they feel the need to ""up"" the action, to the point that the amazing is commonplace. There are no highs and lows, no tension, just wall to wall actions for the kids.

"2040 readers, I warn you to stay away from this!","I feel I MUST write this review even if it's years after release because since Finding Nemo was a classic, someone 2 decades from now, even born as I write this, needs to be warned. Kid, there are so many other worthy films to watch! Don't waste 2 hours of your life!OK, how to put this: Everything that made Finding Nemo so charming is not in this commercially written fluff hack and it's not original in any way. The best way to judge this film is that if, on its own, would it be worth watching? If you're in love with the original characters and just feel you MUST see them, then by all means, watch whatever nonsense they're in. Let's review what the original film had this this doesn't:1) Original characters who were all charming in their own right. None of the new characters in FD are interesting. Even the human dentist and his horrid niece in FN had some charm to them. The humans in FD are much like Non-Player-Characters.2) The original had pacing, character development, timing, humor, and a script that felt like a cohesive story. That's all missing here. The original felt like it was ""filmed"" by a clever director. The action and dialogue is clunky and worse: BORING.3) The original felt real. Not only were the graphics immersive but the story itself felt plausible while this is much like a video game with the characters doing things that appear unrealistic. In the original, even an adult could feel like the hilarious events in the film could happen (at least on film) but in this, it's as real as a cartoon. As a cartoon/video game, I felt no connection to the plot.4) Did I mention BORING? The film spends most of its time in the fish rescue center in different habitats but unlike finding Nemo full of wonder about the ocean and Austrialia, we feel stuck IN A MUSEUM? Don't get me wrong, being in a good museum can be fun but imagine if you were stuck there for hours without an idea of what to do. That's a lot like this film.My 4 year old enjoyed hearing the characters talk and going from room to room much like I suppose she enjoys watching me play video games. But for me, there was no joy in this film. If you loved the characters, I suppose just having them talk about what they ate for lunch is worth the price of admission.If you have NOTHING BETTER TO DO in the future, then by all means, watch this.

It's OK,"If you have little kids, Finding Dory is a cute little movie.
However, if you like to follow the plot of a film, Finding Dory definitely disappoints a bit. One can easily get a feeling of déjà vu from seeing what is essentially the same thing as the original movie: a fish goes lost and, despite the vastness of the ocean, we follow a group of people trying to find the fish and bring them back to their home. The basic bone structure of the story is nothing more than a gender-swapped, mentally confused version of Finding Nemo (and every bit as slow-moving and bland, in my opinion). Sure, Dory is cute and Ellen, as always, does a fantastic job in the role, but it's not something we really needed. It doesn't really offer much of value that the original didn't offer. Finding Dory is the Home Alone 2 of the Pixar world: It's a cut-and-paste film with just enough changed to give off the guise of originality and inspiration (difference being that Home Alone 2 actually manages, in its own way, to be more fun than the original).
This movie is good for kids, and it's good for a little bit of a nostalgia trip for those of you who, like me, grew up with Finding Nemo. But it suffers from a major issue that even Finding Nemo (a film I've been critical of in the past) didn't: it's just so forgettable. Similar to Toy Story 4.
I still maintain that Pixar hasn't made a ""bad"" film (that I've seen, anyway), but this is one of the weakest offerings they've given us thus far.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
More like Finding BOREy,"Finding Nemo was a great movie with lots of fun characters, enjoyable visuals and a good message.Finding Dory only exists to make money.This movie is flat-out boring.Yes, your kid will be satisfied with this movie, but they will also be satisfied with a GOOD movie like Toy Story, The Lion King, Fantastic Mr. Fox, or UP.Don't spend your time watching this movie and don't spend your money to watch it.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Finding Nemo Lite,"Finding Dory feels like Finding Nemo Lite. It looks a lot like its predecessor, but it's missing a lot of the charm and emotion. This movie just feels like it's going through the motions. It's likeable, though. The animation is engaging and some of the new characters are interesting. At least it's better than Cars 2 -- then again, most movies are.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Forgettable movie of a cute forgetful lil fish,"This was a very Forgettable movie of a cute forgetful lil fish and I am disapointed that it carries the legendary Pixar label (which we have come to expect absolute excellence from). Tries to add ADHD / short memory as a theme but this also fails miserably. Kids will love the graphics. This is basically a sort of an unoriginal pseudo sequel to ""Finding Nemo""... The storyline is just too ordinary. This was obviously made for the box office, the animation is good, but there is NO STORY here. It is well marketed hence it made this much money. It doesnt compare to classics like Kubo, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo. After this one watch, Im thinking of donating my DVD copy to a local library, it is not worth keeping or rewatching.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
13 Years of Waiting for THIS?,"This movie was as good as Cars 2. All about a secondary character, made just to get money to fund Coco, Cars 3, and Incredibles 2 (all of which are fantastic!) Finding Dory in one word? Ok, how about FORGETTABLE. Yeah, I know one of the songs' name is Unforgettable...This movie sucked. It was drawn out, and way less sentimental than Finding Nemo.Finding Nemo showed the utter despair and depression that Marlin faced when Nemo was taken. Finding Dory covers that up by Dory having short-term memory loss. There's really no value in the movie, and relies on Dory's disorder for its humor.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
so what?,"10 out 10 for the animation, albeit its by computer and not single frame gel like all classic cartoons where, For adults you spend the whole time putting a face to the voice. Children will never know the magic of Chuck Jones unless we show them.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is necessary to be generous.,"How much had CG technology of this movie advanced from previous work 'Finding Nemo'? I'd like to try to compare them.I couldn't focus the story because I got annoyed with forgetful Dory so much. Don't forget, Dory! So I realized my heart was rough because I reacted it seriously. I reflect upon being narrow minded. I should forgive the others.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Drags in the middle and is as forgettable as the protagonist,"It's not easy to make a sequel that matches the original. That being said, ""Finding Nemo"" was more enjoyable and thrilling.The character of Dory was surprisingly interesting. The poor memory was developed really well into the movie. Unfortunately, there just wasn't anything that memorable about this character. I found the camouflaging character to be the most memorable.As for emotions, the movie does become sad and emotionally resonant at times. However, I soon forgot the evocation of emotions.Even though I never actually got bored of the movie, it dragged a lot in the middle. The excitement and emotions do increase in the later part of the movie, though.+ Great character development for Dory+ Camouflaging octopus was funny+ Emotional at timesForgettableDrags in the middleScore: 7. Despite the thrills, it drags at times and is forgettable.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Has the technology and comedy but, most importantly, the heart is front and center","I confess I approached Dory with a certain wariness, since it seemed odd to have a sequel so many years after the original, plus the concept sounded like it would simply be a rehash of the original film but with a different lead character. In a way the latter thought is valid, since there are similarities between the films in terms of characters, jokes, and narrative. However Dory manages to be more than a late cash-in, and stands up as another very fine Pixar film.The impressive animation goes without saying, although it is really amazing what can be done with computer animation now. The plot itself is not brilliant; it does feel overly familiar in essence, and it of course relies a huge amount on coincidence and convenience – in a lesser film such things would be a major distraction, but here they are not so much. The reason for this is how well the majority of it works. The pacing of the delivery is spot-on throughout, and the writing of the characters and their dialogue is much better than the base narrative. It is consistently funny, with plenty of snap to the delivery, but really what makes it work is the same with the majority of Pixar films – which is that it has heart.Dory is more than a comedy blue fish; she has inadequacies, pain, and insecurities while also at the same time being warm, likable, and engaging. A lot of this rests with the delivery by DeGeneres; certainly this is not a dialed-in piece of voice-work that can often be the case with animated films, this is a real performance. She brings a lot to the character and it comes across in the film, making us care and go with her. The other voice work is not at that level, mainly because they do not have to be, but there is plenty of good work here, even if some of it is a bit more of a piece (eg O'Neill and Burrell very much play how you are used to them playing). Too many to point out, in small and larger roles, but my favorite of course was a Wire reunion for McNulty and Bell.A very enjoyable family film; all of Pixar's usual strengths, but the most important one is that the character of Dory is tangible, emotive, and engaging.",,Anonymous,Animation
worth watching but feels recycled at times,"Only 'one year' after Finding Nemo, Pixar Studios dives back into the aquatic world in this fun but uneven follow-up. This time around the focus of the story is Dory, the amnesiac blue tang fish who has a sudden yearning for her missing family. With clownfish pals Marlin and Nemo in tow, she sets out blindly yet determined to reunite with the parents she once knew. Visual effects are impressive, clever gags are plentiful, and there are an assortment of new characters—including a slick, scheming octopus voiced to perfection by O'Neill—but there are some story lulls here and there, and it doesn't quite rise to the level of awe or heartwarming emotion as its predecessor. Still good fun, especially as it nears its frantic finale, but unlikely to make viewers forget the first film. **½",,Anonymous,Animation
