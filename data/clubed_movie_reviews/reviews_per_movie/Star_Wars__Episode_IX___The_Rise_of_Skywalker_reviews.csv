How corporate greed and consumerism once again destroyed the filmmaking,"Unfortunately, this movie somehow reflects the way society's been going on for the last 15-20 years - the ever growing trivilialization, consumerism and regurgitation of works of genius from past generations who paid blood, sweat and tears for their works to be seen, heard and fealt - all of this now to get a quick buck at the local mall.

This film clearly displays this trilogy's biggest flaw...,"... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.Say what you will about the prequels -years later they aren't considered secretly great or misunderstood. But they did one thing right. They expanded the universe of Star Wars with more world building and more lore, some good, some bad. The prequel story, while stilted, was the product of a single vision. In the end you had bad execution with good building blocks.The Sequel Trilogy doesn't expand anything, instead it makes everything smaller. Star Wars has never felt so small and tired as it does after The Rise of Skywalker. Each movie exists just to tear down and apologize for what came before it. Anakin/Vader's entire character arc is completely and unforgivably undermined after this film.Overall the movie was so bloated and overstuffed with choppy pacing to course-correct from The Last Jedi. It's Flanderization in action. The original movies had so many little touches and so much atmosphere and craftsmanship beyond a few big reveals, neat action set pieces, and bizarre coincidences with the same ten people running into one another over and over. The original films built iconic imagery and characters in the context of them doing things and bonding and building. This was not always perfectly done, but it was done well enough to feel meaningful.You can't just write a movie with the assumption you already have all of those things and skip the work it takes to get them. You can trick people for awhile by using the familiar imagery and beats and deconstructing the world with meta-humor (Abrams did that well for The Force Awakens if nothing else), but you just cash in that goodwill and cheapen all of that stuff by association.Oh well, the big action movies these days are indeed made for children and China - I can't remember who recently said that, but it's true.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I regret Disney buying StarWars,"I can't call this movie good. I yawned my way through the first half and when it finally started telling a story in the second half, I hated the story they told. I shouldn't be surprised from what they did in the previous movies though.I just wish they respected the history of the movies and didn't try so hard to outdo everything that came before.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A movie without a story to tell,"Star Wars: Episode IX is, at times, a decent thrill ride, and it provides us with some satisfying moments, but it fails to tell a compelling story. It feels empty. It rushes through a corporate checklist of must-have moments at a chaotic pace. It manages to thrill with epic space battles, but it lacks a soul. There's no creative vision here, no story to tell. The pressure that comes with making a Star Wars movie seems to have shackled the creators, preventing them from doing anything interesting with the film. It's a shame. The Star Wars universe is one of the greatest fictional universes ever created. It should provide fertile ground for many new and interesting stories. If I were Disney I would take a serious look at the creative process for these films. They could probably learn a thing or two from Marvel Studios.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I still love Star Wars,"Let me say this... In no way is The Rise of Skywalker a perfect movie, it has its flaws. But that doesn't change the fact that I loved it. Yes it has tons of fan service. Yes most of the events were predictable. And still... It was everything I want Star Wars to be. Funny, exciting, a bit odd sometimes but with a group of loveable characters at it's core. Say what you will, but I loved Star Wars since I was 6 years old and this new movie just made me feel like a very happy kid again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incompetence,"I can't say I am a huge fan of Star Wars, I do like the movies, but never geeked out about them, I did watch all of them and in most part I enjoyed the story, the characters and the visuals.But when it comes to TROS ... I felt like I was watching some cut scenes from a game, where you know the story is bad, the characters are superficial and bland but hey, you are there to play a game.The amount of plot holes and patched scenes that lead to nowhere is alarming for a title like this.Some things i liked were the kylo ren scenes, the actor did really well in portraying him, the visuals were top notch and the art team really shined, the music of course was great.I think we are starting to replace talent and hard work with political views and woke mentality and in my opinion this is the death of art.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Probably the most disappointing Star Wars movie since The Phantom Menace.,"Now, I actually don't have a lot of issues with this film. Only 3 issues really stand out to me, but they are 3 very major issues. The first is the pacing. Were the prequels or The Last Jedi too slow for you? Well, this movie moves along so fast it barely gives you any time to breathe! For some who just want to go on a fun ride, this might be a good thing. For me though, slowing down and letting the characters just talk to each other is really important. This movie barely does that. There is always something going on or a plot twist being dropped. It went so fast, I didn't even have time to comprehend a lot of it! This movie feels very rushed. It does slow down a little later on, but it's still a major issue with a good chunk of the film. There are also WAY too many new characters introduced! You have a large enough cast as it is, just work with what you already have! My second issue is Palpatine. It's no spoiler that Emperor Palpatine returns in this movie. His voice can be heard in every trailer and he's on the teaser poster. You're supposed to know this going in. Palpatine's return is handled horribly. He's supposed to be the main villain even though he's been completely absent from the last two movies. It's completely anti-climactic. None of the characters know who he is or have any real connection with him. We're supposed to accept that he's somehow still alive even though we saw him die! He fell down a pit and EXPLODED!!! It's not like bringing back Maul or Boba Fett. They literally tell you he came back to life in the opening crawl and then go on to hand-wave it away with a prequel meme. That's it. I'm not kidding. It's embarrassing how poorly-written he is. They never explain where he's been all this time, what he's been up to, why he's been doing it, how he's been doing it, why he's waited so long, or how he was resurrected. Did someone fish his body out of the Death Star? Is he some kind of clone, like in the old Dark Empire comics? Is he a ghost? I have no idea, and I bet the filmmakers don't either. It's insulting. The third issue I have with this film is the lack of continuity with the other movies, The Last Jedi especially. A lot of that movie is either ignored or undone by this movie. Rose is replaced with a giant slug monster and relegated to a background role, they bring in an Emperor figure when the last movie made a point to get rid of that and have Kylo Ren be the main villain, and let's just say that Rey isn't exactly a nobody. Could you imagine if Richard Marquand got rid of Lando and made Luke not actually Vader's son in Return of the Jedi? It's so frustrating. JJ Abrams sacrificed a flowing narrative for this trilogy for his own original vision. It's selfish and it's childish. Again, this may be a positive if you hated The Last Jedi. I really like The Last Jedi, so this really bothered me. It's clear that there was no plan for this trilogy from the beginning and the filmmakers didn't have enough communication with one another. It's not only TLJ that this movie retcons. Bringing Palpatine back really diminishes Anakin's sacrifice at the end of Return of the Jedi and kind of rewrites the entire Star Wars mythos. He was the chosen one, prophesied to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force. He did that by killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Only he didn't, Palpatine survived. I had the same issue with the old Expanded Universe. I thought the reason they got rid of the EU was so that they could improve on the post-Jedi storyline, not repeat the same mistakes it made, only somehow worse. Who's the chosen one now? What's the point of the prophecy? What did Anakin die for? I have no idea! This movie also contradicts some of the newer books and comics. Again, I thought the point of getting rid of the EU was to create a more cohesive universe with the films and the non-film material. If the movies are still going to ignore or contradict the books and comics, why did they find it necessary to discontinue the old books and comics from coming out at all? They could have two timelines going on at the same time, I don't think it would be confusing! Anyway, I'm getting very nerdy and off-topic. From how much I'm trashing this movie, you might think that I hate it. I don't. I still had fun watching it and there was quite a bit that I enjoyed. Rey and Kylo Ren are still great, the effects are excellent as always (The integration of the Carrie Fisher footage is pretty seamless.), the action is thrilling, there's good comedy, the acting is good and there are many surprises that got me genuinely excited. I also liked how it didn't retcon the Luke storyline from TLJ, they just made it more clear for those in the audience who didn't fully understand the point of it in the last movie. This movie also explains why Hyperspace ramming isn't a common tactic in warfare in the Star Wars universe, after it was shown to be so deadly in The Last Jedi. Overall, this movie is an absolute mess and a major disappointment, but it makes for a fun time out at the movies. Just don't think too hard about how it connects with the other Star Wars movies and you'll be fine. I can see why people like it, it's just not for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A cinematic disaster that wholly fails to justify it's own existence and that of the trilogy as a whole..,"A tragic culmination of the flaws of the previous 2 films. Whether due to his own lack of imagination, studio meddling, or the previous abomination that Rian Johnson directed, JJ Abrams has wholly and utterly failed to deliver a satisfying end to this abysmal trilogy.The storyline is a nonsensical mashup of bad original concepts and stolen ideas, the writing itself is hamfisted, and the climax is a laughable double ex-machina. The main plot point of the film is directly lifted from a 1991 comic series call Dark Empire, except the film did it badly. It comes off like a fan fiction story with a hollywood budget.Any praise I could lay upon the actors themselves was wasted by the director and producers. Ultimately this film (and the Trilogy as a whole) is confusing, unsatisfying, anti-climactic, and wildly inconsistent with the original 6 films.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Has all the right elements ... but falls short each time,"If you were to take a step back and think about all the different plot sequences (short events), they look good on the surface: fast-paced action, good dialog, humor, characters from previous movies, lots of cool worlds and great F/X.Furthermore, if you look at the big-picture story ... it's quite acceptable for a Star Wars story.So what went wrong? For me, the plot-sequences are not well-thought out and there too many of them for the movie's runtime. Many of the sequences have highly-convenient endings (like someone always swoops down at the last moment to avert disaster). You can almost count on that happening each an every time. It's a cop-out formula that's overused.Furthermore, the big ""reveals"" were easy to guess. I'm usually terrible at guessing what happens next, but here it seemed obvious. They'd pose a question in a leading way, for example when raising the question of Rey's birth, pause for a long time ... and ... it's not that hard to put 2 and 2 together. It's like a spoiler during the movie.Secondly, the movie needs to be longer or have fewer plot sequences. The sequence endings seemed rushed and not well integrated with the film itself. If they had a bit more time to edit the movie and catch these kinds of problems, the result could have been very different.But without a doubt ... this is one of those movies you ""have"" to see sooner or later because it involves the completion of the culturally iconic Star Wars story.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why do Star Wars fans hate Star Wars??,"It's not George Lucas' vision. The main crew doesn't have the same chemistry has the original one. It has some loose ends...
This why it doesn't deserve 10/10.
It's the first (on the new trilogy) with a proper original story. TFA was like a remake of ANH and TLJ was a mix of moments of ROTJ and TESB. This one has its own idea, and it's a good one.
We can argue about some loose ends, for sure. But the story doesn't fail our expectations, it respects SW heritage and conflicts (the main one, the inner conflict to go down a dark path).
It's frantic and has amazing battles, fine light saber duels, it gives Rey a solid background.

Don't believe the negativity,"It seems like a lot of people are still holding on to the old era of Star Wars, whilst everyone knows and loves the originals it would be pointless to make a film that was identical to them. This film isn't perfect, you can definitely see the presence of Disney but the budget only helps with the scale of the film and it still feels like Star Wars, it's entertaining for both a general viewer and Star Wars fans alike.

Terrible plot unconvincing acting.,"I literally just watched it to finish the trilogy and I feel I've wasted 2.5hrs of my life. So many parts of the film lifted and rehashed from the original films these films in particular Rise of Skywalker feels so weak in it's plot writing and that screen writers must have had so many mental blocks and just dropped in convenient moments to fill and move along an already bad film. Worst of all for me is Rey she's always thinks she knows everything and her character is infuriating how is she so powerful as Jedi? I mean it took Master Yoda centuries to get to his greatness and yet she did it all in a weekend the only convincing part to this is how unconvincing Rey truly is. Only true and believable characters are Po and Kylo Ren who truly to feel convincing and have depth. And the ending WOW so lame. Thank goodness for Rogue One and Solo, those films show how it should be done. Best thing that came from this film? The end credits.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A satisfying conclusion to the 42 year old saga,"In 2015 JJ Abrams had the daunting but almost impossible task to come up with a new Star Wars movie that would not only entertain the critical old fans but also satisfy the new ones. His trick? He introduced new characters and made a remake of A New Hope. For me that worked fine.He actually does the same with The Rise of Skywalker.To conclude both the new trilogy as well as the whole Skywalker saga he revisited famous old Star Wars locations and ""copied"" some of the most famous scenes from A New Hope, The Empire strikes back and Return of the Jedi. And of course he made a comeback possible of the biggest Star Wars villain around, emperor Palpatine.Cheap? Maybe. But all of Abram's decisions work out very well. With The Rise of Skywalker he made an entertaining and epic conclusion of the Skywalker saga. He wasn't able to please all fans of course, but that's what you get when you tackle a project like this. Too bad a lot of people wanted him to fail and never gave him a chance. Some people even suggests that this episode is even worse than The Phantom Menace - and that's absurd.The Rise of Skywalker is not a perfect film.There's a lot going on and especially C3PO's storyline in the beginning takes a lot of screentime. The ""MacGuffin"" in the story seems far fetched, but the film really delivers at the moments when it has to.Because it's best to see the movie without knowing anything here are some things that I think are worth mentioning.The opening crawl of the movie starts with ""The Dead speak"", referring to the return of Palpatine who has given the entire universe a terrorist-like message that he's backRey, Finn and Poe are together almost the whole filmThe scenes with Carrie Fisher are well done. If you didn't know that she died you'd think that she filmed all new scenes. Only one shot of Leia seems fakeThe confrontations between Ren and Rey are highlightsKylo Ren's character is the most interestingThere one big WTF moment in the movie that no doubt will be spoilered by trolls on the internetJJ Abrams does a lot of fan service (nothing wrong with that)Who or what is Rey?

The Story of 'Star Wars' Lives Forever,"I got to say, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"", has proved me wrong. It's an absolute best final chapter, and far more better than Rian Johnson's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"", because J.J. Abrams and George Lucas has delivered all the great experience in the film, and has delivered the greatest lightsaber duel of all time, that Rian Johnson couldn't deliver in the Last Jedi. There's nothing like the Star Wars series. Episode IX is the final chapter that has a conclusion to the story that is over 40 years of a making. At the beginning of 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, these are all the story of all 8 Star Wars films to get to Episode IX that is the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, it has to be Inevitable, Satisfying, Emotional, and Thrilling. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas wants the whole world to see what it's like to feel the ending of Star Wars, as the force will call to us, between the light and the dark side, and we will all feel the force once again. All the main characters and the original characters come together for one very last time for the final saga to end, and it's like nothing you've ever seen before. The previous story of Star Wars have all build and lead to this very last moment. It will go out with a bang, and there is a massive energy to it, that's bigger than anything that I could ever imagine. And it has all the fun.

The plot is basic and by the end you're left barely satisfied but is understandable.

Up to this point I've strongly disliked the sequels...,"The Rise of Skywalker was by far the best movie of the new sequel trilogy. I have a difficult time understanding certain reviews and the general rating of this movie. My recommendation is go and see it, it's the movie that while being imperfect and flawed in certain areas, redeems the sequel trilogy and brings a dignified end to the Skywalker Saga.First thing I must say is we get the answers! Finally we know the story behind the First Order, Snoke and Rey. We get to know how the certain antagonist was involved in all this and what was the goal of the evil forces. Dammit, even The Last Jedi makes more sense now! The Rise of Skywalker coresponds very well with the Return Of The Jedi but at no point is an ordinary copy paste like it was with The Force Awakens.""Visually stunning"" is a phrase we can say about all the films of the sequel trilogy, but here we see the absolute perfection. The definition of how a space opera movie should look like. The planet that's so important in the plot is simply incredible. All the final sequences inside the ancient temple were overwhelming. Dark and even scary. Abrams did a great job here, we get to feel what it means to deal with the Sith. The final battle was a sort of a typical finale for Star Wars films, but with a few twists. At one hilariously over-the-top moment I actually laughed, but somehow it was not a bad thing, I wasn't mad at this.About the flaws. The plot is progressing very fast so one needs to be very focused. It's a material for a whole trilogy. It's almost as if Abrams finally understood what needed to be done and tried to fix everything with one movie. He sort of did fix everything, but at a cost. Maybe at least a half an hour more would help to slow down the tempo and make the movie more pleasant to watch. The other thing I disliked was all the new ideas about the Force. We all remember the horrible idea of midichlorians from Episode I. Well here it's not as bad, but controversial at least. Here I understand the criticism, though IMHO all this doesn't ruin the movie.The final question remains to be asked. Why only now? Why did we have to endure mediocrity of TFA and TLJ? Ideas from this movie, well explored and with better storytelling would make an awesome new trilogy. Anyway, The Rise of Skywalker rewarded me for patience and all the feelings of embarassment and distaste I've had during the previous films.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Excellent Movie, absolutely satisfying for lifelong fans !","The movie is great! The text crawl and the first 5 minutes set up the whole movie with breathtaking speed and with a tiny but interesting twist. Then the movie starts for real, with all the characters coming together (for the first time in the new trilogy). The plot races forward right between (highly positive) fan service and some unexpected surprises. The characters are deeply likable and authentic, an improvement to ""The Last Jedi"", so we get much more involved and emotional during the course of the 141 minutes. Photography, sound, CGI, music are absolutely perfect!
Anybody who doesn't like this movie probably doesn't remember the feeling and the awe of seeing the older ones (20 or 42 years ago), they must be really cynical and jaded to dislike it. Do not let them spoil your fun and your enthusiasm.
For any die-hard Star Wars fan this movie is a 10.
For any casual fan it should be an 8 or 9.
And if this is your first Star Wars movie you will probably give it a 7, as it is a decent action movie.

A Whimpering End,"For all of their faults, ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" are decently fun action adventure movies that both continued the ""Star Wars"" universe and gave us some new and interesting characters. I like Kylo Ren and Rey. I liked Luke's arc in ""The Last Jedi."" I thought these were interesting twists on what we came to expect from ""Star Wars"" movies. Unfortunately, many fans became needlessly upset with the most trivial and pointless things in ""The Last Jedi."" I don't think that that movie was perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that the internet reaction to it was complete overkill. Due to the mixed fan reaction, Disney and Lucasfilm decided to go all-out in trying to appeal to all factions of this divided fanbase in the finale to their new trilogy. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" takes everything interesting that was set up in the previous two films, needlessly tosses it aside, and gives us a regurgitation of ""Return of the Jedi"" with elements from other ""Star Wars"" movies. It is completely over-the-top, nonsensical, and pretty much destroys any of the enjoyment that I had gotten out of this trilogy in the first place. This trilogy will probably go down in history as one of the better examples of how to completely crash and bury a franchise through a lack of vision and by attempting to cater to a whiny fanbase.We begin with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) hunting down a Sith wayfinder which will lead him to the resurrected Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Once there, it is revealed that Snoke was merely a puppet controlled by the Emperor, and that the Emperor wants Kylo Ren to find and kill Rey (Daisy Ridley). Meanwhile, Rey is training with Leia (Carrie Fisher). Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and BB-8 all join Rey on an adventure to track down Kylo Ren and Palpatine before he unleashes his fleet upon the galaxy.The fact that Palpatine is even alive in this one kind of spits in the face of ""Return of the Jedi"" and Vader's sacrifice in that movie. What's even more sad is the fact that the ending here is basically the exact same thing as the ending of that movie. The first hour is kind of a mess but it's salvageable. After the Rey and Kylo Ren duel on the Death Star ruins, when there is the ""final"" confrontation with the Emperor, this movie takes a complete nosedive to the bottom of the ""Star Wars"" pile. This garbage comes off as half-baked fan fiction material. Say what you will about ""The Last Jedi"", but that movie at least had some interesting narrative themes and concepts. And a followable plot that wasn't completely over the top and ridiculous.This schlock almost completely ruins the sequel trilogy for me. I actually really enjoy ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" for what they were. This movie is as soulless and lifeless as the clammy and disgusting Palpatine-clone that we are shown. Who is honestly very symbolic of the franchise as a whole; being revived every decade or so to just give us the same thing over and over again. None of the characters retained any of their traits from the previous movies either. Finn, Poe, and the rest serve no purpose in the overall plot. And there are so many new characters and locations that we are introduced to that it's all overwhelming and dizzying.On the positive side, I do like Adam Driver. I think that *some* of the action scenes are pretty neat. And in the end, it's still a ""Star Wars"" movie. On a critical level, it's probably better than any of the prequel movies. But I just find it so bland and lifeless, like the filmmakers really just wanted to get this series over with. Like there needed to be a third installment just to wrap up this wildly inconsistent trio of movies.Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to Episodes 10, 11, and 12 when they arrive in 2040 or whenever. Just stick with the original trilogy, ""Revenge of the Sith"" for the meme culture, the spinoff movies for some fresh perspective on the franchise, and maybe ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" if you really want to see the continued adventures of Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca.

I commend Abrams with his direction in this movie as he was able to overcome issues faced in the Last Jedi.The pacing of the movie was evident as a problem with the beginning being packed with scenes and introductions to the movie, evidently revealing the reduction of the original cut into this final cut.Abrams did fill fan service which left me on the edge of my seat with nostalgia and connections to previous characters and stories in the Skywalker Saga, however some of it was a bit over done which did expose a child like nature more suitable for younger viewers.Overall I commend Abrams and the cast and crew of Episode IX and I recommend this movie to all fans as a fun, exciting and action packed adventure to conclude the Skywalker Saga. Although some of the movie I didn't agree with, Abrams did fulfil his obligations to connect with the fans of the beloved franchise as best as he could, with the ending really completing the nature of the saga with carrying generation to generation.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the end of the saga,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ending the final trilogy of trilogies that covers 42 years of storytelling, was never going to be easy. And, given the rabid fan base's backlash from the penultimate episode, the ending was unlikely to appease all (or even most?). Keeping respectful of the sensitivity associated with this franchise, no spoilers are included here, certainly nothing that hasn't already been dissected and debated after the trailers were released.As I approached the theatre, it was impossible not to chuckle at the irony of seeing the life-sized marketing prop for KNIVES OUT in the lobby. Of course, that current release is directed by Rian Johnson, who caused such an uproar with the aforementioned STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (Episode VIII), a franchise entry that happens to be one of my personal favorites. But we are here for Episode IX, the wrap-up of George Lucas' masterful vision. JJ Abrams (STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS) is back in the director's chair, and knowing what a fanboy he is, it's not surprising to see the familiarity and tributes to the franchise interjected throughout.In fact, this finale leans heavily on nostalgia and humor, while tying up most loose ends - as well as some that weren't even all that loose. Writers Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow (originally slated to direct), Chris Terrio, and Abrams seemed intent on giving each beloved character their moment, as a sign of appreciation for their contributions to a legacy that covers a period longer than the lifespan of some of the biggest Star Wars fans. As one who stood in line in 1977, it's an approach that I respect and have no problems with - knowing full well that some will.Any attempt to tie up previous threads must focus on the odd, mystical relationship between Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). Both are still conflicted and attempting to come to grips with who they are. Rey especially is struggling with her identity and roots. One of my favorite elements from The Last Jedi was inner-head conversations blended with cross-dimensional physical interactions between Kylo and Rey, and it's used beautifully here.So, the biggest complaint from me is that despite its nearly two-and-a-half hour run time, there is simply too much crammed in. Too much story and too many characters and too many things that get a glimpse or mention, but no real development. This movie is jam-packed, and 'convoluted' would not be too strong of a word to describe. There are times we aren't sure where the characters are or what they are doing or why they are doing it. We do know that everything good is dependent on 'this mission', a mission that seems to change direction about every 12 minutes. In fact, the ""new"" players - Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) - spend very little time together on screen. And really, Finn is given almost nothing to do except look worried most of the time. On the bright side for characters, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C3PO both get their own sub-plots. Anthony Daniels (as C3PO) becomes the only actor to appear in all 9 episodes, although R2D2 joins C3PO as characters appearing in all.There are many old familiar faces, both good and evil. Some of these play key roles, while others are brief cameos. Much has been speculated about how Carrie Fisher's role as Leia will be handled. Archival footage, combined with special effects and camera angles, allows her to be present throughout, and yes, she gets the send-off she deserves. There are even some new characters/creatures introduced, including a cute new droid (never underestimate or under-market a droid) that is already for sale in Disney stores.No matter one's feelings or expectations, an area that surely will not disappoint is the visual effects. Somehow, this one is even more impressive and awe-inspiring than the others. In particular, a couple of scenes filmed in and around an angry sea left me dumbfounded, mouth-agape. However, what's most amazing is the consistency of the visuals throughout. It's just a stunning film to look at. Some of the story may be a bit confusing or cheesy, but some parts of the film are truly great. Cinematographer and Special Effects guru Dan Mindel deserves special mention, as do Production Designers Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins. Of course the visual effects team is without peer - and take up about 5 minutes in the closing credits.Lastly, composer John Williams gets to add his well-deserved personal stamp on this final chapter with new work added to the already iconic score. Very few moments compare to the opening notes blasting away on the theatre sound system as a Star Wars film begins. And as much as we'd like to treat this as the end, we all know Disney will find a way to keep us interested in a galaxy, far far away.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What kind of Star wars fan are you?,"For me Star wars have allways been about good storytelling.The original trilogy had a simple but strong and surprising story.The prequels had their faults but they still told a great story about how evil could rise to power under the nose of the good guys.The story in the rise of skywalker, is not existing. It just chaos. People running around doing stuff in a pace which seems to be an attempt to hide an incredible high amount of plot holes and inconsistencies. Even the ideas which could have been awesome fall flat due to the lack of an overall structure in the story and what seems to be a fear of surprising the fans.The use of the force and the depiction of the power structure in the galaxy, is so vague and not in line with what was established in the previous movies, that it almost break the logic of the franchise.If you just want a movie with stunning visuals, high amount of fan service and where everything happens as you predicted, then the rise of skywalker may be a good star wars movie.I liked the music and the visuals, but the lack of good storytelling and respect for ALL the previous movies mad me sad.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A competent and noble attempt to undo the mistake that was Rian Johnson,"....did I miss something? How are people saying that this is a bad film?
I had zero expectations going into this one and rightly so. The Last Jedi was slow, confusing, annoying (Rose and the casino planet alone take the cake here) and it made me doubt the entire state of the franchise. Watching this film was like a breath of fresh air. JJ Abrams is a wildly talented director, there were moments where he was able to tell more in 5 minutes of screen time than entire plot line's from The Last Jedi. It's a beautiful example of efficient and clean story telling. It's as if JJ is that one team member who carries the group for the entire first assignment, goes on holiday, his team mate proceeds to ruin everything, and he has to step-in and do what no one else can to fix the mistake. This movie isn't perfect but considering what he had to work with it's an absolute masterpiece of creative film making. I highly recommend seeing it, if only to appreciate JJ's skills.This movie didn't disappoint me, the fans did. Imagine millions of nerds who each have a specific favourite character or a specific piece of lore that they want to see in the film...now try making them all happy. A fan base that's this stubborn doesn't deserve more Star Wars content.This is not a perfect film. But it's as perfect as it can be given the context it was given.

Worst way to end 42 years of an important cultural pheonom,"I recently saw a review on YouTube that made me think about this last Disney trilogy and I almost came to accept that maybe I was wrong and the story arc for Luke and Leia made sense. But then I realize that these movies had very little to do with any of the original movies characters and I digress. How Disney has turned this into a cash cow is shameless, greedy and inmoral. From the very beginning I expected a more dramatic movie, these characters have been with us for forty years! I don't understand why Mark Hamil was ignored when writing the script to these movies, nor why did these movies need a new story when there are decades of comics and books with lore and great stories? Disney had a once in a lifetime opportunity to conclude what George Lucas started almost half a century later, and they decided to turn this over to people who never read the source material nor cared about lore. During all these years Mark H never stopped being Luke and Carrie was Leia, they never took on roles that they were known for more. It saddens me that we will never have a memory of all our beloved original characters together for at least one scene at the end of this all.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Aren't you a little short of ideas for a stormtrooper?,"Nearly two weeks on, I'd hoped I would have a better handle on my opinion of Episode IX by now, but frankly... I'm not sure I do.Let's do the plot bit first. The Emperor has returned. Angered by the threat to his control, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) hunts him down, but before he can strike, the Emperor offers him a fleet for Star Destroyers to lead. Rey (Daisy Ridley) leads her group of friends on a mission to discover a key to finding The Emperor's location.So how do I feel. Underwhelmed, I guess. I'm not massively disappointed and I don't think the film was unduly horrible, but there's definitely a feeling of ""is that it?"", with notes of relief that the ""Skywalker Saga"" is over and we can now (hopefully) start exploring new stories with new elements set in this Universe. I really didn't like bringing back The Emperor in the way they did as, has been mentioned in lots of places now, it undermines the central thrust of Vader's redemption from the original trilogy. I also didn't care for bringing back Lando. I feel like the decision to bring him back, and it's indicative of the whole film, is a decision made for ""the fans"" rather than because it serves the plot of the film. The elements where it reacts to ""The Last Jedi"" really feel forced, or perhaps where it reacts to the reactions to ""The Last Jedi"" is a better description. Fans liked the Kylo Ren mask, glue it back together. Fans didn't like Rose, quick get me Charlie from LOST and copy and paste her lines to him.It still looks good and some of the action scenes are great. I like the new cast, they do well and I wish that the filmmakers had more faith in them. There's isn't a lightsabre battle to match ""Last Jedi"" though, or a space battle to match ""A New Hope"".It's better than any of the prequels, I'll say that.

"Plenty of noise and colour, but little of interest or note","It has been quite some time since I got excited about this franchise; I guess the TV shows maybe are doing more at the minute, but for the films there is little to get excited about within them, and probably far too many of them being made for all the 'proper' fan to make it a date. Rise of Skywalker had been largely panned by viewers and critics, but I decided it was a good Friday night sort of film - one that doesn't take too much effort to watch. I was correct because this film really doesn't have much of a plot to care about, and seems to have been patched together without a lot of thought to the whole.Technically it is very impressive - although of course it is because hundreds of millions of pounds were spent to make it sound and look good; and it mostly does. If you want lightsabers and space battles then you get it here. However if you put aside the technical feat, it is very much hollow. I struggled to care about anyone in the film; the dialogue was often clunky, and there was almost nothing natural or organic in there. The writing doesn't help itself by doing things that seem fan-service at best, and cynical at worst. For example the constant references back to other films by having scenes that echo scenes in the original films break things up. Meanwhile moments or aspects are included that don't seem to mean much in the moment and feel like they have been included in the hope of linking to yet another spinoff opportunity. With all this, the cast are mostly stuck with just going with it the best they can but nobody really stands out as an actor.In the end, it is a fairly bland product; full of noise and spectacle but nothing of any real grit, interest, or substance.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Go read Star Wars Legends instead,I know all the Star Wars fans always say this but go read Star Wars legends. I watched these movies before I knew about legends and while I was watching them the only thing I could think of is how bad this trilogy is and how it ruins Star Wars. No matter what every plot line every character development every story will get destroyed because of this trilogy. That was until I read Star Wars legends. And I don't read at all because of school forcing me to read book over book so I could get a good grade back when I was younger. The only things I read was comic books and instructions to things after schools stopped forcing me to read. But when I finally picked to read Star Wars legends back in 2022 I didn't stop. So I don't make a giant essay on why it's good I'm going to instead make a simplified list on everything it does better than this trilogy.1. We get to see Jedi after the 6th episode and don't see that they all are missing.2. Luke Skywalker isn't a hermit but instead a Grand Master who takes charge in everything including fully changing the beliefs of the Jedi Order.3. Luke gets married and has a kid while Han Solo and Leia Organa get married and have twins and a few years later have one more kid.4. We see the Jedi help people around the galaxy.5. We get to see background characters become main characters. A prime example is Wedge Antilles who was a background character in the original trilogy and in the books becomes a leader of one of the strongest squadrons the Rogue Squadron.6. We get to see lady characters who don't feel like they learn everything in three days and now are stronger than everyone. A prime example are Mara Jade who starts as a Dark Jedi (A Jedi who's like a Sith but isn't fully in the dark side and still have some of the Jedi code apart do them.) and then over the years becomes a Jedi Master.7. No plot points get forgotten about.8. When Han and Leia get married and have a family they don't after a few years leave each other and hate each other.9. They don't hide important plot points in real life or in video game events like how this movie did.10. Characters don't change their name unless they are on a mission or got a Sith name.11. Everything gets explained in the books and makes sense.12. The Empire doesn't die after the 6th episode like in the movies but instead persists for a long time. They even make peace with The New Republic and let planets who want to be apart be apart and one not to leave.13. The New Republic helps defeat any threat that emerges and has an army.14. They always show the politics of the time in the books and show of what's happening and why this is happening.15. Later books don't have The Empire as a threat but instead something more dangerous as the threats.16. Times actually change and we get to see the X-Wings and Y-Wings be replaced by the E-Wings and K-Wings. We even get to see The New Republic reform as The Galactic Federation of Free Alliances.17. Luke doesn't waste time on making a new temple but instead uses the temples at Yavin 4. (I know this one doesn't fully count to a reason why it's better than the movie sequels but I just think it's weird they pick to keep this uncanon for no reason.)18. Palpatine does come back in the books but only a few years after episode 6 and he isn't a clone but instead the original Palpatine in a clone body with only has a few clones with each clone age faster than the last one.19. The fans got a voice in ideas or got acknowledge in the books. Two prime examples are that the fans got to pick a Sith name and a fan film got referenced in a book.20. When a character dies they die. There aren't that many times a character fakes their death.21. The only people who can talk after death and be force ghosts are people who become one with the force and learn how to. If you aren't a Jedi then you can't be a force ghost and characters who weren't taught or died before it became fully known don't become force ghost because they never learned how to.22. When a planet gets destroyed that government that run that planet and others don't go away.And everything I put on the list was the ones I could say. There are many other things I couldn't talk about because I would need to explain a lot of things that would make a massive paragraph in that number or I'm semi uncertain of. The whole legends series is a great read and if you don't want to read then go on YouTube and listen to it or play the video games who are also apart of the legends series. It's way more enjoyable than watching some CEO who doesn't understand Star Wars make an original character that has their exact personality who is better than everyone else when they had none/not a lot of training to get that rank. Be honest when I think about it the CEO might also think she's better than everyone else when they had none/not a lot of training to get the job.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Zero original idea, zero vision, millions of marketing dollars.","I had a thought watching this, ""How did Disney allow this clusterfk to happen?""
But then it all made sense (or cents). It's the Disney approach to commodifying our childhood stories and fantasies and turning it into a production line, churning out identical, packaged goods all in one colour. (In other words, the same crap over and over again).Admittedly, I wasn't terribly shocked watching this, I had time to process all the disgust from Force Awakens, so I had very low expectations. Yet it still didn't fail to disappoint.I mean, WHAT trilogy? It's like a cringe-worthy email spat between two directors, each trying to cancel out the other's points, yet pretending to be civil. Rian Johnson at least had the balls to try to have a vision, but failed spectacularly in execution. But then again, he's inheriting the mess started with Abrams.Now Abrams, if you remember at all from Lost, is not a trustworthy storyteller. He hoodwinked all of us into believing his increasingly tangled web of plots and subplots was going to be somehow resolved in a brilliant ending that will cement his place as one of the truly great auteurs of our time. Of course, now we know better. This is not a storyteller who is faithful to the narrative. He's a music video director, creating tantalising plot points only to dismiss them with silly or lazy answers.And that's what Rise of Skywalker is, a music video/ 2-hour trailer. Scenes are just stringed together without rhyme or reason like Rey jumping over TIE fighter. (that's in the trailer so not a spoiler). Cool for the sake of being cool. Emperor and a huge fleet pops back out of thin air because the plot calls for it. Ending is a joke. Nonsensical action, some witty banter, some emotional moments - what a mess in the hands of a mediocre director.Zero original ideas, zero vision. Zero emotional investment in the story. Zero chemistry between leads. Such forgettable, inconsistent characters. Can you believe this is George Lucas' Star Wars?",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The best badly made Star Wars movie possible.,"The execution of this film is horrific when you truly think about it. The editing is at break-neck speed. It is so fast paced it could give you whiplash.If you loved The Force Awakens like I did, imagine 2 of those films but fit into half of the run time. That is how this film feels. The moment you realise that this film has probably the worst editing of all time, you can let go and enjoy the film for what it is. A glorious, respectful, entertaining tribute to everything Star Wars means. I came out excited, hopeful, and happy to be a Star Wars fan.Every scene is fun, exciting, and a tribute to the spirit of Star Wars. Everyone complains about the use of nostalgia; everyone complains about Rey's backstory. But no. Everything is so unashamed in this movie at being for the fans. It is gloriously emotional, thrilling, and fun fan service.However, it should have been a 3hr+ movie. Every scene in the first act should have been twice as long - so you could truly absorb all the emotions and plot devices.Nearly every decision made story-wise in this film was a decent decision for Star Wars. Only a few glaring mistakes. It's a shame that it's all edited at such a speed where you cannot appreciate each moment enough to absorb the film as a whole. It is almost jarring.This is the opposite to The Last Jedi. That was the worst well made Star Wars film possible. Although nearly every decision made in that film was the wrong one, the wrong decisions were executed in a decently commendable manner from a film making perspective.This film also has some of the most emotionally complex moments for any Star Wars movie ever. It's a shame that such brilliant concepts were happening at such jarring speeds and with no meditation on the characters.We will never know how beautiful this trilogy would be if Abrams directed all 3 films. One thing is for sure, this film would not be so unecessarily fast paced.I urge fans to enjoy this film. It is a tribute to all of you. Do not submit to the excessive online hate.I for one wish for a better made movie, but am satisfied with the enthralling, overwhelming, emotional Star Wars conclusion I was given. I could tell Abrams made the movie for me. And it connected well.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Really nice, best 2.5 hours I spent this year.","I ruined my Game of Thrones final season experience by reading all the spoilers, Imdb reviews and theories available on the internet and haven't enjoyed one bit of it, so with this movie I decided not to read anything at all and just go without any expectations into it, and it proved to be the winning approach.This was a really nice experience, satisfying, emotional. Don't read any spoilers, don't read any reviews, and just know that JJ Abrams did all he could to fix most of the problems that 'The Last Jedi' delivered, and he did well.The movie is a bit pacey for my taste, same as GOT final season was, but understandably so because JJ had to fill all the plot holes from TLJ movie. We all love a slow storytelling, but there was no time for this since JJ didn't do the second movie in the series and we should respect that.I get a feeling that this should have been 2nd and 3rd movies in the series, well at least a good portion of this film should have been a story for the 2nd movie. If this was the case the story would be a lot slower and I guess better developed.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THE WRITERS JUST COULDN'T SEE THE VISION 💎,"I'm in Shock at how the Writers had a Gem Stone of a Story, in Rey Potentially Uniting With Kylo Ren and Becoming the most Powerful Force in the Galaxy. This would of set the course for the Next 3 Movies with Rey and Kylo Ren being the Villains and opening up the Flood Gates for more interesting protagonists to come in and try and overthrow their Rule.But this is what happens when you are not Ballsy enough, you end up with Mediocre, Stars in your Eyes, Safe Endings like what we have here. It was an Absolute Let Down.The Writers could of really shaken up the Cinematic Multiverse and the World of Star Wars if they had actually pulled it off, it seemed like it was going to happen in the Last Jedi, but I thought maybe the writers were saving the Best for last. SMH 😔A few Highlights:° Palpatine charges up his Lightning and Unleashes it throughout the Skies and the Sound when he lets loose was That Of Unequivocal Pure Power. It is Another One of the Greatest Cinematic Segments I have ever Seen and Heard.° Rey does this Awesome Backflip when Kylo Ren speeds at her with his ship.° Rey vs Kylo Ren with the waves crashing near them was Great.° There were some great effects in different scenes throughout the Movie.Bad Points:° General Hux? Really? Why? do they think this is cool or something? It was a Joke.° What happened to Finn? He has been pretty much non existent, over this and the last movie.° The Rey and Palpatine Thing. Oh Please.° Rey at the Very End. Just LOLLooking Back, this is very AntiClimactic. The Writers, The Directors, They just couldn't see what they had and where it could of lead them.

Ludicrous plot,"Just watched this with my 2 kids (10 and 5) whose favourite shows currently are intellectual powerhouses such as Captain Underpants, Floor is Lava and the Last Kids on Earth.

I was mesmerised back in 77 as a 5 year old kid during episode 4 and again tonight watching episode 9, I was totally captivated, ending the Skywalker saga on a massive high.
How our Princess was handled was absolutely perfect, the movie looked incredible, the cast were all amazing and John Williams score, as always, was consistently awesome. I left the theatre this evening with a tear in my eye and a huge grin on my face.
My 13 year old daughter scored the film 10/10, my 18 year old son 8.5/10, my wife 9/10 and for me it was a perfect 10 star experience. I'm going back to see it again tomorrow, to once again take in that stunningly beautiful final Star Wars shot, in all it's emotional glory.

Star Wars is a intergalactic fairytale. Very entertaining, funny, nostalgic..
The point of knowing who you are and who you chose to be no matter of your family's actions or the way you have been raised. Sure there were some cliche scenes but which fairytale doesn't have one. The chemistry of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's is unquestionable. The fights were just epic!! On the climax of the movie I was holding my breath. Palpaltine is the villain we deserve!

"I enjoyed it, but with a sizeable asterisk","Rian Johnson'sStar Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)was a film which divided critics and audiences to an unusual degree - on Metacritic it has a critical score of 85/100 (the second-highest in the franchise), but its audience score is only 4.4/10 (the lowest in the franchise). In their (predominantly negative) reviews of Rise of Skywalker, many critics who championed Last Jedi posit that the film was a great work of art, unfairly maligned by a toxic fanbase. And certainly, there was an element of that - the racist and sexist abuse thatKelly Marie Trantook from such fans was shameful. However, these critics essentially argue that if you didn't like Last Jedi, the only possible explanation is that you're a  misogynistic Neanderthal. They don't mention the horrid screenplay that spends 40 minutes on a side-quest that has nothing to do with the rest of the film; they don't mention how Holdo (Laura Dern) withholding her plan from Poe (Oscar Isaac) makes not a lick of sense; they don't mention Luke (Mark Hamill) throwing away his lightsaber (to hell with that scene); they don't mention how Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) was turned into comic relief; and they certainly don't mention resurrected flying space Jedi (to hell with that scene too). The fact is, the film is an absolute mess at both a structural and thematic level.And so we have Rise of Skywalker, which is a course correction if not a flat-out apology - Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is once more wearing his mask and the Knights of Ren are back; the Jedi child seen at the end of Last Jedi is never mentioned; Rey's (Daisy Ridley) parentage, so casually dismissed in Last Jedi, is once again crucial; and Rose (Tran) is barely seen. Indeed, Rise is more of a sequel toStar Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)than it is to Last Jedi, one or two major plot points notwithstanding. And although I certainly enjoyed it as a spectacle (it looked and sounded exceptional in 3D IMAX), there's no doubt it's a deeply flawed piece of work. It's the kind of film that feels like it was created by a computer algorithm or a corporate committee trying to tick as many boxes as possible, concerned primarily with trying to please everyone without offending anyone. And this is only one of two impossible tasks it assigns itself.Picking up the story a few months after the events of Last Jedi, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned, revealing that he's been manipulating events from behind-the-scenes for years. As the film begins, Kylo Ren is making his way to Palpatine's base on the 'hidden' planet Exegol, which can only be reached with the use of a powerful Sith Wayfinder, of which there are only two in existence. Seeing Palpatine as a threat to his leadership of the First Order, Ren is planning to kill him. However, rather than doing so, he watches in awe as Palpatine reveals a massive armada of hundreds of fearsomely powerful Xyston-class Star Destroyers. And so, the Resistance set out in a mission to confront and defeat him.Directed by Force Awakens directorJ.J. Abrams, with a script by Abrams andChris Terrio, the biggest problem with both this film and this new trilogy as a whole is lack of narrative through-lines. At no point during Rise did it ever feel like the culmination of a nine-film arc. It barely felt like the culmination of a three-film arc. Not only is there a disconnect between the three films in the trilogy, but there's a sizeable disconnect between this trilogy and the previous two. Love them or hate them, the prequels not only form a coherent and logical trilogy, but (Midi-chlorian foolishness aside), they also form a coherent and logical six-film arc with the original trilogy.George Lucashas spoken about when you watch the originals, it's Luke's story, but when you watch the six films, it's Anakin's story. When you factor in this third trilogy, however, despite Disney dubbing the nine films the ""Skywalker Saga"", the overarching story essentially becomes Palpatine's. But, whilst his presence is woven intricately into the fabric of the first two trilogies, his appearance here is...less so. This has the effect of making the nine-film sequence feel unbalanced, with the last three never really feeling like a valid continuation of the previous six. At best, they feel like a spin-off, with thematic connections and recurring characters occasionally shoehorned in to try to establish narrative continuity.All of which leaves Rise with not one, but two impossible tasks - 1) to somehow conclude this trilogy in such a way that it also works as the satisfying closing chapter to the nine-film Skywalker Saga, and 2) to somehow conclude this trilogy despite having to abandon and retcon much of what the second film did.Of course, a big question here is whether or not Disney had a specific narrative plan going into this thing, with many arguing that the lack of coherence between the three films proves that they did not. But that seems somewhat unbelievable to me. Rather, it's more likely that Abrams laid the groundwork for a coherent three-film arc, but Johnson ignored (if not necessarily undermined) much of that preparatory work. This also feeds into the criticism that the first hour of Rise is too plot-heavy and expositionary; which could be explained if Abrams was essentially in a position of having to cram two films' worth of plot into one film.The big thing here is the return of Palpatine, which has been accused of being completely arbitrary, a desperate bit of fan service from a filmmaker trying to win back fans, and which doesn't make a whole lot of narrative sense. I can certainly sympathise with those sentiments, and I agree that his return negates Vader's sacrifice at the end ofStar Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). However, there were hints in Force Awakens that there was a hidden big bad, and that that big bad was Palpatine. To explain any more would constitute spoilers for Rise, but there are videos on YouTube posted shortly after the release of Force Awakens which speculate that Palpatine might be involved.There are some smaller issues with the film, however. For example, it treats death less than reverentially, with multiple characters dying, only to return in some form or another, which cheapens and undermines any inherent risk in the story. The quartet of main characters also remain as insipid as they were in the previous two films - Rey is still a reluctant Jedi trying to wrap her head around everything; Finn (John Boyega) is still a token good guy who used to be bad; Poe is still Han Solo-lite; and Ren is still a moody emo who hates his parents. The biggest problem is that the film is built around the Resistance trying to get to Exegol. To do so they need a Wayfinder, but to get that they need this other thing, but to find that they need to go here, but to do that they need a doohickey, but to get that they have to...you get the picture.For all that, however, I have to admit, I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker for the most part. There certainly are a lot of callbacks but I thought most were fairly well-handled, logical enough and reasonably organic. Aesthetically, as one would expect, everything looks and sounds great, particularly Palpatine's base on Exegol. Abrams and cinematographerDan Mindelshoot these scenes like it's a horror movie - deep chiaroscuro shadows, ominous caverns disappearing in the background, unnaturally powerful lightening flashing from above. This tone is helped immeasurably byRick Carter's production design, which really sells the vast otherworldliness of the place. Equally important here isDavid Acord's sound design, which features a constant chatter of unearthly and disembodied voices, like a thousand ghosts all whispering at once.The whole thing has a dark vibe the likes of which we've never really seen in Star Wars, and the scenes here are probably the best in the film. The scenes showing Rey and Ren speaking to one another via Force Dyad are also excellent. These scenes were easily the best part of Last Jedi, and they're just as good here, as we see the background of one character's location appearing behind the other character, with the backgrounds shifting from one to the other as the scenes play out. A lightsaber fight makes particularly good use of the Dyad, with events in one location having an unexpected effect on events in the other.So, all things considered, I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker and found it a vast improvement over Last Jedi. However, having said that, it never touches greatness, with everything feeling workshopped and focus-grouped to within an inch of its life. It looks great, and it's both exciting and entertaining, but it's also safe and predictable. And sure, you might say that fans rejected Last Jedi because it took too many risks, and now they reject Rise because it doesn't take enough, and there's probably some truth to that. But the fact is that it just never feels like a closing chapter. I enjoyed it whilst I was watching it and it's a decent enough Star Wars movie, with some terrific individual scenes. But as the final entry of a 42-year-old franchise (the most popular franchise in any medium in human history), it is, perhaps inevitably, a little disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Honest opinion out of the theater:Many critics and some fans have stated negative reviews.
I wholly disagree.J.J. Abrams may have ""played it safe"" as many have said.
The plot-lines were nostalgic.
There was actually some solid humor.
There were some goosebump scenes.
I feel J.J. fixed most of the errors produced from ""The Last Jedi,"" even if there were a few new plot-holes.
I enjoyed the characters and their dialogue much more than the first two of this trilogy.
This finale, to me, redeemed the sequels.I loved it.

A movie that is as stupid and fun as the Return of the Jedi.,"Lets face it, except for the first two films in this franchise (New Hope, Empire Strikes Back), which struck a good balance between fantasy and realism. Since the Return of the Jedi, all logic has been thrown out the window to repeat the same formula and please fans who want to see the same thing in every movie. And with each copy, the quality gets worseAnd this movie is the culmination of this need to serve these same fans, to make them happy to buy many products of this brandJJ had already given a signal that we wouldn't see anything new in this third triology with force awakens. And when Rian Jhonson tried to do something new, the reactions were not very pleasant.And just like the prequels, there is an interesting story of redemption, which is drowned out by this constant need to serve a movie to thousands of fans and consumers who want to see the same mediocrity repeated over and over again.And for all that, The Rise of Skywalker is a stupid but fun movie. Without a consistent narrative, but with excellent visual effects.
Good actors, but with a messy and cringe script.Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker It's watchable, but it has no magic beyond the manufactured nostalgia that money can buy. It is simply, just more of the same.I give this movie a seven in ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In my 30s the prequels came out. Yes, they were not the same...new characters and the building of the story of Obi-wan and Anakin. Understandably, many felt these movies did not measure up to the nearly impossible expectations of episodes 4-6. Then comes The Force Awakens. Again, new characters introduced and we're led through essentially a passing of e wand to a new generation. So now we close with The Rise of Skywalker. I was blown away. I truly feel it was an epic adventure. I can't adequately relate the excitement and emotions felt through the entire movie.

A Fantastic Controversial end to the new trilogy,"With it being Star Wars Day I have finally decided to rewatch and review the final film so far Episode 9 - The Rise Of Skywalker, so after watching it here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees The Resistance led by Rey, Finn & Poe have to work together to attempt to locate the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, while Kylo Ren attempts to find Rey and tell her his own plan.Main Character
Daisy Ridley is back as Rey for the third time and I think she does a really good job in this film. You see how in this film in particular how she is torn between both sides of the force and I think she gives a strong acting performance to sell that. She has fit into the character really well over time and I honestly think between her and Kylo Ren is how George Lucas wanted to right Anakin in the prequel trilogy but ultimatley did a poorer job.Supporting Characters
John Boyega gets a better time of it in this film as Finn, his story comes full circle across the trilogy and seeing him in this more commited and heroic role is good to see. His chemistry with Ridley and Oscar Isaac is a real highlight of the film and provides not only some of the more emotional but funnier moments in the film. The mentioned Isaac gets more to do in this film and given more mystery to his character and I thought he did a good job. They continue his arc from the previous film and I thought as mentioned him and Boyega have truly fantastic chemistry together and it really works for the film. Adam Driver is back as Kylo Ren and his story throughout the three films does a great job creating this complex character completley torn between the light and dark and in my opinion being a more interesting version of Anakin making him in my opinion one of the most interesting villains in recent memory. As mentioned Ian Mcdiarmid returns as Palpatine and he revels in this role and fits back into the role flawlessly and he is once again the ultimate evil which works for this film and despite the issues people have it really worked for me.Story
The story does a really good job of building are main characters stories, it also does the right thing by linking there stories together and not splitting them all up like the previous film. You see the main two characters Rey and Ren's struggler between the light and dark and how they are linked throughout this trilogy. Some people weren't happy with some of the reveals made in the film, mainly one large one but for me it did work. Though one criticism I have is that the film has some really emotional moments but goes against them very quickly, it sometimes doesn't commit to certain acts and takes away from being an even greater film that decides on really being emotional. Also this film really uses maguffins a bit too much, the crew have to find numerous objects to help them and it just feels like to much to do and overcomplicates things.Script
The script is really good in my opinion, the humour is well done, mostly due to the actors great chemistry but credit to the script for this. Also the drama really works and as mentioned provides some really emotional moments and dialogue between the characters. Yes some people would argued we are not given enough context to certain things but for me I don't need all the answers especially if it disrupts the flow of the film.Style
The style of the film is great, we go to many interesting locations that makes this film feel a bit more vibrant then other Star Wars films. The action scenes are exciting and great, the shootouts, space battles and lightsaber fights are great and feel like they fit right in with this new trilogy. The pacing of the film flows very nicely and honestly I was never bored and thought this film did an effective job in telling its final story.Overall
Overall, this film has a lot of mixed opinions but in my opinion this is a fantastic final chapter of the new trilogy and does a great job in providing a fantastic conclusion to these characters ending.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Some will love, others will hate!","The established fans of the sequels will probably find a lot to enjoy in this, a bit too short, movie that takes all the most interesting new characters and puts them in even more interesting situations. However if you didn't already like the direction the force awakens and, more importantly, the last jedi has taken this one won't win you over.
It revels in the exploring of boundaries that were semi-established in the already existing canon and sometimes takes a few steps in a direction that isn't entirely familiar. It is a daring final movie in a franchise that was daring to begin with. And in the end of the day STAR WARS has always been more fantasy than science fiction. It isn't supposed feel real; it's supposed to feel fantastical, and that it does.
My final criticism of the movie is that it could have used twenty more minutes in the first two acts, and a bit more time developing the friendship of our main trio. It works well as it is but some of the emotional beats didn't hit as hard as they could have, and this comes from someone who has read the comics and books leading up to the movie.
All in all an exiting but divisive conclusion that will yet again split fans between the dark and the light.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I think I'd be more disappointed, if I had any expectations.","I wasn't actually going to see this one in theaters, but I had two separate events in one day where I had to go and my ticket was paid for so its one of those things where the movie ended up being doubly fresh in my mind. It wasn't that I didn't want to see this one I just didn't have an enthusiasm for it. TFA was ok, if in a slightly better than Phantom Menace way and TLJ left me pretty disinterested in the new Star Wars canon.It occurred to me last night that literally no one involved with the original star wars had anything more than a side role or a cameo. It wasn't written by anyone from the original, nor produced or were any of the effects done by alumni. Lucas was shuffled out a sidedoor, so I found myself realizing that I don't really care nor have any interest in this beyond what appeared on screen. There's nothing to be let down by. I enjoy the old trilogy and this is just some other thing by different people. It holds no more value than the Legends canon. Maybe less so. I liked those books.Sorry, getting to the point - I went in just expecting to be entertained. If you're expecting this to put a bow on Star Wars prepare for massive disappointment. Its so lame they'll probably reboot the whole thing in 10 years. Unfortunately even just expecting to be entertained is going to be hit and miss.This is a 4 hour movie crammed into 2 and half hours. The movie begins with Palpatine not only being back, but with a whole another empire on the grill. I think this was a poor choice. As seen in the trailers he has like hundreds of worldkilling star destroyers, fully manned. If you're expecting an explanation.. curb your enthusiasm. The vast majority of the movie is our plucky heroes jumping from place to place looking for macguffins to help them stop him from managing to start his car then theres a big space battle and light saber duel at the end. I would say there's maybe 5 minutes of people talking to ghosts and having reflections on the force and mourning the old cast. Then it ends. My audience, both times I saw it, mostly just shrugged. Most everything from TLJ either literally gets retconned or is brushed under the rug. I can't emphasize this enough - go in with 0 expectations. Heck it might help pretend like this is a whole new Star Wars story and the first two never happened. I have to give it a 6 at least because I was pretty entertained. I don't see myself ever watching it again though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst movie of star wars ever,I hate this movie and I hate the way they made Luke into the OPPOSITE of who George Lucas created him to be. It totally makes Anikian's story die in vein. The worst. I feel like somehow we should never allow these movies to air. No one should have to see this awful nonsense. It completed RUINED the Star Wars legacy of the characters we love. Screw the guy who created this BULL s* nonsense. This guy should NEVER be allowed to write another movie. I can't express how much I DESPISE these last three movies they made. Whoever signed off on this needs to retire and do something else. They have completed RUINED Anni's story... last three movies are just AWEFUL!!,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Starwars Fans are the worst,"I've been watching the film's since I was kid on Betamax. The original trilogy was great, but fans hold them as the greatest movies of all time and anything that doesn't fit their imagination of what the next movie will be like, is a disappointment to them. Out of this trilogy, I found Force Awakens was great, The Last Jedi was ok as a kids film. The love story they tried to force left a bad taste in my mouth, but this film nicely redeems the trilogy. I didn't find any annoying characters, the storyline was predictable but entertaining. Remember that it's a kids/family movie, as were all of the other films. Disregard all the extremely poor reviews by the ""fans"" that are angrily typing their reviews in their parents basements. This was a nice ending to the saga",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Begin a franchise, if you know the perfect end.","Yes, an obvious comparison with MCU is inevitable. A franchise, which is loved so much by all, should only be begun if one has clear idea of a satisfactory ending. Such is the SW-TROS. It's a visual treat, no treat. But in the end, though there is a feeling of end, yet, someting feels a bit - incomplete. There are twists, sub plots...but there is a want for more.

"While no Star Wars film is perfect, don't be fooled by cynicism","As an avid Star Wars fan I may be a bit more forgiving than some, but the people giving it below a 5/10 had their minds made up before it came out. This was never going to make them happy, they've spent months digging for leaks on a movie they claim to not care about. As someone who was there for the release of the prequels it's pretty common for these movies to get hate on release and be highly appreciated a decade later. This movie is dense, fast movie and I'll admit it should have been 20-30 minutes longer. None of that changes how fun the ride is and how fitting and end to the story It is. While at times you may say to yourself ""I didn't expect that"" upon reflection it's fitting with the old George Lucas saying ""it's like poetry, it rhymes"". I say judge the movie for yourself and when you get there just sit back and enjoy the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Embarrassing,"From a technical aspect this film is fantastic, however the main purpose of a movie is to be a medium to tell a story to which with the context of having a massive budget, essentially infinite previously written lore to draw upon, and being a part of one of the most beloved film franchises of all time this has to be one of the biggest failures in story telling in the history of media. Are there worse movies? Yes. Are there worse stories? Yes. But to take the most popular film franchise of all time and clearly put 0 effort into actually coming up with a coherent story is unfathomable. It is clear now that Disney had absolutely no plan for what they were going to do throughout the 3 sequels and thought that just winging it was a great idea.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Ending We Could Get (spoiler-free),"The 9th episode of Star Wars trilogy was a masterclass in bringing a satisfying closure to a beloved saga. The simple but fun story reminds the ones of the original trilogy. The references,
the comebacks, the jokes, the sets - all done with precision and expertise that deserve a round of applause.The previous movie in the franchise, The Last Jedi received mixed reviews from fans, many of them overreacting to some indeed questionable choices in the storyline. Rise of The Skywalker was left to face the consequences, and did it bravely. Instead of running away from it's predecessor or moving against it, JJ Abrams found a brilliant way to use it to his benefit and develop the story rather than taking a step back, a task that seemed impossible to me before watching the movie.Some things I really liked:
👌👌👌 - Billy D Williams as Lando. Great to see him back.
👌👌👌 - C3PO portrayed by Anthony Daniels remains my favorite side character in the franchise.
👌👌👌 - Daisy Ridley as Rey. I love her so much.
👌👌👌 - Adam Driver as Ben Solo. So talented.
👌👌👌 - Many moments I cannot mention since it's a spoiler-free review.
👌👌👌 - The special effects department, bringing Carrie Fisher back to life.
👌👌👌 - Amazing score by John Williams. The only fair thing to do at this point would be to name the Oscars' Best Score category after him. It should have already happened a long time ago anyway.Overall, very fun. Anyone who says otherwise went in to watch the film when they already decided they're not gonna like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No expectations made med enjoy the movie,"I am a huge SW fan, and as TFA was underwhelming and TLJ made me absolutely furious, I went into seeing this movie with no expectations at all, niether reading or whatching anything about the movie beforehand. And thank god i did so. I was actually able to enjoy it.
No, it's not a fantastic movie and no, it does not satisfy my true SW heart. But it was solid. It has a few holes, it has, 'wait what really?' moments and it pushes the limit of the universe a few times in teams of what i'm willing to accept as a SW fan. But with that said, it doesn't do so in the same heartbreaking degree as TLJ did, and on top og that, it actually brought in a few things that made me feel excitement and that left me with some sort of overall satisfaction storywise. JJ Abrams had a difficult task fixing the mess that TLJ left behind, and i think he did well.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Story is sleepy as hell.,"Felt asleep in the first hour.The first half of the movie is about searching for the sith navigation? Really? A whole hour for just that? Man, I never felt asleep in the first six instalments (include TFA) that's first seven instalments.Too much emotional scenes those are not in necessary. Is this a space action-adventure movie or love story? Like a couple arguing between Kylo n Rey from the start to the end, I don't feel the excitement in the whole movie.Finally, where is the epic lightsabre fight?! Their fighting styles are like chopping chicken with the sabre. Is there even a sabre art director?",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Expectations subverted. Again.,"The Rise of Skywalker was a tour de force. It subverted expectations and pushed social justice propaganda. So why didn't the critics like it? These were the same things the critics cited as reasons The Last Jedi was a masterpiece. And The Last Jedi was clearly no masterpiece.So what happened? I'm not sure. But The Rise of Skywalker did expose the critics' hypocrisy. When critics cited the subversion of expectations as a positive aspect of The Last Jedi, I was suspicious. It felt more like an excuse for The Last Jedi's poor storytelling and weak character development. But whatever. Then came The Rise of Skywalker, which once again, subverted expectations. And this time, the critics didn't like it.The critics' response to The Rise of Skywalker confirmed my suspicions: critics don't really like their expectations subverted. Critics only like their expectations subverted when it goes their way, which is another way of saying they don't like their expectations subverted. The Last Jedi sacrificed good storytelling for cheap jokes and nonsensical plot twists simply for their shock value. Yet the critics overlooked these flaws and called them subverting expectations because The Last Jedi pushed fashionable propagandas.The critics bashed The Rise of Skywalker because it subverted their expectation that the seeds planted in The Last Jedi would continue to develop. Instead, The Rise of Skywalker chucked The Last Jedi out the window, course corrected, and continued where The Force Awakens left off, as if The Last Jedi never happened. Perhaps this was the real reason for the critics' hate. They might've taken the erasure of their beloved The Last Jedi personally and felt it was a big middle finger to them. But I thought it was pretty funny.The Rise of Skywalker was clearly better than The Last Jedi, but it was no tour de force. It felt rushed, the characters were underdeveloped, and action sequences were unremarkable. That said, JJ Abrams did the best he could to both fix the mistakes of The Last Jedi and create an entirely new film. And he should at least get credit for the effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The fall of Skywalker,"Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.My opinions on the previous 'Stars Wars' films were much more definite, being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they weren't that bad. Also thought 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' were better than expected (am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here), but 'The Last Jedi' certainly had a lot wrong with it. 'Solo' was good fun on its own terms too. Absolutely judging it from an open mind, 'The Rise of Skywalker' left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang, it's not deserving of a 1/10 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 10/10s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style. Of the franchise, this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed.Will start with the good things with 'The Rise of Skywalker'. It is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.There are some great performances here, Daisy Ridley carries the film outstandingly, having become more confident with each film, and Adam Driver is menacing and conflicted. Carrie Fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to Leia, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given (which was quite weak in my view) and how great it was to see Ian McDiarmid again as Palpatine, again his material was not great but he does a good job with it. Chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and C-3PO provided a few amusing moments. Babu Frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments. Some of the action is thrilling, namely the extended blaster battle and Rey and Kylo's force-based clash.For all those good things, 'The Rise of Skywalker' has a lot of major flaws. With so little time to breathe in the story, the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story. There is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act, and also too many characters. Some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on, such as Lando and Rose Tico. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walk-ons.Although the action has its moments, too much of it doesn't rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable. The big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense (the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform ""what the heck?"") and really convoluted the storytelling later on, leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anti-climactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it. A long way from a bang. Morever, the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogy's with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences.Overall, have seen far worse but a big disappointment. If some people liked it, good for you. It just didn't work for me and many others, for reasons that are valid, and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that, and not just for this film but for almost every film here. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Star Wars is no longer a Special Experience,"Just for reference, I am a huge fan of the original 3 films, having grown up on them. I've seen the prequels once each due to their boring nature and cartoony digital effects. Not. Fan of them by any stretch. Episode 7 was a fun movie that seemed to set the franchise back on its magnificent footing. Only to be completely undone by the awful episode 8. Prequel level awful!!!
This brings us to this movie. It is nowhere near as good as episode 7 and nowhere near as bad as episode 8. Some questions are left unanswered and some are answered extremely shabbily. Fan service helps but unfortunately there was too much of a mess left from episode 8 to try to reform the narrative and save this trilogy.
It is a watchable movie that lightly reminds you of why Star Wars was at one time, a super special theatrical experience. Now it is just merely another movie that comes out and holds your attention for a couple hours. No more, no less.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I left the theater disillusioned and sad,"Rian Johnson didn't leave J.J. Abrams much to work with, that much is true. All the things Abrams had tried to set up in The Force Awakens, Johnson simply tossed over his shoulder like Luke with his lightsaber.However, what Abrams did with this last film in the whole nine film saga, is about the worst thing he could have done. Johnson's actions were not those of a team player, but at least he tried something new. He wanted to take Star Wars into a new direction. So what did Abrams do? He grabbed the wheel, derailed the whole plot and forced it back to those same old tracks they've always traveled. Because why try something new when you can simply bring Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) back and do the whole shtick with him wanting to rule the galaxy all over again.It's painfully clear that they didn't have an overarching plot for this trilogy. They flew by the seat of their pants and that shows. So now the Skywalker saga is complete and it ended as a shallow rehashing of old clichés, already seen plots and recycled characters. Which makes it easily the worst film in the whole saga. You heard me correct.Now, objectively speaking, this is a very good-looking film. It's a bit grey and grainy compared to its two predecessors, but the locations are still grandeur, it feels and looks like Star Wars, and the score is nice.I also have to admit I really like the connection between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo (Adam Driver). Which also happens to be the only thing from The Last Jedi that Abrams carried over to this film. But it just works, allows for some of the best scenes in the whole film and is simply intriguing to watch.Overall, as a film, Episode IX has its ups and downs. If you're not that passionate about Star Wars, you're going to enjoy yourself just fine. But if you are, I'm predicting you're not going to like what you see here.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I still enjoyed it,The film itself was no doubt the worst of the trilogy but the other two were pretty damn great. Whilst visually impressive and still having the wow moments as well as moments of nostalgia the film couldn't help but feel like a collection of visually spectacular set pieces rather than a fluid storytelling experience and film. This was only made clearer in comparison by seeing at the end of a triple bill reminding me just how good the first two were. As a film in general though it's still pretty good without quite hitting the level you'd hope from a Star Wars film.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

can you stomach some stale swiss cheese? push reset and give us Darth Caedus!,"I never thought I would look back on the Phantom Menace trilogy as being part of the good ol days, but after this mess, yeah. Makes me miss the clarity and coherence of that abomination...I get it, pleasing everyone is impossible. But writing a good story is not about pleasing everyone, it's about making something fun, original, with a natural rhythm, a flow inherent in it's own style and intent behind it.In my opinion, they failed hard here. This is full of plot holes, jumbled together pieces of story lines that come out of nowhere and suddenly become meaninglessI couldn't care less about any of the ""heroes"", I don't relate to any of them and I am finding myself thinking about the countless needless lost lives of the bad guys. a few lost rebel lives, ok. but seemingly hundreds of thousands of these government employees... and i am supposed to mourn who?...I mean, I suddenly realized that storm trooper armor is just for show, this is why good guys never bother. Any pistol can burn right through them!I am watching the final scenes and wondering about things like ""I wonder how much these bad guys get paid? Why the hell they still fighting? What's in it for them?...""What I am saying is that my attention and care was just not there. To be honest, it was ok. A 6/10. if it was NOT star wars but a standalone movie of similar content, would be a 4, 5 tops... So yeah, the mythos alone brought this from mediocre and broken to meh I guess ok.But, I cannot state this enough, J.J. Abrahms man, you really screwed us over. The ending, the way that the Skywalker saga is concluded, is sad and insulting. I haven't been following all this time to have everything go to the worms like that. The title itself, ""Rise of Skywalker"", is about as misleading as could be, and ironically points to the very insult you have inflicted upon us by forever ruining the future of this universe.I don't care that Disney paid money to be allowed to make up the story and disregard all the cool work put in by the new jedi order novels and follow-ups, this story, this movie, to me is the fake. The only right thing they could do at this point is go for another money grab and push reset on this thing and go back to the drawing board for episode VII and use the books for material...Darth Caedus is the true conclusion of the Skywalker saga and will forever remain in my heart and mind as the real third act.

This is not a Star Wars movie,"Yes I know the title has Star Wars in it and the it looks like a Star Wars movie with lightsabers, spaceships and a few iconic characters but the most important part (at least for me): the story the movie tells and the message it tries to present, does not exsist. Each Star Wars movie from George Lucas told a unique(the second death star as the only exception) story and a clear message. The only message this movie presented to me was: ""Give me your money so that Mickey Mouse can build a Disney Star Wars park so that blindfolded fans can buy even more merch and Disney can make more cheap written projects like book of boba fett and Obi-wan kenobi.

"I do not understand the negative reviews, this was excellent.","I saw Rise of Skywalker yesterday going in disgruntled by the early reviews. Upon further review, The critics negative input on the film, was incredibly wrong. I haven't been this drawn into a Star Wars movie since I was a kid watching the original saga for the first time. There literally wasn't a dull moment throughout this whole movie. A visually pleasing work of art that is filled with action, emotion, nostalgia, and so much more. This was about 90% of what I wanted out of this movie, as they executed the finale very well. I was no fan of the Last Jedi and feared that this movie would be even worse. Though, this was far from the case as REAL Star Wars fan will appreciate this film for what it is. Without saying too much, I see a lot of Return of the Jedi in this film, (one of my favorite Star Wars films) which is probably why I loved it so much.

"Satisfying, It Must be. With Us, the Force Should be. There is No Try.","Pros:Loving the action sequences, most of the scenes are as intense as they would get. You would see that most of the actions here focus to entertain and to elicit highlight moments in the movie.The acting here is well-crafted by the actors. Daisy Ridley is exceptionally good as Rey, she oozes strong affection feeling and her poignant gestures render her character a good three-dimensional development. Not to miss out Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Though not as great as Ridley, but he fairly treats Ren redeemable of the character's good inherent qualities, trying to preserve what was left out in The Force Awakens and regains the character's strength of the damaging curve of The Last Jedi.Great fan-service for the final film of the trilogy. Many previous films' characters appear mostly to give out a new hope to the Resistance. Excessively not, the amount here is acceptable enough to make the fans happy and not annoy others.JJ Abrams knows extensively the appropriate time to which every character should appear. Rey and Ren steal most of the screen time. Finn and Poe always stick together as bromance partner. BB8 has more spotlight than R2D2 for driven story effect. One thing that I salute is that JJ Abrams throws Rose Tico out of the window for good. The Asian character who first surfaced in The Last Jedi was the character that did not move the story forward at all. She just further dragged the story for no reason. In this film, she plays a minor, a reindeer to Leia which is a great thing.Powerful line of tracks playing out in the background. John Williams finds his true potential to give this final story an epic feeling.The Rise of Skywalker answers some of the questions the fans have been longing all year long. Rey's lineage, Luke's whereabout, Snoke's origin and etc.Cons:The plot lays out in very thin threads, the focus here is to entertain the audience with a racing game of cat-and-mouse. What's worse is it is derivative from the action/adventure video games. It plays out a like a Playstation story mode, where an avatar needs to find a missing object at a location before going onto the next level by finding another lost item before venturing into a mission that seems forever.The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is its awkward and ill-placed comedy. The Rise of Skywalker has moved on so good from Rian Johnson's cringey not-worth-it laughter. However, as the run time goes along, the out-of-place comedy resurfaces and it get worse and worse. By the final battle, it contagiously affects an awkward direction to the whole plot as well, no longer to the comedy aspect alone.Albeit answers are spoken out, some of the other questions have yet to be revealed. Rey's lightsaber, final battle, Rey's skills and etc.There are problems with the editing, the exhilarating action scenes are layered down by dreadful cinematography. The camera fails to capture focal points of scenes resulting in the death of tre cinematic experience.The Rise of Skywalker loses its grip to find the light side of previous trilogies' atmosphere which is the fundamental reason people go into the cinemas to catch this beloved franchise. The lack of the Star Wars' atmosphere makes The Rise of Skywalker an effortless attempt for one last ride.Verdict: The Rise of Skywalker proves that it is a satisfying conclusion to the third trilogy of the Star Wars Saga but that's only it, its lackadaisical effort to drive more approach to good storytelling and powerful emotional moments place this film in the midst of the light and dark sides.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst of the worst.,"A die-hard Star Wars since the age of 5, I was stupidly excited for the sequel trilogy. But that excitement and hope wained with each installment. I did not think the series could get any worse after The Last Jedi, but I was wrong. Episode IX is the worst of the numbered Star Wars films and is a blinding example of all the bad habits of story crafting and filmmaking that J. J. Abrams has offered viewers during his career.The plot is contrived and convoluted, with one fetch-quest and mystery-box McGuffin after another, culminating in a boring, unrelatable character appropriating the name and legacy of the franchise's hero, Luke Skywalker. It took me almost five years since it was released to finally sit down and watch this slog through a galaxy far, far away, and I still regret wasting my time.This film has some of the dumbest ideas ever conceived in the Star Wars universe. I thought Force-facetime was bad enough, but Force-pass-the-lightsaber is just idiotic. The creators of this film and the sequel trilogy as a whole have very little concept of the rules of the Star Wars Universe, and it shows. What we see on screen reminds me of the half-baked ideas for adventures that a six-year-old kid would devise on his bedroom floor as he played with his action figures in isolation. The Rise of Skywalker is just one stupid idea after enough that loosely ties whatever the pathetic excuse for a plot is so that characters can move from one action set-piece to the next. The fact that every McGuffin is ultimately worthless because there are some other means of accomplishing the goal without it is just lazy, and I would have hoped Abrams realized this was part of why The Last Jedi was a total failure of a film in terms of its plot, story, and character development.The Rise of Skywalker proves Disney and Katheleen Kennedy didn't have an overall story for the trilogy but instead shot from the hip and made up crap as they went on. The price they paid was killing the interest of a massive portion of the fanbase they paid millions to get access to.This film is an abysmal joke of a movie, and doubly so as a Star Wars film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Star Wars is not a religion,"Don't believe all the negative reviews.

Totally Apathetic to Your Viewership,"Have you ever wanted to experience the filmic equivalent of being along with someone you barely know while they run errands? And they don't like you particularly much, or think you are particularly intelligent, so when they do talk to you, they refuse to give you any details about anything they're doing, and only give vague, short replies that intentionally left you in the dark? Have you ever wanted to bottle the feeling of being gaslit? Have you ever wanted to feel entirely bored by a lightsaber duel? Nostalgic for the relatively frenetic and thoughtful blocking of Kenobi and Vader's awkward, but interesting '77 duel?This movie truly doesn't care whether you pay attention to it. It's because because: The Movie. Why? Because the movie said so. Over and over again. The movie never, ever reaches a raison d'etre, any scene or sequence that seems like it does more than simply exist to get to the next scene or sequence. It's a dark ride with all the lights turned on and none of the decor; it's a film that never feels like it begins as nothing ever really is indicated as being important to the audience, but nonetheless it continues forward. Yes, they really somehow made a whole film feel like introductory fluff, like the plot before the plot in a Simpsons episode, but infinitely less relatable or amusing.If everything can be swept under the rug, what am I to care about? If no one scene or sequence stands out, where is the heart or identity of your film? Your family could improvise a Star Wars film together this holiday and it would arrive a point more quickly and organically than Rise of Skywalker ever does. And it will be more entertaining, because even the most amateurish improvisers understand the universal constant that an audience doesn't watch a scene to get it over with, but because cool things, dramatic things, or funny things can happen during a scene.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The fitting end to a saga,"I'm a real fan. And I absolutely loved TROS. It's impossible not to, if you are a true fan. I've cried a lot in decisive moments in the movie. It shows the Force has more depth than we know and it really uses the expanded universe content to build on that. C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie, Leia, Lando...They are there, showing the band can play one last song before that long pause after a tour (we know, for Leia, is the last one, unfortunately). They did such an amazing job using Carrie's footage and honoring her memory. I feel this movie will mark a generation forever, as it did mine, years ago.
Haters are gonna hate. Back in my days, I didn't have the internet to write such an elaborate review and make it seen by thousands of people. If I could, I would've exalted ROTJ. A perfect ending for a perfect trilogy. But victories are never truly won in a galaxy full of wars, far, far away... As, of course, no one's ever truly gone, and that is true for both Jedi and Sith.Mind this. This movie is fun and emotional for the whole family. Fans and non fans will be able to enjoy a fast paced story that will not cling to answer all questions, but does answer all the important ones. Do remember, it took another trilogy to Lucas answer what were the Clone Wars and how the Empire was born. Again, we didn't care much about these things at that time. The main plot, a group of freedom fighters fighting against an evil Empire was all that needed to be shown and explained. I see the same beauty here, in TROS.Take your family, have fun, cry, praise, take a bow, clinch the chair and live this experience. Allow yourself to feel all the emotions this trilogy ending wanted to transmit. May the Force be with you, in whichever Galaxy far, far away you might be from.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"1/10 Reviews are hilariously childish, This films does what it needs to.","This film is JJ Abrams and all involved salvaging a historic franchise. Venting your anger at The Last Jedi by hating this movie is everything that's wrong with movie fanbases nowadays. Having a 3 part trilogy, and having someone write and direct the middle part was never going to end well. But criticism for Last Jedi is now not even relevant anymore. People need something new to hate.However, to watch this movie and give it the lowest possible rating shows that you came to watch this film with an agenda. Every nitpick, every slight flaw or plot hole, every chance to find a reason to hate this, you amplify it and make it seem like a mess, when in fact it simply isn't. It has a lot of strange choices that take the story in completely different directions (which if you remember, all criticism for The Force Awakens was that it was literally A New Hope's story, and unoriginal for the most part). Having this unpredictability leaves a constant guessing game which some fans will love, and others will want the ""Star Wars Formula"", which neither is wrong.Remember how you felt as a child leaving the cinema watching any Star Wars film, whether it be Empire Strikes Back or Attack of the Clones, or even The Last Jedi for that matter. As a child you don't care about plot holes, you don't care about the story not going how you planned it in your head, you only care about what is in front of your eyes.I personally grew up with the Prequels and by the age of 11, Revenge of the Sith came out, now my personal favourite of all the films, but when I try to watch the prequel trilogy as a whole, the first two are unwatchable at times.
If the Phantom Menace had no Duel of the Fates and Darth Maul, it would be a god-awful film, but would still be Star Wars, and everything Star Wars is about, whether you like it or not. We don't write these stories, we are either fans or we aren't, and 90% of us in this review section have loved at least 1 Star Wars film.I'm rambling now, but my point overall is, when you look back on this trilogy in 10 years time, you will certainly not hate it half as much as the internet is telling you to.Star Wars is a film that has such importance for so many families, Grandparents, Parents, Yourself, Your kids and probably their kids.
Remember what Star Wars is really about, because when it comes down to it, 1/10 star reviews and constant negativity will only be here while this film is current, but these films, and the family memories they bring with them, will live forever.When your grandson asks what Star Wars is, you've got 9 movies to show him (plus TV Shows, games, Spin off Films and more), and I can tell you this for damn sure, that child is going to absolutely love it no matter what.Ironically, the 1/10 reviews are the people acting like children, and the children watching this are going to enjoy the film like adults should. Maybe that is the ""Magic"" of Star Wars.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

You can't please everyone...,"Well, according to most comment sections, I guess I'm *almost* the only one who *actually* enjoyed it...and I hated, loathed, and utterly despised The Last Jedi. Rise of Skywalker wasn't the story that I, personally, would have told (with all of the source material that's available)----but...I legitimately enjoyed it. I'm quite surprised. It actually made The Last Jedi *semi-watchable* ----and THAT is an accomplishment (considering it used to be unwatchable garbage).I'm actually astounded by all of the chronic-hate that this movie is getting. But, having said that----I *completely* understand. The Last Jedi broke the fandom, and it *never* should have happened. Darth Kennedy should be stricken down and made to disappear.This trilogy is deeply-flawed, but I enjoyed ROSW just as much as TFA. I'm judging it for what it *is* ----- *not* for what I wish it was or what it may/should have been.I was thoroughly entertained. What can I say? I'm genuinely surprised by this. I've been reading the leaks for *months* and I had already decided to hate this movie. But, it's one thing to read *one person's description* of a film's events than it is to watch it be executed in real-time. I hated The Last Jedi to such a degree, that I actually feel guilty for liking TROS. But, it is what it is. I'm not going to lie to myself just to go with the flow of everyone else.I think that we modern people are so analytical, that if everything doesn't reflect the understanding of *the real world* -----we wholeheartedly reject it...and in the process, we lose the ability to be entertained (thus becoming a nihilistically-based bottomless pit of morbid-criticism that refuses to allow our minds to wander into the possibilities of the impossible). When we think we know everything, we lose our sense of awe and wonder, thus preventing the enjoyment contained in the suspension of disbelief. This says more about *us* than it does about the intellectual properties that we over-analyze, pick apart and cannibalize.People are so blinded by hatred (from the perpetuation of TLJ) that they lack the self awareness to realize that they're seeing TROS through the lens of their blind-rage-bias. But----- *that* is Disney's fault. I'll never project the blame on the audience. This entire trilogy is so nuanced and problematic. What a mess. Having liked TROS it's surreal seeing myself write such things. But, it is what it is. I refuse to engage in denial through the conduit of my own, personal bias.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Lots to look at,"I realized long ago that I've grown out of any deep investment in Star Wars as a franchise, so I just approach these movies as mindless entertainment, and as such have genuinely enjoyed these latest movies.
Even though I don't expect much from the plot, I actually thought TLJ made some really interesting choices. So now you have a sense of where I'm coming from.
This movie looks really, really cool. Lucas apparently funneled the entire budget for a New Hope into the effects, and here it's easy to imagine that the lion's share of time & energy went into designing the look of the worlds. And man, they hit it out of the park.
Did they sacrifice plausibility for superficial cool factor? You betcha they did, and I didn't really care, it's a space movie, not a documentary. The set pieces and some of the sequences are really beautiful and, honestly, put to better use than those in Avatar.
It's flashy, loud, brash, occasionally stupid, but a real treat for the eyes. So if you don't mind shelling out $15 to see what is essentially the fever dream of a moody but really talented set design student, this is for you.
If you're at all invested in the lore of Star Wars, you're likely to be disappointed. There are fun little nods here and there, but like people are saying, they're not super well done. But I'd absolutely watch this again just to see some of those designs.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Reviews lost in politics,"In a time where we will judge a movie and start slating purely based on a trailer that we saw 6 months ago it is hard to get a genuine reaction to a film.Take ""The rise of skywalker"" for instance. Two years ago we were treated to the marmite that was ""The last jedi"", critic adored it and fans hated it in equal measure, unfortunately I came in the latter although I found more to like on a 2nd viewing. Trolls rose out of the shadows and grownups overreacted, threw temper tantrums and declared their childhood destroyed. Two years on here we are with ""the rise of skywalker"" and once again we are in the marmite phase only this time its the critics who are getting angry.Is the film perfect? Not by a long shot. The first 30 minutes feels rushed as we race fro maguffin to maguffin but there is a point where the film levels out and I finally found myself unclenching and enjoying the film.I really enjoyed ""the force awakens"" and hoped for a similar feel. Unfortunately it felt like JJ had a lot of boxes to tick however with the detour and scrapping of future plot point courtesy of Rian Johnson, and the tragic passing of Carrie Fisher, JJ has been handed ball of wool that he needs to untangle and all things considered he does a pretty good job.I would have loved it had he been a bit braver in relation to certain characters surviving/dying. Some of the new characters are instantly forgettable but that's more of an issue with them being underwritten and I feel like a few missteps were taken with ""the force"" but I guess they can do what they like, they're writing it, it's up to me to get on board.Is this a 1/10 defiantly not, those who rank it so are your trolls, is it a 10/10, no it is not.

An entertaining Star Wars flick but disappoints to conclude the beloved franchise,"Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, a film that supposedly concludes the beloved Star Wars franchise that made millions of fans fall in love with movies and became a series that redefined the level of Sci-Fi for future films yet to come. The first Star Wars film, A New Hope, was released back in 1977 and blew away audiences with Sci-Fi explosive entertainment that intrigued audiences by giving the viewer a new experience in a galaxy far far away.Now we are in 2020, and Star Wars continues to blow us away with dazzling special effects, breathtaking cinematography and beautiful matched music. And Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker has plenty of these elements to offer up to you. But... that's about it.Unfortunately, because of the legacy the original trilogy left us, director J.J. Abrams and Disney had a lot of expectations when it came to finally distributing the newest trilogy for long devoted fans and cinema lovers to view. And while The Force Awakens, 2015, brought Star Wars back into the light of day after a decade of waiting with a stunning new cast and evenly paced plot, the same cannot be said about the disappointing Last Jedi and the recent Rise of Skywalker.Disney's latest film felt like two movies pulled into one; whether that came from the rushed plot, undeveloped characters and uneven storyline, it can be said that this film suffered from a serious lack of creation. Every scene was forced into the next without letting the viewer indulged the events of the previous sequence. Then following would be a series of short action sequences involving star cruisers, blasters, one liners and flying Stormtroopers! yes, you heard me right; they fly now! It's not that all the action here is a bad thing. In fact, I found it quite enjoyable. I was entertained the entire time, but I never jumped out of my seat with delight. That's the main problem this films has, a lack of dramatic tension. There weren't any moments that made me cling to my seat in anticipation nor was there a time I felt any adrenaline rushing though my mind. I can't say I was ever bored but I also cannot say I was every sucked in. There were a few small scenes that definitely surprised me, such as one involving Rey searching inside an abandoned part of the original Death Star, but besides some key scenes there was no adrenaline rush that Star Wars films usually accompany us with. In all, it felt like something that wasn't meant to conclude something but rather just provide us with eye candy and basic action scenes, something we've all seen before.Now for the million dollar question; how does this film conclude Star Wars? Well, you might be able to guess by the title that Rise of Skywalker concluded everything with a thud. But I don't entirely blame the film. Because of the divisive response to The last Jedi, Disney tried to wrap everything up as if that film never happened, which is why this film felt so rushed and empty. One might call it a mad dash to the finish line. And while that's not entirely a bad thing, because we all know it's going to make a ton of money, fans of Star Wars will most likely be annoyed with the conclusion and critics will at most feel somewhat fulfilled if not completely satisfied. With that being said. it can be concluding here that while Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker had a few enjoyable moments, the films adds nothing new to the genre and on it's own stands as an average inclusion to the world of Star Wars",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Better than Last Jedi, but not by much","So Rise of Skywalker isn't as bad as others would say. When I saw it the first time, I didn't have high expectations for it whatsoever, but a little part in me had some hope it would be better than the Last Jedi.The main issues in ROS were the dialogue and plot, which are the most important components of film, but I believe that in this film, they weren't tremendously awful. For instance, there were a good amount of predictability throughout the majority of the plot that raised a few questions. There were portions of dialogue were it seemed like the characters forced themselves to say.However, there are so many more positives that can be addressed regarding the film. The special effects and cinematography were perhaps the best I've ever seen within the Star Wars films. The best thing that came out of ROS is most definitely the nostalgia.

"4 billion spend on the rights, apparently nothing left for a good scriptwriter","There are two major things that make that movie as horrible as it is. One is structural and the other seems to be part of the current Zeitgeist. Let's start with that.This movie exactly like the Marvel movies will repeatedly tell you: DON'T TAKE THIS SERIOUS! How? By putting in silly jokes when ever they feel like it and especially in scenes that should actually have depth and seriousness to it. I thought the silliness in part 8 was a Rian Johnson thing but Abrams is no better. And it is so ironic that the movie in the rare moments where it is actually serious is good. There will be a point I would say the at beginning of the last third where you will feel that. We finally get a few meaningful scenes in a row that you can actually get emotionally invested in. But it is far far to little. Whenever Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver get scenes together, they are good. Which is due to the fact that they are the only real characters. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are good actors but they get absolutely nothing to work with. And you can see that Boyega is bored out of his mind with his flat character and Isac just getting bad lines where he either jokes or points out things that are obvious for the viewer anyway.Second problem is the script. It blows my mind how you spend that money on the rights and millions and millions on the production and actors but when it comes to the story you don't hire a really good scriptwriter. The story of the previous two movies where not good either but they were way more coherent than this one. Disney makes stuff up just as they want to. Telling you you have to believe it just because they say so. There are plot wholes as big as the death star in here. Nothing makes sense, they drop stuff that was established, bring up new stuff that makes no sense, don't tie up loose ends. This is a screenwriting mess.I wanna end on a positive note. It is a good looking movie especially when it comes to looking epic and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are good and have good chemistry together.

"TFA fans will enjoy it, TLJ fans most likely not","Fair enough, the latest Star Wars trilogy will not be awarded for it's originality. This movie is no exception. That said, I enjoyed the Rise of Skywalker a lot. Like the Force Awakens it has the feeling of the old Star Wars movies. Something that the Last Jedi had not. JJ Abrahams also stayed true to the legacy or myth of the original characters. Ryan Johnson chose a different path, which divided the fan base. JJ Abrahams returns to, what he started with, the Force Awakens and this movie is more of a sequel to that one as it is to the Last Jedi. In fact, this movie kind of dismisses a lot of the stuff that was told and shown in the Last Jedi.Because of this I think the fans of TFA will enjoy this (a lot). Fans of TLJ will be disappointed that Rian Johnson's movie is somewhat denied in this sequel and will feel that this movie is just a rehash of the old movies.Either way, the movie doesn't have the most brilliant storyline, but it gives closure in a way that, at least I, was hoping for. It's an emotional goodbye to a universe that I followed for over 40 years.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

GO WATCH IT! IT'S WORTH IT.,"I just got back from the cinema where I saw a Star Wars marathon, the Skywalker trilogy. I have to say that I didn't have low or high expectations, I saw a mix of reviews (more positive than negative but not relevant); and the truth is that it is one of the best films I saw in 2019. The special effects, sound mixing, sound editing, and the score are what shine most in the movie!, the cinematography and production design were also spectacular. I saw a mix of Harry Potter and a little Endgame but executed brilliantly. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are some of the best in cinema today and their performances are brilliant. Carrie Fisher (RIP) and other cameos did well too.What I can't understand is because there are so many disappointed fans (and some without seeing the movie), it's a good end to this stage and the Skywalker trilogy. Highly recommended for everyone and I recommend seeing it in 3D, it's worth it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's Star Wars, Let's Talk About It","Honestly taking into account all that lead up to this film, it actually ended relatively well.George Lucas at least had a plan in place for where he wanted the story to go. Disney in their infinite wisdom threw that to the side and that resulted in the trilogy being what it was. The first was decent, a bit fan servicey but hey, that's fine. The second was devisive for many but I was fine with it, though it did have its flaws.That brings us to Rise of Skywalker. Yes, for me the movie had some flaws in the story and such, but I thought it wrapped the trilogy nicely. Threads were pulled together in effective ways while other elements seemed somewhat forced and somethings just go nowhere.Overall I was satisfied with this conclusion, but one definitely has to keep in mind that these movies are more a product not so much a passion project as they used to be. There's a lot of anger and vitriol within the Star Wars community, just remember that it's only a movie. And it's pretty good.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The ocean planet with the huge, roiling seas heaving to and fro was pretty cool. Haven't see that before! Nice job, special effects people! Here are two stars out of ten for you.As for the rest, well it was ruined long before now by a total lack of anything resembling planning. Deciding to make Rey the granddaughter of Palpatine is a big shrug and also has the icky effect of making us think about Palps having sex. Thank you for that mental image, Disney.Speaking of sexy scenes we never wanted: Rey and Kylo kiss? The writers never did figure out what their relationship was, did they? Was it sexual, sibling-like, or what? They never decided and just blundered through it, inadvertently making it queasier than necessary than if they'd just decided and went for it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ever wanted to just have the worst experience ever? Go watch this.,"Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker is the definition of cruelty. Never before have I felt the need to just leave the theatre because I couldn't take it anymore. After Rian Johnson's Episode 8: The Last Jedi, which was a horrible movie too, I had better expectations since Episode 9 would again be directed by J. J. Abrams, who also made Episode 7: The Force Awakens, which wasn't too bad. But I was disappointed in the extreme. The script is so bad that Ed Wood would turn in his grave. Palpatine's return was a lousy marketing attempt that was never really thought through and only exists to attract a large audience and make a lot of money. Rey is also incredibly poorly written as a main character. All in all, the film doesn't seem to have been thought through properly at all and you can see how little J. J. Abrams really knows about Star Wars. Rose Tico is probably the worst character ever to appear in a film. The Rise of Skywalker is the end of a nine-part film series that has been unable to recover from a steady decline since 1983 (with the exception of Episode 3, which is better than the other prequel and sequel films) and received its coup de grace with Episode 9.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This movie was clearly convoluted with a plot made from elements of a patchwork of what was left over from TLJ. Palpatine was brought in because Kylo REN was not a good enough villain to carry us though the movie. A lot of things just went unexplained, but the pacing doesn't really give you time to think about that. It was fantastic getting Mr Billy D Williams back. Shoulda been there from day 1. There are elements from this film, like the bonds formed between the new trio of Finn, Rey and Poe that should have been there in TLJ. It all came together in this film. Background characters stayed in their lane. Leia was treated as she should have been... Royalty. It was as if she was really in the film. The new guy who played Chewbacca may be up for an Oscar. Not kidding about that. Threepio and R2 were brought back into the fold and not just cast aside in favor of the newer droids on the team. This movie worked and is a more fitting sequel to TFA than TLJ was. 7/10 stars. There were a few things I didn't like, but that would be spoilers. Overall, Great Job JJ.

Before I saw the film I thought it sounded strange bringing Palpatine back but it worked out just fine! The trilogy could have been better but as an effort by JJ, the crew and actors I have to give them praise for what they did. J.J should have done all three movies! The last Jedi destryed so much in the universe of Star Wars and that blame is on K. Kennedy, not on the actors or the crew! They should have followed the rules George Lucas had set up for the universe! I really liked the new forcepowers in the rise of Skywalker! They were explained but so few noticed.

Good closure but will divide viewers (no spoilers),"I watched clips from all previous movies before going to the theater. I am glad I did because Rise offers many moments of nostalgia and tries its best to close out 42 years of story telling. Did it accomplish this mighty task? I think mostly yes, but this will be subjective and open to much debate. Star Wars fandom is clearly divided ( as to be expected) based on reviews I've read and rightly so. Even if you are not a big Star Wars fan you cannot ignore it's impact on pop culture.Without getting into specifics I really enjoyed the relationship between Rey and Ren that continued to develop from The Last Jedi. Also, the movie moves at a fierce pace from the beginning (almost too fast) with a sense of urgency to 'get into it'. This was not a surprise considering how much this movie needed to accomplish.I usually only stick with watching the trailers and let the movie unwind the plot. This time I read spoilers/theories over the past year but stopped the week of the movie release. I am glad I took this approach because it was fun to see just how much all of the blogs got right and wrong. In the end about 60% of what I thought would happen did which was fine with with me.Be sure to see this movie in a theater with the best possible sound and picture.

The truth of the film,"I'm giving it a ten just to offset the haters. It does deserve an 8 or above. I think it's really difficult to please Star Wars fans. I see some people complaining about this film online. But honestly, they would complain about whatever was put on the screen. Taking something that started 42 years ago and has had an enormous impact on the lives of many people, including myself, is a huge undertaking. You strive to please the 50 something year old fan while trying to make it entertaining to an 8 year old. Add to this the complexity of the story and it's characters and... I think a mistake was made by having someone different create the second movie in this series. The same person (JJ Abrams) should have had creative control for all three films. This creates an additional problem with continuity. And the fact that Leia (Carrie Fisher) was to have a major part in this movie, but unfortunately passed away before production ever started, this creates a game changer. So it seems like everything was stacked against them. Was it perfect, no. There were a few things I would have changed, but overall the story worked. It can be an emotional roller coaster at times. One particular event silenced the sold out theater. But... I'll just let that there. Am I satisfied with what I saw, yes. I really think I need to see it again as our seats were horrible.

"First Hit: In the end, it was satisfying and that's all that mattered.","First Hit: In the end, it was satisfying and that's all that mattered.I was one of those guys standing in line the first day that the original ""Star Wars"" film, later subtitled ""Episode IV - A New Hope,"" was released (1977). The moment the words ""Star Wars"" came on the screen, followed by the storyline scrolling up and fading into deep space, and lastly, the cruiser coming in overhead, I was hooked.I liked some of the subsequent films. The prequels were a mixed bag, as were the sequels. Yesterday the final movie, number nine, was viewed, and I was happy I saw the ending to the film that started it all some forty-two years ago.This film brought in many of the old characters in different scenes signaling this saga of stories' conclusion. Most of these scenes worked well, but some did not.The highlights included how they intertwined Leia's (Carrie Fisher) stored archival footage quite effectively into this story. Because of Fisher's passing, she had a more significant part than I would have imagined. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), was terrific and became the Jedi teacher, just like his teacher Obi-Wan, was to him. Luke gave Rey (Daisy Ridley) her final lessons to become a true Jedi Knight and with that lesson, the sword (OK, lightsaber) was passed to her.Her rival and representing the dark side, as Darth Vader once did to Luke, was a continuation of the previous film and well played by Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. The story also included small scenes with Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who once owned the Millennium Falcon before he lost it in a poker match to Hans Solo (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick Chewbacca.However, it was Harrison Ford's addition that didn't work as well. His talk with Kylo seemed odd because of his casual GQ casual attire look didn't seem to fit the Hans of the past. Despite this, I appreciated the closure these additions provided.The goal of this story was the defeat of the dark side still headed up by Emperor Palpatine. Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who was secretly managing the demise of the Resistance with the rest of the Siths from their planet Exegol. One of the twists isn't their always twists in a Star Wars film, was that Rey was Palpatine's granddaughter. Palpatine was hoping to turn Rey to the dark side and together with Kylo, they would rule the universe and everything in it.Heading up the Resistance's battle against the dark side was Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who had inherited the Millennium Falcon and Chewbacca after Hans death in the previous story. Together they pulled all the outliers of the resistance to do one final battle against the dark side.The scenes were well done, and the photography and special effects were A-1. The first 2/3rds of the film was a mishmash of battles and strategy sessions attempting to set up the final 1/3rd. The last section built up in a predictable yet effective way.We know who's going to win this battle of light and dark, but there was enough there to make one wonder along the way. It's enough to keep you in your seat when the full-screen cinematography throws up images that touch your joy, curiosity, and memories of days gone by.Ridley is strong in this role. I never warmed up to her in the previous film, but as this film moved along, I started to accept her as the Jedi Knight savior and leader of the Resistance. Driver was excellent as Kylo. He had immediately picked up where Vader left off and even with his helmet off, Kylo's face scar says it all. Isaac isn't Ford. And to create a new captain of the Falcon is a significant role to jump into. Ford had his way, and eventually, I bought into Isaac's version of the Millennium Falcon's captain. Boyega's part was good but his overall role seemed to be minor in the scope of things. Williams was okay as Lando, and there was one scene that his charm was at the level it was when we were first introduced to him. Ford's role seemed just a bit out of place and almost like an add-on. Hamill's character was well done and I liked the inclusion. Chris Terrio and J.J. Abrams wrote a satisfying finale to this nine-film saga. J.J. Abrams also directed this effort and was able to put a final period at the end of this well-intentioned set of stories.Overall: I'm more glad than sad that this series of stories is over because at least it ended strong.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A NEW HOPE!,"THE DEAD SPEAK! What first began as a whisper of few has now become a deafening roar of many. Fueled by hatred. Corrupted by a hive-mind mentality. Fully withered and consumed by the dark side. I refer not to the glorious return of Ian McDiarmid's delightfully evil EMPEROR PALPATINE, nor the out-of-nowhere, massive fleet he commands and dubs the LAST ORDER. Not of SUPREME LEADER KYLO REN or his FIRST ORDER, who are so close to victory they can taste it in the opening of this movie. I unfortunately am referring to you and I, dear readers.
We, the STAR WARS mega-fans of old. We who have spent the past few years enraged at what they have done to our beloved franchise. While it is a beautiful thing to be passionate about what you love, let us not forget the warning of our little green master - ""Anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.""
Remember, in Anakin's desperate mission to preserve what he loved most, he destroyed it and became a monster.
In the weeks leading up to release, I realized that for every aging super-nerd naysayer, there is a youngling out there who is ecstatic to see newcomers such as John Boyega's FINN in these new-era adventures. While maybe not tailor-made to suit you, the force is as strong as ever with the STAR WARS franchise, and I personally find your lack of faith disturbing.
Like many though, I too had a bad feeling about this. However, I am relieved to say, I loved this movie! This is not just a STAR WARS fix, you get an overdose here. From the moment the opening crawl concludes, it reels you in and proceeds to barrage your mind, eyes and ears in an attempt to end the saga with a bang.
A beautiful score, as is the case with it's predecessors. Visually pleasing on an epic scale. The focus is pulled closer to our central characters, which gives more time for them to be fleshed out.
As opposed to 2017's LAST JEDI, this time around the few new characters are handled with an effective less-is-more approach. There are cameos a-plenty, which are sure to tug on your heart-strings. New force powers are explored, serving to expand the mythos. Last but not least, the action knob is turned to 11 and broken off. Lightsaber battles, anyone? Some scenes have very obviously been inserted by J.J. Abrams as deliberate fan-service.
Unfortunately, it is quite a bit further than a kessel-run from being a perfect film. It is plagued by an abundance of plot-holes. New plot-holes are created as they try to patch old ones from previous installments. Lore is blatantly ignored and will leave hardcore fans scratching their heads. While the grand scale of the film delivers an epic finale, from the other side of the coin it can be considered downright ridiculous at times.
However, if you are willing to temper your expectations, return to orbit, and remember that this is fiction made for the sole purpose of entertainment, this movie is a blast. As someone who spent the last two films less than interested in our new heroes and villains, I was left wanting more of them here. Adam Driver steals the show and delivers a very emotional performance. While some points must be force-pushed off the final score, for me it is still a 7/10

Where to begin....,"You walk away with more unanswered questions than you had from the start. I think part of the film's failure is largely based on Carrie Fisher's death, as she was supposed to play a larger role. As a result, the pacing of the whole film is off. That being said, the writers abused the characters they had. We never really get to know the three leads, let alone seem them interact. You know less about Finn than in the beginning. The only redeeming character is Kylo Ren (mostly attributed to Adam Driver's acting, which outshines everyone else). Stop adding side characters that you'll just throw away - it makes it confusing and one-dimensional. Like Rose? What on purpose did she serve? Or Poe's mask-wearing friend? No one even knows her name. Or Finn's new friend with curly hair - again not memorable if I can't tell you her name. This movie just felt like a bad fan fiction in so many ways. Also Palpatine really? It's like Disney thought their audiences were really that dumb. It was the worst villain comeback of all time and still never addressed any of the big issues. Like how did he go undetected so long? What exactly happened to the knights of Ren? Eugh - this whole movie puts such a bad taste in my mouth.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Has some good qualities,"The people who have rated this film really low like a 1/10 or a 2/10 expected this film to be the best film of the year, ending the biggest saga in the world with a strong plot and acting like endgame.

Movie by committee.,"This isn't George Lucas vision of Star Wars. Neither is it some talented and visionary directors vision of Star Wars. This isn't even a high budgeted and dedicated fan movie. This is basically just a movie made by a committee - a movie made by a corporation, trying to pander and please as many demographics as possible. Like; we need to have 50% men and 50% women in the movie - we need to have 25% Asians, 25% Africans, 25% Hispanics and 25% Caucasians (who of course mostly should be evil). There needs to be 27% action, 23% humor, 15% suspense, 18% romance, 19% nostalgia etc. We need to get the old fans back, and we need to lure new and young ones in. We need to introduce a certain amount of new cute and cool creatures, characters, weapons and vehicles that can be sold as toys and put on merchandise.That's how I felt when I saw it. Like I was watching the worlds longest and most expensive calculated demographic pander. Not that J. J. Abrams is the most original, deep or visionary director to begin with, he's all ways been a corporate tool, most of his movies basically just feel like empty copy-pasted franchise-related fluff, but with this one, it really felt like he also had a bunch of corporate overlords telling him what to do, how many boxes he had to check and how many demographics he had to please while making the movie.When I heard there was going to be a new trilogy, I was so exited to see my old childhood heroes again. But these movies quickly turned out not to really be about Luke, Han, Leia or the others, they were quickly pushed in the background, their characters changed to fit the narrative, before they were killed one off one by one right from the first movie. We never even got to see them reunited alive on the screen together again, and we were instead told to focus on the the new cast from Captain Planet and the Planeteers.And the new band of heroes just doesn't have the same charm, personalities or chemistry together (actually this is the first movie in the new trilogy, where they do stuff together). They more feel like they have been cast for a United Colors of Benetton commercial, on behalf of their skins-color and sex, more than what type of character and personality they had to portray - they are all just so empty, like cardboard-cutouts with calculated screen-time and one-dimensional personalities. Most of them, hardly even have an arc or any real character-development over the course of 3 movies.And the same goes for the new movie itself. The action is bland, nothing we haven't seen a 100 times before. Often way better and more impressive in other modern movies. Sure it's state of the art, but some of the CGI actually looks rather rushed and unfinished, considering the budget behind this movie, while at other times, there's just too much going on at the screen at once, for you to get involved, focus or care.
And the action often doesn't serve a purpose to the story - it's just more timely inserted space-battles, chase-scenes and sci-fi fights. Mostly just overblown shiny CGI stuff, with a few practical puppets, sets and costumes thrown in to pander to the old fans.The humor feel as forced and artificial as in the first two new movies, more like the humor you would see in something like Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor Ragnarok, than in Star Wars. Sure the original Star Wars movies also had some humor, but they were never perceived as comedies - in those movies, the funny moments felt natural, like when normal people in the real world make jokes and snappy remarks among each other, or are thrown into unexpected situations together. Not these wink-wink-moments, slapstick humor and juvenile self aware meme-jokes. At times I almost expected Rey to just start using her unignited lightsaber as a microphone and start to rap or Finn to go; ""Palpatine please"".
What's worse, is that this movie also tries to be dark at the same time, but this isn't Empire Strikes Back or Revenge of the Sith, those movies really were dark chapters in the Star Wars saga, with hardly any humor in them, but in The Rise of Skywalker, it just makes the movie feel even more like a tonal mess, since the movie also tries to be funny, upbeat and happy at the same, making both the humor, the drama and the darker elements feel even more forced and out of place.Without going into spoiler territory, I can tell you this; if you felt that The Force Awakens and Especially The Last Jedi did more damage to the existing Star Wars characters and lore, more than it helped expand it, then you will hate this movie.
Not that there's really much to spoil anyway - the shallow Rey and her generic friends, just follow the markings of some convenient new space dagger, which takes them across a bunch of random locations, that leads to some pointless exposition and bland action sequences. Most of these sequences, feel like they could have been put in at any random order, like they were planed and filmed before the story, while most of the story just feel like an excuse to go to try and fill out two hours of more Star Wars - not like this epic, fulfilling and long awaited conclusion to some of the the most important movies in modern pop culture.
Or to quote the actor of C3PO Antonio Daniels; ""We've waited 40 years for THIS?""
Basically, this movie and the new trilogy as a whole, just ruin more for the original saga, than it expands or concludes.And the way they bring back Emperor Palatine is beyond stupid, not to mention his motives and plans, that hardly makes any logical sense. Sure, it's great to see Ian McDiarmid back as Palpatine, though it's basically only like an expanded cameo - but by bringing him back, this movie basically destroys the whole overarching plot of the first 6 movies - with Anakin being the chosen one, fulfilling the prophecy of bringing balance to the force, by helping Palpatine whipping out the Jedi, and then destroying Palpatine and his empire.
Bringing Back Palpatine felt more like a desperate act from Disney and the producers, to have a major beloved villain back and lure in more old fans, but when they did so, they basically made the plot and the epic story of all the first 6 movies pointless, all 9 movies are basically just a weird mess now story-wise.Actually most of this movie, feels like a jumbled mess, that seem to have gone through countless script-changes, multiple edits and re-shoots. It almost felt like they came up with most of it, as they went along. Often it seems like entire scenes are missing, and we are left without crucial information and explanation. So many questions sat up in both episode VII and VIII are still left unanswered, while this movie still creates more questions and leaves you scratching your head. While also completely disregarding or changing a lot of the lore and ""rules"" of the Star Wars universe - the force and its powers seem to be more or less random now, and its wielders can more or less do anything when it fits the plot.
Supposedly Disney also went ahead and started to produce these films, before they even had an entire story planed out for all 3 movies, even though George Lucas all ready had a scripted idea for a new trilogy, that they discarded, to instead go along with something more ""safe"", that they hadn't even planned out first.
If you want to create a trilogy of movies, perhaps, you should have an overall story you wish to tell, before you wish to make a trilogy.
Instead of making it up as you go along from movie to movie - and in this episodes case, scene to scene.
Just an idea...Though I guess calling your own long time fans out as trolls, Russian bots, racists, homophobes, misogynists and basement dwelling man-babies, just because they voice their disappointment and general critique towards the movies, isn't the best way to strengthen your brand either...So even if you're a huge Star Wars fan, should go and support this movie?
The short answer is no. This is movie-making without soul, without love, and without the desire to tell a story. Without passion.
This is corporate entertainment at its worst. Everything seems calculated. This is only made to sell more plastic and to desperately still keep a major franchise relevant, even though it is clearly loosing its momentum.Maybe we did finally get to see what happened after Return of the Jedi, but the way this trilogy ended out, I would actually have preferred, that they never made these movies - since they just make all the all the battles and sacrifices from the first 6 movies feel pointless now.
If you really are a fan of Star Wars, or movies as an art-form in general, then you shouldn't support this shallow nothingness with your money.

"I'm 47 and a woman. So, not your typical reviewer.","The issue with IMBD is the following: us in the older generations will read the review but rarely write them. It's usually the 20 something or younger writing them. I saw New Hope when I was seven, and I've been a fan of Star Wars ever since. So, my review is geared toward those from my generation who watched the series in order.I agree with the other reviews that this episode is MUCH better than the most recent two. However, I will also say it is the best behind the original three that has been made. As far as I'm concerned, the original three and this one is all anybody need watch. I believe it is that good and, the movie does a good job tying all the new and old together. I did not once look to see the time, and I was extremely satisfied with the story.

Un-fun and rather unnecessary.,"I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for ""The Rise of Skywalker"", as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it.I won't recount the plot here...mostly because the film was non-stop and most plot elements lasted mere minutes. The folks went from one deadly fight to another to another to another...and much of the first portion of the film turned out to be unnecessary.I am NOT a 'Comicbook Guy' who complains that the film isn't true to the original three or other such nonsense. I have gone to all the films and enjoyed them (with the exception of ""Episode 3""...but few enjoyed that movie)...and I really enjoyed some of the more recent ones. But I disliked much of ""Episode IX"" because it seems like J.J. Abrams is trying to undo so much of what Rian Johnson did in ""Episode VIII"". Sad...but I liked ""Episode VIII"". Instead of relationships and characters, ""Episode IX"" is pretty much only about explosions, near misses and more explosions....as well as long dead characters suddenly coming back to life for no good reason.All in all, a joyless mass of explosions and a film I should have just skipped. The theater also was showing ""Knives Out"" (By Johnson) and that film was FUN. ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" is simply un-fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Uneven but entertaining.,"'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker (2019)' is a bit of a mess, with an uneven pace and a contrived plot. However, its peaks provide more enjoyment than any 'Star Wars' story since 1983 and its valleys only just caress the quality of the best scenes in the 'Prequel' series. The movie doesn't get good, generally, until its latter half. It features some truly cringe-worthy dialogue and a lot - and I mean a lot - of heavy-handed exposition. It just doesn't trust its audience, reminding them of every last detail and implied motive from its two predecessors. Even then, it doesn't really pick up the baton from either of those pictures. Instead, it rushes its opening moments to quickly establish a new status quo at the cost of any real franchise cohesion. Bringing Palpatine back is clearly a complete last-minute attempt to ensure discontent fans still buy a ticket, feeling forced and kind of a cop-out. I mean, if the intention has always been to have Palpatine pulling the strings, he would've been in 'The Force Awakens (2015)' in some capacity. It seems that the entire thing is being made-up on the spot, written not to complete a pre-planned trilogy but to please even the most anti-'The Last Jedi (2017)' fans. Why is it catering to fans who simply aren't there? Fan-service is all well and good until it starts to feel obligatory and distracting. That certainly happens here, with as much of the stuff stuffed in as possible. As I mentioned earlier, though, the affair does have its moments. The third act is pretty great, once you accept the contrivances that lead up to it. It, along with a handful of earlier sequences, is engaging, entertaining and emotionally resonant. It also includes some minor subversion that prevents it from feeling totally stale, even though it is certainly predictable. It's a satisfying end to an unnecessary trilogy, but it doesn't come close to being as good as the actual ending we already have. The best parts of the entire piece revolve around Kylo Ren and his long-awaited, tumultuous arc. Rey's scenes, which are usually intrinsically tied to Kylo's, are a close second, giving us a glimpse at the more nuanced and affecting film we could've had if Lucasfilm hadn't been forced into damage-control mode. Sadly, they aren't given as much time as they really need. I mean, there's no casino sequence or anything like that, but the plot just continues to pull you away from its most interesting elements. It's unfortunate, as there does seem to be a really good film hidden somewhere in here. The end result is a mixed bag. Whereas 'The Last Jedi (2017)' had decent ideas executed uninterestingly, this has uninteresting ideas executed decently. As I said before, it's more enjoyable than any of its post-'Return Of The Jedi (1983)' peers. It isn't great but it isn't bad, either. It's pretty good, on the whole. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Satisfying Conclusion Against the Odds,"After the train wreck that was TLJ, JJ Abrams was left to pick up the pieces and plot threads / characters that Rian Johnson seemed to have no interest in developing. Could Abrams give this trilogy a satisfying conclusion in light of Johnson's seeming intent to disrespect and disregard all that had gone before with his film? Well, for the most part the answer (somewhat against the odds) is yes. Elements of TLJ that annoyed / enraged some long time Star Wars fans (myself included) are addressed / countered to give at least some context to some of the previous film's most baffling plot choices. How Mark Hamill must have loved delivering the line about a jedi 'respecting their weapon' in light of his (and many fans) disappointment at the treatment of Luke in the previous film! Sure, the plot seems somewhat cobbled together and re-treads familiar themes / plotlines from previous entries, but Abrams keeps the pace up to make this seem almost (?) irrelevant. As with The Force Awakens, this actually FEELS like a Star Wars movie. Some might call it 'fan service', but I prefer to look at it as understanding your audience and their expectations. So while the sequel trilogy never reached the heights of the original trilogy (how could it?) and at times during TLJ seemed to sink to the depths of the worst of the prequels, this final film is a solid enough entry to see the Skywalker Saga out, if not in style then at least in respectability.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm Sorry Most of You Did Not Like the Sequels,"I saw The Rise of Skywalker December 19th at one of the late night showings. I purposefully did not read any prior leaks or reviews of the movie as I did not want to be biased to spoiled before going in. I did not read any theories and tried not to make any of my own. My friend whose Star Wars knowledge can be summed up in a question he asked me during the film ""Is that Luke Skywalker?"" when Han Solo appeared. Me, being an avid fan of the series who grew up with the Prequels, Battlefront 1 and 2, LEGO Star Wars, and Rogue Squadron, along with reading countless canon and legend books/comics before Disney purchased Lucasfilm, I came in wanting the best for the Original Trilogy and the storyline of Anakin, Luke, and Leía Skywalker. I can genuinely and whole-hearted say J.J. Abrams did the absolute best he, or anyone else for that matter, could in concluding the Skywalker saga and the three trilogies. I loved the film, plain and simple. Was it perfect? Of course not, no film is, even Empire Strikes Back (my favorite movie of all time). But what I can say is that I enjoyed so much more of this film than I disliked, only having a few minor critiques that don't involve the story at all, just better portraying scenes and events better. I've read the critics and other reviewers negative feelings of the film and I honestly am sorry for them. I'm not mad or frustrated, simply disappointed they cannot stop complaining and enjoy something that deserves to be celebrated. I encourage everyone to not let others opinions of the film to diminish their own feelings of the film before and after seeing it for themselves. Critics, predictions, expectations, and theories, in my opinion, are the true tragedy of the Sequels not the films themselves. The Rise of Skywalker will be one of my favorite all-time films, maybe even surpassing Empire Strikes Back after more time. In summary, I loved The Rise of Skywalker and encourage everyone to let go of their preconceived biases before and after seeing it for themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Appreciate it for what it is,"Hard-core fans need to settle down and appreciate this series in its entirety for what it is. Even the originals had plot holes. Star Wars, for me, has always been about expansive world-building which each one, even the prequels, managed.

Fantastic,"I purchased tickets to see this not long after they went on sale. I was so excited. Then I read reviews and people saying how bad it was, I was so worried. Then I went to the cinema and I tell you, it so far the best one to date. The story line was brilliant, the acting was brilliant, the twisters was brilliant and the ending fantastic. I wasn't disappointed one bit. How they kept Carrie Fishers character alive in the film was wonderful, a great ending to a character that I've watched since I was a little girl. Who I wanted to be. I've never felt so much tension and excitement in a Star Wars film until now. Wonderful new characters and ending of a few.
I will certainly watch it again. Maybe not in 3D this time though. Well done in such a fantastic way to finish a well loved franchise. Would love to see more, but they said that they were only going to do nine and they've done nine. The only thing I wish they had revealed was who was Finns real family and how he became a Stormtrooper. But that is the only negative I will say in this.

A satisfactory ending to the saga,"I see people complaining about how bad this movie is and most of them probably haven't even seen it.

I wasn't expecting anything when I went to see it. I just had a ""I'm gonna watch it 'cause I have to"" mentality, but turns out I really enjoyed it. Of course this movie isn't perfect, but generally speaking, it is a good Star Wars film that's better than many other Star Wars movies that have been done in the past and it really does a good job developing these new characters to the point that you can feel connected to them in a way you couldn't in the first two films of the trilogy. I guess the best thing I can recommend you is to just go see it and have your own opinion. Don't take my word for it and certainly don't take the word of anyone who says this is a 1/10 for it.

The weakest film of the Star Wars series.,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (also known as Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker) is an epic space opera film directed by J. J. Abrams. The film stars an ensemble cast includes Late Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams.The revival of Emperor Palpatine resurrects the battle between the Resistance and the First Order while the Jedi's legendary conflict with the Sith Lord comes to a head.Probably the most weakest and disappointing film of the entire star wars saga which may have disappointed many star wars fans including me as none of us was expecting the trilogy to end like this. It seems that the makers was more keen to make easy money and hence wasn't ready or keen to invest in preparing some decent storyline for the film.The acting in the film is average to decent as it seems that none of the character were too keen to do hard-work and just wanted to play it simple.The VFX, cinematography and BGM are probably the strongest point of the film.Overall a half-cooked and half-developed disappointing film.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not a good story, not good science fiction","Okay, let's review the evidence you have after you see a good movie.1) You know every character by name. You can relate to at least one of the characters.
2) You can remember some real cool dialog, whether it is funny or dramatic or meaningful.
3) You suspend your disbelief. This is especially important for science fiction. Although sci-fi is fantasy it should at least put boundaries on its physics so that even though characters have super human abilities there are still ""reasonable"" limits on them. If only a 4 year old can suspend their disbelief for 2 hours then something is wrong.
4) Some sort of classic story telling pattern is used. There is a well defined conflict along with information that tells you the context of what is happening. You should know how each character gives meaning to the story. The story should have some build up toward a climax and then a meaningful conclusion.
5) You feel that the use of emotion in the movie fits the story. In other words, the music isn't super dramatic for someone brushing their teeth. The music and the story fit together, and you do not feel like you are being manipulated to feel things that the story does not deserve to invoke.
6) The movie is well paced. It does not jump from scene to scene like some crazy video game, and it is also not too slow. There is action where is make sense and quiet moments where thought and planning happen. Why is the necessary? Because this is how real life is, and in order for a movie to feel real the pacing has to be realistic. Furthermore, too fast of pacing is even worse then too slow because it puts the viewer to sleep with a barrage of information that causes the viewer to shut down mentally.
7) The movie can stand on its own. If this was the only movie that a viewer has seen from this story line then it should still be good. The movie shouldn't be trying to pull all its meaning from previous episodes. This would violate the formula of good story telling.
8) The movie has original content, thoughts, ideas. Sometimes cleverness alone warrants making a movie. Everyone wants something fresh, even if it's an extrapolation of previous ideas.This episode of Star Wars failed all of these criteria.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

With the exception of a few light sabers thrown in, nothing here has anything to do with the original and creative George Lucas' Star Wars saga. Abrams certainly knows how to waste a lot of people's money and time. A shameful ignoble end to what was a phenomenal franchise.

Utter garbage and entirely unfit to be in the franchise,"Years after watching this movie, this particular Star Wars film still sticks out in my mind due to the sheer awfulness of this film.

I responded, ""I feel like I just watched a very bad Michael Bay film."" Now, I feel that statement was generous as I would gladly watch 4+ hours of Transformers, 2 films - back to back, over 2.5 hours of Rise of Skywalker, maybe even more than that - maybe a Michael Bay marathon.Knowing what I know now, I would rather shovel snow for 2 hours in freezing temperatures, mow the lawn during peak summer heat or allergy season, any number of painful activities over watching this movie. JJ Abrams must hate making movies now because this movie feels like it was made by someone who hates the very art of filmmaking.

An unmemorable ending to an unforgettable saga,"I like millions of others around the world count myself as a fan of the Star Wars universe.Being a part of our lives for the better part of 42 years, any excuse to spend time in the galaxy far far away is one I will gladly take up and its due to this that it would be hard for me to not find another entry in the Skywalker saga somewhat enjoyable but disappointingly for the legacy of what has come before and for fans spanning the globe, The Rise of Skywalker is a mostly forgettable and magic free affair that remains a fine fan service Star Wars outing, but not a great film perse.Almost entirely erasing the memory of The Last Jedi, J.J Abrams returns to the directing chair after starting things off in fantastic fashion with 2015's The Force Awakens and injects Rise with a breakneck pacing that disallows viewers any time to contemplate, ruminate or consider what they are seeing, have seen or will see as the Resistance push forward on their quest to finally rid the galaxy of evil and create peace for all.It's an insanely jam-packed adventure, one that finds itself struggling to find its footing in a genuinely bad opening 30 or so minute stanza, with Abrams and his co-writer Chris Terrio struggling under the weight of expectations and story commitments that they find themselves carrying with 8 films worth of lore, backstory and characterization that has come before them.To their credit, Rise finds itself in a better place around the half way mark when a bunch of odd McGuffins and seemingly totally unnecessary side plots and detours are dealt with but at best Rise is never more than throwaway enjoyable as it begins to tick off a series of boxes that will most likely come off as far from surprising as it heads towards a lacklustre finale that may have moments of wow-factor but mostly is just a grey blur of imagery and sequences that will never be considered up there with the best iconic moments of the franchise.For all their supposed flaws that have been hotly debated over the last few years, both Force Awakens and The Last Jedi like the films before them featured a number of reveals, set-pieces and character developments that shocked, awed and astounded viewers and it's sad to say that Rise fails to ever truly deliver anything that will stick in our memory as our beloved characters of old and new heroes and villains find themselves bringing their arcs full circle.As per previous entries into the new era of the franchise, the films main cast all give it their all with Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver once more delivering the goods and partaking in all of this films best moments while old staples Chewbacca and C-3PO get a lot more to do this time around than the last two entries which is sure to please long-term series fans.Unfortunately lost in the films ADHD pacing and plot developments that come thick and fast very little consideration are once intriguingly set-up supports Poe Dameron and Finn with Oscar Isaac and Finn relegated to wise cracks and yelling respectively as their universe saving participants are relegated to mere caricatures. Lucky for them they fair better than the pointless new additions like Richard E. Grant's General Pryde, Kerri Russell's masked villain Zorii Bliss and Naomi Ackie's utterly pointless warrior Jannah, all of whom you question as to why they were invited along in the first place as their roles in Rise are more than questionable.Likely to be nit-picked more than dozens of other films put together, Rise is still going provide a fun 2 and a half hours in the cinema for most of its casual and hardcore viewers and there are some brilliantly put together sets, special effects and character finales to be found amongst the rabble of ideas, half-cooked explorations and diversions but it's hard to see Rise ever being regarded as the ending this series deserved as it fails to instil in itself the heart, soul and magic that made this world the cultural defining phenomenon those many moons ago back in 1977.Final Say -One could spend countless hours dissecting and examining every tiny detail of The Rise of Skywalker, a deeply flawed, fan service focused culmination of decades of work and lore that is light-years away from the best the series has given us even if it is still utterly watchable. Simply put, J.J Abram's farewell to the Skywalker saga is a an unsurprising service piece to its fans, that forgets to become a great movie in its own right, as its identity and charm gets lost in a flurry of moments and set-ups that never truly payoff in the way they should've.3 ½ desert festivals out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Skywalker's Dead, Long Live Star Wars","Yesterday I watched The Rise of Skywalker during a marathon session of the complete trilogy in my local theater. I saw clearly how much effort has been made to combine all story arcs into a sound, Hollywood closure.
In between the episodes I asked people I met in the audience about the final episode. What would they like to know about the major characters, which theory did they have in mind about the ending and so on, and I could predict beforehand that the ending couldn't possibly appease all of us. Each and every one has a different take on the story and characters, which is to be expected when there are so many theories and sources available, and plausible, about this fantastic Galaxy Far Far Away. That being said I like to specify why I find The Rise Of Skywalker actually worth watching.ProsThe choice of actors, cinematography, action scenes and one liners are fine-tuned to our present-day society. It feels like you're inside a video game, living the life in this Star Wars Galaxy. I've read quite some rants about the sloppy writing of the movie scenes or about Disney's marketing department taking over the original story of George Lucas, but I would say, so what? There are so many storylines, thanks to all the novels, it's a mission impossible to put that into one trilogy. If the script is formatted by marketing statistics it will show a diversity in gender, race, romance, comedy, action and melodrama, whatever works to attract an audience. This can ruin a plot, but What's the point of story telling if your audience can't relate to your story?
It's a dilemma and it shows. The latest Star Wars trilogy still is traditional high fantasy with the great battle between good and right, wise guardians and evil knights, but it is mixed with a modern take on Buddhist philosophy. So the battle between good and right has evolved into a lighter version, with a yin/yang light/dark model and heroes/anti-heroes.
I would say, leave your brain on the shelf while watching and just Go with the Flow. I still don't know the essential meaning of this trilogy. Perhaps the message is you don't have to rely on guardians or large armies, just keep the power to yourself. Your life becomes more meaningful with a life long learning, maintaining 'the balance' and working together.
Personally, I find this Disney concept a brilliant solution to combine different fan bases with different generations and countries. In the western world we have the older hippie/protest generation who believes in revolution, mass communication while the younger generation is more individualistic, they like to practice yoga and mindfulness just like the Jedi. In the East there's already a long tradition of buddhism and a preference for Wuxia, with masters and disciples, and highly styled fighting scenes that can be found in abundance in this movie. So I think this episode will be another box office success.ConsAre there any flaws? Yes, of course. When I look at the huge density of actions and dialogue in this episode, I see an inconsistency in the duration of scenes at times. Why do the makers pay 5 minutes attention to the bombarding of rocket men in the desert while there's only 1 minute left for someone dying, saying his final words?VerdictAnyway, it is as good as it gets. There's a sound and fulfilling closure to the Skywalker Chapter, and I sincerely hope the Star Wars Saga continues.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

At least that's my general feeling that this is how they ended up with this abomination of a Star Wars movie. Three sequel movies with zero cohesive story, each worse than the last.

The Rise of Skywalker - Wraps the saga well!,"I first saw Star Wars in 1977 as a 9-year old in Wellington, New Zealand. I saw Star Wars another 24 times at the cinema before the Special Edition came out in 1997. I have hundreds of toys, books, posters and love it. I am Darth Hans. I saw Empire over a dozen times, loved that immensely. Return of the Jedi is my least favourite. The story and theme changed dramatically.I love the world and characters of the Prequels. The Prequel world is incredible to me I like the setting more than the Originals, however the storytelling and dialogue was very average. The Revenge of the Sith was an excellent conclusion to the 1-3 saga.The new Sequels have brought a different angle. I enjoyed the visual style and new characters of The Force Awakens, although the story did not push the boundaries enough. The Last Jedi in my view was strong and challenging. I enjoyed the surprises and although some scenes were not ideal, in my view the film took the story in a surprising direction. I loved the fact that Luke's story did not go to my plan. In fact, I don't have a plan for how the stories should pan out, I let the filmmakers tell their story.The Rise of Skywalker is a rollercoaster conclusion with a scale unseen in Star Wars. The film is truly epic. The characters are tested, things go wrong and the momentum towards the massive finale was fun, relentless and exciting. Sure there are flaws, most films have many. The film drops you in from the opening crawl. The first scene presents the main antagonist in a fresh angle. The new characters go on a journey of discovery at a breathtaking pace. I thoroughly enjoyed the interwoven scenes, dialogues, plots as it leaped through hyperspace to its massive conclusion. Rey, Leia, Rey, Poe, Finn, Rose, 3PO, R2, Chewie, Lando, D-O, Hux and some ""returning"" characters presented a Star Wars film in its largest scale ever.I absolutely loved it. Bravo JJ and team! Thank you. Darth Hans",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun but flawed ending to the Skywalker saga,"The Rise of Skywalker has many fun actions scenes but has many story and character flaws. Pros: Good action, good special effects for the most part, good acting for the most part, and lots of unnecessary but fun fan service. Also some of the characters decisions are mostly good especially for Kylo Ren and C-3PO. Also the banter between the team was pretty good and fun. I also liked that Lando finally returned to the series though he is in it for only a short amount of time. The movie does do a good a job at making you nostalgic for the original trilogy and there are super really cool and exciting lightsaber fights.
Cons: Palpatine's return was not needed, the movie retcons too much stuff that happens in the other movies, Finn should have been given more character development, the new characters were unnecessary and for the most part had no development , and the reveal of Rey's parents was fine but the reveal kind came out of nowhere. Also some of the humor just fell flat and felt out of place.The movie has a lot have things going on at times and this can drag the movie on and make it feel rushed. Rise of Skywalker is a decent finale to the saga but has many flaws and it does its best to clean up the mistakes of The Last Jedi.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The disneyfication of Star Wars,"I guess I'll give this film a six. That's exactly what it is, right? This is an average, family-friendly, formulaic film which plays it safe. Perfectly fine performance from the cast. Story is a letdown. No memorable scenes. A couple of embarassing ones, including a planet where aliens dance like African villagers for some reason. A moment in the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon where, surprise! The little alien dude is on board during a battle for some reason. That kind of trope is dead wood now.My biggest gripe with the new Star Wars movies is that they don't try to push the special effects envelope as the old ones did.Nice movie poster though.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's like witnessing a car crash happening in slow motion,"The three Disney SW sequels were, IMHO, were complete failures with each successive one being worse than the last. This is the third installment of their failed franchise so naturally it is the absolute worse one in the lot.
Watching this was like watching your worse nightmare slowly unfolding. Sure if you watching it like any other sci-fi movie with no apparent clue regarding the rich background that is, or rather was, the SW universe then it's still bad with some mildly enjoyable CGI scenes thrown in here and there. If you watch it as a standalone movie, without seeing any other SW movies in the past; taking into account the story line and plot then it's 3 out of 10 at best. If you try to watch it as a SW fan and have seen all the previous movies and read the comics and various novels (and yes you were very brave being able to sit through this utter garbage) then it's a negative 10 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It was okay,"You just can not please everybody, especially not with Star Wars. At this point, no matter what they came up with, it would have been teared to pieces, just like this, all in all good movie experience.It was quite the show, with all the fan service and twists we have been waiting for. Yes for sure it was at some points bad and wacky, too fast and jumping from plot point to another. The way they did Leia was somehow off, and at times there was straight up wacky dialog and cringe moments.But isn't that what Star Wars is all about? Even the original trilogy was wacky at times, hell it is a space opera about stuff levitating monks and talking bears.
This was bigger and more epic than any other episode before. I am not ashamed to admit that I had tears in my eyes many times during it. It may be just an okay movie, but it is just what I was always hoping to see as a young kind - epic conclusion.

I'm delighted to say I was not disappointed.The classic themes of sacrifice, adoption, love, cameraderie, belief, redemption, hope and bravery were powerfully interwoven with oodles of fan service and a truly operatic touch. At times it was all so powerfully emotional, but never less than a thrill ride too. Everything I wanted was delivered, and more.JJ did us all proud, especially as I don't believe he was given the easiest material to work with as you look at some aspects of 7 and 8.I think the haters watched a different movie to me, and / or have forgotten the genre Star Wars inhabits of family-friendly space adventure with quite the dark side. I understand that some flourishes may not be to everybody's taste but to give this wonderful piece of work a 1, 2 or 3 out of 10 is basically trolling and to be ignored (imho!).

Seriously complete garbage.,"Star Wars: Episode IX - Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker saga. The film is overstuffed, rushed, and fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the nine-episode saga. Instead of building on the foundations laid by its predecessors, it attempts to course-correct the events of The Last Jedi, resulting in an uninspired and disjointed narrative.The film's pacing is frantic, with too much happening in its two-hour and twenty-two-minute runtime. The story feels rushed, with important plot points glossed over or ignored entirely. The characters, who we have grown to love over the course of the saga, are given little room to breathe or develop. Instead, they are reduced to mere plot devices, their motivations and actions dictated by the needs of the convoluted narrative.The film's attempts to please everyone result in a lackluster and unsatisfying experience. It tries to cram in as much fan service as possible, at the expense of coherent storytelling. The result is a film that feels like it was put together by reading angry Reddit boards, rather than by a creative team with a clear vision for the story.In conclusion, Star Wars: Episode IX - Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing end to the Skywalker saga. It fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the story, instead opting for a rushed and overstuffed narrative that tries to please everyone but ultimately pleases no one. It is a film that will leave fans feeling let down and unfulfilled.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dont bother with those giving 1/10 SPOILER FREE,"Is this movie perfect. No it is not. Is this a welcome and enjoyable addition to Star Wars, absolutely without a doubt. This movie (at least in my opinion) ignores or retcons The Last Jedi. I dislike TLJ as a Star Wars entry. It was a poor follow up to The Force Awakens, and I felt poorly paced and executed. TROS is breakneck speed pacing to revise this movie. Many of those narrative flourishes land, though it makes the first two acts seem rapid fire. However the final act is pure adrenaline rush Star Wars epic action, sacrifice, heroism. This film is likely to be divisive. If you enjoyed the established direction of TFA, and were disappointed in TLJ, you will be pleased here. The characters get the most exposition and though many parts go as predicted I found myself with that childish glee that Star Wars at its best instills me.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This one takes all that was good about the previous episode and tramples all over it with bad story-telling, a whole load of deus ex-machina that reach the level of absurd, and some decent performances struggling to make themselves heard above the din.

OK but not great,"I certainly didn't come away disappointed (which I kind of expected given many poor reviews)... but neither did I come away thinking ""wow"".It probably helps if you know the back story better than most people... as the movie dotted the i's and crossed the t's for all the most important things.In the original it felt like you were there... but in this one I kept thinking that this looked like it was a set (quite a small one often).The pace is ferocious at times... they're trying to cram in as much as possible. This doesn't allow the characters to be developed very much.I'm glad I saw it... and I think most star wars fans won't be too disappointed as it's not as bad as some people make it out to be.The box office seems to tell a different story to many of the reviews (a lot of people have seen it). I have never seen so many reviews focussing on the box office... yet mostly glossing over the fact that it's been quite successful financially. Is someone out to torpedo the film?I've never seen so many reviews focussing on minutiae in the film... while finding very few reviews that look at the big picture? I assume that some of this is paid content (people being paid to write articles)... but if it is... it's weird paid content... as all it did was keep the movie in the public eye... not encourage the reader to view the movie (a lot of it wasn't all that positive).This movie has been hyped a lot.

Rich with incidents and nostalgia,"""No one's ever really gone."" Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)Nor is the Star Wars franchise, which, in Star Wars: Episode IX--The Rise of Skywalker seems to go on like the universe, forever. J.J. Abrams has directed the alleged end of the main stories, which started over 40 years ago. My kids are grown but not forgetting their first experience in the '70's, which the recent ""rise"" replicates in spirit if not in richness of characters.The old heroes are still here, with Oscar Isaac's Poe the obvious heir to Harrison Ford's Han Solo, for instance. Even Princess Leia is here even if in archival-edited form (Carrie Fisher is dead). Han Solo in the form of the real Harrison Ford makes a cameo appearance as he faces off once again his son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). These are all memorable characters as is the swashbuckling Jedi hope, Rey (Daisy Ridley).The new characters like an abused droid and Poe's masked and brief love interest leave no legacy. In fact, too many characters people this space, like commuters on a NYC subway line. And that goes for the number of incidents, which bring plenty of action but rarely thematic significance.What is significant is the recurring theme that through cooperation, friendship, love we can win against the dark forces. The contemporary relevance is just as fresh as it was generations ago. If you band together, for instance in the ballot box, you might gain happiness, peace, and bring down a wicked old Sith emperor. The applications for good people banding together are many in the real world as well as fiction and science fiction.Star Wars: Episode IX--The Rise of Skywalker is an enjoyable holiday adventure rich with episodes and, for many of us, nostalgia.

I certainly enjoy some of the reviews ;),"In 2019 I was looking forward to this conclusion and then in my old age totally forgot about it ;). I stood in line in 1977 with a group from the Physics department of Washington University because they said it should be great and it was. In retrospect it was not the history of the Roman empire but a fantasy in space. Yet, I continually see comments that this was a disappointment and I ask myself how so. It I science fiction a creation of the mind of humans who spent hours toiling to create the scenarios and yet you in your wisdom, and lack of creative thought , just can not enjoy it for what it is. Tonight it was on TnT and even with the advertisements for nothing I will ever use I enjoyed it and found a product that tied up the loose ends. If you did not like it you did pay to see it and thus supported the presentation therefore who is the fool the creators for presenting you a well thought out story or you making an attempt to comment well out of your training as a critic. I have over the years watched all of them and some were better than others but all entertaining. This movie is not a 10 as none of them are but enjoyable. Oh, BTW those were not horses as someone commented I have no idea what they were but if you think they were horses I have a bridge for sale in Brooklyn ;) I suspect most of those who complain required remedial viewings to catch up on the story line as you did not exist in 77.

Star Wars is finally dead.,"I'm not sure wether it's worse or better than Episode VIII. This movie is just utter chaos. Pretty much every scene is created for spectacle or heavy-handed characterization. The majority are hamfistedly lifted from the first trilogy. Famous EPIV-VI imagery is crowbared in without any sensitivity for the symbolism. ""You like Emporer Palpatine, right?"" Disney seems to shout in dispair.Nothing flows naturally, most events seem to come out of nowhere and aren't explained in the slightest. Kylo Ren needs to find a thingy. Why? Don't ask. look at the flashy lightsaber. The crew finds an ancient weapon that leads to some important thing. Why? They were lucky i guess, it's not important, look at the shiny lights. The screenplay is absolutely predicteable, even the big twist in the middle is a horrible rehash.The relationships between protagonists feel forced and constructed. Rey and Finn try their best to resemble Han and Leia, but it's done very clumsy and artificial. Not Anakin-Padmé-clumsy, but still far from natural. Lightsabers are swiss army knives for Jedis instead of mystical weapons which should be used with caution. The force is super-powerful, unless the screenplay doesn't want it. Rey jumps around like Super Mario in one scene and struggles heavily to climb a rock in the next. And the humorous scenes mostly fall flat beside some minor exceptions.There are only a few good bits. The lightsaber battles feel a lot less like some ridiculous dance coreography or circus act, but more like a struggle between two opposing characters. And there is a beautiful homage to Carrie Fisher, which actually felt dear, honest and respectful. But most good ideas here are merely touched on and dropped in favour of more spectacle.What little of Star Wars magic remained has finally left the screen. It's now a disney amusement ride, just over two hours long. This is Disney in full blown panic mode, solely relying on hype and fan service to generate revenue. At times it seems like J.J. just wanted to be done with it. This is the director, whose dream was to make Star Wars movies! I was dragged in by friends claiming a need for closure, but i left 30 minutes before the end.

Not as bad as many people say,"The first thing you need to know is that this film had hundreds of ratings with basically 1/10 and 10/10 (as a reply to the 1/10 ratings) before the release. Too much passion from passionate people. The rest is history: some people finally watched the film and wrote several negative reviews and the rest read the reviews and posted the same ideas in their own reviews.As somebody said here, this film is dense and requires several viewings to understand it completely, specially the first thirty minutes; I remember that when I was a teenager something similar happened to me when I watched Episode IV at the theatre (please don't let me be misunderstood: I'm not comparing them!).I agree this film uses spot techniques studied to catch fans. That's the price to be now part of the Disney's universe. But objectively speaking, this film has all the elements to be an acceptable (just that) ending of the saga.The soundtrack by John Williams is as good as always: that's a strong point that shows if we compare it with The Mandalalorian's ST, for instance.Some characters like Poe Dameron are too Disney-like for my taste (maybe young public feels more identified with him), and some scenes by Rey portray her more like a Pokémon than like a master like Yoda, although the plot gives a strong reason for her to behave like that.As a conclusion, this is not the best SW film to date, but not the worst either.

Here is my spoiler-free review.
This was the first Star Wars film that I was NOT excited about seeing. I didn't like The Last Jedi especially after seeing it the second time, so needless to say, I went into this with exceedingly low expectations. JJ Abrams managed to make a great Star Wars film. I was really really impressed with what he did with what he had to work with. The characters and the story surprised me in a good way. This is a great Star Wars film. JJ Abrams went back to the basics and told a story a story of good vs evil with interesting characters. I wish that the Last Jedi would have been better because it would have really made this one even more great, but it reminded me of a really good episode of the Mandalorian or Star Wars Rebels or Clone Wars (Cartoon). I give this a 8-9/10. Great movie. Go check it out. You won't regret it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Loved it!,"I am so confused by all these bad reviews, if you enjoyed The Force Awakens then you will enjoy this movie.
If you thought The Last Jedi was a mistake then don't worry because JJ fixes up all the loose ends.
I have read reviews complaining about it being too emotive? And having too much action/adventure? I mean what do you want from a movie? Ask yourself why you are interested in watching a Star Wars movie, because if it's to see lightsaber duels, good vs. evil or Jedi vs. Sith (which I might add Ryan tried to terminate..), a few well tied in comedic moments (watch the originals - are they dry and serious throughout like The Last Jedi? No) and a couple of twists that pay homage to the original trilogy then you should really enjoy this movie.
I will add that there is a lot of storytelling happening in this film which some people don't seem to like - but given the train wreck JJ was cleaning up he did a brilliant job. I imagine this trilogy would have been quite polished if they just stuck with the one director throughout.
I also don't think a true Lucas fan will ever be satisfied with this trilogy, but at the same time look at all of you who hated the prequels which was Lucas' vision and it is his story to tell...
All I can say is when I walked out of The Last Jedi I was confused and a little wtf just happened, it made no sense to the story set up in The Force Awakens. After The Rise of Skywalker I walked out satisfied and felt that it tied in well with The Force Awakens.PLEASE go and see the movie for yourself, I don't feel these bad reviews are an accurate representation of what I saw, not even in the slightest. So many of the bad reviews are more upset that there even is a new franchise and not to do with this movie itself!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Disregard all the negativity! An 11 out of 10,"No spoilers.I'm a hardcore fan and has been since 1977, and this was just a wonderful, wonderful experience. JJ completely and forcefully saved and wrapped up the most impactful movie experience of my life. I honestly can't understand where all the negativity comes from.Perhaps this movie resonated differently with people who grew up with the original trilogy than those that came in at a later point and were expecting more focus on things happening in the prequels? I've read reviews that it was three movies in one, endless action scenes and zero character development, and nothing could be further from the truth. The film is extremely focused on the story line; no side tracks and gone are the silly excursions of casinos, code breakers and horse races that doesn't lead anywhere. No weird everybody has the force philosophy with kids and brooms, or dead pan silliness where Poe speaks to the First Order pretending to be put on hold. It is in a sense intense in that a lot is wrapped up, but so it should be as one has to remember it is the final chapter. This was a true Star Wars story for those to whom Star Wars matter, and the final scene in particular was wonderful and dare I say cathartic.

"As a fan of Star Wars whom ignores all the politics, I am conflicted.","Simply put, The movie is confusing. I don't mean hard to follow. I mean that it's hard to understand exactly how it all fits together and why the plot became what it did. If we look at the trilogy, 'The Force Awakens' was a great set-up for something wonderful, And 'The Last Jedi' was pure hollow nonsense which seemed to add nothing to the storyline, And 'The Rise of Skywalker' tried so hard to right the sinking ship. But, Because of the burden it had to bear, The entire movie felt like it was scrambling for footholds while falling off a cliff. It felt like trying to cram two movies into the space of one. It felt forced and rushed and left me so conflicted. I wanted to like it and tried to convince myself that it was the ending the trilogy needed, But to be honest it felt far too formulaic; Far too predictable because it was supposed to be an ending, But yet the characters felt completely disconnected from their previous movie's selves, Almost as if they never existed. The cinematography is fantasticly beautiful. The scoring is amazing. The choreography is the best in the trilogy. The action is fast paced and fun. To finalize, This movie was an average level of fun and does answer all the outstanding questions. But it leaves you with a bittersweet feeling. It does leave you wondering what could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid fixer,"I had many trepidation's about this film, especially after the mess created by Rian Johnson. JJ Abrams had so many things to try and rectify after episode 8: a film which basically threw out all the story and character groundwork that had been laid in the Force Awakens. On top of that, he also had to find a resolution for the loss of Carrie Fisher - no small task there either.
For me at least, not only was he able to that (by degree) but he was also able to construct a storyline that gave the main protagonists momentum. We all know how dearly this franchise is held by so many people. It would be impossible to satisfy everyone. This does not deserve the 1/10 ratings that many are venting about here.
This has the best performances of this trilogy. The characters who we are supposed to care about have clearer arcs, and those newer characters introduced by Rian Johnson have been rightly relegated to supporting roles (eg Rose). Mind you, there weren't many left after the Last Jedi either.
I don't understand why people are so hung up about the Skywalker linage issues or that this entry tramples the trope about Anakin being the one to bring balance to the force. His story finished with Return of the Jedi.
I for one have really enjoyed watching Rey's arc throughout this series. Her rapidly developing powers have been quite awesome to see. And now we know why. I can't help but feel there's a bit of misogyny sprinkled about here.
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how successful this film was in addressing the many issues presented by its predecessor. Yes, the pacing could of been better in parts but JJ had a lot to do in 2 and half hours. I do wonder what would of been different if Carrie Fisher was still alive for instance.
All that said, this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. And one which fixes so many of the problems introduced earlier while also trying to placate all the stakeholders who are so heavily invested in this franchise. Us included.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

At one point enough is enough.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Mandalorian (series) it's finally time for the last one to date The Rise Of The Skywalker. It's been a rollercoaster watching this saga, with some really good ones (The Force Awakens, The Mandolarian) but also with some disappointments (A New Hope, Rogue One and The Last Jedi) but the worst one must be The Rise Of Skywalker. What a disappointment this last movie, an awful script (without a question the worst Star Wars story yet), a story that made me want to have a vomit bucket next to me. I watched the eleven movies plus The Mandalorian in five days, so it's all fresh to compare, but never was I this glad to see the end credits appear than with The Rise Of Skywalker. I'm actually glad this was the last one (at least for now) because I don't think I could watch one more now, certainly not of this low quality. The CGI's were great though, that's the only reason I score it a six, otherwise it would be lower. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. But now I think they should leave it like this, call it a day, maybe just continue with The Mandalorian which has great potential, but as for the movies maybe it's time to stop before you ruin it completely. Did i become a Star Wars geek after these five days? No, absolutely not, I did enjoy the saga though but that's about it, time to move on.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

THIS is Star Wars (until the last act),"Where do I start... Firstly, this film doesn't lack action. Out of the 3 films in the new trilogy this has the most character development, fan pay-offs and beautiful locations. I enjoyed every second of the first two acts.Without spoiling - the dialogue in the last act is awfully cheesy and something I could have come up with as a little kid. While this can be overlooked in the film as a whole it's disappointing that the sequels could not be concluded in a more satisfactory way.There are some beautiful moments for certain characters while others are placed on hold as the writers didn't know how to conclude the stories which was disappointing.Ultimately I enjoyed the film as a stand-alone but it emphasises the lack of planning and organisation which surrounds the sequel trilogy.I have high hopes for the future of Disney Star Wars with content like the Mandalorian demonstrating how if Star Wars is done correctly it can match the quality of the original trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unfortunately it only gets worse as the subsequent films are released.Hopefully one day soon another set of 3 films will be made to replace these and we will be able to appreciate the tying up of the series with the thought and care that they deserved.The main problem in this series and especially in this particular film is the character development for ray I have no problem with making strong female characters like Princess Leia or Padmé but due to the complete lack of planning or foresight the development feels forced and unbelievable.This huge mistake in the most basic yet important part of storytelling is what leaves this film all at sea.,4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The only redeeming qualities The Rise of Skywalker has is that it was an attempt at a Star Wars movie with some of the characters everyone loves. The story is horrible and not really even in character for a Star Wars movie. There are prop elements, ships, scenes, etc that are nothing like what Lucas created.

Best movie of the sequel trilogy,"Well, that does not mean it is a great one. There are segments in it that I found very entertaining. Besides of that there were many 'roll-eyes' and 'facepalm' moments as well. The problem is that the movie trys to fit so many tastes, that it seems to have no profile and feels rushed. The humour is most of the time just cheap, but there are also some scenes that are truly fun. The visuals and audio are great as always.
So why it is the best movie of the sequels? Its Kylos and Reys character development that made the film interesting for me and lets it stick out compared to the other ones. I was emotionally affected in a way that I did not experience in TFA and TLJ. In contrast, most of the other characters could have been completely left out and often felt tedious. I was never bored in the movie - it was interesting until the end because of the main characters. In conclusion its an enjoyable, but far from perfect film. The rating, that is even worse compared to the other movies, obviously comes from expectations that we're finally not fulfilled.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

These aren't the films you are looking for,"Really wanted to give it 6.5, its not a terrible film but 7 seems too generous given its a genuine mess...but a good-fun sort of mess. Left me feeling more like I'd watched an extended cut of Solo.Without wanting to give too much away, if there is anyone left who's not seen it, I felt it pretty much jumped from TFA and skips the events of TLJ altogether which goes to reaffirm what a waste of space that movie was. It has the standard JJ plot-holes big enough to warp space and time, and lifted-scenes...sorry, homages, with at least 1 genuine surprise...but it suffers from a lack of cohesion across the whole trilogy that left me simply not caring what happens to anyone who appeared before, and not understanding what all these new characters were doing...because again I didn't care.The most frustrating part is that it is possible to still make a good Star Wars movie...Rouge One is definitely my #2 of all of them, and on some days actually beats Empire. Its well written, cast, acted, directed, paced, and presented....its just such a good film om all levels in its integration into the Star Wars universe but ability to show something new and different. I am sure nobody deliberately sets out to make a bad film, but boy it seems like sometimes they don't care whether its any good do long as it meets its delivery date.I think Disney have a real problem now; they've paid billions for this universe, but this is absolutely the last time I'll be heading to the cinema in good faith.

The heart of Star Wars was lost already though this was the best they could probably do,"In The Force Awakens, Han Solo is killed by Kylo Ren. We are told this advances the story. But I disagreed. Why bring Harrison Ford 35 years later just to kill him? Struck me as heartless.But the Disney folks weren't done. They killed Luke Skywalker too and treated him quite un-heroically in the last film. A lot of fans didn't like that and the director of that film has since been dismissed.Now Abrams, the director of The Force Awakens returns, and we are given hope.But the movie fails from the beginning, basically giving away the whole plot right in the first few paragraphs. Not something George Lucas would have done. The story lost a lot of its mystery and buildup by what happens in the first 5-10 minutes.The rest of the film is basically a series of chase scenes to get you back to where we started. Without giving away too much, you are being asked to swallow quite a bit of what is even plausible for a Star Wars movie.Some scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor particular the scene on a desert planet where there is a dancing festival. Reminded me of a mix of Jar Jar Binks and the Ewoks.This movie did not have young kids in mind particularly with the bloody beginning which had little point to it. Also the knights that Kylo Ren assembled had no place in the film either and were not explained and seemed like a Lord of the Rings ripoff.The good: Daisy Ridley is great, Driver is pretty good also. Carrie Fisher is treated well but they do not spend enough time on her during a critical scene after she intervenes in a fight between Ren and Rey.There are a few good laughs and a few scenes that will pull on your emotional strings. Some nice returns of a few old time Star Wars actors bump it up a notch.Probably a 7.5 and definitely better than the last two films but what this is missing is really Luke Skywalker and a plausible explanation to believe in these events.The first three Lucas films made sometimes veered away from what was believable but ultimately tried very hard to keep it believable. This movie did a better job than the last two on that front but still fell short.And the love interest of Poe was really a totally wasted misdirection of the plot in my opinion.What saves this film is the return of some key nostalgia pieces but is really just a salvage job.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

After watching all 3 movies it felt like we've been watching an argument between J J Abrams and Rian Johnson.""This is important""
""No it's not""
""YES IT IS!""Such a massive mistake not having someone directing the story across episodes. So what we got in Episode 9 was largely Abrams trying to yank the story back on to the track he originally intended. It had its good moments (threepio got all the best lines). But it was for the most part pretty predictable other than a couple of cameos I didn't expect (I cheered to see Dennis Lawson, however briefly).Including Leia was always going to be difficult with the passing of Carrie Fisher. Her scenes were cobbled together using unused footage from Episode 7. I suppose it was done about as well as they could have done but much of her dialogue seemed general and vague in the context of the scenes she was in. Clearly the other dialogue was built around using as much as they could. It came off as being a lot like one of the Weird Al Yankovic mock interviews where he takes a celebrity's answers to interview questions and then changes the questions to alter the context.When I first watched the Last Jedi I really enjoyed it and for the most part defended it against its critics. Over time I began to agree more and more with those critics. At the moment I'm a bit torn over whether I liked this one or not. Time will tell what my final verdict will be.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great ending to an epic journey!,Loved the movie. Great job wrapping up all the storylines with a few added bonuses thrown in. Not sure why so many people are rating this movie so low. My new favorite Star Wars movie!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I found it to be a great movie,"Saw it on the premiere night, and then on Blu-Ray last night. I think this is a great movie with amazing visuals and engaging story. Sure, it has its Star Warsy nonsense moments, but Star Wars has always been like that. It's a family adventure movie, not hard sci fi... I genuinely do not understand the hate for this movie, and I think it did an outstanding job of correcting the shortcomings of the last one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Death of the Star Wars.,"Pathetic copying of the storylines by previous two parts from first trilogy regressed at the end to very sad ending of creativity and storytelling. Chaotic storyline, forced events, but mostly teleportation and resurrection crossed the final line and proved that there was no story to tell. It was forced on screen purely for the purpose of making profit not cult movie.
Star Wars was dead in minds of creators of The Rise of Skywalker, but they decided to keep kicking dead horse anyway.
Very sad to see it happen with my own eyes.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable romp,"Can't understand why all the Star Wars fans hated this film so much..was the original a cinematic masterpiece? have an amazing story line? fantastic acting? Well no, but when I watched the original Star Wars as a teenager I loved the spaced themed romp, it was simplistic but fun.. as is this much underrated film. Great action film.. anyone taking this film seriously needs to have a word with themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

pretty much what I expected,"The apparent end of the Star Wars franchise was what I expected. I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't.

"Great movie overall, things could have gone diferently if J.J. had directed all the sequels","First of all anyone who rates this movie lower than The Last Jedi is absolute bonkers. Rise of Skywalker is by far the best film of the trilogy and in my opinion is the best Star Wars movie since disney took over the franchise. J.J did a great job with IX and I'm sure if he had directed Episode VIII it would have been much better than what Ryan Jonhson came up with and consequently not have given a bad reputation that it gave to the sequels. I hope you enjoyed the movie as much as I did and may the Force be with you, always!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you are a huge Star Wars fan you'll love this movie,Ignore the reviews and go see it yourself. I've been watching Star Wars my whole life and this was a great nod towards everything.

The perfect end.,"After all the negative reviews, I went into the movie expecting to see something mediocre.I don't get it. Do people just agree with all the nay sayers? Negative just to get attention?? Most likely (in my opinion)....,THEY just don't get it.With A LOT resting on J. J. Abrams shoulders, this movie did everything it set out to do and could not have been done any better.Some tongue in cheek dialogue, meant as humour (due to some out dated writing) in the first 30 min, is the only reason I am not scoring a 10.The rest of the story, scenes, amazing sets, tying past and the present and the famous musical score (perfect at every moment) made this Star Wars movie one of the best.A true Star Wars fan would agree.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Emperor is funny as hell in the new one!,"Not sure if it was their intention really.but I thought the return of Palpatine is very hilarious. They made him humorous as well as scary,and I thought that's a genius move. Saw it twice,and first time wasn't too sure,but 2nd time was pure gold. Ending is intense and had me in stitches. I've seen all Star Wars movies in the theaters,and yet I don't ever recall laughing so hard at an ending. It was great despite some cliches. I know I'm in the minority when I say it's the best one since Return of the Jedi! Great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
People are too hard on this movie,"My expectations were low given the harsh reviews I had seen. However, it easily exceeded my low expectations and actually proved to be a phenomenal conclusion to the story. Sure, if you want to nerd out and hyper-criticize I'm sure you can find more than a few things wrong with it. I think people are too hard on this movie. J.J Abrams has created a new world of Star Wars and this movie fits well within it (and stays true to the original world). It also helps reconcile some of the disappointments of The Last Jedi for me. (I will say, 95% of Lando's parts were 100% cheesey- but I'm glad he made it into the film). Watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hit or miss,"I'd say that rise of the Skywalker is a 7.5/10This movie to me has some cool stuff going on but is to scared to do anything new. The music by John Williams is as good as ever and for the most part the acting is alright. However, the plot has a little to much going on and could confuse people not really seasoned in Star Wars lore.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow.,"I consider myself a Star Wars fan. I've had a lot of mixed feelings about post-Disney Star Wars. That's probably why I went into the cinema with fairly low expectations this time around. And maybe it was because of my lower expectations, but Episode IX blew me away almost immediately. It's the best Star Wars experience I have ever had! I'm not old enough to have experienced the original trilogy as it was released, so don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this is a better Star Wars film than back then. But it's an epic conclusion to the new trilogy and it's in my opinion the best Star Wars film to be released in my 22 year old lifespan.There are a couple of cringeworthy scenes. There are some WTF moments. But that's all part of Star Wars. Always have been. But no other Star Wars films have left me so emotional. J.J. Abrams did a great job in my opinion. Much better than Episode VII.The pacing felt good when I saw it. The cinematography is beautiful. Personally I loved the story too. Okay, maybe they could've dropped one or two of the new characters, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.The conclusion to this tale is epic. And kind of sad. Personally I loved it. At the same time, I know a lot of people will diss it. Not because it's a bad film, but because it's Star Wars and it's not the original trilogy directed by George Lucas.I'll go watch it again. Hopefully with less tears next time ...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
JJ ABRAMS YOU'RE BROKE MY HEART,"I'm extremely sad about the completion of this saga, really waiting years and you play it?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Star Wars Movie i have waited 36 years for,"This is how you follow the original trilogy. Not with CG reissues, not with political, trade route terrible prequels but with a film that not only engages with new likeable characters whilst giving the original characters purpose. In the early 90s before there was any hope of Star Wars returning fans would read great stories like the Thrawn novels which show how powerful Jedi can become and how dangerous the Sith can be from the far reaches of the galaxy. This is the film that the true fan in me always wanted before my fandom got crushed by the horrid reissues and prequels.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Damage Control aka. ""Working with what you've been given""","It is a shame to what happened to Star Wars.The first in the last trilogy was setting some stuff up, but following a familiar plotline. It was a good movie, but a mediocre Star Wars installment.However, it all came crashing down when The Last Jedi was released. It was simply a middle finger to the Star Wars fans. All the mysteries built up were toppled in an instant, all the fan-favorite characters were misused, with immense plot holes, forced virtue signalling, an irrelevant side-quest that added nothing to the movie, and much more. It simply destroyed the long-time established characters.It was so obvious in this one that JJ tried his best to fix all that was simply trashed in the previous film. Mind you, this does not redeem JJ or Kathleen Kennedy, since a clear lack of planning from the start was inevitably going to ruin the franchise, but at least there was some damage control done here.Was it void of virtue signalling? Not really. I found the exploration of newly added force abilities to the characters actually braver, although some were a tad bit too much.The movie definitely felt more like a Star Wars video game than an actual installment into the franchise, despite it being the one that finalizes the story. A lot of scenes were filmed as such.The CGI on certain characters (Leia being the obvious one, without spoiling too much) was sub-par. Rogue One had it better (there, I said it).The saga was supposed to be about Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader, but it turned out to be about Palpatine. Most of the plot points nullified the achievements of Luke Skywalker to an extent. What were the previous ones for, then, if it all boiled down to Rey being the ultimate hero? Was she the one who brought balance to the force now?The only way I can keep loving the franchise is by reminding me of this one true fact: the whole saga is about the adventures of two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2. Luke, Vader, Palpatine, Kenobi, Rey, Solo, Chewie, Leia, Lando; they all come and go, but those two remained true to character and cause.Final verdict: it did a good job as damage control, given that JJ was handed over a disaster, and they did well with what they had in hand, but overall, despite not being ""too little"", the attempt was ""too late"".Goodbye Star Wars saga. F for respect for all the entertainment you have given us, including your ugly sides at times.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There A LOT going on,"There is a lot going on in this movie but also it feels maybe 30 minutes too long. I think the challenge was trying to introduce the big bad into the movie and build some story there when perhaps the time for that was in the last movie. That said, it is a very cinematic experience with loads of action to enjoy. The characters of Rey and Ren both developed nicely here and it tied up the Skywalker saga as best it could. It was definitely fun to watch (though my bum got a bit numb toward the end) and I will rewatch several times upon home release.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A lot of stuff makes no sense even for star wars in this movie like the teleportation of the objects.And omg this ending...HORRIBLE! Just simply sooooo bad.

Which it for C-3PO,"Of all the directions they could have taken to end this incredible journey, they did not choose well. I have no problem with how it ended, I had a huge problem on how it got there. It felt like some one who never saw any of the Star War movies wrote this and it was completely soulless.

"Muddled and lacking any tension, The Rise of Skywalker is the representative dud ending to the sequel trilogy","TROS combines the obvious, simplistic conclusion to an arc that Return of the Jedi had with rushed and emotionless attempts at character development. I think when evaluating the sequel trilogy, the issue of a lack of a consistent narrative across the trilogy hurts all three films in the larger story, so I mostly consider each film on its own merits. Each of them and the trilogy would have been much better off with a single writer and vision of the direction the trilogy should go, but since we didn't have that, each movie should just be judged on its own merits. On those grounds, The Rise of Skywalker fails to convince the audience of its character arcs or generate any investment in the inevitable outcome. Rey is severely underwritten, as we don't know to what extent she's really tempted by the Sith or her reasons for and against; all we get is fear of a vision and her family backstory. Kylo had a crucial arc in the previous film which was promptly thrown out the window here in favor of literally the same arc, just done worse. Once again he is told by a higher power to kill Rey, and while he initially tries to turn her, he eventually sides with her. We get a bizarre scene with Han where Kylo is sad and apparently coming around, but it rings hollow because we've seen it before and none of the reasons behind the turn this time are shown. Plenty of plot points don't make sense (how does Palpatine return? lazy writing anyways; how does Rey using a second light saber give her the upper hand? Why doesn't she have all the Sith rush into her as she was assured would happen moments before?), but even beyond that, no emotional beats in the film hit because it's all so contrived. This film feels most on the side of personal rather than true galactic stakes, as we only see effects on others when all the ships come in at the end, and those personal stakes never feel real because of the inevitability of the ending. The Rey/Kylo romance felt really strange, death is toyed with repeatedly for no reason (Chewbacca, Palpatine, Rey, and that girl Poe is into are all examples of this), and Rey going to Tattooine and calling herself Skywalker was the perfect nonsensical bow on top of the absurd film. I think some of the directions they try to take the movie are reasonable, but are poor choices given the decision to retcon the previous film and how little time they have to build different character arcs. Rather than build on VIII or set more realistic character goals for this one, they went all in and made a film that's hollow from start to finish. While it's representative of the disjointed trilogy overall, it's a shame that such a beloved franchise ended so underwhelmingly.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It needed time to breath.,"JJ did his best to pick a up and end a story from the force awakens (ignoring TLJ mess) in one movie. It was too crowded. I'm sure the studio wouldn't let him release it as two parts so the ideas materialize better. It would have been less overwhelming and people would have time to theorize, hype and anticipate the second half of the twists.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
not the best way to end a franchise,"To start with abrams destroyed the franhise before it even began. But thats not the problem. The nostalgia had already exited stage door left. A couple of characters returned and made the film a little confussing for certain reasons. One of my biggiest problems with this is the end. There was nothing satifying about it and made it feel weak and uninspired. I do however appreciate the big fights and as always great characters that we have known to come and love. Also what happened to rose. She deserved to be such a big part of the film than the couple of minutes we saw her forever. Overall not the best of the three in this franchise, I see what it was trying to do but just simply failed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfect ending to the saga,"Gave it a 10 to balance out the ridiculous 1s that are on here. In reality, probably an 8.5.Watched it with my son on IMAX 3D and both of us had our jaws hitting the floor regularly.The film has everything: spectacle, humour, action, emotion and, above all, a nice conclusion to the series.We chatted about it afterwards over a drink. Amidst all the ""oh the bit where..."" We suddenly realised that there was nothing that we actually found disappointing.Adam Driver's performance knocks it out of the park. Ian McDiarmid was born for the part of Palpatine. He oozes evil, power and madness.Can't wait to go back and see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
