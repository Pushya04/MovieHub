Never wrote a review before,"I'm 26 years old and I've never really been a Beatles fan before. I knew who they were and how they are the greatest band of all time, but I never actually sat down and listened to their songs. Recently, while going through some personal hardships, I started listening to some of their songs and holy s***, I was blown away. So then I started going down the Beatles rabbit hole, watching interviews with them, reading news and of course listening to more of their music. I lost my younger cousin last year, he was only 20 years old, may he rest in peace. We grew up together and we were essentially brothers. And so reading about John Lennon made me feel the same way I did after losing my cousin. And then I heard about this movie. Having no real expectations, I watched it. This movie is a nice feel good movie. No crazy plot, no crazy action, just a simple premise with decent execution that gets the job done. That's all it really is. But to me, it felt almost like therapy. I felt some part of myself healing after watching this movie, so to me it feels special. I would recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An original homage that helps break the current biopic trend,"After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Rocketman"" and ""Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story"" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent ""solo"" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Totally predictable...but so what?,"Movies like Yesterday aren't meant to challenge our intellect or keep us on the edge of our seats. They're mean to entertain without strain, and tap into our sense of feelgood and nostalgia.That's exactly what Yesterday does, and it does it very well. The acting is spot on, the characters relatable, and the humorous moments well placed and paced.The fabulous songs of the Beatles don't hurt either. Watch through the credits for the full version of ""Hey Jude""Don't judge Yesterday by the same yardstick as Endgame or Get Out and you might thoroughly enjoy it as I did",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Troubles seemed far away after watching,"There were three main reasons really in seeing 'Yesterday'. The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle's previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.While it could have done more with its concept, 'Yesterday' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. Had not had an easy day, or week even, up to seeing the film, so 'Yesterday' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. As far as films released in 2019 go, it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.'Yesterday' is a slick looking film, not exemplary but never cheap. Lily James looks great and the camera clearly loves her. The music of course is fantastic, it is The Beatles after all, with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed, making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. ""Hey Jude"" is one of the most memorable examples. The script balances amusing comedy and never over-sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish (well mostly).Story-wise, 'Yesterday' captures the feel-good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and didn't get over the top. The John Lennon bit is a highlight. Boyle has done better and more inspired direction, but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. The performances are good, a truly charming James coming off best. Himesh Patel has come on a long way since 'EastEnders' while Kate McKinnon is riotous in the manager role.On the other viewpoint, the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. Especially the final third, which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.Ed Sheeran's ""extended cameo"" for my tastes was rather puzzling and didn't seem to gel with everything else.All that aside, it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Could've Been Hokey, Turned Out Great!","I went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such? Was he going to get caught and crucified for it? Was he going to get the girl, lose the girl? So many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. Yes, he faces several difficulties. But, the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. If I want realism, I watch a documentary. This is what I go to the movies for. Really well done!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Beatles still rule!,Beatles fans will enjoy this more than those who are not familiar with the music and history of The Beatles. Including a love story to add extra 'feel-good' moments in between bouts of great singing from both real world artists and actors alike.There are a few standout characters that bring alot of flair to the dry English humour and a great Beatles song during the credits that make me want a theatre just to listen to music in!,7.0,Anonymous,Music
A love letter to Beatles fans..,"If you are a Beatles fan or even if you just enjoy one or two of their songs-don't miss this movie. Its a beautiful tribute to the Beatles & received the approval of Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono & Olivia Harrison. That tells you something right there. It's sweet, funny & bittersweet. Ed Sheeran is amazing-sweet & befuddled as he tries to figure out how Jack writes masterpiece after masterpiece. I can assure you that you'll be smiling at the end of the movie and finding your Beatles music wherever it is. I laughed, I cried, and I remembered my beautiful John Lennon . I can assure you that you will be smiling at the end You might also be dancing. Love, Love, Love.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Charmed by It,"I enjoyed this because I didn't think too much. If this were science fiction, which in some ways it was, and the Beatles never existed, how would so many things that were their legacy have developed. The British invasion would never have happened without them and a culture that expanded decades would never have taken place. But we can put that aside because the film tells us that the Beatles did not exist. Not that the four persons did not exist, but the band itself. I loved the bit with John Lennon where Mark David Chapman never came into his life. Anyway, it is a sappy love story in many ways, but the music is fun and the challenges of the protagonist are quite real in that milieu. I have been a huge fan of the Beatles from the get-go and if given a piece of paper and a pencil, could write the titles of a couple hundred songs. But to remember the lyrics, especially to a level of creative expertise, would be astonishing. Every once in a while something comes along that is just fun--no more criticism.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A World Without Coca-Cola,"Among other things, specifically The Beatles would be strange, only of course if you were one of the very few who had prior knowledge of them. An interesting concept caused by a blackout phenomenon that is never explained; which is fine, as the goal is not to describe why, just what it would be like.The music is fantastic obviously, and huge kudos to Himesh Patel for doing all his own singing. The movie is generally a feel good flick with an underlying love story. There's nothing else that is really spectacular about it, so to me this was a good movie made by one of the more creative filmmakers out there.My favourite scene has to be near the end when our main character meets with that one specific musical icon in his old age. Makes one think how differently things in the world could be depending on some people's life choices.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"As others say, could have been great.","Brilliant concept. Would have been a much better film if it had put more focus on Jack's personal journey in finding peace with the fact that he is the necessary messenger to put Beatles' work out to the world without Beatles. Because 'a world without Beatles would be infinitely worse'. Would be quite an inspirational film if it was about a personal realisation that at the end of the day, we are all just doing God's (or Universe if you wish) work.But, Richard Curtis being Richard Curtis, of course would make it heavier on the love story. As much as I love some of Curtis' work (especially Love Actually), I feel this time, this particular love story feels too much forced. I couldn't relate with either character and more importantly, it reminds me I am not in high school anymore. Teenage me did enjoy watching Hugh Grant mumbling through four weddings. But now, as an adult woman, I just want to slap the guy and tell him to pull himself together (in Maggie Smith's voice). Maybe, I outgrow Richard Curtis' film. Or maybe, RC just missed his mark for this one.A feeling good film all around. Just not exactly what I hope it would be.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Slightly disappointing,"To cut a long story short, with a film directed byDanny Boyleand based on a legendary band such asThe Beatles, I was expecting significantly better, although the movie is definitely not bad. The love story between Jack Malik and Ellie Appleton is excellently interpreted byHimesh Pateland the gorgeousLily James, whileKate McKinnonvervely interprets a sickening impresario. But the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality: the « Twilight Zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. In fact, by being slightly in bad faith, the filmYesterday (2019)can almost be reduced to the Beatles songs. I am fully aware of the exaggeration, but allow me to moan and groan: I'm slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com aboutThe Beatles, a stuff of legend across all periods of time.",,Anonymous,Music
Yesterday,"A film full of The Beatles songs cannot really go wrong.Danny Boyle has made a whimsical fantasy. What if we live in a world where The Beatles did not happen. John, Paul, George and Ringo never amounted to much because they never got together.Gosh it would mean somebody else narrated those early episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer in a small seaside town who is going nowhere. About to call it quits the only person who believed in him is best friend from school, Ellie (Lily James.)One night when all the lights go out throughout the world, Jack is involved in a bus accident and wakes up in a world where no one have heard of the pop group The Beatles or their songs.Jack writes the songs from memory and wows the audience with Hey Jude, Back in the USSR, Here Comes the Sun, Yesterday and Let it Be. These songs find an audience for the first time.Unfortunately Richard Curtis's screenplay takes some interesting ideas and then diverts its attention to a soppy and unnecessary romance.This is a rom-com. Jack and Ellie have only ever had a platonic relationship so far. All through childhood, to those teenage years when their hormones were raging to the present day.Jack it seems has never had a girlfriend and has never romanced Ellie, the woman who has always believed in him. Suddenly Jack realises he needs Ellie when she has found someone else.I would like to have known more about this world that had no Coca Cola, cigarettes and Oasis. The joke about Oasis was funny, a band so influenced by The Beatles, they could never exist if the Fab Four had never happened.Then again without The Beatles there would had been no Bruce Springsteen, The Eagles and Brian Wilson would not have strived so hard to create Pet Sounds. Some young filmmaker called Robert Zemeckis would never had made a movie called 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand.'It does raise another issue, The Beatles were more than just the songwriting. It was also the music, the harmonies, how they sang and the production by George Martin.Some ideas are explored such as the music industry sanitising the product they want to sell. The White Album has diversity issues according to a marketing executive. However Curtis goes for the default romance story in the second half which lets it down.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Delightful Fantasy,"The aspirant singer Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is struggling to be a great musician with the support of his agent Ellie Appleton (Lily James) and his closer friends. However he is a failure and needs to work in a supermarket to survive. One day there is a blackout and Jack has an accident while riding his bicycle. When he recovers, Ellie gives a new guitar to him and Jack plays ""Yesterday"". Soon he realizes that the world does not know ""The Beatles"" and he plays and sings their songs becoming the best musician in the world with a greedy agent. But can he afford the price he has to pay for the stolen success?""Yesterday"" is a delightful fantasy with the story of a world without ""The Beatles"", coke, cigarettes, USSR and Harry Potter. It is hard to understand Jack´s final decision, but the romantic story is a fantasy so it is very reasonable the conclusion. The sweet Lily James steals the film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Yesterday""",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Feel-good movie and a real crowd pleaser. I love it!,"Saw it at my cinema in Lovran, Croatia just a few hours ago, so it's still pretty ""fresh"" while I'm writing this.
The whole idea is great, haven't seen those yet in mainstream cinema. The plot is pretty much straight-forward, with likeable characters, great music (of course) and when the movie was over, it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing Hey Jude.All actors are really good, but Lily James is so adorable in this movie! She shines in her character and steals every scene she is in. Liked her the most (obviously).Take your girlfriend/boyfriend/friends/family to see this rom-com fantasy music comedy in cinema on a big screen, and even if you won't like the movie, you will sing Beatles songs after and feel good about it (guaranteed)!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Interesting premise. Not much else.,"This film starts with an interesting premise but doesn't do much with it. After the protagonist is transported to the other world, we don't really see much apart from endless applause and success. Okay, the songs are good, we get it. There's a bit of attempted drama in the form of the materialistic executive who sucks him dry for financial gain and his former manager who misses him but this was all clichéd and played for jokes.

Disappointing,"Danny Boyle is a director that I usually like, but unfortunately this film disappointed me. I thought it was very cliched and filled to the brim with tropes and bad, cringeworthy dialogue. I thought the acting was good, and the premise was interesting, but they don't live up to the potential of that premise. Because rather than exploring the interesting questions that this premise entails like how the world, the music industry, and our understanding of music would change if The Beatles were never a thing, they instead just use this as a strange, needlessly complex way of telling a by the books romance. Overall I wouldn't exactly recommend this film, and I was pretty disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
An Interesting Concept Unrealised To Its Full Potential,"An interesting concept unrealised to its full potential, Yesterday never truly grasps the places it could've gone with its premise and settles for a half-baked idea that's not allowed to simmer far enough and is further diluted with a half-baked romance. On top of that, it's missing the kinetic flair that's often evident in Danny Boyle films.The story concerns a struggling musician who ends up in a freak accident during a mysterious global blackout & wakes up in an alternate timeline where The Beatles never existed. After realising that he's sitting on a goldmine, he starts playing their music, claiming them to be his own, and embarks on a journey to fame & stardom.Directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later & Steve Jobs), Yesterday neither entirely digs into the what-if scenario of a world without the Fab Four nor wholly embraces the romance subplot it has going on the side. Boyle struggles in juggling both plots, thus resulting in a finished product that lands far from what the premise promised.Despite the availability of so many routes to choose from, the film opts for the least interesting one and keeps returning to the romance part it could have done without anyway. Riding on the strength of the all-time greatest band's music, Himesh Patel delivers a fab showcase as the leading man while Lily James & the rest are alright at best.On an overall scale, Yesterday is severely underdeveloped in plot & characterisation and is nothing more than a hokey rom-com at its core. The Beatles' catalogue does make the ride a bit bright, breezy & bearable but the input from the cast & crew still leaves a lot to be desired. A wasted opportunity of sorts, Danny Boyle's latest is one of his weakest directorial efforts.While there is absolutely no denying that a world without The Beatles is a world that's infinitely worse, it turns out that a world with this film isn't any better either.",,Anonymous,Music

Yesterday review,"A good idea suffers from writer Richard Curtis's tendency to warm over old formulas, and is saddled with a romantic sub-plot that feels completely surplus to requirements. Himesh Patel is flawless as the struggling singer-songwriter who inexplicably finds himself living in a world in which The Beatles never existed, whereas Kate McKimmon is terrible in a poorly written role that belongs in an entirely different movie. Needless to say, the music is great.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"James Corden's in it, and that isn't even the worst thing about it","Positives first, this is a slickly done piece of work, but frankly, with Danny Boyle directing a Richard Curtis script, so it should be; it's the sort of material Curtis probably turns out in his sleep.
The trouble is the film pretends to be about a concept, namely, a world where the Beatles never existed but one man inexplicably remembers all their work, but is actually just another implausible rom com with some excellent, excellent songs on the soundtrack. Other than these songs, the only reason to see this is to see Ed Sheerhan defy critics who said his cameo in game of thrones was the worst performance on film since tommy Wiseau.

He then works 8 Days a Week to recreate the Beatles music and gain some fame along the way.As the story begins I Feel Fine, this is a brilliant idea for a movie, now just Don't Let Me Down. When the movie will just Let it Be about a musician capitalizing on being the only one knowing the Beatles it is a great comedy and drama. But then the movie takes a Twist and Shout to be about a romance. Jack's got a friend and it is clear that She Loves You and I've Got a Feeling that all he needs to do is say ""I Love Her"".When the movie shifts to this All You Need is Love section I keep wanting them To Get Back, get back to where they once belonged.

"Good movie, great songs.","Yeah...that headline is my summary. Richard Curtis knows how to write a romantic comedy: star-crossed friends who seem destined to be more, quirky sidekicks that make you laugh. It is a formula, but it is a formula that works. I mean, Notting Hill meets the Beatles? Seems perfect. But this move never quite realizes its potential, partly because the romantic plot starts feeling cliche, partly because the Beatles were more than just song writing, partly because this story lost its way 2/3 of the way through. I still enjoyed it more than I expected. It is just that there's a difference between being well done and being original.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Brilliant Original Story with a Wonderful Moving Ending,After Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman. Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn't ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don't going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn't deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema. I highly recommend it.,9.0,Anonymous,Music

what if no one remembered the Beatles?,"This is a cute and harmless film, courtesy of Danny Boyle.The story concerns an aspiring musician, Jack Malik (Hamish Patel) who is discouraged about his lack of career and decides to quit. As he's on his way home, there's a worldwide blackout for something like 12 seconds. Danny plows into a bus and winds up in the hospital.He soon realizes that the blackout wiped out a few parts of our culture - cigarettes, Coca Cola, and the Beatles. Jack seems to be the only person in the world who remembers the Fab Four. He starts singing Beatles songs as his own creations and becomes an international star.The story is about what we all have in common and what happens if it's taken away - we lose that little piece that keeps us linked. It's also about a nightmare suffered by famous actors, musicians, artists, and writers - what happens when people realize I'm a fake? Many famous people, when their work is appreciated, feel like frauds.In Jack's case, of course, he is one. As he gets ready for his first album, all the people and success start to get to him. And it's causing him to lose his girlfriend (Lily James).I think another point here is that if the Beatles hadn't existed, we would have had to invent them. Their contribution to our world and our music is incredible. This is a fun film; don't look for Citizen Kane.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

You'll weep it's so good.,"""We were driving through Colorado, we had the radio on, and eight of the Top 10 songs were Beatles songs...'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,' all those early ones. They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid... I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.""-Bob DylanIf the works of Shakespeare were suddenly erased from the world's memory, culture would suffer an unthinkable loss. In Danny Boyle's witty and entertaining Yesterday, the works of the Beatles have been lost in a freak 12 sec global electrical outage. Except for Jack (Hamish Patel), who remembers the music and proceeds to reintroduce it as his own.Boyle and writer Richard Curtis, who seem to know a thing or two about music and struggle, have a winner of a conceit in the world discovering arguably the greatest composers of pop music in history. Patel interprets the songs beautifully and simply with a stripped-down guitar that enhances the lyrics and melodies.We have been graced this year with two outstanding musical biopics, Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman (although the latter is surely more fantasy than bio), and Yesterday is a fitting companion piece to those stellar movies. The Beatles come alive through the songs, interpreted with low-key power by Patel.Yesterday disappointed with its reliance on the old trope of boyhood friend Ellie (Lily James), then manager, having unrequited love for Jack. You know how that will end, taking considerable surprise away from an otherwise intriguing premise.Then the matter of the ethics of plagiarizing; not until the end is Jack faced with the moral dilemma when so much effective drama could have been experienced much before then. Anyhow, hearing the simplified Beatles should bring tears to your eyes (It did to mine) with a deep appreciation of transcendent pop music.Yesterday is about today and forever.",,Anonymous,Music
Yesterday needed HELP! as it was a Long and Winding Road........,"My Review- Yesterday. I rate it 6.5A Long and Winding Road that took a few bad turns.I was really looking forward to go against some of the negative criticism Yesterday is receiving as I liked the original story concept portrayed in the trailers I saw but as often happens the trailer is better than the movie.Yesterday is an Adult fantasy,a little Faustian ( sell your soul to the devil ) and Sliding Doors ( What if I took the different road) also Aladdin grant me my greatest wish.
The trouble for me with this movie basically is the script,it just gets sillier and veers off in all directions until I started to lose interest.I blame the Director Danny Boyle the story writer Jack Barth and Screenplay writer Richard Curtis ,who wrote great stories and Screenplays for Four Weddings and a Funeral , Bridget Jones Diary and Love Actually but also the horrible recent one for Mama Mia! Here We Go Again,which I notice gets about the same rating on IMBD as Yesterday, which could have been much better.Yesterday I enjoyed much more than Mama Mia !Here We Go Again ,which also featured Lily James who plays Ellie Appleton in Yesterday .Himesh Patel ( no relation to Dev Patel) plays Jack Malek a song writer musician who has been trying for years to be appreciated for his talent .His manager Ellie ,who would like to be more than a friend and manager is the only one that has faith in Jack.
Then a 7 second total World black out erases any reference to The Beatles and their music.
Jack runs in to a car in the dark on his bike and wakes up in hospital and when it sinks in after searching the web that no one knows any of the Beatles music he decides this is his chance to become famous.No more spoilers (that's all in the trailers )because I can't rubbish this movie as it's original but flawed and the cast are all very good ,especially Himesh Patel who sings and plays his own guitar while performing the Beatles songs .Yesterday is worth seeing for the excellent cast and for Beatles music fans plus Ed Sheeran fans ,who plays himself very well and its entertaining and good fun in parts as The Beatles song goes ""It Was a Hard Days Night "" and the script needed ""Help""!",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Himesh Patel (in his feature debut) plays a rock guitarist on the point of giving up, getting ready to go back to teaching, despite the urging of his manager-roadie, Lily James, who has been in love with him since middle school, although he has never noticed. When she drops him off, he gets on his bike to pedal home, when suddenly the lights all over the world go out and he is struck by a bus. When he wakes, he discovers he is in a different world, where no one has ever heard of Coca-Cola or cigarettes.... or the Beatles. When he plays a Beatles song for his friends, they claim never to have heard of it before. He thinks they are joking, but as it dawns on him, he desperately writes all the Beatles songs, and is hailed as a great new talent, and taken under the agency of a Mephistophelean talent agent, played to glowering perfection by Kate McKinnon.There are some wonderful sequences in this movie, and this is what Curtis excels at, like the incoherent buddy, played here by Joel Fry, who is utterly useless, and the assortment of friends. More than that, the recent spate of musicals about rock performers gives me some hope that we will see a revival of musicals, even if they are for the moment, of purely the diagetic variety.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice comedy.,"This film is like a breath of fresh air. I don't like romance comedy but this film is really good. Firstly, the story is interesting, you as viewer appeared in the world without some ordinary things. Globally nothing was changed, but for someone this changes are global. Also the film shows that some music is immortal and popular in all time but big money can mess every music even legendary. Secondly, the cast is good, appearence of Ed Sheeran is jewel of film.
So, it's good comedy with a little bit unsuspecting end.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I will watch this 10x in the next 10 years. Crazy under-rating here,"I doubt there is any other film where my rating is so far above the imdb rating. This has so much going for it.The soundtrack is The Beatles. Huge Win. And they did a fine job choosing, performing and integrating the songs. The scene where his parents and the neighbor cannot be bothered to sit quietly for a few minutes to hear Let It Be for the FIRST TIME is one of the funniest scenes ever.That leads to the other Big Win in this: it is frequently hilarious and the comedy is almost always deftly done. I have to add Himesh, who I had never seen before, sort of looks and sounds like Russell Brand, who plays rockers in at least a couple of films.Only possible complaints: The Rom part of Rom-Com is not handled as well as the Com. Rom takes over the film too much in the end. And a few of the later scenes with Gavin are just Strange. But, there are things to nit-pick on in every film, even the ""10""s.So, I am amazed people complain about the coherence of the ""alternative universe"" or whatever it is. This film is a FANTASY. IT is not a Science Fiction treatise.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A personal dream,"The whole concept of the movie is completely stupid but I have thought about this before the movie even existed. It's pretty enjoyable to watch the rise to stardom of some random guy in England that happened to get lucky, yet unlucky. I think there is a clear reason why this movie works. The songs. I bet that if the songs were by any other artist other than the Beatles, it wouldn't be good at all. But I love the Beatles, so a movie with a bunch of their songs is going to be enjoyable for me. Admittedly there are tons of problems with the writing of the movie, there are tons of stupid, unnecessary scenes thrown in, the characters are just boring. Some of the dialogue is cringeworthy, the acting falls of with some characters(Ed Sheeran). But in the end it all doesn't matter as it was a pretty fun. I wouldn't recommend to someone that hasn't heard of the Beatles or that doesn't like there music, that would just be dumb. 7/10. Yee.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

When Jack wakes up he discovers (mostly through Google searches) that he's living in a world where the Beatles never existed. As a result he's able to pass off their songs as his own and becomes a star.My favourite part would have to be when Jack meets Robert Carlyle as John Lennon, He asks if if he's happy?

British Charm,"This is a British Film. The themes are worldly but it is British.
The only American character in the movie is overbearing and obnoxious.
Himesh Patel oozes charm in a English underclass sort of way and Lily James is so girl next door wholesome that one can't help but fall in love with her. Together they make a engaging pairing.
The Beatles music is done very well and it was refreshing to hear the songs again.
My only qualm with this film is the fact that the director felt it necessary to put a character who was John Lennon in this film. The scene is totally misplaced and frankly, disconcerting.
The movie is thin on plot as 99% of all Rom-Coms are but is a entirely adequate date flick.

Frothy musical fantasy,"Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), an aspiring musician, awakens to a world in which 'The Beatles' (amongst other things) never existed, allowing him to take sole credit for one of the greatest collections of popular music ever written, although not without feeling a bit guilty. The film does a lot with the slim, high-concept premise and the musical segments are great. Patel and Lily James (as girlfriend Ellie) are excellent, as are the rest of the cast, especially musician Ed Sheeran and Kate McKinnon, who amusingly hams up predatory music promotor Debra Hammer. Not surprisingly, the film is full of both overt and subtle nods to 'The Fab Four' and is perfect for anyone who has ever daydreamed about an alternate reality in which they pen an iconic tune (my song of choice is 'Bridge over Troubled Water'). Good, lightweight fun.A final note: being of an earlier generation, I had no idea who Ed Sheeran was, which I suspect would be on par with not knowing who Paul McCartney was in 1968.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Okay concept, cheezy movie","So this movie really didn't have much to do with the Beatles, It was more of a background plot that was happening to progress the real story, which was a romance between a guy and a girl. Of course, the whole concept of everyone forgetting was cool, but most of the movie was obnoxious and filled with crappy jokes. The remade Beatles music was done very well, however I feel like the movie was preying on nostalgia and really just selling a mediocre love story. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. I would recommend against watching it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Love Letter to the Beatles with a Fun Premise, but with Some Tired Tropes","A very creative premise that has a fun time playing around with its concept of trying to make the Beatles music famous again in a world where the band never existed. The main character is funny & likable, though his ""it's me or the job"" relationship conflict with his band mate felt forced and tiring. The only other complaint is that at times it feels like there isn't enough conflict with how the public perceives the Beatles music in a modern setting. Could've been cringe, but it could've also been some clever commentary to see how our current era would try to modernize or even reject the old classics if they were to first premier today without any of its rich historical context and excellent timing that made them classics to begin with. But on its own, it's still a passionate love letter to the Beatles with a fun story hook to elevate the classic rock music.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What is not to like about this exceptional movie?,"This film is an absolutely beautiful story that depicts the Beatles' success in such a unique and brilliant way.Himesh Patel (Jack Malik) has an incredible voice and is absolutely perfect for his role. Lily James (Ellie Appleton) is also the perfect person for her role as she depicts a very sweet school teacher who has been desperate for Jack to love him since they met. This is also why the romantic element in this film is flawless and heartwarming, particularly towards the end of the film.The film is also very funny and all the cast do an excellent job of making the audience laugh. Ed Sheeran (playing himself) is hilarious and I am very glad that he agreed to be a part of this film.Do you enjoy the Beatles and their songs? Comedy? Romance? Fantasy?

Also, this is kind of a small complaint, but Jack should really sing 'Wonderwall' and 'Yesterday' in the final performance. It's not a deal breaker, but it would have been perfect.

The acting is wonderful, the direction seems to be having as much fun as the actors are, the music is, well, mostly The Beatles, but with new and fun arrangements that pay so much honor to the originals.

Now, not everything needs to be spelled out in movies but literally nothing is explained at all here and it's the central conceit of the movie. There's also this idea that suddenly injecting the Beatles into the modern climate would springboard someone from wannabe to music's Jesus, which I just don't think is realistic.What we're left with is a fun, charming movie...

He survives but it seems nobody in this reality ever heard of the Beatles, Also none of their songs exist either. So Jack starts to put out their songs as his originals and becomes famous...but he feels guilty.Strange movie. It does manage to be both funny and dramatic. I was honestly never bored. Also Patel can sing and pulls off covers of the many Beatle songs pretty well. However this movie has issues too. Patel has a tendency to overact and James is downright atrocious. The supporting characters though are fun. Also the direction is all over the place throwing things at you out of left field. Still, I'm a Beatles fan so I'm cutting this some slack.

An enjpoyable what-if,"Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a young, struggling singer/songwriter living in Lowestoft, England. Just as he is ready to give up on his musical aspirations, a world freak accident occurs which eliminates the entire history of the music of The Beatles; that is for everyone except Jack, apparently. In response, he uses his memory to ""write"" The Beatles' hits, performs them, and becomes a star.The film begins with some terrible music gigs that are funny in their truthful depiction of star-wannabe purgatory. It then morphs into a fascinating ""what if"" scenario that could also be a dystopia to many.The fantasy is the best part of the story which is sadly weakened by an unrequited romance between Jack and his childhood friend and music manager, Ellie Appleton (Lily James). Occasional dollops of schlock and schmaltz in this area lower the overall quality of the film.But ""Yesterday"" has more pluses than minuses. Patel has a sweet, innocent likeability overall and James is fine as the leading lady. A couple of supporting performances add to the comedy element. As Jack's right-hand man Rocky, Joel Fry has some great moments as an oaf often out of place. And Kate McKinnon is bang-on as a Hollywood showbiz shark, Debra Hammer. In one scene, she is making her nastiest comments while doing perfect poses in yoga and Pilates while wearing (presumably) designer yoga clothing. This scene seems to be a not-so-subtle jab against a certain North American archetype. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune of encountering this archetype would have a good snicker at this scene. The jabs against shallow, Hollywood, showbiz types are further extended into a surreal boardroom scene.Overall, ""Yesterday"" has a theme of ""what price, fame"". This is best depicted in a sublime scene that takes place in an isolated seaside home in the film's second half. (No spoilers here!)

Imposter Syndrome,"I once told three women at work that I was born the year Buddy Holly died and drew three blank stares, so I know how the hero of this film felt.In an episode of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' a poet published a poem he'd copied off a cereal packet, traveled back in time and successfully sued the manufacturer for plagiarism. Richard Curtis enlarged this conceit into this deftly plotted variation on the idea that a blow to the head is all that it takes to propel an individual into a parallel universe superficially similar to the one he'd grown up in, but in this case where cigarettes and The Beatles never existed and John Lennon had never met Yoko Ono and was instead (SPOILER COMING:) quietly but contentedly living in obscurity in Norfolk.Salieri is mentioned, so the resemblance of the scene where Ed Sheeran is daft to suggest 'Hey Dude' would be a better title than 'Hey Jude' to the scene in 'Amadeus' were Mozart is told there are too many notes in his music is probably intentional; and since George Harrison was a lifelong chain smoker which directly led to his death from cancer that would meant that all four of the Fab Four would probably have still been alive.Keep paying attention for the punchline.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Most of the characters were bland, with no true motivations and awful chemistry. Jack malik, the main character, seems so unenthusiastic about everything. He doesn't enjoy making music and doesn't act like he loves the female lead until the plot requires conflict. Additionally the movie shoves the idea of ""big corporate media is bad"" down your throat when it would be much more interesting if it had an ounce of subtly to it.The technical aspects of the film are all average, the cinematography had some unique shots, but nothing spectacular.I can honestly say that the only aspect of this film someone could find any ounce of enjoyment from is the Beatles music, and even then it only takes up a small portion of the film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
All you need is love.,"'Yesterday (2019)' is a very traditional 'Richard Curtis' film, complete with pretty much every trope you'd expect from a rom-com come music-drama. As with many others of similar ilk, its loosely sci-fi-stroke-fantasy 'what-if' conceit isn't really a massive narrative concern; it's brushed aside with some basic lip-service that doesn't even come close to an implication of an explanation, really. Of course, its repercussions echo throughout the piece and it is, for all intents and purposes, the fuel of the flick. The story that evolves from this initially outlandish but increasingly acceptable premise is a familiar one, but it's a satisfying and well-told one nonetheless. This is, in large part, thanks to Danny Boyle, who directs the thing with a real flair not often seen in the genre. Whenever he has the opportunity to do something somewhat left-field, while still delivering a traditional and relatively straight-forward piece, he takes it with apparent glee, injecting the experience with an unmistakable vigour. This praise is in no way meant to discount the work of Curtis, mind you; the screenplay is confident, charming and well-crafted enough that you don't mind how, essentially, 'by the book' it is. The cast do an excellent job at drawing you into this slightly alternate world, too; everyone, and everything, seems suitably grounded. I did find one of its clichés to be a tad bothersome, but it didn't matter too much. Neither did its general predictability, which was actually shattered on a couple of occasions by some decent pseudo twists. Even when it isn't funny or poignant or particularly fast-paced, it's still pretty fun. The entire affair is rather strange, from an outside perspective, because it's ostensibly a 'Beatles film' that isn't a 'Beatles film' at all. Their music features heavily - although, it's pretty much all sung by someone else (wonderfully, I'll add) - and the picture seems like somewhat of a celebration of it, too. However, both the band and the music basically fall into the background: the film isn't really about either them. Still, it's not like non-biopic movies are a new medium for The Beatles. Perhaps pieces like this are better at conveying the feeling of listening to iconic songs and the joy they bring to people's lives than classic biopics could ever hope to be. The stories behind the songs often aren't as interesting as the stories we make while listening to them. I think that's at the heart of 'Yesterday (2019)'. It isn't a story about success, it's one about giving the world the opportunity to make their own stories. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Liked it but it's no epic,It's heartwarming with a great soundtrack and a larger good performance from the leads bar a slightly cringey Ed Sheehan.

A bit better than meh!,"I've seen quite a lot of Richard Curtis films. Some had an emotional warmth (4 weddings, Notting Hill, About Time) others a bit cheesy but perfectly enjoyable (Love Actually) and a bit netter than merely meh....

But that's probably because fantasy is not my genre - and a world without Beatles is utter fantasy right? Not that AWWB would necessarily be a bad thing.

Beatles tribute gets lost in love story and is saved by Beatles music,"Vi and I made it out last night to a preview of Danny Boyle's most recent which contemplates what the world might be like without The Beatles. Or rather, if nobody remembered The Beatles, except the former teacher, protagonist who also happens to be a struggling singer songwriter who is nearing the 10,000 hour mark of his up to now futile music career.Was it 'merely' the underlying brilliance of Lennon and McCartney that propelled The Beatles to stardom in the 60's? Is it simply catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics that led to the perennial relevance of The Beatles catalog? Is this an ongoing cultural phenomenon demonstrated by the passing of love of Beatles music from parent to child, fan to the uninitiated, that continues, fervently, even today? These might be a few of the questions that ran through my head as the plot unfolded manifest in another question: could one guy with a guitar replicate The Fab Four's success?As a bit of a Beatles fan, the subtext to the film, contrasts the roles that a select few beyond the fab four played in The Beatles success with the movie's equivalents. As a snarky jab at the music industry, Brian Epstein's meticulous eye for detail is hearkened and contrasted with Kate McKinnon, whose performance is at once spot on and over the top. Her character is undoubtedly the tip of the iceberg for those archetype 'gonna conquer the world' southern California denizens, yet rings hollow in a few spots. The distinction is poignant for a Danny Boyle movie, normally the complete opposite of tone deaf, and while I chose to include it here, the scene(s) I reference may be cut from the final release version. (For edification purposes: the music studio in L.A.)Speaking of the studio, The Beatles, simply would not be without the mastery of studio producer George Martin. The orchestral arrangements, the sound story mentality, the embracing of The Beatles' desire to embrace the latest technologies are a few of the ways in which Martin guided the manifestation of magic conveyed on vinyl. The film, in this regard, is light on the complexity and development of the sound over time and focuses instead, even acknowledges, that Jack's is a lesser reflection of the brilliance of The Beatles, with a few laugheties about lyric selection.Which is not to say that the interpretations of the songs chosen are not without merit. The sincere portrayal of 'Yesterday' provides a solid framing for the rest of the movie. 'In my Life' plays a vital role in driving the movie forward, and appropriately so. And the at once nuanced, yet in your face pleading of 'Help' is a true reading of the song's rarely spoken meaning appropriate to the character and plot. Patel's rendering, spoken and sung, is true.What is a bit muddled is the inability for interpersonal communication in a world without a common language of love, alongside earworm hooks, impeccably delivered by John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Instead it takes a plot twist I didn't anticipate, to initiate the third half of the movie resolution.Ultimately, the movie succeeds at contemplating how a struggling musician / teacher might navigate the complicated waters of being the one person in the world who remembers and can perform The Beatles...A Long and Winding Road indeed!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Ironically forgettable,"Coming into Yesterday hoping for a good and relaxing time, with classic Beatles songs, I ended up being rather disappointed. There was nothing wrong with the narrative pers se but unfortunately it doesn't hit that charm that many music centric 'small' films tend to bring. Perhaps it was the one too many Ed Sheeran 'cameo' that just seemed to distract from the main draw of the movie.In an already cliche genre and narrative Yesterday really doesn't do much to elevate its craft, it was a decent watch but ultimately one that would be easily forgotten.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining and pretty engaging for most parts - Beatles save the yesterday!,"If you had seen the trailer or even heard of the plot before watching the movie, the plot might lose you in the opening parts as its pretty much goes by the same narrative. Its what follows after, which makes Yesterday's magic work!The pivotal instrument in the movie is Himesh Patel. Its not everyday a movie comes with an actor of Indian assent leading with the legacy of Beatles. The narrative - perceiving the emotional range of such a lead has been superbly handcrafted and the magic works onscreen balanced by all the cast including Ed Sheeran!Its not a masterpiece, but its definitely a landmark movie in this genre. Highly recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun rom-com,"Rocketman recently did a great job of reminding us just how good Elton John songs are, making us want to dust off our vinyl/plastic/streaming service collection and reacquaint ourselves with his back catalogue all over again. Last year, the Bohemian Rhapsody movie did a similar thing for the music of Queen and now it's the turn of The Beatles with Yesterday. Written by Richard Curtis, and directed by Danny Boyle, Yesterday doesn't go down the musical/biopic route, instead taking classic Beatles songs and weaving them into a high concept romantic comedy.Yesterday follows struggling musician Jack (Himesh Patel) and long-term best friend/manager Ellie (Lily James). Gigging in pubs is getting Jack nowhere and he's resigned himself to the fact that he might have to give it all up and return to a life of teaching. He lands a spot on the Suffolk stage at Latitude festival, expecting it to be his big break, but only his friends and a handful of bored kids show up to watch him play.But then, while riding home on his bike that night, something mysterious happens. An unexplained 12 second power cut hits the entire globe and in the resulting chaos, Jack is struck by a bus and flung from his bike. When he awakes in hospital, bruised and missing a couple of front teeth, he plays a Beatles song to Ellie and his friends, who all think it's amazing. They think it's a new song, written by Jack, and claim to have never heard of The Beatles before. After a bit of Googling, it becomes clear that The Beatles never actually existed, and only Jack is able to remember them or any of their songs. There are a few other things which crop up as we go along, that also turn out never to have existed, in what is a bit of a nice running gag throughout the movie.Jack immediately realises his chance of success at last and sets about trying to remember as many of The Beatles songs and music as he can. His friends love the new material, and there's also a hilarious scene where he tries to introduce his parents to a Beatles song (The Kumars, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal both on top form here), but it's still not really working out for him at the pub gigs and weddings where he performs them. It's only when he gets the chance to professionally lay down his tracks, and starts handing out free CDs to customers at the store where he works, that things really take off for Jack, drawing the attentions of one Mr Ed Sheeran. Ed clearly has fun sending himself up, and actually features quite heavily in the movie, particularly in these early stages - turning up at Jack's house, asking him to come and support him on tour, arranging a 10 minute songwriting challenge between him and Jack. I'm not really a fan of Ed Sheeran but he actually turns out to be responsible for a lot of the movies humour, eventually conceding that Jack is a better songwriter than him.As Jack starts to hit the big time, traveling to LA and being guided through the music business by new manager Debra (Kate McKinnon), we hit a bit of a mid-movie slump. Luckily though, Himesh Patel portrays Jack with such a relatable and likeable charm - his bewilderment and frustrations at the ridiculousness of the music industry, not to mention the building pressures of living the lie that his success has come from using someone else's work, guides us nicely through these slower moments of the movie. The romance part of the story continues to play out too, with Jack and Ellie both clearly having loved each other for 20 years now, but with neither of them committing to taking it any further. Lily James is once again wonderful, despite being very underused in this role, and it's the love story element of the movie which isn't quite as strong as the rest of it.The movie does manage to pull things together nicely for the final act, resolving the unease and tension that underlies much of the movie. It could have done with a bit more rom and a bit more com at time, but still manages to be an enjoyable movie and a perfect reminder of just how great The Beatles are.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Not Quite Enough Boyle, Far Too Much Curtis (vague SPOILERS I guess)","If they cut about 30 minutes from this they would have a 8/10 movie.Ohhh, this movie is SO frustrating, yet I would recommend folk go to see it and I think most folk with an interest in The Beatles / Pop Music / Creativity / the Music Industry and also fairly 'Light but Charming' comedies will definitely take some string positives from it.POSITIVES...
With some nice stylistic choices by Danny Boyle, and a nice line in humour, a highly enjoyable use of a great catalogue of music and warm performances from MOST of the cast, I found myself grinning at much of it, with a few guffaws too, as though I was watching a Cute Kittens video or something.
The first half hour or so is really strong,.I thought it was heading to about a 8.5 rating...NEGATIVESBasically when Curtis tries far too much to make it a romantic comedy. You are there, laughing, or grinning, or.humming or singing... And then BAM one of the most confusing 'romances' I have ever seen takes over for some extremely clunky reasoning, and there's feelings and all that...and it is okay the first time... But unfortunately, there's more... About I guess, on and off, half an hour more over all... And it's horrible, (and quite a number of things are said in this 'romance that just make one of the romantics seem almost unpleasant to me anyhow... It's really weird to be honest)There's also a bit of storyline, involving an unpleasant character that was similarly clunky, and over done, but time wise this was not so bad, and I guess was needed for the story, but was badly done.But overall I when I did enjoy it, I really did, it had some rather cool surprises and it is actually an interesting concept, and does make you think a little when it's at its best.But it could so easily have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Another copy and paste storyline from Curtis.,"The characters are all well played and Lilly brings the pleasant sparkle. However, the story just goes from A to B relying on a few minor giggles without really trying to be creative or original. Yes it is entertaining. You will enjoy it. But a writer with so much experience cannot be allowed to keep getting away with such copy and paste nonsense. The story is entirely predictable and unoriginal. You watch and wait for something to take you by surprise but it just never comes. The character, the love interest, the conflict, the heartbreak, the reveal, the happy ending. So if you have a boring Sunday then this film is for you. You will laugh and smile. I recommend it as a film for fun but it isnt a keeper.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wow, what a film!","Yesterday is so fun to watch, I loved every moment of it. So good to finally see a film that isn't a remake or a sequel. Himesh Patel and Lily James were brilliant and relatable. I loved their chemistry.
Loved all the music obviously!! how can you not. The Beatles are the biggest selling band in the world, if they didn't exist the world deservers to hear their music.
However above all loved the underlying message; success doesn't also have to be about the money you make and tell the truth at every possible opportunity you get.I can't wait for this film to be released on DVD so I can watch it again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining if you don't think too hard,"The difficulty with imagining a world which never had The Beatles is - there was more to them than just the music. They were a cultural phenomenon as much as a musical one; ""All You Need Is Love"" crystallised the attitudes of an era, it wasn't just a song. A world without that would not simply be the same world as today without the song.Well, this is a movie, it aims to entertain and it certainly does that. The songs are well presented, although again showing it was the chemistry of the four that really made them work - Jack and his backing band really can't do ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" like John, Paul, George and Ringo. On a personal note, the film has made family history because my wife: a) wanted to go to the cinema to see it, and; b) she actually enjoyed the experience. That makes about 5 cinema trips together in 32 years of marriage - how we ever got together I will never know (but I'm glad we did).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Yesterday was Danny Boyle on an average day,"Yesterday certainly has that Danny Boyle style to it, but is the actual movie any good? Well, it's a mixed bag I'd say. The concept of being the only guy who remembers The Beatles and using that information to gain fame and success is great, but the movie just runs dry of what to do with its feature length running time and falls into predictable cliches and character moments that you see coming a mile away. It didn't feel like they knew exactly what to do with the concept and just went with a safe predictable path on how to conclude it all.There's quite a bit of funny humour here and there and good use of music and shots thanks to Danny Boyle. I found some characters mildly irritating in
places and there were also alot of scenes in this movie that seemed like filler. It felt pretty long and probably could have been 30 minutes shorter easily. On a more positive note, the acting is very solid and there's definitely a unique British charm to the whole thing that makes it stand out from other mainstream movies. It's just a shame the story gets progressively worse as it goes along. Overall, I'd say Yesterday is still worth a watch, even if it might only seem average at best.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Happy, Feel Good Movie","OK, having read through all the negative reviews complaining that the plot is ridiculous and unrealistic, I'd like to remind everyone that this is just a movie. It's entertainment. Most sci-fi movies are ridiculous, all superhero movies are unrealistic and that TV series with wizards and dragons is both. But again, they're just entertainment.So, back to this movie. It's a light-hearted comedy based on a what-if scenario. Yes, there's a love sub-plot in there so I guess it could be classed as a rom-com although it's not a stereo-typical plot. There are some moral questions in there - are fame and fortune all they're cracked up to be, are they worth losing your friends for and is it ok to pass off other people's work as your own? But again, this is just entertainment - it isn't meant to be a lecture.All the actors do a great job with their characters, Himesh Patel's singing is really good, Ed Sheeran pokes deadpan fun at himself and Kate McKinnon is hilarious as the ice cold avaricious Debra.It's funny, it's touching, it's wonderfully nostalgic and it gave me a new appreciation for The Beatles' music 50 years after the fact. If you're looking for high brow rocket science, go watch a historical drama or a documentary. If you're looking for light hearted entertainment with great music that will lift your spirits, look no further.

One of the best movies I've seen in a while - The Beatles is turned into what Tarkovsky had done with the smoke!,"This is it! This is how you move on with a bold premise and transcend reality!This film is no science fiction. It has the quality of a fairy tale because we aren't led down useless rabbit holes to figure out what happened and why. It's the result that matters. Parallel universe? An on/off switch? Who cares! The point is that the whole word (but a few people) have forgotten about The Beatles, and there's also no record of their existence online or in collections of print media.To be honest, I find the IMDb score too low for the achievements in this delight. What's wrong with people? Would they dislike It's A Wonderful Life, too?The allegory of there being no Coca Cola but only Pepsi can be read as ""the real deal having vanished"" and the copycats remaining. And Harry Potter supports that. A world with no Harry Potter, no Beatles, no Coca Cola... Yikes!... But we aren't expected to make much sense out of that as well, because there also is no such thing as a cigarette. I'd see that a positive!Lily James is so sweet, so lovely, so marriage material in every scene! I'm glad the dude does what he should have long ago, and couples with her finally. By the way: ""Hey Jude"" becoming ""Hey Dude"" was top notch! Cheaper times, cheaper taste! Yep, back again to some sort of ""lesser dimension"", but still shaky.I loved how the movie underlined the fact that PRESENTATION MATTERS! It's not just the quality of the songs themselves - today, masterpieces come with rituals and subconscious conditioning to like them. Hence it really makes sense that you might not be appreciated all of a sudden by every single listener when you recite a song of The Beatles to ears who hear it for the very first time.""The Beatles"", in this movie, is akin to how Andrey Tarkovsky had experimented with editing in the early days of cinema: He captures the movement of fire on top of a candle, with smoke coming from it. Then he continues on to show us a plan where there is only the smoke, but no candle! From its own colorful perspective, the story of Yesterday does the same. The candle (The Beatles themselves) are gone, but thanks to our protagonist the smoke exists now!Ed Sheeran contributes tastefully as himself to the plot. The only problem I have with casting is Kate McKinnon. Yeah, we're supposed to hate-watch her already, but I felt like I also hated her (the actress, not the character) for treating this like one of her routine Hollywood comedies.The twist about expecting to see whatever happened to Ringo Star (who still lives) versus who our protagonist gets to meet and talk was really cool.Young couples who love music can make this their most rewatched film. It's really good. In line also with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (without the depressive aspects) and High Fidelity, but in my opinion better made and more fresh.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

What disappointed me was how little the film actually spends delving into a world without the Beatles. Instead, we mostly get a cliched romance story about childhood friends.

Interesting concept but too ambitious in execution,"First, what i enjoyed most in this movie is Kate McKinnon's delightful performance as a ruthless agent. Hers stands out among generally decent performances from the rest of the cast, and deserves an Oscar nomination for supporting actress.
The movie as a whole is a pretty shameless piece of work, perhaps not unlike McKinnon's character Debra Hammer. While the concept is interesting, those behind it try to take on too much and end up spoiling everything. One is allowed to be far-fetched up to a point and beyond that, the whole premise falls apart.
One suspects the whole idea behind this project is to make money from songs by the Beatles. On a positive note, at least it may introduce some new fans to the body of work. However, Yesterday the song was not rendered well, and including Back in the USSR is totally out of place and meaningless.
On the whole, one would give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and believe that their nostalgic intentions are good.

6/10,"This movie has a few interesting ideas. But overall it didn't WOW me. The film's success is largely an understanding of a reality the movie tries to paint as evil. Which makes the whole product feel bizarre. And not in a good way.I'd say the biggest flaw is that It often felt too slow paced. Also, after a while a lot similar kinds of jokes were recycled to a point where it wasn't fresh.The actors were fine. The songs were performed nicely. I was annoyed that they never really explained why nearly everyone suddenly forgot and had no record or evidence of The Beatles, Coke, Harry Potter, cigarettes and a few other random things.I liked what they did in imagining John Lennon surviving to the present day. Although the pathway to the main character meeting him seemed rather contrived.Sadly, the story had a lot of love story cliches which made what I thought was an interesting Beatles sci-fi movie, into a chick flick romance. And not a good chick flick romance.The film honestly feels like the work of a producer with a calculator rather than an artist making a brilliant work of art.It isn't terrible. Producers usually know enough to make a product which will stay afloat. But it certainly isn't a movie I'll be recommend to my friends. Other band or musician movies of late have been much better.

Does anyone else see the irony in this disaster?,"The premise of ""Yesterday"" is that the Beatles no longer exist. The irony is that the filmmakers have made a movie that treats the Beatles as if this was REALLY the case. There is absolutely no attempt to show the incalculable impact that the Beatles had on the world. Instead, we get a global society that's pretty much the same, but bereft of the Beatles music, as if music was their only contribution to life as we know it.
This ludicrous script is basically a ""romantic comedy"" that presents a litany of every cliche in the genre, with an ending that is so saccharine, and so contrived, I almost walked out of the theater (If I were closer to the aisle, I would have). There is also a ""cameo"" towards the end of the film that is beyond tasteless. How in the world can Apple, the Beatles and their heirs have signed off on this?!
If you love the Beatles and their music, avoid this insult to everything they stood for. Hopefully, it will disappear quickly and be forgotten. If you truly want to know who the Beatles were, I recommend Mark Lewisohn's brilliant biography, ""Tune In"".

"Yesterday: My Good, Bad, and Ugly","The Good:
In a cast made up primarily of caricatures and walking genre tropes Himesh Patel shines as an acting talent and musical performer. Without much to play against Patel plays the role of a conflicted and lovesick musician perfectly, and his often emotional renditions of the songs of The Fab Four help make up for the middling performances of the rest of the cast. While it's still not enough to lift this movie out of the disappointingly average place it finds itself if, it is refreshing to find a fresh face with real talent among bigger stars phoning it in.The Bad:
Because the movie doesn't feature much of The Beatles catalog prominently, it relies heavily on the romantic storyline between Patel and James, and their chemistry. Unfortunately, their chemistry falls short, and is confused by early dialogue that suggests James is uninterested, and that their relationship, romantic or otherwise, has always been driven by her, not Patel. With their lackluster romance in place, the comic relief of McKinnon and Fry, and the reserved inclusion of Beatles songs performed by Patel just aren't enough to ensure the success based on reinvigorated nostalgia that is clearly the aim of the film.The Ugly:
For a nostalgic look back at The Beatles catalog there is no better film in its execution than Across the Universe (Julie Taymor, 2007). As a jukebox musical it's pretty generic. But, for Beatles fans it puts the music and the history of the band at its center without complicating its sensibility by trying to tell a narrative so separate from the music that the audience is left wondering where the two meet. In fact, the close parallels between the romance between the main characters, and the personal and career trajectories of The Beatles enrich the story in a way that Yesterday's imagined narrative apparently separate from any influence of The Beatles could never achieve.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Not what I expected, (thought it another music biopic) but I liked it better than I expected.
Ballsy of Boyle take a chance on such an original storyline.A tiny, tiny disappointment was my hope for a cameo by Paul or Ringo or BOTH....I love surprises - this will surprise you too.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not the Beatles,"It's hard to classify Yesterday. It prominently uses Beatle's lyrics and song. It's funny but with a twinge of melancholy. And mostly it's a fantasy of what ifs. It's also predictable with a sad whimsical elemental surprise towards the end. For Beatle purists, this movie would be hard to accept and enjoy. Somehow the interplay between Beatle songs and the movie plot doesn't quite run smoothly and easily play out like Across the Universe (2007). Nor does Yesterday incorporate the creative movie magic that Across the Universe used with a compelling lavish way. This alternative reality fantasy appears to be a somewhat new take on the more oftentimes comedic or dramatized versions of reality such as John Candy's Delirious (1991) or Amazon's The Man in the High Castle series (2015) which make more of their own focused intensity in their delivery. This fusion of so many genres coming together in Yesterday ultimately changes the movie into more of an experimental film genre in progress. As a musical Yesterday doesn't sustain the intimacy of lengthy sweeping musical pieces as experienced in Rocketman (2019), La La Land (2016), Les Miserable, or Chicago (2002). Overall, the movie stands on its own, in its own way, but as a tribute to the Beatles, only the Beatles themselves can really authentically hit the original notes of emotional integrity with their own tributes",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The Romance This Summer Needed,"When done right, rom-com-drama's (especially ones with a music backdrop) are some of my favorite films of all time. 'Yesterday' posed a creative premise, as the world has forgotten The Beatles (among many other pop culture things) and one musician decides to take advantage of that and take credit for the songs as his own. It's a premise that almost begs you not to root for the main character, played by Himesh patel. But Patel contains great charisma and shares a natural chemistry with Lily James. Admittedly some of the rom-com elements feel dated and towards the end of the movie, a little bit unearned, but there's something truly special about hearing The Beatles iconic music on screen amidst a charming love story, something we've been missing this summer.7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Homage to Beatles and perks of plagiarism,"The concept of the movie is nothing short of brilliant, though delivery is solid, but not stellar. Still, it is a good movie, with lots of Beatles music celebrated in a nice way, but the movie is a bit light when tackling issues of plagiarism, cost of fame, corruption of the music industry etc. It can also be inspiring from time to time, showing how a true gift of genius must feel like and how it is, supposedly, validated despite of some misunderstandings and corruption on many levels in modern society. Some lighthearted humor and pretty formulaic love story is there also along the way. The movie is somewhat ruined by casting of one pretty lame SNL actress, who just cannot act and is so over the top disgust ing that she unwittingly parodies the intended music industry parody and undermines the otherwise pretty decent movie. However, music of the boy band from Liverpool saves the day time and again, and shows how true talent and genius looks like, almost by contrast.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Let it be.....,"Yesterday is a film that with this title could so easily have written its own obituaries, but with Danny Boyle at the helm this film has sailed thru what could have been troubled waters.We have a cookie premise of one man who finds after an accident he's the only one in his new reality to have ever heard of the Beatles. Taking advantage of this, he climbs up the ladder of fame but really the real prize that he must Kearny is to win the heart of his childhood sweetheart.It generally avoids cliché, its fun and sassy, but most importantly pays genuine homage to The Beatles and the roots of the songs.

Inventive story and a very entertaining evening of Beatles music.,"Set and filmed in England, British actor Himesh Patel as Jack Malik is a teacher but an aspiring songwriter. The problem is his songs aren't very good. He has a long-time friend, also a teacher, Lily James as Ellie Appleton, who actually serves as his manager although he doesn't get much work as an entertainer.Then something very unusual happens, the result is that Jack seems to be the only one in the world who knows who the Beatles are. A web search turns up nothing. When he starts to play and sing ""Yesterday"" for his friends they love his song, they had never heard it before. Same with all the other Beatles songs that he can remember. His career takes off, he gets the attention of a big USA record producer.It was nice to hear all the Beatles music but the thrust of the story is mostly his coming to terms with his guilt in having everyone think he is a great songwriter. Also coming to realize that maybe he and Ellie have much more than just a ""friendship.""Even Ed Sheeran has a role, not just a one-scene cameo. Good movie and the acting is very appropriate.My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. We enjoyed it very much, it is one of the better movies we have seen in recent months. Then we re-watched it in August 2020, about 10 months later and it was still good and mostly fresh.",,Anonymous,Music
Tunes and Cinematography Share the Honours,"Despite pre-release Australian reviews for Danny Boyle's Yesterday being decidedly underwhelming, it had a full house at the large theatre at which I saw it on a Sunday afternoon. Apart from a few young shavers, In my fifties, I was at the youthful end of the watching demographic - there were several blue-rinses.Yesterday tells of The Beatles becoming wiped from history after a 12-second world power outage. A young and unsuccessful songwriter from a sleepy English seaside town, Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), is seemingly the only person now alive who knows of the band and their catalogue, having received a concussion at the precise moment of the power cut. After realising he's not victim to a large scale meta joke, that The Beatles really have been expunged from memory in this parallel universe, he starts 'composing' their songs, ultimately to be lauded as the world's greatest songwriter. But does it bring him happiness and love?The idea is great, the execution less so.Screenplay is from Richard Curtis who seems to have been on auto-pilot during its writing. His CV in the last 30 years is beyond impressive, but we all have off days. Its well-worn and simple premise of guilt and unacknowledged love ran very shallow, its jokes often laboured.And too many of the support characters are plain annoying and irritating rather than endearing; sadly, the usually marvellous Sanjeev Bhaskar as Jack's Dad is the chief culprit in this regard. An extended support performance from Ed Sheeran stretched his limited acting experience beyond credibility.Likewise, in his first big screen outing, Himesh Patel as the film's star had difficulty imposing himself. His delivery of the Lennon-McCartney and Harrison songs was, however, generally impressive, a lack of tone only occasionally showing.Cinematography from Christopher Ross was first rate, the concert footage especially so. The mainly English locations showed that country in a good light - including a brief montage of Liverpool's exceptional civic architecture.The film is inoffensive, the soundtrack exceptional (does that need saying?), but ultimately extremely lightweight. But it's always going to be worth seeing for the tunes.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
BORING!,"I was really disappointed with this film. Never once did it actually grab my interest. Jack Malik was so bland, and uninteresting, that you never once learn anything about him. I couldn't tell if he was trying to act as the character, or if he was trying to be himself.The comedic bits aren't even that. They're such incredibly awkward moments that happen in the movie, that it almost felt like we had to have a person hold up a sign that said ""Haha"", JUST to specify that they were meant to be comedic scenes! If I have to sit there, and wonder ""was that meant to be funny?"" then it clearly failed.Pacing. This movie is rushed. It's fast in all the wrong ways, and it's slow, in all the wrong ways. It never takes a moment to breathe, nor does it take a moment for us to take in the scenes. And the scenes that SHOULD be rushed? Like all the awkward scenes with Ed Sheeran, and Jack's bland, stereotypical (insert greedy manager here)? They drag on for forever!And yes, the elephant in the room. The pointless subplot romance with his best friend/manager Ellie. I'm sorry, but I thought it was just..unnecessary. And there isn't much chemistry between the two of them. I'm sure there's people who thought it was okay, and that's fine, but me, personally? It just slowed the ""energy"" (what energy the movie even had), and just brought everything to a halt.TL;DR: The movie is not worth spending money at a theater. It's a one-and-done movie. It's boring, both rushed and slow, it's just not an interesting movie. Honestly, I'd only spend $4.00 to rent 'Yesterday', and say 'Alright, I saw it'. Basically, I wouldn't recommend this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Two different stories into one,"This film felt like 2 different stories within one film. One was the main story of Yesterday which was very innovative and interesting, while the other was much leas creative, just a cliché story seen in many previous films. The good acting and chemistry between the 2 main characters saved the film, but that love story weakened the plot. The film could've been a great opportunity to examine whether the Beatles songs would've been relevant in today's society or not, or at least tried to make the audience think about that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The acting and singing work of the main characters carries the film together with the music of the Beatles.,"Yesterday is a new fantasy comedy directed by Danny Boyle, the director of 127 Hours, 28 Days later and Slumdog Millionaire.In the film, musician Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) has a hard time breaking into the music world. The only one who really supports him is his good friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James).
When Jack is hit and recovered during a worldwide power outage, he realizes that he is the only one who still knows the music of the band The Beatles. For example, he decides to use the Beatles songs himself during his performances. In this way he manages to break through in the music world, but he still feels insecure, knowing that he has not invented or written his songs himself. As long as he remembers the songs of the Beatles, he can remain successful. His new success is somewhat at the expense of his relationship with his parents and with Ellie.This film plays in a comical way with dealing with secret plagiarism and copyright problems. For Danny Boyle it was also an expensive film to make, because he has to pay for the rights of the certain Beatles songs, which can be heard in the film. Buying these rights has fortunately been a good buy, because in addition to the mysterious plot of the story, the film is further supported by well-known music. They also know how to make some jokes about the music world and how things are going nowadays with this film. The film also has other fun comic moments, but the trailers do give away some of the nicer moments. To enjoy the movie more, you better try not to see the trailers.The acting and singing work is done well and nicely in this film. Himeesh Patel and Lily James have good chemistry together. Himesh also shows how celebrity and money can turn people into a completely different person. Kate Mckinnon plays her role in this film somewhat exaggerated, as she often does in all her roles, but here she knows how to put it down appropriately. Furthermore, some music artists such as Ed Sheeran also have a cameo in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Then in a freak event all the world forgets the Beatles.... Jack appears to be the only person to share the brilliance of the plethora of Beatles music, it's a gold mine. It gave us all an appreciation of what the Beatles gave us and through this event we get to listen to all these classic songs like we are listening to them for the FIRST time.

A pleasant enough trifle...,"This was a pleasant trifle, a big cone of pink fluffy cotton candy that we enjoyed and then promptly forgot about.

I love their music, but they were also as much a product of the right time and place as anything else, and lots of other great artists didn't have as much success because they weren't mop-topped white boys singing catchy tunes.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie to heal lost souls. Happiness is back to movies,"The film is as much as lighty as light. Nowadays even in comedy we experience the characters facing many struggles and difficulties all along the way. Losing the charme and beauty of the softness of a simple story. Here in ""Yesterday"" Boyle was able to mix all together a bit of fantasy, good music and so much love without tragedy.Yesterday moves from a simple point. The main character Jack (played by Himesh Patel) a simple guy and not professional musician (really not-so-good-at music), after a car incident during a worldwide electrical blackout, finds out that The Beatles have disappeared from the memories of all the people in the world: they never existed. He decide to re-write the story playing all the forgotten and never played songs. Success without being ""his"" is however a burden too difficult to carry for the good-hearted Jack, who all the way to the success is about to lose the love of its life Ellie. But this movie is about finding simple but important things. So nothing is lost . All is saved and everyone has its ""happily ever after"". Being a story simple and happy has become a rarity this days, registers have forgotten that the people needs happiness to fight the harsh times we live in. We do need more movies such this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The premise of the film is unique and makes for some good running and in jokes.

A love story first and foremost,"Music based films are all the rage at the moment. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' did astoundingly well both with audiences and award ceremonies, 'Rocketman' seems to be a hit and now we have 'Yesterday'. 'Yesterday' is a little bit different in the sense that it is a fictional story which utilises the music of an extremely popular band from the 60s rather than just straight up telling their story. In fact this is one of the best ideas for a movie I can remember. The whole world forgets about The Beatles except for one person. The possibilities that lends itself to are endless.I didn't actually realise until after seeing the movie that there was only a select few (20 I believe) songs that they had rights to. That possibly explains a little why the film often feels more about the love story at its centre than the music itself. The love story was actually very well written (both characters were extremely likeable) but I did often think I would like to be hearing a little more music. Too often songs were cut short or were chopped around a joke relating to interrupting the song.The biggest flaw in this movie for me was the humour. Far too often jokes fell flat. The character of 'Rocky' was clearly designed as the comic relief, and the character was perfect, but the jokes written for him were not up to standard. It felt like they were trying far too hard. An obvious joke is never as funny as a subtle one. Ed Sheeran's involvement with the film was a master stroke though. They didn't over-use him and when he was on screen it was fascinating to watch. I had a good time with 'Yesterday' no doubt about it. I can't help wondering though if things were done a little differently whether this could have been a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"A bit random, but stick with it.","I don't know if this is a great film or if it's just the great songs, but it's very good. Yes it's pretty silly, in a cheesy romcom fashion, but it's fantasy, pure indulgent fantasy and boy is it fun. Jack gets hit by a bus during a 12 second worldwide blackout. It's not explained why, that's not the point, let's not get technical, it's fantasy remember. When he comes around in hospital, no one remembers The Beatles, no one except our struggling musician hero. It's a bit random, but stick with it. Himesh Patel it has to be said does play and sing beautifully and for all the charm of this film, the highlights are clearly the musical interludes. That's not to say there's little else here, the cast is pretty impeccable and as instantly lovable as the songs. We get a few little jokes about Oasis and Coca-Cola not existing either and bit part Joel Fry threatens to steal the show on several occasions. Ed Sheeran's fairly lengthy and reoccurring cameo is... well it's cringey really, but still quite amusing. If only for the fact it highlights just how whimsically crap his music is. Alright putting him up against The Beatles is a touch unfair and he's clearly having fun with it himself, having 'Shape of You' as his ringtone when Jack calls him. Of course the elephant in the room is that Jack's rich seam of songwriting is all built on a lie. It all starts with a rollercoaster of excitement as Jack realises that fame and fortune are his, as long as he can remember all the words and figure out the chords. But as things begin to snowball and he's schmoozed by intentionally repulsive American record executives, Jack moves further away from himself, his home and most notably Ellie, his friend, original manager and painfully obvious love interest. It's all very sweet, quite generic and predicable with its happy ending, but it is entertaining and damn those songs are good!",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Yesterday Will Not Be Remembered Tomorrow,"Yesterday is a movie with an intriguing concept, that suffers from poor execution. The movie follows Jack Malik, played my Himesh Patel, who is a struggling singer-songwriter that plagiarises songs from The Beatles in an alternate timeline where they do not exist. Jack is a likeable character, with an interesting arc and he has fantastic chemistry with Lily James' character; Ellie Appleton. The problem with the film is that how the alternate timeline is created isn't explained. A global blackout occurs and afterwards, The Beatles don't exist. How does a global blackout cause The Beatles to vanish from history? The movie doesn't explain. How is Jack the only person that remembers The Beatles? Also not explained. If the basic premise of your movie is extremely confusing and doesn't make any sense then it doesn't matter how good anything else in the movie is, because the whole movie takes place because of a gigantic plot hole. Even if there was one throw away line that briefly summed it up that I missed, that's not an effective way to explain the biggest plot point of the movie. Yesterday is an okay movie with good acting, likeable characters and good music, but it's premise makes zero sense and leaves your head hurting as a result.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A charming and original film!,"I'd consider myself a huge Beatles fan (I'm 20 y/o so not exactly my generations kind of music), I was so excited for this movie. For me, the movie didn't have to be great, but hearing the music in the theater would be remarkable in and of itself. But this movie exceeded my expectations. Is it a perfect film? No, absolutely not. But in an age of superhero movies and musical biopics, to have such an original idea be brought to life about a band that is seemingly larger than life was a joy to watch. There are a few sequences and jokes that don't hit their mark, but the theme of the movie certainly does. Love. It was more of a romance than I thought it would be, but the undeniable chemistry between Jack (Himesh Patel) and Ellie (the lovely Lily James) turned this movie from solid to a very good movie. You begun to wonder halfway through the third act how they're going to tie this together and let's just say, you won't see it coming. All I have to say is: Wow. The movie also reminded me how timeless their music is, being a fan I have to say you come to re-appreciate the genius of Paul and George and Ringo and John, in a way that cut's even deeper while paired with the romance with Jack and Ellie. If you are not a Beatles fan (how can you not be?), the movie will undoubtedly lose some of it's effect and charm, but it will still carry itself through guest appearances by Ed Sheeran (who did a very good job) and funny sequences. All in all a 7.7/10, the feel good movie of the summer with great performances and original story, that is paired with some of the greatest songs ever written!

"A fun, sweet-natured film that truly does bring to light how much impact The Beatles have left on the world","Yesterday is a fantasy comedy written by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually). Directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Trainspotting), it is a lighthearted romp brought to life by some great music and acting performances.Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling musician from a small town in England whose dreams of making it big are beginning to fade. One night, the entire world experiences a twelve second blackout and during this time Jack is struck by a bus and is later hospitalised. Upon being discharged, Jack is astonished to discover that he is now the only person on Earth who remembers The Beatles and their music. Using this to his advantage, Jack starts passing off Beatles songs as his own to assist him in becoming the famous rockstar he always wanted to be.Even though it doesn't quite achieve the satirical edge it hopes for, Yesterday is still a fun, sweet-natured film that truly does bring to light how much impact The Beatles have left on the world, whether we realise it or not. The film has a distinctly British flavour and it's unlikely it will appeal to international audiences, where some of the more subtle eccentricities may go right over their heads. The overall premise is similar to the 2006 TV series ""Life On Mars"", where the main character is hit by a vehicle and transported to an alternate timeline, although this film is considerably more comedic in tone. Danny Boyle seems like an odd choice of director for a film like this, but he does a pretty good job carrying this unorthodox subject matter the whole way through. All of The Beatles songs featured are used perfectly during the film's big musical moments, and are expertly performed by newcomer Himesh Patel in the lead role. Surprisingly, a supporting appearance from Ed Sheeran of all people provided some of the film's funniest moments, as he proves to have solid comic timing. While not a must-see on the big screen, this film would certainly be worth a watch upon home release.I rate it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music

What was he planning to do when he ran out of Beatles' songs?!,"I was scrolling around and this title came up which rang some vague bell and it sounded a little interesting so I watched. The first thing that really stunned me was that it was directed by Danny Boyle and that I didn't remember a film by such a major director. Be that as it may, this little curiosity about a so-so musician experiencing an event that causes him to awaken to a world that has never heard of the Beatles. However, he now knows how to become a successful musician and lives in an increasingly whirlwind life learning about the joys and pitfalls of fame. There are a number of cute ideas in this film, but its biggest asset by far is Himesh Patel who I had no idea was this talented. His performance is right on target, but the major surprise is his awesome singing and guitar playing talents. There are four others in this that I admire, though more in other places. Lily James is always sweet, but she has had much better roles than this.

A unique experience,"To set your expectations straight, there's very little Beatles in this story. I feel like people are going to expect something the likes of Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman, but that's not the case.
This story is more about the lead character, with the sprinkled essence of the Beatles.
Now that we've got that out of the way, this was an absolute delight.
It's been some time since I've seen a Danny Boyle film, but I'm glad he's still got that unique touch.This movie feels different. It's shot quite well (beautiful cinematography), the humor is brilliant (I burst out laughing multiple times), the story is fun (absolutely childish), the themes are subtle (but impactful) and the character satire is on point. Everyone has memorable moments in this film.The story is a weird mix of unpredictable and cliche, but it's paced well. The first two acts fly by, leaving you with a slightly long,but acceptable climax. It's also riddled with meta-references,so if pop culture is your thing, entertainment is guaranteed.If you appreciate the following, you will enjoy this film - British dark comedy, the music industry, irony and anti-humor, the love for Beatles (in that order)I know that this is a relatively minor film in the summer scape,but it's worth your time,if you choose to see it. It's most certainly the funniest movie I've seen this summer.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Just Suspend Belief, Sit Back, & Enjoy The Music","A world without the Beatles, as some have already observed, would mean we would not have much of the music we enjoy today - they are that important. Not only did they influence music, they changed the way music was recorded, marketed and managed. They had more control over their music in the recording studio than the vast majority of new recording artists in the 60s, so paved the way in so many ways.But what about the movie? It's a nice romance with good comedic actors and some really good music (if you like the Beatles, that is...and if you don't, you're just trying to be cool!).

Charming even to those who do not love The Beatles,"Despite not being as familiar with the Beatles as everyone else appears to be, I still enjoyed Yesterday quite a bit-- and that is why the film is so good. The film can entertain audiences that aren't necessarily head-over-heels with Abbey Road or yellow submarines or songs about people named Jude. While other contemporary love letters to bands (Bohemian Rhapsody, The Dirt) focus entirely on the band itself, this film honors the Beatles by telling a story of the world without them-- a world in need of a voice to tell their stories. This is where the conflict comes from: does Jack Malik plagiarize the Beatles or not? This premise is fun, lighthearted, and thoroughly enjoyable in execution by Danny Boyle, who clearly understand what this film needs to be.The film's heart is not the Beatles, it is Jack Malik (the outstanding newcomer Himesh Patel) and the choices he makes. The story/romance between Jack and Ellie is what pushes the film forward, and the Beatles-never-existed premise is merely the vehicle to do so. At the core of this film are two strong performances, a simple message about telling the truth, and a heartwarming love story.No, the film's cartoonish nature isn't going to blow audiences away. But what the film lacks in terms of originality and depth, it makes up in charm. Yesterday is wholly satisfying to those who want to be satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Better movie than the overall score implies,"Fans of the Beatles and of science fiction probably rate this higher than those who are neither. Being both, I hoped for a little more development of the parallel time aspect (See Back to the Future II, which Carl Sagan rated as the best movie about the aspects of time travel ever. **someone goes back in time and changes something that alters the course of events, creating an alternate parallel time**.) Lily James' character was a bit more girl-next-door than was absolutely necessary, but she is a joy to watch in that role, nonetheless. Otherwise the Beatles music is very well presented--a couple songs were better than the original versions, IMO. The IMDB score as of this writing is 6.9, but this is a way better movie than that. Well worth the price of rental!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Why would they want to ruin this one?,It was embarrassing to see the promising first half expertly killed in the second half.

An issue of misappropriation,"There's the world of ""high-concept"" movies in Hollywood, and then there's ""Yesterday"". One can easily imagine a pitch meeting for this project at Britain's Working Title banner, but the fact that it was made and achieved success in the marketplace is certainly a singular event.This falls into the category of a gimmick run wild. Actually two gimmicks, but the second one from sci-fi's ""worlds of if?"" subgenre is a spoiler, and didn't work for me at all -perhaps because of its clumsy handling in this script and finished film. Directed by Danny Boyle, who insists on defying any variation of the Auteur Theory regarding film directors by insisting on tackling eclectic subjects, except for his payday horror series ""28..."".Himesh Patel, an unlikely leading man if ever there was one, stars as the little guy whose dreams of stardom seem dashed until he suffers an accident just as all the power in the world goes out for a few fateful seconds. He wakes up and is astonished to find that it's become a parallel world straight out of fantasy: everything's the same except, for starters, The Beatles and Coca-Cola and cigarettes never existed. Sounds a bit like a Jim Jarmusch riff.That goofy premise is strung out to its predictable conclusion (a fake Hollywood ending if ever there was one). It's often whimsical, sometimes endearing, at times clever and frequently irreverent, but never the satirical gem that writer Richard Curtis thought he concocted, Like many a shaggy-dog tale there's a mysterious compulsion to keep watching and listening, waiting for the other shoe to drop.The bad news is that about at the halfway mark, when seriousness creeps in, it is presented as a rather corny satire of easy targets, such as marketing experts and the entire phony nature of celebrity. Yes, false goals and false values have done in our unlikely hero. So what else is new. When the bubble bursts, Curtis and Boyle fall back on stock movie cliches -very disappointing.ChatGPT hadn't been dumped on an unsuspecting public yet when this movie was made, but it the film still plays like an AI-generated project, most especially in that second gimmick that tries in vain to assuage not only the hero's conscience but to paper over egregious plot holes. In movies, sentimentality is often the last refuge of a scoundrel, to steal the cliche about false-patriotism, and in that sense Curtis and Boyle are scoundrels. One need only watch ""Sweet Smell of Success"" or the best films of Billy Wilder (e.g., ""The Apartment"" and ""Ace in the Hole"") to see how this subject might have been treated trenchantly rather than in saccharine fashion.",,Anonymous,Music
Half way good,It's an enjoyable film and is actually quite funny at some points. Through out the movie there is a lot of over acting that created a weird atmosphere. The story seemed to get lost about half way through and it couldn't really recover after that. Over all it's worth going to see but not seeing twice.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Ana de Armas was missing from this movie,"There was a reason I didn't go see this movie when it first came out; I just didn't think I would enjoy it, and the trailer seemed off-putting to me. Now it was free on cable so I gave it a go, and I was pleasantly surprised, however it could have been a lot better, so this is going to be a mixed review.So, the first thing, this is a romantic comedy. It's not the story of the Beatles, it's not how the songs came to be, but that's ok. It guarantees a phenomenal soundtrack, even Jack's original songs are sort of funny in their mediocracy. Unlike some romantic comedies, the acting here is actually good and casting such as Kate McKinnon (SNL) as the pushy agent is perfect. Not to mention Ed Sheeran who is doing a superb job as himself without showing off as cocky and giving a great acting performance.I found the premise of the movie (certain things are erased from existence) to be fresh and thought-provoking. Every time you toy with something like that, or time travel, etc, there are always potential existential problems, but I thought this idea was kinda genius and makes this movie stand out from the rest. It is funny at times but not Roll-on-the-floor kinda funny at any point.So whats the problem with this movie? Well, it was actually the rom-com part. There are too many cringe moments in the love story that is Malik and Ellie, and I noticed I started looking at my watch about 3/4 into the movie, just waiting for the conclusion. In other words it became a bit boring and unemotional towards the end, it needed some jolt that never came and even the big finale was a big cringe.I heard that Ana de Armas was casted into this movie but was later removed to it 'hurting the romance between the two main actors'. I feel something like that maybe was what was missing from the linear progression and give some excitement to this ultimately predictable romance. I know it's a British style movie, but still, the hottest moment in this movie is a kiss on the forehead between Malik and his agent? Think about it.Overall, great premise, great potential but unfortunately only partial delivery. Sill I recommend this movie as a break from the movies that just repeat each other and to reminisce on the great music that was the Beatles. Guide: No nudity, no sex, no violence, few cuss words. Exact score: 74 / 100.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
could of been so much better,"We watched this movie last night on Netflix, to be honest know very little about the plot or who was in it beforehand, which I generally I prefer.We had seen in the last year, Bohemian rhapsody and Rocket Man, both great movies, really enjoyed themOn the whole I enjoyed this one as well, but it could of been so much better. I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but the best thing about the movie is the music, would be nothing without it. I had forgotten how many classic pieces of music they had wrote.Lily James is great, last saw her in the 'Dig' , she has something extra about her.Problem for me was Himesh Patel, he just wasn't believable as a struggle rock star and zero chemistry between him and Lily James.

"I saw the Beatles Live, yea yea yea yea!","My review is so bias, you may want to consider it a protectionist take on sacred material or a passionate fans expert labor of love love love.

The characters are all well intending likable pieces of a plot that is destined to have a happy and fulfilling ending. You would think with all that said, I would give it a 10, wish I could because the stories that good. Here's one rub; the underlying love element doesn't quite work, there is just no chemistry between the lead actors. Her performance is solid and his isn't bad but there's just no one screen magic. Here's the big rub; Himesh Patel who plays Jack Malik and carries the mail, sort of speak, for The Beatles, is a decent actor that has a task he's not up too. Too many of the performances of Beatles masterpieces, he's off pitch and then butchers a couple of songs which the Beatles material protectionist in me finds offensive. Bottom line, Patel was miscast. To me that was the real flaw in this otherwise Oscar worthy film. So the fault lies with the producer on this one, not Patel. I really wish you cared about these two people getting together and that The Beatles music was expertly performed and produced. If that were the case, Yesterday would have been one of my favorite films of all time. By the way Ed Sheeran does a great job as himself.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Suspension of disbelief is key here,"While I did enjoy the concept of this movie, it's really hard to believe that people would be swooning over The Beatles music if their music was released today. They were as big as they were because of the time period they were in, and nobody would become the most famous singer/songwriter today for writing their music, because that's just not where the most popular music today sits. That's not what the general public wants. Their music, if released in the 2020's, would be seen as Indy-pop-rock at best.

It isn't Enough To Be Kind,"The man of this film sing a song as if he made it by original,but they are the beatle's song and the people around him are't know that fact in the story.The subject of this film is that being honesty is most important to live.

important.Especially when we create something to imitate is needed.At the same time we have to keep the people not to notice the origin.This film tells us that it is safer for us to keep in mind that other people know the things more than we know.It is easy to say that to be honesty is important but to be succeeded is also large motivation to act something.

A charming musical and romantic dystopia,"SummaryYesterday is a charming combination of dystopia, romantic comedy, fairy tale and tribute film, about an amateur singer who wakes up in a world that does not keep track of The Beatles.ReviewJack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a repositor in a supermarket and at night he sings his songs in some bars in his town or at small festivals, counting on the support of him as a ""representative"" of his friend Ellie (Lily James ). After suffering an accident that coincides with a strange global phenomenon, Jack awakens in a world where there are no traces of The Beatles. This circumstance will give a decisive turn to his life.Danny Boyle's latest film aptly combines several genres: ""focused"" dystopia, romantic comedy, fairy tale and tribute film, and does so with its usual visual power and never-ending pacing. And the result is lovely.Although dystopia and humor are giving way to romantic comedy, the first never disappears and reserves at least two very original and emotional moments. Its premise is not only a plot trigger, but brings up several themes: fame as an accident and as a mystery, musical precursors, songs and their context of creation, the musical legacy, the timelessness of genius, the unexpected connections of elements belonging to different scopes and categories. And the story is staging them in an ingenious way (and often funny) and never forced.Patel is perfect as Jack in his extraordinary circumstance (and also sings very well) and the Ellie of the lovely Lily James knows how to shine both her lights and her shadows. There is a prominent participation of singer Ed Sheeran and Kate McKinnon moves at ease in the role of a powerful and ruthless artist representative.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The Beatles still kick,"What would the world look like if one of the greatest bands ever were wiped off the face of the earth? That's the premise of the movie Yesterday. The world experiences a global black out in which the entire Beatles catalog has gone, and only one person remembers them, struggling musician Jack Malick. He decides to utilize the accident towards his advantage, and pass of the Beatles songs as his own.Malik discovers that he's the only person that remembers the Beatles. This happenstance is the opening he needed to turn his failing career around. Once he starts passing of the songs as his and uploading them on YouTube, he becomes an internet sensation.The foundation of this movie isn't the Beatles, contrary to popular opinion. It's having your dream come true and realizing it's not what you expected. Like so many before him, he's excited to have an audience finally, but the more his videos receive clicks, the more prominent the demand. Naturally, this requires him to leave behind everyone he loves, including Ellie, his best friend/manager/booking agent. Their relationship is one of the themes of this movies. There are many sections in this film, friendship, success, and self-worth are few Jack Malik grapples while navigating success.There is going to be two types of audiences for this movie. Beatle fans and fans that are looking to escape monsters or superheroes.The Beatle fans are going to feel disappointed at the commercialization of these songs. After all, they were written to commemorate love, awareness, or even conflict. The latter is happy to see a movie with a human-interest story without special effects. How to do you weave those two worlds together? First, you can't take this as a blueprint for the music industry.Second, you must accept that this generation wasn't raised on the Beatles like previous generations. There are more Oasis and Radio Head fans. Also, this story is about Jack thinking success was going to solve all his problems; instead, it created more.I enjoyed Himesh Patel as Jack Malik, he was funny and believable as a struggling artist. Lily James is charming as his love interest. I wish their coming together were written a little more interesting instead, we knew that these two would fall in love.Kate McKinnon was spot on as Jack's slick new manager. She makes no qualms about looking at him as a cash cow, not an artist. The most delightful characters in Yesterday however are Rock and Mr./Mrs. Malik.Rock portrayed by Joel Fry is the worst Road Manager; however, this is what makes him so charming. The guy with the worst time management is now in charge of the hottest artist in the world. The scenes between Fry and Patel are some of the funniest in the film. I also enjoyed that Ed Sheeran was willing to let this film make fun of his persona.Veteran comedic actors Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal are hilarious as Jack's parents. They are so underwhelmed by Jack's desire to be a musician that even when he plays a classic Beatles song they don't care.If you're looking for accuracy, you will be disappointed in Yesterday, but if you're willing to invest in Jack Malick this will work for you. After all success doesn't guarantee happiness. Yesterday is a feel-good movie also it was nice to imagine how this generation would react to John, Paul, Ringo and John.Diversity- This movie gets a 7 the lead was brit of Indian descentScale- this movie receives a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I wonder why the film maker and/or writers chose Eleanor Rigby as the song whose lyrics Jack couldn't remember. The reason isn't intimated in the movie. The other point is the appearance of a couple of older people who knew who the Beatles are. But Jack is supposed to be the only one in this alternate timeline who knows about the Beatles and their songs. Someone pointed out that the reason might be found in the movie, Letter to Brezhnev. Sorry, I haven't watched it yet so I wouldn't know the possible connection. And, lastly, the encounter of you-know-who and Jack may be or may not be a thrill for the viewer.

I apologize to the haters but I've seen well over 1500 movies in my lifetime. I love a great hero action movie, (like Gladiator), anything by Quentin Tarantino and yes, I love a nice happy ending movie like this one.Perhaps I love it more because I'm a child of the sixties or perhaps those who didn't appreciate it were not. I still remember the day John was tragically taken from us and yes, I teared up when Jack drove out to see John.The world truly is a better place with the Beatles music and if you like a nice message with this as its premise then I suggest you watch this one.I still occasionally buy the DVDs for movies I love watching again and again....

A heart warming movie.,"Yesterday has a very interesting premise to start with. It's a very fresh idea and I haven't seen anything like this before. Yesterday is a musical fantasy but it's more a romantic comedy. The writers and Danny Boyle gave importance to rom-com than exploring the main idea of the movie. It could have been a lot more good or lot more worse if they explored it more. But still, you'll get a cute rom-com with very good performances and very good songs.

Maybe another day?,"If 'The Inbetweeners' (2008) or 'Absolutely Fabulous' (1992) producers had made 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018) it would have been something like this film. There's even some elements of 'Teachers' (2001) in here, down to the incidental soundtrack to start with.It's definitely an interesting concept, but I'm not sure that it was executed brilliantly. The back catalogue of The Beatles and their lives, both as a group and individually is so immense and fantastic that they really should have been given a more sensible treatment akin to that of Bo Rap and The Iron Lady (2011), Etc. John, Paul, George and Ringo are incredibly important to British history after all. I vote that someone makes a series out of their unique lives.This particular representation was slightly silly and somewhat cheapened by the balloons and banners that went across the screen at times. It felt a bit like a made for TV Bank Holiday special because of it.That doesn't mean that it's not enjoyable, but it's just not outstanding and doesn't do justice to the Fab Fours legacy. You can watch it easily and without paying it too much attention. It's a good film to have on in the background.I will say that everyone played there parts well and naturally, even Ed Sheeran, who it is nice to see branching out in to films. He is a very talented man all round and funny too.I did wonder whether Ed would have still made it in to the limelight if the Beatles had never been and why Coke was suddenly not available too.The lead character is not particularly likeable, even to begin with, but as he learns his lesson you do warm to him.I also hated his version of Help, which even though he sang well throughout otherwise, was quite badly sung and reworked.Fun and light, but it could have been something awesome.568.65/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"An insightful thought provoking comedy, till almost the end","A fantastic idea well executed with some great details and insight. The characters were fun and funny, in a low key British way. I loved the multi racial but still British landscape, also this is one of those rare films with no cartoon baddie verses good set up, there is no real baddie in the movie, (much like miyazaki's totoro and kiki's), and the interest comes from looking into the what ifs more than the unrequited love aspect, which was well done and Lily James was gorgeous and Himesh Patel was suitably oblivious etc, it was needed for the story but it lead to be the rather too neat and tidy focus of the ending, ie it ended up being a love story more than an intriguing sci fi one.
I loved how the story didn't try an make a blackmail aspect to the 'others' story angle, showing Richard Curtis didn't want to go for the obvious with this film, and instead chose fascinating angles to investigate.
And that went right through to the jokes and set ups. The board meeting didn't play it for cliche laughs but those laughs were definitely there.
Ed Sheeran was pretty gracious with laughs at his expense too, the Rap line was great, and he was pretty low key in his delivery.
Just a pleasant fun watch with some great thought provoking set ups and of course a show case for the genius of the Beatles songs, which were on the whole really well delivered. Dan Pemberton soundtrack too to augment an already excellent collection of material.
Pretty much wins all around except for the cheesy romance ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Remembering The Beatles,"Following a global power outage that lasted 12 seconds, the world remains without many things of notoriety, of which nobody remembers anything.

Only problem is, it's either that or lose the girl who's loved him for almost 20 years. A fascinating storyline based on a ""what if"" scenario which leaves you thinking. Excellent acting with a typically ""no nonsense"", light-hearted British script.

Expected more,"The premise is actually quite fascinating, and the real reason why I decided to watch this movie. But the execution is somewhat disappointing. The supporting characters are the biggest problem for me, most of them are extremely unlikable and uninteresting, and more often than not kind of annoying. Especially Rocky and Kate McKinnon's character. The writers are obviously inspired by The Office and similar types of sarcastic humor in films and series. For me, it did not work, and it made the characters come off as mostly shallow and cynical.I also feel like the tone of the film varies quite a lot, from joyful to dark and depressing. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but I felt like this one was desperately in need of some momentum. At least I wanted it to be one of two things, either a fun kind of Bruce Almighty-comedy, or a gritty Coen Brothers-drama. It ended up being neither of those things, just sort of flat.The ending also threw me quite a bit, but I won't go into details.

"Fun, heartwarming, and no superheroes.","Well, I suppose that Jack is somewhat of a hero, or anti-hero. I wish that studios would do more good old-fashioned films like this.

I do believe that it is a generational film however. I am in my fifties (boomer/X Gen cusp) and I went to see it with my aunt and uncle who are in their eighties and they really liked it but they were not really a part of that generation who experienced Beatlemania, even if they observed it at the time. And millennials and Z Gen's really don't have an appreciation of what the Beatles actually did to the popular music scene at that crucial point in the 60s. They really don't understand the importance and impact that the Beatles had culturally on the entire world. And of course pop music has changed drastically in just the last decade or so with all the hip hop influence. Makes me wonder what the Beatles would have done with hip hop. Would they have adapted it and built upon it? That is what they did best with the musical strains of their time, so why not? Anyway, great film. Fun, fun fun! Himesh Patel is very endearing and such a tremendous voice in his own right. And Lilly James is a remarkable actress who unfortunately is stuck in the role of pretty girlfriend in several excellent movies (Yesterday, of cours and Baby Driver) and I hope she can break out of that an go on to some lead roles in the future.

One of the most inventive plots in recent years.,"Just by reading the plot you immediately raise an eyebrow in sign of interest. However unsure of how ultimately the effort will result, I went in with a small percentage of engagement and felt that the story was rightfully executed and with a proper hint of sensitivity. A struggling musician suffers an accident and after that he realizes that no one but him has ever heard of The Beatles, which at first he thought was some sort of an elaborate prank but when he actually did some research online discovered the awful reality. Not only are The Beatles missing but some other big names like Coca-Cola. So as he was living in humiliating conditions as a musician he decides to start playing Beatles songs and make them pass as his own, which takes him to stardom.At some point one inevitably tries to figure out where the story is going to go, but I was unsure how everything was going to play out in the case of this film, which made it much more intriguing and engaging. Himesh Patel fantastically executes Beatles' tunes and give them his own spin which is always refreshing and much more fitting for the film.A truly exciting and original film that flew under the radar.

It's a light, old-fashioned, feel-good fantasy comedy that is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for after seeing the trailer.While I am able to suspend disbelief over the whole no-Beatles thing, I find the relationship between the singer and his manager less believable. For it to work out as he did he would have had to be far stupider and more awkward than he was.

"""I've Just Seen a....Film?""","I looked forward to ""Yesterday"" with great anticipation, not because I'm a huge Beatles or Danny Boyle fan, but because the British make marvellous ""little"" films about rock and roll. Witness ""Still Crazy"", ""That's Be the Day / Stardust"" and ""Sing Street"". The premise is interesting, the characters all seemed real and Himesh Patel looked like he could really play the guitar. And that scene in the trailer when he sings ""Something"" on the Corben Show...oh wait. That wasn't in the movie after all(??). Having just left the theatre to catch a matinee showing, I've got say I am a bit disappointed. The music was great, as expected. I l love the straight covers and the neo-punk version of ""Help"". But..it's the Beatles after all. The acting is first rate on all levels, and the inside record industry humour hits the mark. So where does ""Yesterday"" not work? It's the plot, that petty film device that makes celluloid magic seem almost like real life. It's that element that makes super-heroes and super-villains and web-slinging crime fighters seem almost plausible. Maybe ET's really are out there, and what if we could time travel or make ourselves shrink to the size of an ant. I was looking forward to the explanation of how the Beatles, and other things, just never happened. Just some kind of half boiled rubbish about post-concussion syndrome or exploding supernovas would have worked. But really, aside from a throw away one liner early in the film, it was not mentioned. That was a let down. Some plot lines, which I won't give away, were just left hanging, as if someone forgot to roll reel 6.
There was an awesome scene near the end with the return of a legend, but that was really the only scene that might endure as a classic. There were other moments that came close, but most just didn't hit the mark. Still, an entertaining night out, and great memories for Beatles fans. But would I see it again? ""Not a Second Time"".

One Of My Favourite Movies Of The Year,"I just got out of YesterdayI loved it. Seriously one of my favourites of the year. I knew Himesh Patel from his work on Eastenders (a show my ex was obsessed with) so it was no surprise to see him be great, and it was nice to see a few other English tv actors pop up too!!Lily James!! What a babe!! It took me a while to place her, then I realized she was Cinderella In the live action version from a few years ago.I feared Paul McCartney would turn up at some point, but he didn't",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I didn't buy this love story..,"Seriously, you basically see the entire movie within the first 20 minutes, because that cycle just seems to repeat itself throughout. So much could've been done with this awesome concept, and while it's entertaining enough, it didn't fulfill its potential.Danny Boyle, Richard Curtis, The Beatles, Lily James. So much I love, so I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, there were just so many annoying characters. Ed Sheeran's scenes always had an element of awkwardness about them, while it also didn't help Himish Patel lacked the charisma needed to pull off the lead. The fact he was playing a fraud for 3/4 of the film didn't do him any favours.While proudly wearing an element of the 'fantasy' tag, there were still too many scenes that weren't convincing or believable - that should have been. Can't say I was a fan of the modern music scene and industry being mixed with the Beatles in this way.It was sweet, but also a bit twee at times. The whole premise probably says more about the current state of the movie industry plagued with reboots and remakes than it does anything else. Despite its downfalls, it was a refreshing change from the usual superhero movies these days. The John Lennon scene was the best bit.An okay film with an excellent premise that should've had better results.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Disappointingly Formulaic,"The premise to Danny Boyle's 'Yesterday'-that a struggling musician realizes he's the only person on Earth who can remember The Beatles after a strange worldwide blackout-is incredibly alluring. Too bad the film itself effectively wastes the opportunity to explore such a novel idea in any sort of resonant or meaningful way.The biggest problem with Boyle's approach is how formulaic the entire movie is. There's the dedicated small town talent manager, the jerk part-time boss, the one supportive fan, and the dopey sidekick. The performer's musical career, played by a wonderful Himesh Patel, isn't going anywhere until the Beatles thing happens. Then fame, success, and a stereotypical super-agent steps in. Before we know it the singer-songwriter has everything he ever wanted but is miserable.There's no need to dwell on the finer details or the love story because you can probably guess them all already. Sure, there are a number of things that are disappointing with the film, but most of all it's that Danny Boyle couldn't make 'Yesterday' something on a similar level as 'Slumdog Millionaire' despite ample opportunity to do so.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Yesterday is FUN.... FUN ... FUN!,"I just got home from watching the 11:45 AM showing of 'Yesterday' at 'The Lot' in San Diego, CA, it was an amazing experience, the huge recliners along with the outstanding service made watching the movie very enjoyable and I recommend everyone try the unique movie experience at least once.The idea to make a movie about what if 'The Beatles' never existed and someone woke up in a world seemingly to be the only person on Earth to have remembered who 'The Beatles' were was brilliant.From start to finish I found myself singing along with 'Jack' (not loud) as he sung Beatle songs for the first time to people who never heard of the Beatles , even thru the end of the credits.Yesterday is one of those movies which make you glad you're alive and renews a belief a person could raise above greed and do the right thing, it was that good.Yesterday all my troubles seem so far away....Just see the move for yourself and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I was completely disappointed. This is a dry, boring movie , quite sad at times , really awkward during a lot of scenes. A complete opposite to the style and spirit of the best rock band in music history. The actor (Himesh Patel) has a sweet beautiful voice which is appropriate for Ed Sheeran cover songs but is very very far from the character of the Beatles songs and their voices and unique character.

Fills the music movie quota,"If you're a fan of biopics like Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody that celebrate the music catalogue of major artists, then you will enjoy this too. Where it differs is that Yesterday is not a bio of the Beatles, but of Patel's character Jack Malik, during a fateful period following a supernatural event. It's an interesting premise that offers plenty of opportunity for comedy, succeeding only part of the time (Kate McKinnon's character always seemed just shy of the mark, appearing brutal without the necessary comic context).The absence of the same real-life tragedies that the other biopics have may reduce the impact of this character's story, but the message behind it all is still universal, still meaningful, and not far removed from the others. Oftentimes, the only person you need to impress is yourself.Patel plays the lead ably well and James is hard not to find delightful.6.5.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"An intriguing, yet somewhat safe take on a unique ""what-if"" scenario.","Yesterday was brought to us by the director of Slumdog Millionaire and stars Himesh Patel as a down on his luck musician who wants more in his profession. One night however, his luck changes when the entire world forgets about The Beatles aside from him, so he naturally takes advantage of it.For the longest time, I had no idea what this film was about, yet I was still fasinated by it. Coming out of the theater, I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. Yesterday presents a genius ""what-if"" scenario that presents many different questions that provoke thoughts like wat would happen to the person if they remembered The Beatles while everyone else didn't. While I mostly enjoyed how it was executed, I had a few problems with the film.The film's casting was really will-done. It has some great performances from Lily James and Ed Sheeran, but I was mostly surprised with Himesh Patel as Jack. What mostly surprised me is how amazing his singing voice was and how well he took advantage of it. I thought the first half of the movie was also pretty thought-provoking with its themes and concept. One question that the movie answers is what the world would look like if The Beatles didn't exist. I also appreciated how the movie didn't go into severaly dark territory. When we have a film like Yesterday, which is essentially a fantasy, I was genuinely happier with its lighter tone, as opposed to a realistic biopic. It has both heartbreaking and heartwarming moments all around, and that made for an overall pleasant experience.Despite being satisfied with the film's execution, I felt as if the second half felt too safe. I thought it could've been a lot more interesting; it could've gone into more depth on the problems of plagiarism and taking advantage of someone else's work despite the fact that everyone forgot about it. The film doesn't raise those question enough for me to care, and I wanted to care more about the inner conflict. I also think this film is a little out-of-touch with how modern-day music is conceived. The movie takes place over the span of months, and music tends to come and go, rather than be timeless, which is what the movie intends to say to its audience. Personally, I don't understand that logic given modern times. My final issue with the movie is that there is a cameo during the third act that I think shouldn't be there.Regardless of my issues with the film, I still enjoyed it for its light tone and interesting concepts.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Kate ruins another movie...,This was really not a bad movie and I was enjoying quite a bit until Kate McKinnon showed up and ruined another decent movie.

Fantastic premise.,"The premise is a fantastic one. In fact, it is often debated in the music industry as to whether The Beatles would attain the success they received in the current oversaturated music climate amidst an era of people with smaller attention spans that are less 'innocent' and vastly harder to please than their 60's counterparts.
So a world where only one musician knows that the Beatles and their incredible catalogue existed is a notion really worth exploring to it's fullest.
However, it seemed to play second fiddle to the romance plot.If you're to make a film about the music of one of the most influential and innovative bands in history, then there's an expectation for the film to also be somewhat innovative.
Sadly, it isn't.
Instead it is a repetitive formulaic cliché caused by a hebetudinous script.
So let's not mistake this for what it could have been to what it actually is: it's a straight forward RomCom.It's saving grace was that, due to the awesome premise, the brilliant music of the Fab Four could be relived as if you're introducing someone to the Beatles songs for the first time.The acting performances from all the cast were outstanding, which also helped hold the audience attention and lead Hamish Patel did an absolute sterling job of performing the songs we all know and love.
Kate McKinnon never fails to garner a chuckle with her delivery, Lily James steals every scene she is in with her magnetism and Joel Fry was on point with his character.There were enough funny scenes throughout (mostly in the first half) and enough chemistry between Hamish & Lily to keep us happy to see the film to it's obvious conclusion.Why do romcom's feel the need to make the protagonists such pure beings that they feel compelled to do public confessions of their own wrongdoings?I really wanted to love this film more, so it's unfortunate to witness all the hard work put in by all the cast and crew be downgraded due to Richard Curtis' script.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Interesting concept,"I was a little shocked to see Boyle's name attached as director as this is certainly out of his normal comfort zone. On paper a Richard Curtis script with Danny Boyle as the filmmaker, would feel like a slam-dunk, but this is not the case. The film creeps into melodrama and it struggles to maintain that comedy and drama combination it strives to balance. Much like About Time, this might have been better with a few story beats removed or amended. Interesting idea and clearly a love letter to The Beatles, I just wish I could've enjoyed this more.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable but underdeveloped,"First of all, I would like to say, I really enjoyed this film. That's why I gave it 7 stars. It was funny, sweet and made me want to go and listen to all the Beatles songs again.However, I felt like it was slightly under developed. The concept itself was really interesting but I felt like they didn't explore the idea enough, they oversimplified a really interesting dilemma.And the ending also felt a bit oversimplified.

"Yesterday, or no other day?","The Stream: An extra long Beatles concert that drags on for two hours.The Big Screen: A musical concert with some very good humor.The Final Bill: Music lovers and Beatles fan will enjoy this road tour of in theaters while casual fans should save some bucks by streaming it.-S2SThis week, we had the distinct pleasure of attending a pre-screening of the movie, Yesterday. A movie that is set for release on June 28th and seems to be flying under the radar. Himesh Patel is the lead actor and it is good to see a fellow person of color in a film that would typically lack melanin. This film was directed by Danny Boyle who became famous for his films, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 hours, Trainspotting and 28 Hours Later. This movie seems to have good bones to it. Let's get to the nitty gritty.Let's begin by talking about of the positives. Himesh plays Jack Malik, an aspiring singer/songwriter looking for his big break, but quickly nearing the end of his rope. Himesh plays an extremely relatable character. You feel every bit of emotion he pours into the film. He takes us on a bike ride and we feel every single lump along the way. On top of that, I was pleasantly surprised by his great singing ability (unless that's actually not him and then they did and excellent job covering that up).Along with Himesh, the cast had a very good rapport with each other, especially Lily James as Ellie. The sexual tension is palpable between them and it truly enhanced the movie. In fact, the true essence of this movie is not about the Beatles music. Without giving too much of the movie away, the true essence of this movie is what will a person choose when the have two competing desires in their heart. Also, how much is your soul worth, even if in reality it actually costs you nothing. Enough of that deep talk, the movie has good comedic moments, a bunch anchored by Kate McKinnon.With all that said, facially this movie is just an extra long Beatles and Ed Sheeran concert. Depending on who you are, that could be your worst nightmare or it will get very old very quickly (way too much Ed Sheeran). I did find that the storyline took way too long to progress and was WAY too obvious. Just a typical, unrequited love storyline in a different gift box. This movie also leaves the viewer completely confused by the reality of the movie. The producers have fun with the reality they created, but I believe viewers would have appreciated a resolution for that part of the storyline as well.Long story short, those of you who loved the British Invasion should see this movie in theaters in some fashion because you receive a 2 for 1 (a concert and romantic comedy). Those of you looking for a last minute date night movie, should also consider watching this movie, especially if your date can appreciate good music. Otherwise, casual moviegoers should avoid this movie in the theaters, BUT will find a nice treat when it hits Netflix, Hulu, or Redbox.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A Rom-Com for those who don't like Rom-Com's,"Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle team up to create a near perfect Rom-Com, even for those, ""who don't like romantic comedies"".When a small-time singer songwriter has a fantastic brush with fate it recharges his faltering musical career. Little does he know how every part of his life is about to change.A fun, rollercoaster story that starts in England, then shifts to the US before it crosses the pond once again for what turns out to be a wonderfully built up conclusion.This movie has the same breadth of strong characters, and snappy dialogue that are present in all the screenplays associated with Richard Curtis.Funny, heartwarming, wonderfully well written

"Enjoyable, but lacking","I was extremely impressed with Himesh Patel's lead performance, Lily James is always nice to see and of course we all love the Beatles' music. But other than those things, I'm probably not going to remember much about this film.The romantic problems between James and Patel's characters seemed as if they were more appropriate for people who are in their late teens, not thirty year olds. The way that they interacted with each other seemed downright bizarre for older people, and that subplot seemed to branch into several directions that just didn't interest me.I was also disappointed with the things that randomly disappeared from Patel's new world in addition to The Beatles. Bill Maher said, ""Ronald Reagan didn't destroy the Soviet Union. The Beatles destroyed it."" When it's revealed that a band that was extremely popular in the '90s and massively influenced by The Beatles disappeared, I thought that director Danny Boyle was going to show us things that would have happened without their influence. Instead, random things that have nothing to do with them are erased from his reality. Also, the Soviet Union dissolved regardless of their absence. :)Kate McKinnon is funny, and I laughed at several of her lines as a talent manager. However, even her performance was a bit too goofy. I work in L.A.-- as much as I hate agents and managers, I realized that I've seen three films this year (""Stan and Ollie,"" ""Rocketman,"" and this film) in which they are depicted as a bit too evil... even for them.In terms of Boyle's oeuvre, it's like his Trainspotting sequel: I liked it. I didn't love it. However, unlike T2, I won't rewatch this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good idea, executed poorly.","The film had a thought provoking premise that could have been pulled off very well but, in my opinion, did not meet expectations.Somehow it felt as if it took itself too seriously while not leaning into its craziness.There were unnecessary cameos and childish stereotypes rounded up into a poorly written script.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Honestly came to enjoy the music, but it was still good.","This came out shortly after Bohemian Rhapsody did and I just remember bio-pics having a little popularity by this point, with films about Elton John and Judy Garland releasing within the same couple of years. So Yesterday comes out as a celebration of the Beatles, just not the form of a bio-pic. This automatically makes it unique, not to mention the concept of the movie itself. Not that there was a logical reasoning as to why it all happens in the end, I don't think the real plot is meant to be taken seriously, and that's okay. It was just a fun movie exploring an alternate universe in which the Beatles never existed.While it is a unique take on the butterfly effect, this was first and foremost meant as a tribute to the iconic band. No one can ever deny the cultural significance these 4 British men made for music, for Britain, and for history itself. Take that and a bunch of their iconic songs and apparently you have a movie. I'll admit, I sang along to most songs. The Beatles were way before my time, but I still grew up to be a fan. In a way, Yesterday was slightly nostalgic in that sense.Once the first act came and went, the entire premise that was so advertised in the trailers was complete. So as an audience member, you're left wondering ""how are they going to turn this into a two hour film?"" Well, they did just that with Jack's story arc. As he becomes a world renowned singer/songwriter, he's left with the basic issues that comes with fame - money, friendship, etc. This theme of the film was actually written really well. But if I'm being honest, I just came for the Beatles, so I honestly didn't care about the guy's troubles. I still enjoyed it nonetheless.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Shaggy Treatment of Mop-Top Music,"The good:
1. Lily James plays Ellie. I loved her spicy Cousin Rose in Downton Abbey and her spunky good ol' girl waitress in Baby Driver. She has become a young actress I look forward to seeing. She gives an appealing performance as an underappreciated woman. But pray tell, why does the lead character, Jack, underappreciate her for so many years (besides being a sad sack)?
2. The Beatles music is fun to hear, even though not performed (mostly) by the Beatles. The music playing over the closing credits is perfect.
3. Toward the end there is a charming scene set at a slightly dilapidated house near the water. To say more would be to say too much.
4. Funny character work by Kate McKinnon, who has the best comic eyes since John Belushi. But see the quibble below.
5. Ed Sheeran shuffles through the movie playing himself. He is amiable and self-deprecating and likeable.
6. The use of Google searches is amusing. (Some of us pray to God for guidance, but we all get answers from Google.)
My quibbles:
1. Himesh Patel, who plays Jack, isn't a great singer. He misses notes.In a movie about an aspiring musician getting famous singing Beatles songs, shouldn't the actor be able to do them justice. (I assume he sang for himself. Where is Marni Nixon when you really need her? Or Auto-Tune?)
2. The film raises some serious issues-happiness and art and conscience and the corrupting influence of fame and money-but falls flat. There's no emotional heft in the climactic moment of crisis and redemption.
3. Dental problems. For a time, the lead actor wears an off-putting dental prosthesis. It's both gross and obviously fake. How does that improve the movie?
4. Beatles music remains popular, but the band and the music and the innovation are inseparable from the cultural context of the 1960s. If The Beatles came along now, would they even get played on the radio? Music which felt fresh and innovative and a little dangerous in 1967 has become foundational to much of popular music today. Indeed, if a classic Beatles tune were released for the first time today, it might seem a bit old-fashioned. The movie simply assumes that songs written in the mid-1960s would have instant astonishing immediate popularity 65 year later. But would they? A question worth pondering. The movie, however, doesn't give it a second thought.
5. The worldwide blackout that destroys almost all memory of The Beatles is never explained, It's as if the filmmaker is saying: Move on, moviegoer, nothing to explain here. But that means the blackout is a deus ex machina of the most shamelessly contrived sort.
6. In one scene, Jack is overjoyed to meet an older man and woman-never mind why. But then he lets them leave without even getting their phone numbers. Did I miss something? Wouldn't he be desperate to see them again? They are, so far as he knows, the only two people in the world who understand him and to whom he can talk.
7. Kate McKinnon is funny, but it's a stock character, the fast-talking overbearing anything-for-a buck soul-deadening leach of a manager. She could have been the film's villain, which it needed, but she never moves the character past comic caricature. She succeeds at comedy but fails at villainy.
8. The big climax leaves behind questions for the world to ponder that can't be answered. I can't say more. But how do those massive unanswered questions affect Jack's life? The final scene doesn't logically follow or resolve the huge questions, and so leaves us hanging.
If you want a lightweight movie with Beatles music, a movie that doesn't place demands on its audience or itself, and you don't mind shaggy logic and loose plotting and maddening loose ends, give it a try. You could do worse. It's hot out there, and the theater is air conditioned.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Lily James tries her best to assist but there's no getting away from a very weak screenplay. The soundtrack is superb but most of that was written elsewhere 50-odd years ago.

A Journey Through Music and Nostalgia,"""Yesterday"" is an entertaining film that presents a fascinating concept: a world without The Beatles. Himesh Patel shines as Jack, bringing a relatable charm to his character as he navigates the ups and downs of sudden fame. The music truly steals the show, with fantastic renditions of classic Beatles songs that evoke a deep sense of nostalgia and joy.The film does a great job of blending humor and heart, particularly through Jack's relationship with Ellie, played by Lily James. Their chemistry is genuine and adds a nice emotional layer to the story. While the premise is intriguing, I felt there were moments where the film could have delved deeper into its themes, particularly around creativity and authenticity.Danny Boyle's direction keeps the pace lively and engaging, though a few scenes could benefit from more emotional depth. Overall, ""Yesterday"" is a delightful watch that celebrates the power of music, leaving you with a smile.

not what i expected at all,"I was aware going into the theater that this wasn't going to be a beatles biopic and i was completely okay with that. the story seemed fun and i was excited to watch this cast. putting this all aside, the movie did not live up to any of my expectations. the story felt empty and the best part was getting to hear the beatles songs. i got lost on what the point of many scenes and it just lacked purpose. it wasn't a horrible movie, it just wasn't what i thought it would be. hopefully this movie will make a younger audience appreciate the beatles, because without them the world would be slightly different. although, much of the younger audience that carried bohemian rhapsody and rocketman, have already heard/support the beatles so yesterday wont generate as much new appreciation.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliantly done!,"All of the characters are very like-able. As a viewer, you instantly want Jack Malik to succeed in his dreams of being a musician. The music is amazing and they stayed true to how the songs sound originally, which most people will like.
Though she's not in the film long, Kate McKinnon is a comedy powerhouse, as always. Ed Sheeran adds the star power the movie needs to seem like real-life.

Typical Richard Curtis,"I so wanted to love this film. It has Danny Boyle, Richard Curtis, and the Beatles. It should be massive.
Don't get me wrong; I left the cinema having enjoyed it, but 24 hours later I felt disappointed.
Richard Curtis knows how to write a hit. Every credit to him. The trouble is, you know what you are going to get (Love Actually kind of ended it for me). It was just all a bit too formulaic. There is a big difference in my mind between a film with a great story and a film made to be a hit. This is the latter. A bit slushy. You will have seen the story a hundred times.

Bland and boring,"""Yesterday"" is a perfect example of the modern movie: carefully crafted to appeal to everybody, offend nobody, and ultimately, to say absolutely nothing (because you cannot say something and still maintain the first two).Sure, it is watchable, but any film featuring what is arguably the greatest rock music of all time, with the broadest appeal of almost any music, would have to try quite hard not to be watchable. Yet, in my opinion, ""Yesterday"" does try quite hard to do just that. The movie constantly stretches believability, as one has trouble imagining the main character actually doing almost any of the things he does. The love story that is central to the plot feels extremely forced and unbelievable (rates about a 1/10 on the love meter). Even his job stacking shelves at a supermarket doesn't really seem believable, let alone the meteoric rise of this uncharismatic character who, like the film, has essentially nothing to say. What a wasted opportunity, as the concept of a 'world without The Beatles"" could have been taken in many creative directions. But the way it rolls out it is entirely predictable, using tired movie tropes we have all seen hundreds of times before.In my mind, the film would have been so much stronger if they had chosen a charismatic star who was kept down in life due to external circumstances, the kind of person everyone can get behind as opposed to an average schlub who remains average throughout.There was a time when films used to feature a thing called ""movie stars."" Great actors who we loved to watch, and not people who look like they live next door, and those films used to be creative and provocative and tried their damnest to say something, to say anything.

I loved this!,"Yesterday is a warm engaging and lovely film.It doesn't seem to have been that well received by other reviewers - but maybe they are just not of a certain age or disposition? I loved it!One night there is some weird electrical disturbance and Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), an otherwise undistinguished guitarist, has a bike accident. He wakes up and finds himself in a parallel universe. But he carries his memories over. No spoilers.Malik is joined by Ellie Appleton (Lily James), a young local teacher. What then unfolds is an onrush of musical pleasure and an exploration of the human condition....This is a great film by Danny Boyle, with a story from legendary writers Richard Curtis and Jack Barth. It is an affectionate tribute to the power of The Beatles - and indeed - the power of music, to transcend time.Wonderful real performances by Patel and James, ably supported by Ed Sheeran, of all people. And an absolutely not-to-be-missed (uncredited) cameo by Robert Carlyle as ....... (no spoilers!) actually had me in tears. Beautiful!Great dialogue, great acting: we really identify with the characters because of they are genuine and relatable. The film also has great photography and brilliant music. This is really a minor classic in my opinion.Yesterday is only a little weak in one area: there are some ""chick-flicky"" moments which let it down slightly.My criticisms are rather minor.

Curtis and Boyle Team for a Classic,"Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis have been favorites for some time now, but it never occurred to me that the director of ""28 Days Later"" and the director of ""28 Days Later"" would ever work on a movie together, and, if so, what kind of movie would it be?Together they created ""Yesterday"", the best science fiction movie of 2019. The story begins with our seeing (and hearing) the end of Jack Malik's long effort to succeed as a singer/songwriter only to realize indifference and the support of a few close friends. Then a standard sf trope, a time/space event, puts Jack into an alternate world where he is the only one who remembers the greatest rock band of their era.From here the story becomes a rollercoaster ride for Jack: success beyond his wildest dreams, crushed by his guilt at knowing the truth of his situation. It will provoke mixed feelings for fans of the music, with scenes that are, by turns, hilarious and deeply moving.The supporting cast is excellent, especially Ed Sheeren, who is a great sport to take on this role and Kate McKinnon, who I will now seek out to see anything she's done.The ending is a Richard Curtis perfect landing. The movie is Danny Boyle at his very best.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Yesterday Review,"This is a decent movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Here are the negatives. Just like Ma and Brightburn, the concept of the film is really good but it isn't explored enough. You want to know more but it decides to focus on more character drama. Ed Sheeran is not the best actor in the world and he just looks incredibly awkward in this film. In most scenes he is in, it looks like he is incredibly confused. Another aspect would be that there are a lot of plotholes thrown into this film that when you notice them, it starts to take you out of the experience. The editing for this film is not good at all. There are too many cuts for some scenes and scenes just keep cutting away every 2-3 seconds when it shouldn't. The camera angles are so obnoxious in some scenes that it is distracting. Some scenes are tilted at a 45 degree angle for no apparent reason at all and it is just annoying. The humor is not that funny at all and I only chuckled one joke throughout the entire film. I'm not huge on Kate McKinnon as the primary antagonist in this movie. She just feels out of place surrounded by everyone else. Here are the positives. Himesh Patel and Lily James do a great job and have great chemistry together. Patel's performance is actually really good. He gives a ton of emotion, he's a good singer, and he knew what he was doing. Most of the supporting cast does a good job with what they are given. I was surprised about how much heart there was in this film. You genuinely care about the experiences they go through. There is one particular scene that I feel is very very touching. Patel's character is given an address and he drives to this secluded location where he knocks on the door and John Lennon answers it. He gives some inspirational words to Patel's character and it is very nice, emotional, and touching. The new renditions of The Beatles songs is actually pretty good. I enjoyed listening to them a lot. The cinematography is good in most areas but it is not special. The tone remains consistent throughout the entire film and it's also paced really well. Overall, Yesterday is a great Beatles love letter with lots of heart, good acting, and interesting renditions of good songs but is held back by major plot holes, poor editing, weird casting choices, and an underexplored premise. I give Yesterday a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Funny But Ultimately Lacks Something Crucial,"If I had a desert island director, it would be Danny Boyle. I can't say the same for Richard Curtis in the writers' department, but that's not to say I don't like many of his films. But on many levels they seem to be an odd fit for each other - Boyle loves to put his audiences through a tough journey to reach any sort of emotional journey. With Richard Curtis, it's all about enjoying a ride we more or less know the route of from the beginning. When Curtis is good, he's very good; when he's bad ... we'll, he writes The Boat That Rocked. The two of them coming them together for Yesterday - a feelgood romantic comedy around the music of The Beatles, which can be remembered by only one person in the world - is enough to make me worry that we'll be landed with a film which is neither Curtis-enough nor Boyle-enough.That's pretty much what this film ends up being. There are plenty of charming, laugh-out-loud, Curtis moments. There's some of Boyle's style and social commentary. What we don't have any of - and it's crucial to the success of the film - is light-footed whimsy and charm. Both Curtis and Boyle can produce that, but neither of them does so here as if they're both saying 'After you'. There's some fine performances; Ed Sheeran, as himself, is especially funny (I say that as someone who really doesn't like his music); it's to Sheeran's credit that he's willing to satirise himself.The music is, of course, magnificent; Himesh Patel in the central role carries them off with aplomb - his song renditions are often electrifying. It's just that ultimately this film is neither one thing nor the other.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"An enjoyable distraction, not to be analysed too deeply","I am a huge fan of both The Beatles and alternate history, so I expected this film to be right up my alley. Feeling in the mood for something that was light and not to be taken too seriously, I came away quite satisfied. I would describe the premise of the film as ""interesting but cheerfully ridiculous"". In terms of creating a world where The Beatles never gained any traction and are largely unknown, it mostly succeeds. In general terms, this world (quite plausibly) doesn't look vastly different to ours, until you start delving into its musical history. However, if you turn your attention to the more specific aspects, there are elements that do strain credibility. If history took such a divergent path that The Beatles, Harry Potter and Coca Cola were unknown, how are we to believe that Jack and Ellie still attended the same school, with Ellie still ending up as his manager? Not to mention that they still lived in the same town, with the same circle of acquaintences. And in this timeline, how did Jack catch Ellie's eye in the first place, seeing as he would not have performed Wonderwall (no Beatles = no Oasis) at the school concert? Of course, these are all essential plot devices, but still, they are ones that grate a little.The reason for all the world's power supply being briefly knocked offline is never explained (fair enough, perhaps, seeing as this is not a science fiction film). For the record, a massive coronal mass ejection of the sun could conceivably have this effect. Nor is it explained how Jack's accident results in him languishing in an alternate timeline. I do wonder what the psychological effect on someone who (hypothetically) ended up in this situation might be, and perhaps there was scope for exploring this further. To its credit, the film didn't attempt a truly absurd scenario where Jack attempts to find his way back to his original timeline!In summary, this film is no masterpiece, however it is to be commended for taking what could have otherwise been a fairly generic love story, and applying a number of quirky twists. The gentle moral that happiness is something to be found on your own terms, rather than by what societal pressure dictates, is also welcome. This film could be just the ticket if you are after a couple of hours of escapism, but would prefer not to have to concentrate too deeply (indeed, it's probably best if you don't!).",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The corporatisiation of Jack Malik's image was done quite well.While this was not a bad film I couldn't help but feel it was a missed opportunity. The film regrettably became somewhat of a rom-com. Emphasis was on his relationship and the one dimensional romance we couldn't care less for. With a unique and brilliant concept I felt the sky could be the limit, performing the Beatles hits. Historic moments could have been created and other music legends could have been involved. I think Forest Gump is a good comparison with Yesterday.

"Fun, entertaining, and a little too long.","Yesterday (3.5 out of 5 stars).Yesterday is a fun romantic comedy film that has a silly plot, a good cast, and fun musical sequences. The plot follows a struggling musician Jack (Himesh Patel) who is losing the crowd and only has his long time friends that are there for him. One of them being his love interest since childhood Ellie (Lily James). One night as he is riding home on his bike. The electricity goes out all around the world. And when it comes back. A bus hit him accidently. He wakes up the next morning who is the only one around the world that knows about the Beatles. Which he tries to remember every song so he can sing to it on stage.It is a fun and cheesy plot with the Beatles playing an important part in the movie. The film also tries to have that love story without it being too settled. Himesh Patel can sing and the songs he performs on screen are great. Lily James also does a great job as well. The film also has Ed Sheeran playing a small role.It is an entertaining film.

I believed in Yesterday,"Kate McKinnon rocks! (Okay I'm getting ahead of myself)""Yesterday"" is a charming love letter to the music of The Beatles. A reminder of the power of music to bring people together. And a reminder of the danger in letting blind ambition and greed get in the way of a good thing. It's also a decent romantic comedy by Screenwriter Richard Curtis' lofty standards (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, About Time). Director Danny Boyle adds his personal flair to the proceedings without getting too much in the way...It's not a particularly visual film so I can't say that anything is lost by not actually seeing it in theaters. But...the sweetly funny story along with the charming performances from stars of Hamish Patel and Lily James- all set to the music of The Beatles make Yesterday well worth the price of admission. It wants you to tap your feet- laugh- cry- and succeeds in the first two. That's more than enough to make it a great time at the movies. And oh yeah, there are some surprises in store too ;-)(Ps.

What a lovely and touching surprise,"Yesterday might have the worst created trailer I've ever seen. I remember going to watch Rocketman in the theaters and seeing Yesterday in the ""coming attractions"". Coming on the heels of both Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, it seemed like a gigantic copy, trying to capitalize on the popularity of filling a movie with a bunch of songs from one artist. It looked both bizarre and boring, without humor or deeper meaning. To quote my grandfather, ""I wouldn't walk across the street to see it.""
I was wrong on all accounts. Yesterday is not a copy of either film. It's not boring, it's hilarious, and it has great meaning. Yes, it is a bit bizarre, but that's the premise of the story. Himesh Patel (in his theatrical debut) stars as an unsuccessful folk singer who performs in coffee shops when his devoted friend and manager, Lily James, can get him a gig. One night, while bicycling home, there's a global blackout and he gets hit by a bus. When he recovers, he's shocked to learn that neither his friends, the rest of the world, nor even the Internet, know who the Beatles are. Either he's living in a dream, he's escaped to a parallel universe, or the blackout caused massive changes, but the Beatles never existed. So, since no one has heard their songs before, if he can remember the music and lyrics accurately, he can pretend he wrote them. But is it the magic of the Beatles themselves that made the songs popular? Were the 1960s the one and only time the songs would make such a splash? Or are they timeless songs that everyone will fall in love with, regardless of the era and performer? (Rather than four-part harmony and a full band, Himesh performs solo with his guitar.)
I only reluctantly rented this movie to honor the beautiful Lily James as Star of the Week on Hot Toasty Rag, but I ended up loving it. I loved the little tributes to the Beatles that I only learned later through reading online trivia. I loved the humor, the excellent comic timing of the cast, and the realism mixed in with fantasy. I loved the extremely touching message. The only fly in the ointment was Kate McKinnon, who was supposed to play a money-grubbing, heartless manager from LA, but really only came across as someone so full of hatred, she could barely function, let alone recite her lines. Thankfully, she didn't have too much screen time. The rest of the movie was lovely. I only wish the trailer had been better made so I could have seen the film in the theaters. I'm already looking forward to watching it again.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are some random canted angles throughout the movie, and although it might make you sick, it's not that bad. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The 5th Beatle of 2020,Great concept with a seemingly impossible 3rd act somehow works.The fact you've paid royalties for track with such epic nostalgia means we are going to be dragged the whole way through.A love story and a couple of moral tales in the subplot makes this absurd concept really shine.They missed an opportunity for classics like 'we can work it out' & 'if i feel in love'Lily James is such a cutie and going to be huge if she sticks to roles that she can shine in and doesn't try to get fresh with diverse roles for the mere sake of not being typecast.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
Standard romcom wrapped up in a confusing way,"The first layer is the romantic comedy. We start with a beginning musician (Jack Malik played by Himesh Patel) without much success (to say the least). His manager (Ellie Appleton played by Lily James) is a girlfriend from his youth, who is secretly in love with him. When success all of a sudden stikes, the professional music industry pounces on him. His new professional manager (Debra Hammer played by Kate McKinnon) loves only money. For her Jack is just a product. What will Jack choose: the succes in a ruthless music industry or the love of his life in anonymity?The second layer is the source of Jack's sudden success. He is the only one in the world who remembers the music of the Beatles. Once he realises this, he starts to promote their songs as his own.The trouble is that it never becomes clear why nobody knows about the Beatles anymore.Have they never existed? A scene with an old John Lennon living withdrawn in a remote little cottage by the sea, seems to suggest this. But if the Beatles have never existed, so have Beatle songs.Are they collectively forgotten? The fact that you can no longer find the Beatles at Google (alongside with a brand such as Coca Cola) seems to implicate this. But why is Jack Malik the only one who has avoided this collective amnesia?Are there parallel universes and is John Lennon a dead popstar in one universe and a quit living old man in the other? Has Jack Malik travelled from one universe to the other because of a traffic accident during a mysterious power outage? But how come that Jack meets the same friends before and after his accident?So in my opinion the story of the causes of Jacks success (the second layer) is rather clumsy. But is this important? Can't one take these causes for granted and enjoy the story about the consequences of his success (the first layer)? Yes one can, but the problem is that this first layer is a rather standard romcom without much brilliancy of his own. The second layer is supposed to be the cream on the cake, but it isn't.The second layer does provide the film however with an excellent score, being the whole oeuvre of the Beatles. The timing in which this score is used is rather subtle. The songs performed are in sync with the development of the story. For example ""Help"" is performed when Jack Malik really needs help.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great, but Ed Sheeran isn't.","It's a good film and all, the music's great, but where this movie falls is... Ed Sheeran. It's annoying in a Beatles film having a completely unrelated signer who is a pretty bad actor in it...An example of this- There is a pretty emotional scene (won't spoil), and when you're in the moment the scene just ends and 'Shape of You' starts playing. What were they thinking...",8.0,Anonymous,Music
LET DOWN,"When you think what they could have done with this it is ultimately disappointing. A great idea not developed enough. Not funny enough. Not engaging enough. Not exciting enough. The love interest story line is as week as a floppy fish trying to lift a dumbbell. It's not a bad movie but it's just all too.... feeble. If you are left, like I was, feeling like you wanted something more substantial... take my advice. Go to You Tube and search for the 25 min long Carpool Karaeoki with Paul McCartney. It will leave you feeling a lot better than you do after watching this 2hrs.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Have watched this 5 times,"This movie is exceptionally good! The first time I watched it, I was in a flight home from NYC. I was sitting next to a stranger who fell asleep and it was a good thing he did because I sang the whole time. (Not that I have a bad voice, but it probably would have been annoying to hear me sing all the Beatles songs without the benefit of the music.) I thought it was hilarious, touching, respectful to the music, and just an amazing movie all around. The casting was perfect. Honestly, whether you are a Beatles fan or not (I am), this is a great movie. My best friend watched it with me (the 2nd time I watched it) and she thought it was awesome. My son (3rd time) also loved it.Watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"I don't know who wrote all those songs, but they saved the movie!! :D :D ;D","Jokes aside, while it was great to hear the songs I grew up loving (I'm 49), I felt a little disappointed about the script (dull) and some of the acting. They wasted what otherwise could be a great concept for a movie.Don't get me wrong. The movie is ok, go and watch it, it deserves. Some movies were not born to be great but to be average, and that's ok, we watch them anyway, have a good time and then go eat something and sleep, forgetting them the next morning.But... A movie about the Beatles songs should not be just average.I stand to my first statement: the songs saved the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie with great songs.,"Great movie, great cast, great music, great premise. It was great fun watching it. I give it 8 stars, yeah maybe I'm just easy to please.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyed it. Wish they'd kept the Ana de Armas scenes in.,"I really enjoyed the music and the acting was good except for Gavin who was given an unfortunately cartoonish role. I understand there was an additional plot line with Ana de Armas as a competing love interest for the now famous Jack which was totally cut. I hope they include the uncut version of the movie in the future DVD release as the movie characterizations felt a little thin without something to balance against Lily James. Also, Ana de Armas was stunning in Blade Runner and it would be nice to see her in this otherwise fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Boring as hell,"If you're going to make a bloody movie about Beatles songs, put a song in every scene. The entire middle part put me to sleep. Actually it uplifted me at first and I was laughing and laughing til after about 30 minutes. It seems that the director didn't know how to keep the excitement level up. It was boring as hell and I never want to see it again. Anyone who says it was good throughout the entire movie is nuts. They're just trying to be nice.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great premise, likeable lead actor","What a cool concept. A struggling musician wakes up to discover that the world has never heard of The Beatles. He, alone, carries their songs inside of him. The lead actor (Himesh Patel) was someone I was unfamiliar with, but he did a great job carrying the emotional weight of this story and also being subtly funny. A very good high-concept dramedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Wonderful comedy drama for couples on rainy weekends,"I loved this film. It had everything you need for a couples watching on nights they want to snuggle up and remember why they feel in love to begin withThe concept was out of this world. It's both a love story and a cautionary tale about fame and wealth. The pairing of the two leads was not your traditional coupling but by the end you'll be rooting for them to find their easy back to each other.It's got a good supporting cast and well, the soundtrack is OK too.Don't be looking for action or expensive sets or locales guys. This is an indie project with more spent on the music budget than the cast or production.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great fun,Yesterday is an extremely fun film despite the fact that it doesn't explore it's unique premise as well as it could have. Himesh Patel and Lily James gives great performances. Ed Sheeran also gives a surprisingly good performance in his cameo role. It's consistently funny and Danny Boyle's direction is really good.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Ok movie,"So I think if I grew up with the Beetles I would've appreciated this film more. Also while the main cast dialogue and acting was spot on the supporting cast was way over the top in a trade for a poor joke. Kate McKinnonin was annoying every time she came on screen and would have been better if she just played a more normal person.
Also the romantic relationship was just like come on already and shag would you.

Charming and lovely - although about as predictable as a film can be.,"Yesterday tells the story of Jack, a struggling musician who wakes from an accident in a world without The Beatles (and a few other notable absences). The story is very straightforward - with this exclusive knowledge Jack rises to fame, pulling number one hit after number one hit out of nowhere. I thought what the film did interestingly was changing how certain elements of The Beatles catalogue and image were perceived in this alternate world. It made me think about why and how certain ideas, songs, images, outfits etc become popular, which was relatively fun.Aside from this the film was fairly derivative - fame isn't all that its cracked up to be, there's more to life than money, love is the real prize etc etc. You could spot the ending from a mile off, although it still retained its charm. One of my major criticisms of this movie however is that I wanted more Beatles songs! There weren't as many as I was expecting, although I suppose it was a shortish movie so they wanted to give more emphasis on story than singing a song from start to finish.I wasn't overly enamoured with Himesh Patel's performance. Jack just seemed constantly uneasy and insecure. Whether I should pin this criticism on Himesh or Boyle I don't know, either way the character didn't hit the spot for me. Lily James was as expected - quirky, charming, and excellent. I really do love her as an actress and am yet to see her put a foot wrong. The inclusion of Ed Sheeran was... odd although not unappealing. I thought it would drag me out of the film a bit, but he did a solid acting job and it was actually integrated into the story pretty well, it wasn't a gratuitous cameo as I feared it would be.Yesterday is a fun way to spend two hours. Its not too serious, straightforward, and has a funny and interesting concept which it executes perfectly well. I'm glad I watched it, but once is enough for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
