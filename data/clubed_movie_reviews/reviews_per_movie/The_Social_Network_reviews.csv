A big surprise,"I'd put off watching THE SOCIAL NETWORK for a time, suspecting it to be a dry and slow-moving film. After all, it was about the guy who founded Facebook, so how much fun could it be? I didn't much like the idea of watching a film based around people sitting on computers, so I was in no hurry to see it.Now I've watched it, and things have changed. Because THE SOCIAL NETWORK turns out to be one of David Fincher's best films, and that's from a director whose filmography is littered with gems. This is a hugely entertaining and thoroughly gripping story of success, defeat, lies and deceit, and I was so caught up in the narrative that the two hour running time flew past.The joy of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that it focuses on the conflict between the various parties involved with the founding of one of the world's most popular websites. It's bam, bam, bam, with barely time to breathe, let alone get bored. Good performances are given across the board, particularly from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, two actors I'm normally disposed to dislike, both of whom are excellent. Technical values are, unsurprisingly, absolutely spectacular, and it's clear that Fincher is in his element, making a mini-masterpiece out of the premise. Splendid stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Power Of Great Direction,"So there I was, sitting in the cinema waiting to see 'Inception' greeting every belated trailer with a groan, each one prolonging the time till I could finally see one of the most anticipated movies of the year and there it was, I turned to one of my friends ""my god..a film about facebook?!.."" To say I was skeptical for those few moments would be an understatement, I was almost angry, like a footballer who releases an autobiography 5 years after he starts his career I just didn't understand the timing of it, who cares anyway?""I think this is Finchers new movie actually""""DAVID Fincher? He's made a film about facebook?!""Almost immediately 'Social Network' became a movie that I needed to see. David Fincher is one of the true masters of delivering some of the greatest films of the past few decades. The gritty 'Se7en' and the intelligent 'Fight Club' had been two of my favourite movies growing up, the latter of which I had the privilege of studying in college quite in depth and although I missed 'Benjamin Button' (only god knows why it took me until 2013 to watch!) I had thoroughly enjoyed the enigmatic 'Zodiac' as well.'Social Network' became my favourite Fincher title almost immediately. It is one of those rare works that feels so effortless in its brilliance which is due to the incredible work from both Fincher and Sorkin in creating this modern masterpiece, the way I see it the film relies heavily upon three aspects which are executed with perfection.First of all, the score for this film is sensational. I've always been a huge fan of Trent Reznor & Nine Inch Nails but with his partnership with Atticus Ross and his ongoing collaborations with Fincher (also see 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo') I can only see them becoming the most formidable artists in the industry, every minor note resonates perfectly throughout the film and creates a beautiful texture on top of an already excellent piece of work.Secondly, Sorkin's razor sharp screenplay is something a director can only dream of receiving, the dialogue never falters and it is always witty, sincere and hilarious all in one (which can also be attributed to the performances of the actors involved)But most of all, the atmosphere that Fincher is able to create visually is stunning, huge credit must also go to long time collaborator Jeff Cronenweth, together their formidable partnership and undoubted perfect understanding of each other's work is clearly the factor behind this film being one of the best movies of the past decadeGreat performances from Eisenberg, Garfield and Timberlake also help this movie stand head and shoulders above most and as one of the most promising young actresses in the business, Rooney Mara is given her first chance to truly show her quality in a small role.It's difficult to say where 'Social Network' will stand when we look back on Finchers body of work but one things for sure, if it isn't seen as one of his truly great masterpieces then he is sure to become one of, if not the most powerful director in the industry for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Nice movie about psychopathic facebook founder,"Fast paced and interesting, this movie tries too hard to portray Zuckenberg in a better light than he deserves. He was not a good coder. He was much more exploitative than movie suggest, as his later love affair with CIA and selling personal data of facebook users for nefarious purposes proved. This guy is far less charismatic than portrayed (and he isn't portrayed as particularly charismatic to begin with) and far more calculating, menacing and Machiavelian than described. The only thing the movie did show worse than it was was Zuckenberg incel situation. Zuckenberg was dating a Chinese golddigger/smartdigger/Harvarddigger the whole time and they got married.But despite being more positive towards its subject than they would warrant, the movie manages to capture part of the psychopathic nature of facebook and its founding. Artistic liberties were taken in order to humanize these monsters, to make us care and for plot not to be boring. In that it succeeded, but humanizing monsters like Zuckenberg or Hitttlerr is never a good idea in a movie. However, you at least get an idea about the depths of the cutthrooat depravity that was only confirmed by the fact that facebook abuses the trust of its sheeple all the time, and a movie is fun to watch, and deserves a praise even if it is an idealised/sanitized/overseksed version of the sorry reality this movie is based on, and as a movie is well worth a watch, but keep in mind the reality was much darker and more boring at the same time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A timeless story of friendship, loyalty, greed and betrayal","I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak: When I first heard about it, I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied, confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important, more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film, though, I realized that, of course, Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as ""The Facebook movie"" is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.First and foremost, I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement. Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter – which it is and then again isn't – the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film. Re-teaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth, Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous – once again, Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium, and this film, shot on the RED One camera, looks absolutely beautiful, from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures.Sorkin's script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases, once again just what a genius this man really is. From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device – the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions, which introduce the various characters and lead into ""flashbacks"" of the events being discussed. It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon, Facebook. Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction, and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with. Most of all, though, it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. I saw Fincher refer to it as ""Sorkinese"" in an interview, and this is a really good description – it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written, and it is also certainly a completely unique language – one which normal people in our real world do not speak, but that just sounds great on screen. The rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me, and the script is certainly a shoo-in for Oscar consideration.The film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess, and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work. The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher, who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business. Instead, he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or up-and-comers, and really make stars out of them. First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg, an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then. However, no matter how good he was in those previous films, none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis, Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold, calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants, is very confident and forward-looking and will stop at nothing to get it. His counter in the film is Saverin, played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield, a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years: Saverin is a far more sympathetic character, more warm and inviting – these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg's betrayal of their friendship.Many pundits and commentators have designated this to be the ""film that defines our generation"", and truly a ""product of its time"" in the most literal sense of the word. However, I'm not sure I like this designation, especially since once you watch the film, you very quickly realize that this isn't a story about the founding of Facebook; it's really a story of friendship, ambition and betrayal, a character study of this fascinating individual whose actions in the film happen to depict the invention of an online social networking site that gets out of hand and puts all of his relationships, especially that with his best friend and business partner, in jeopardy. All of the themes mentioned above are universal and can be applied to a number of fantastic films and works of fiction over the centuries, and that, I think, is the greatest achievement of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
It really shouldn't work,"This is a film which simply shouldn't work, but it does - magnificently. A story centred on a teenager who becomes the world's youngest billionaire, a web site that reaches a million users in two years, and a cast of real life characters with names like Zuckerberg and Winklevoss just shouldn't be possible. A convoluted tale of raw conflict on the origins of a new type of web site should not lend itself to an expensive movie as opposed to a television documentary. It succeeds because it is not about the technology but about creativity and conflict and about friendship and betrayal. It succeeds because of a magical combination of accomplished direction, scintillating dialogue and superb acting.The direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success, all the way from ""Alien 3"" to Se7en"", but here he is right on form with a flashy, but tightly structured, presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest. The all-important, sparkling script is courtesy of Aaron Sorkin who gave us ""The West Wing"" - the best television series ever - and yet apparently does not do social networking.At the heart of the movie is a brilliant, Oscar-worthy performance from Jesse Eisenberg as the 19 year old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the genius behind ""The Facebook"" (the social network), the unsympathetic anti-hero of the adventure, a borderline sociopath variously described by women characters as ""an asshole"" and someone ""just trying so hard to be"" one. Andrew Garfield is excellent as Zuckerberg's Harvard roommate and co-founder of the site Eduardo Savarin; thanks to the wonders of CGI, Arnie Hammer manages to be terrific as both the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss; while singer Justin Timberlake is a revelation as the Napster founder Sean Parker. This is a testosterone-charged fable with room for women only in minor support roles - ironic in that getting girls was the impetus for the Facebook project.The film opens in 2003 with a breathlessly wordy encounter and closes in 2009 with a poignantly wordless scene. In between, the story zips along at the frenetic pace characterised by the business itself. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Millionaires"", the framework for the fascinating narrative is not one but two courtroom dramas or, to be more accurate, pre-trial hearings (both resulted in out-of-court settlements which tells you a lot). Clearly you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An Acceptable Form Of Horror,"Maybe I'm too old. No, not maybe, I am. I saw this characters as aliens of sorts. I know they represent today's landscape, brrrrr. The film as a film is one of the best of David Fincher but the universe it explores gave the chills. A world approaching its end, fast. The youth of the characters made it even more sinister. I couldn't detect their soul or any evidence of its existence. In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations. Roman Emperors or Wall Street. Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid. Love and friendship, loyalty and/or honor as obsolete as good manners. Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all - or did he? - Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me. Good, very good and Andrew Garfield, the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he'll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets. How I wish this was merely a science-fiction film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

A modern classic,"I heard a lot of promising things about The Social Network. And you know what, I agree with the positivity this film has received, for it is my idea of a modern classic. With an intriguing concept, it is for me one of the defining films I have seen recently, one of the best movies of 2010 and relevant in its themes of greed, betrayal, class tension, friendship and loyalty and concept.Production-values-wise, The Social Network looks wonderful. The cinematography is incredibly skillful, and the editing is crisp. In fact, I'd sure The Social Network is director David Fincher's most stylish film since Se7en. I have heard a lot of mixed feelings on the score, while it is not my favourite of the year not like Toy Story 3, King's Speech and Inception, The Social Network's brooding, smooth and quite sexy score is very memorable and fits well with the film's occasionally quirky tone.The Social Network is very well directed too. Fincher directs with an intensity and focus that makes The Social Network tied with Se7en as the best of his movies in my opinion. Another strong point is the screenplay which is very smart and sharp, while the story making the most of this intriguing concept is constantly snappy and engaging.Also, all the characters are very well written and assembled, for me they are among the best-written characters in a Fincher movie. It also helps that the acting is as impeccable as it is. Jesse Eisenberg is very commanding as the titular character in a subtle sort of way, while Andrew Garfield also impresses as the ""voice of reason"" character. I was surprised in a good way by Justin Timberlake, while the weakest of the three leads, he does have a cocksure swagger here that he actually pulls off really well.In conclusion, a wonderful film and one of the best of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A very good but flawed film.,"""You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be one."" This statement, uttered by a lawyer, played by Rashida Jones, describes David Fincher's The Social Network quite well. It is not a great film, but it is trying very hard to be one. That being said, it is certainly a good one. When it was announced, people reacted to the idea of a film about Facebook similarly to a Transformers film being made. For the most part , all the write-ups about the film were filled with cynicism and negativity. To people's surprise Aaron Sorkin would write and David Fincher would direct. Following its premiere, mountains of praise were heaped on the film, which for the most part was deserved.To me, this film is hard to review. On the surface, there is much to praise. Fantastic performances, great cinematography and direction, with some great writing, yet, I come out of feeling nothing. There was an emotional disconnect between the film and me - something was lacking. The film is exceptionally well made, it has great style, and Fincher deserves a lot of credit for what he has done. However, the problem I had was I didn't care about the characters. Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is not meant to be a hero, in fact he is portrayed as a prick. Someone constantly condescending due to his insecurity and superior intellect. We are not given any characters that we can attach ourselves to, which isn't always a problem but the story was told in such a way that it didn't suck me in either.The performances are great across the board, and most surprisingly, the stand out for me is Justin Timberlake, who disappears into his role. He plays Napster creator Shawn Fanning as a slightly delusional, paranoid entrepreneur.Aaron Sorkin, like David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino, has a very stylized way of writing dialogue. It either works for you, or doesn't. Fortunately, it did work and some very enjoyable exchanges are present in this film. The problem isn't with the dialogue, but with the way the story is told, constantly cutting forward in time to his meetings with his lawyers and the people suing him. This gives the film an almost procedural feel, and leaves me cold.Fincher has made some very good films, but never has he made a truly great one. They never emotionally connect, and I blame this on his style. The film is beautifully shot, but it is the way it is shot that I had the most problem with. It is too clean, too composed. It is style versus emotion, and style wins out. It is quite obvious he started his career as a commercial and music video director in this film. This is certainly not always a bad thing, but on this film, which needs us to connect with at least one of the characters, the lack of emotion keeps me from really loving this film.I will say that the final scene almost made up for it, it is humorous yet strangely disturbing. Unfortunately, the ending came out of nowhere. There was no build up, it appears as if several scenes were cut leading up to the ending. It, instead, uses text during the final shot to clear up all of the loose ends, which there are many. The film doesn't care about its characters, and this proves it.It may come off strange that I will still recommend the film, but I do. It is very good, and interesting. Certainly better than most of the films released in the last couple of months. That being said, it has flaws, significant ones, and for that it fails as a great film, but succeeds as a good one.For more reviews and articles about film check out my blog: The Deleted Scene http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Excellent dialog. Superb directing job by Fincher.,"I went into this film with little or no hope. By the time the movie was over, with the Beatles' ""Baby, You're A Rich Man"" playing over the end credits, I had a huge smile on my face. I literally cannot wait to watch this again during it's wide release.The lighting and camera work here is beautiful, every scene and sequence is a joy to watch. If Fincher hasn't already proved himself time and time again with his great films, this one might be the one to seal the deal for him. One sequence in the middle of the film features a boring rowboat race. Fincher sets up the photography so beautifully, that it feels like you're watching a painting come to life.All the performances are excellent. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg as a fast-paced, nerdy, kind of jerk-ish attitude, and Andrew Garfield is his best friend, Eduardo, who at the beginning didn't mean much to me, but I found myself rooting for him by the end. Justin Timberlake is easily the weakest one of the three, but he still does a decent job.And oh, man the soundtrack. Trent Reznor deserves some kind of recognition for this. It is amazing. A lot of people say the movie sounds boring. They cite ""The invention of facebook"" as an uninteresting topic. I say don't believe that talk, and check out this interesting, funny, thrill ride by Fincher and co.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fincher's best since Fight Club,"I have been a fan of David Fincher ever since I saw Se7en when I was 13. I saw all of his films the following week and not one of them disappointed me. That was back in 2003. I loved Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as well, but he really knocked it out of the park with this one. I was fortunate enough to see The Social Network at a screening on 9/16/10 for my college. Eisenberg, Hammer and Sorkin were there and did a Q and A after the film. It was a GREAT experience. All of them seemed excited about the film and rightfully so. The film brilliantly tells the story of college students who go through hell with each other over the credit for Facebook and the damage that comes to all of them because of it. The acting and dialogue were flawless. Eisenberg, Garfield and even Timberlake churn out performances that should get them serious attention come award time. Fincher's direction is also perfect. you can always tell a Fincher film when you see it because his visual style is so striking and The Social Network is no exception. When this is released, please go see it and watch a film that defines a generation and what the world has become.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Can the ""Facebook movie"" be one of the best of the year? Yep, it sure can...","""The Social Network"" was an incredibly engaging film that, while mainly revolving around the invention of Facebook (and all the problems that the creators encountered both before and after all was said and done), really focused in on ideas and feelings that can be (and are) universally felt through all people, the primary example being trying to fit in. Everyone wants to be accepted (I for one have never met a single human being that has wanted to be a loner), and some will do whatever it takes to get that sort of attention (which tends to lead into bad consequences). In a year where movies have received some of the lowest critical ratings (as well as box office earnings) in recent memory, ""The Social Network"" was, while haunting, truly refreshing and ultimately a triumph in all aspects, whether it be considering the acting, script, or directing. It was a fantastic movie that shouldn't just be among the best of the year; it's so much more important than that. It defines the entire social networking generation, and that is one hell of an accomplishment. Everyone can relate to it one way or another, and that makes it one of the must-see pictures of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
All films written by lawyers are really about lawyers.,"A bright social misfit (Mark Zuckerberg) becomes a billionaire by coming up with a new and radical way of communicating with friends and colleges through the internet. But was he the complete and total author?Before I even saw this film I congratulated David Fincher and his production team for even touching this theme. So recent a piece of social history. The protagonist has the deepest pockets imaginable - so the film is clearly guided by lawyers and legal advice. The usual flashback he said/she said bomb-proof air-raid shelter. Mostly based on court deposition.(Not only was the film virtually written by lawyers they feature on-screen more than they need to. Loyalty-free parasites - all of them!)I don't think many people will want to see this product twice and over time the (high) IMDb rating will shrink. Why? Because the soup is too thin. We know he did it - what we may not know is how he did it. Once this is learnt (in the broadest who-do-you-believe strokes) then there is not a lot to return to.Credit Jessie Eisenberg for playing a slightly autistic virgin loner who clings to the wall at parties, but clearly untrue. He not only had a girlfriend before his life went bang, but he is still with her today. Movie convention dictates that all programmers are geeky social misfits, usually wearing glasses held together with sticking plaster.(They stopped short of this here - but cliché is not avoided.)Programming is a slow business. Like working in treacle. To show his skill he hammers away like a speed typist. But most of programming is debugging. He never got it right first time. Although, to be fair, only programmers know this and the audience has no interest in such nuts-and-bolts.Quality acting by lead Eisenberg and especially good support from Justin Timberlake (as theft-is-good Napster ""founder"" Sean Parker) who really is quite adept at playing flash character roles. Lost a lot of weight to make himself look younger.The movie contradicts itself is when it claims that Zuckerberg has no real interest in money. Especially when most of his actions show that he wants to cut the cake more-and-more in his favour and, earlier, makes himself scarce rather than having to lie. Cowards lying. Like Bill Gates (featured in cameo) I don't envy him because he is not cool and in reality money (above a certain level) cannot improve your life. Not unless your only ambition is to build a hospital in the Third World.Like many I came to this film looking for information and what I got was mostly opinion and spin. At worst it clinks and clangs in its ball-and-chain. However I was entertained for a couple of hours and that is - really - all we should ask of a film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"As complex as a David Fincher movie can be, and probably the movie that defined this decade.","When this movie ends tells us that Facebook has 500 million users, this was the figure in 2010, 10 years later this figure was tripled and now there are more than 2 billion people registered in this social network, it can be said that this film talks about the theme that defined this decade of 10s ""social networks"" although its height began in the 2000s, it is obvious that its frenetic growth happened during this decade, it could also be said that The Social Network defined the decade, as Fight Club defined the decade of the 90s, touching issues of importance and relevance of the time, both making an accurate and deep portrait of their respective generations.David Fincher creates a film as intelligent and cold as his main character, although the story can be reliable and not yet, since Mark Zuckerberg himself has said that the most accurate of this film is the use of his character's clothes , the other characters in the story and even Sorkin and Fincher indicate otherwise, The Social Network is not a documentary, it can be taken as a work of fiction that recreates a situation of betrayals and pure frivolity, does not give us information that we should take as totally correct since it has a certain tone of the famous Rashomon effect; which is that several people testify to a fact until the original version is so eclipsed that it is impossible to find a truth among so many points of view.This movie is undermined by pure irony; Harvard's least associative boy with no knowledge about human relationships creates the greatest source of communication between people today, and the film ends with the creator of Facebook himself waiting that his friend's request to be answered. The direction of Fincher and the script of Sorkin make this film look like a thriller, a dark thriller, when in one of its many layers it is a film about envy and teenage immaturity, one of the greatest qualities of the films of Fincher is that they are very complex, and can cover as many topics as they want.The Social Network with Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac joins the list of masterpieces created by the hand of David Fincher, one of the artists more prolific of the seventh art.Although I almost never talk about such repetitive themes as the interpretations in my reviews, since it is obvious when the performances are good and not, and most of the reviews say the same about that, but this time the young actors who keep this movie afloat deserve a line of recognition or more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I can't zero in on any huge flaws in that respect. However, I didn't find it entertaining. Interesting, yes, but I was bored. There is no one to root for. All of the characters are assholes and douche bags, so it makes it hard to care while watching the movie.I take that back. I liked Rashida Jones' character, but her role was too small for that to matter.A random tidbit...Justin Timberlake's performance was great.

You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.,"On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history...but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. (Sony Pictures)THE SOCIAL NETWORK is not about Facebook. It's about Mark Zuckerberg and the people associated with him and the consequences that arise with the evolution of Facebook. In an even broader sense, it's about friends being driven apart due to money and betrayal. Because of this, it's no surprise that many have already compared this to CITIZEN KANE. And it's not just the similarities in themes that are astounding, it's the quality as well.What makes THE SOCIAL NETWORK so good is the masterfully written script by Aaron Sorkin. The film is filled with impeccable dialog that just sucks you in. It would be no surprise if the film won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Director David Fincher also does a great job keeping the audience captivated through and through with a consistently fast pace. Really, you'll probably be drawn to the film's opening argument between two characters than any other scene this year. All right, I'm exaggerating, but you get the point. It's not Fincher's best work, but it's in the top 3.Jesse Eisenberg and co-star Andrew Garfield are the driving force behind this film. Eisenberg does a terrific job delivering the lines as he did while Garfield brings in an emotional aspect to the film. Although both are quite excellent, Garfield's performance is Oscar worthy. Rooney Mara is quickly getting up the ladder after having last seen her in the remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in the beginning of the year. She's just in a few scenes, but she's great in them. I would have like to see her more in the film, though. Apparently, Armie Hammer played two characters as twins in the film, which really blew me away when I found out because I thought they were two different actors. He really distinguished the characters really well. Oh, and if you're worried about Justin Timberlake, don't be. He's really good in here. I also loved Rashida Jones in the few scenes she was in.With terrific performances from the cast all around, a brilliant script, some fine directing by Fincher, and an engaging score by Trent Reznor, it should be no surprise that THE SOCIAL NETWORK succeeded the way it did. Although it's a 2-hour dialog driven film, it absolutely engrossing to watch. If anything, this is probably the closest modern version of CITIZEN KANE that we will ever get in a long time. THE SOCIAL NETWORK is easily one of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Social Network,"Let's start with the script. It's great. Written by soon-to-be-best- adapted-screenplay-nominee/winner Aaron Sorkin, The Social Network's writing is intelligent and demanding on multiple levels: most obviously, the story is cleverly structured across dual lawsuits, but there's an equal amount of sophistication to Sorkin's character work--Zuckerberg is never quite capable of maintaining a dialog, Eduardo always stops just short of explicating his emotions.Those two characters are wonderfully played by inevitable acting award nominees Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield--Eisenberg owns the brisk pace of the film while Garfield brings most of the humanity--who anchor a terrific ensemble--SAG best ensemble, perhaps? The film's score is a perfectly atmospheric concoction of electronica from edgy dark horse best original score nominees Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and it's all united under the name and vision of David Fincher, who did not win an Oscar for Fight Club or Zodiac or Benjamin Button.All of this is to say two things: this is a really great movie from a phenomenal creative team, and also there are times when the film feels somewhat calculated for accolades--never in the repugnantly safe, crowd- pleasing, middle-brow Benjamin Button sense, but in the sweetly transparent sense of a kid who did all his chores and is suggesting that he might deserve a cookie.You know what? Give David Fincher a cookie. The Social Network is thoroughly intelligent and engaging as a modern biopic and as an examination of evolving cultural currency, and it's also one of my favorite films this year. -TK 10/1/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I deleted my account after watching this film,Straight up I must say that this whole narrative of Mark Zuckerberg inventing facebook just doesn't sit right with me. Isn't it a Darpa invention for data mining? And Zucks was the innocent face to through up front? This all felt like a giant well made ad.,8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Zuckerberg the Great?,"I had to go into this with a grain of salt. The Facebook phenomenon is quite amazing and has made changes to our society that we will be dealing with for decades. That said, I don't put Zuckerberg in the same room with Thomas Edison. The fact is that if Facebook had never been created, the world would have gone on just fine. Perhaps it would be a better, more humane world. One where people don't spend their lives producing tons of personal garbage that is really of no interest. The word ""friend"" has taken on a whole new meaning. It sounds then that because of personal bias, I wouldn't like the movie. I did. It's intriguing to watch this twerp hit all the right notes and put into action the phenomenon that has taken place. I really felt like I was in the room with these guys; that I participated in their discoveries and plans. Jesse Eisenberg is so believable that whenever I see Zuckerberg on television, I think, ""Wow, he looks a lot like Jesse Eisenberg!"" I can't buy the criticism that this movie is exploitative. If this story was going to be told, it had to be told now because the events are as fleeting as that computer you bought last week. It helped me to understand what went on. I recently saw Mark Zuckerberg bemoaning the failures of our schools. I think that he and his ilk are as much responsible as any poor teacher or principal. The numbing of America (or world) isn't helping much. But this film allows us to have a view of it's potential undoing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Over-hyped,"he Social Network, about the intrigue surrounding the founding of the fantastically popular website Facebook (perhaps you've heard of it), is a fine film – but not a great one. That's a little disappointing, considering that David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac, Fight Club) is the director, but the movie isn't much more than a run-of-the-mill history movie about a subject matter – websites – that's not particularly compelling.In 2003, Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, Zombieland) creates a quickie site called Facemash, which takes head shots of female coeds and puts them side by side, allowing male users to rate which one is more attractive. This crashes the Harvard network and brings him to the attention of one of the many posh elite clubs on campus, whose leaders (the Winklevoss twins) ask Mark to create a social networking site for them, but open only to Harvard students.This in turn leads Mark to create Facebook itself, rather than the Harvard-oriented site. It also sets off a chain of events that would eventually make Mark a billionaire, albeit one sued by not only the twins but by his own best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), the company's CFO.The movie's how-it-all-came-together theme is interspersed with legal proceedings – both sets – that put everything into a sort of current context. What caused Eduardo and Mark to be at odds? Do the twins have a chance of defeating Mark? And how does Sean Parker of Napster (Justin Timberlake) fit into all of this?More than 500 million people use Facebook presently. It's no longer a haven limited to college students. My mom's on it. If my grandparents were alive, they'd be on it as well. It's a hugely successful tool in so many ways – small businesses can use it to keep in touch with their customers, friends can find their friends anywhere in the world, people can catch up with old classmates, and so on. It's highly intuitive and very user friendly, and it's all free.Making a movie about a website can't be easy. A website isn't three dimensional; it's not exhilarating to watch someone create one. The Social Network is simply not an exciting movie, although it tries really hard to be one. It attempts to show that the intrigue and back stabbing that occurred behind the scenes of its rapid rise into the zeitgeist is riveting, fascinating stuff. But when the movie was over, I didn't know much more about Mark Zuckerberg than I did going in to the theater, and what I learned about Facebook itself was just trivia.On top of that, the legal stuff that's always in the background is just dull, no matter how many snide answers Zuckerberg gives to opposing counsel. We're not talking about the Scopes monkey trial here.On the plus side, we do get a terrific performance from Eisenberg, who shows he's not just another schlubby always-a-victim actor; the role has some real heft to it, and he's amazingly up to the challenge, particularly with the rapid patter that always seems to be coming from Zuckerberg's mouth.Other than that, though, this is almost a generic origin story about a subject that's really not interesting enough to warrant a full-length movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Who cares, and more importantly, why????","Cinema students rejoice. Here is an American film worthy of critical analysis and close examination.Its camera work is (at times) stunning. The acting performances are worthy. The direction is tight and focused, all the while entering some new territory regards narrative structure. The sound was daringly attempted, albeit not wholly successful.So why just six stars? Because with all the film's many technical and artistic high points (and there are many), I just didn't care. It didn't entertain me.I understand that many folks might find Mark Zuckerberg's rise to Facebook CEO interesting; however, I suspect that a good many more people will not--I am among the latter.About eight years ago, former San Diego Union-Tribune movie critic David Elliot wrote eloquently of a movie's need to personally reach a viewer's psyche before the individual can embrace it. Providing entertainment is the goal of all movies. I fought against this thinking most all my life. I wrongfully assumed that a film could be judged on its artistic merits alone, with no consideration given to its ability to make a personal connection with the viewer. Even if the connection was unexplainable and strictly visceral, the movie must make an emotional and personal impact on the viewer for the film to be a success. The viewer must be entertained.Well, this movie is an example of Elliot's observation. The film did nothing for me. It was one long, dull and boring straight line, in spite of its artistic touches. I didn't care about Mark Zuckerberg before the film, and I don't have any more interest in him afterward.I wanted to like this movie. Again, there is a lot to like; technically it gets an ""A;"" artistically it gets and ""A;"" but for entertainment value it struggles to get a ""D."" I hope you like it. You may.Everyone's likes and dislikes regarding movies are different. I agree with Elliot in that films should ultimately be judged on a personal level after considering their artistic and technical achievements.For my tastes, I'll see another film for my entertainment dollar. Afterall, isn't that what movies are made for, ENTERTAINMENT?This movie is many things--many good things--but it isn't entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I'll tell you why this is so re-watchable,(Flash Review)Editing and Dialog.The intelligently-written script is machine gunned out at as brisk a rate as the film's pacing echoes the mind of Zuckerberg and the hockey stick growth of Facebook. The chronology flows together with perfection and is complimented by Fincher's slick and glossy atmosphere. The story is spliced between the startup phase of Facebook and the legal battle between the twins and his co-founder. Not sure how accurate the portrayal of the characters are but it makes for an entertaining story which could have easily been boring. Yet another great Fincher film.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Facebook has a lot to answer for.,"Driven Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg becomes a billionaire by creating Facebook, the film looks at its conception, it's success, and the subsequent controversies and lawsuits that followed.This is one very well made, polished movie. Almost fourteen years on its still sharp, polished and slick, it still packs a punch. The problem I have, is that the central character puts me on edge.It's not hard to look back to the early years of Facebook, and to remember that people went absolutely crazy for it, everyone I knew was on there, faces from the past, present, people I didn't even know. These days it's there for the sake of nostalgia.Facebook has a lot to answer for, I actually think it's put a generation backwards when it comes to actual, real social interactions, an inability to converse and interact in the real world, we all know someone who's a keyboard warrior.It's interesting, as it's a big moment in history, Facebook really did change the world, and it is Zuckerberg who's ultimately responsible, but wow, every single character in this film is absolutely loathsome (with the possible exception of one of them,) they're all horrendous and impossible to like, relate to, what a world we live in.Jesse Eisenberg is terrific as Zuckerberg, the ultimate DBE (dead behind the eyes,) even now when I watch him interviewed (trying not to hurl something at the screen) I question whether he's on the same wavelength as a gone else. Timberlake and Garfield are both very good in their roles.Drunk, angry, stupid and blogging. That sums it all up very well.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"This history of Facebook is exciting--for a awhile. Lots of filler here & great script, great acting.","The Social Network (2010)The rise of Facebook is so sensational in terms of money and culture, a movie about it was inevitable, and it came early in the game. Appropriately. Everything is speeded up in this world, and who knows why turn might make Facebook the next AOL or Nokia.And so it is quite the story. I don't think it's such a great movie in movie-making terms, however, and this flies in the face of a lot of critical acclaim. Beyond the main story line, there are lots of party and social scenes that are meant to display the changing lifestyles of the main characters (much of which is openly inaccurate). These are prolonged enough to lose their point, and after a few of them, they lose their initial interest, too. They are really meant to serve as interesting ways to have dialog about the stellar rise in members and money involved with Facebook.Because of course there is no action in a movie like this. It's mostly dialog. It's about ideas and numbers and watching computer screens. We are led through the initial moments of inspiration, possible intellectual theft, and good luck at the beginning of Zuckerberg's rise. But there are only so many aspects to this rise that can hold interest for us. It is pinned together through a more recent scene in a well appointed briefing room, as a couple of the leading characters give testimony about who really started Facebook. Flashbacks fill up the rest of the film.What to miss? The long and overly filmic rowing scenes (part of which were partly scale models, actually). What not to miss? The lead, deadpan performance by Jesse Eisenberg and the really moving performance that steals every scene he's in by Andrew Garfield. Justin Timberlake is good, too, and will be a separate draw for some. The twins turn out to not be twins--quite incredibly, a body double was the second twin and the face of the first actor was digitally inserted into the second one. Crazy stuff.The writing is superb. Aaron Sorkin is key here, making some of the dialog really virtuosic (including the first scene, a dialog in a bar between Zuckerberg and his would be never will be girlfriend, which took 99 takes, all shot with the legendary digital Red camera). The filming, as such, is really good in a functional way, and with the experienced Jeff Cronenweth in charge (he did minor flicks like ""Fight Club"" and the American ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""). And Cronenweth is one of director's David Fincher's big reasons for success.Fincher is a terrific director, and you might say he made the most of a story with little real substance. But I'm not sure that's true. I just saw ""Moneyball"" a second time last week and it holds up really well even though it generally lacks what you would call action, too, and was written in part by Aaron Sorkin as well. I think Moneyball, whatever its defects, is a better movie. Both movies are about contemporary society and the changing way we use computers, and the way people behind the scenes have made this true.Facebook is a story we are all destined to be affected by, whether you learn of it through the movie or elsewhere. Many people are just totally gaga about the crazy amount of money involved, the movie clicks. The title of the book this was based on is perfect--The Accidental Billionaires. So true. For me, though, I'm like Zuckerberg himself. I just don't care about money, and so the main draw in scene after scene was missing. Judge for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Just as Fincher gave us the definitive Generation X film with ""Fight Club"", he and Aaron Sorkin give us a definitive Generation Y film...","...and that's ""The Social Network"".It joins the ranks of his best, and just like many of his his previous works, has been reviled before it was properly understood.For months before it came out, it was the laughing stock of people who were off-put by the idea of a ""movie about Facebook"" (even though it's easy to look and see that it's about the founding of Facebook and the people behind it), just like ""Fight Club"" is dismissed as a violent film about people fighting, or that ""Se7en"" is just a serial killer movie.Not to get sidetracked, though.""The Social Network"" is filmmaking and storytelling of a high order, that shows the grand irony of a socially inept Harvard student named Mark Zuckerberg who ended up creating one of the largest social phenomena of the twenty-first century (and love Facebook or hate it, it most certainly is that). The story works as an engaging, fascinating character study; at the beginning of the story, Mark is a socially maladjusted reject, and even after several million 'friends' and a few billion dollars later, he remains pretty much the same.The outstanding acting, style and direction, as well as the great script armed to the teeth with sharp dialogue is what people are likely to miss by dismissing it as a mere 'Facebook movie'.Even if it were just a ""movie about Facebook"", why is such subject matter off-limits? Things that have become a large part of our culture shouldn't be reflected in our art? Or, is it because of that? That technology is such a scary thing and needs to be dismissed? The indisputable fact is that everything that's going on with social networking and the world of the Internet is incorporated into the ideas of a certain corner of history, this one, which will be remembered as such, and ""The Social Network"" may very well be remembered as a film to define that era.So please, this is one of the films to see this year. Don't get hung up on the idea that it's just a silly ""Facebook movie"", or else you'll be missing out on an excellent picture.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I Like the Film More Than I Do Facebook,"I was slow to see The Social Network, with the cast and subject matter it just didn't interest me. I'm glad that I did finally give it a viewing because I found it quite entertaining. It's a solid ensemble cast and Eisenberg is particularly strong. He successfully creates a truly unique character that is nerdy, insecure, selfish, condescending, smug, and a total jerk, and yet one that we want to watch. The scene where his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) simply and deftly explains why girls don't like him is pure gold. I'm curious to see how The Social Network will stand up to the test of time, but for now I found it very engaging and worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"I ""like this""","Director David Fincher's The Social Network stars Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, and depicts how he became the billionaire behind the popular Facebook website. We start with the humble origin of the site's forerunner as a prank Mark pulls after breaking up with then girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara). This catches the attention of the school's social elites who pitch their site to Mark only to have him leave the project and launch Thefacebook, a site eerily similar to their concept. But before anyone can grasp the situation, Facebook becomes a phenomenon. Along for the bumpy ride are Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), Mark's best friends and FB co-founder, as well as Napster founder Sean Parker (played by Justin Timeberlake).Tradition dictates that a film's protagonist, or hero, needs to be likable. When the audience isn't rooting for the hero, the movie usually falls apart. Not true for The Social Network, a movie that thrives on the disdain achieved by Mark Zuckerberg in this account. From the start he is overtly blunt, rude, and careless with no signs of remorse. Does this sound like a guy who would donate $100 million to a public school system? The Social Network chronicles Marks efforts to hijack ideas and leave out friends. It's a story about an antagonist.Great performances abound. Jessie Eisdenberg is a distant, fast-talking, smart alec. Andrew Garfield has a fantastic scene where his easy going Eduardo loses his cool, and for once Justin Timberlake doesn't suck! I'm sure Sean and Justin mutually agree to his lady's man charlatan portrayal.But the fun doesn't stop there. The score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor's is reminiscent of Tangerine Dream and it lifts many scenes. I think some people will be letdown to find that the story of Facebook is framed by legal hearings but there are some clever screenplay elements put into play by scribe Aaron Sorkin. The Social Network is billed as a dark comedy, but I found it to be a straight drama. Almost every movie regardless of the subject has a lighthearted moment and that's what I see in The Social Network; it's a drama that happens to contain some humor. For instance it would behoove you stay on the good side of a twin who describes him as ""6'5"" 220 and there's 2 of me"".There are times where the use of soft focus goes to the extreme and the mise-en-scène masks drug use. Heck, college students even sub out the f-bomb for some truly awkward PG-13 retention dialog. Cutting from an R to grab a PG-13 for assumed profits has never been this bizarre.Even without showing a dollar, The Social Network is a far more timely and engaging tale of greed and woe than last week's Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, but still it would have been nice for the film to clarify how Facebook became so preposterously overvalued. After all, this is a move about some people you came into money and the audience never understand where the money came from. Is it the movie of this generation? Perhaps but that would be because this generation can't make an income from inventing a tangible product. My distaste for Facebook may be obvious, but I ""like this"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Andrew Garfield is Brilliant in this Role,"Wonderful performances from actors. Great storytelling. Honestly, the only reason I don't want to rate the movie higher it because I would have preferred a truer diversity in casting. Andrew Garfield was the heart of this movie and made it special, I would have preferred an actor true to the ethnicity of the character/person. Besides that, Jesse Eisenberg was hatable, which is good since I don't think your supposed to like Mark Zuckerberg. All of the acting performances are great. Would recommend this film to anyone who like learning about ""real life"" events. Armie Hammer playing twins is fantastic, he does a great job of giving each twin their own identity and character with character development. Justin Timberlake is incredible unlikable, but provides a full performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Considering I am 'old' and a history teacher, this movie isn't exactly geared towards me...","My review is best read and understood in context. I am 46 years-old (and in the Facebook world, that makes me OLD) and an ex-history teacher, so what I liked and disliked about the film is not what the average viewer would think. This isn't meant as an insult--just that I know I am not like the typical demographic for whom the movie was made. I am very computer-savvy for my age--but that still makes me a dinosaur compared to a teenager or 30-something person. The fact that I have never had a Facebook account alone makes me an odd-ball! So, when I see the film I do NOT wax nostalgic about the good 'ol days of 2004 or 2005. Additionally, as a history teacher, I CRAVE accuracy in films and tend to nit-pick them far more than normal. For me, history is like the Bible--you don't embellish it or 'interpret' it--is IS truth. So, a younger person seeing the film with me would find me insufferable, as I would look for the flaws and ignore the bigger picture.So, I did some research and found that the film makers did NOT intend for a historical account of Facebook but wanted to craft an exciting story that people would love. And, to do so, personalities were changed and facts were omitted or ignored. My biggest problem is that in reading about Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, while he is no angel, nor does he seem to be (as the movie strongly implies) a sociopath with Asperger's Syndrome (I was also a psyc teacher...trust me on this--this is exactly as the film portrays him). And, although he is exciting to watch in the film, Justin Timberlake's version of the fonder of Napster isn't exactly spot-on, either.So if you can ignore the artistic license, what are you left with in ""The Social Network""? Well, for 46 year-old guys like me, not a huge amount--or at least not as much as I might have hoped based on all the publicity the film received. Yes, I liked it--but didn't love it. I liked some of the acting (again, I'll mention liking Justin Timberlake--something I NEVER thought I'd see myself putting in writing!) and the rest of the cast were good. I also loved the way the twins were magically created using computers and a single actor....cool. But the story didn't engage me that much.

Interesting rather than thrilling,"I had heard plenty of positive comments about the Social Network and have finally got around to seeing it. I must confess to being slightly disappointed.The story follows the founders of Facebook and their rapid rise to fame. It is an interesting portrayal of the pressures that come with owning a company that is worth a fortune. The tagline to the film is that if you have 500 million friends then you're bound to make enemies along the way. The story is really about how success leads to people wanting to share in the success and how it ultimately splits up genuine friendship. Overall I found the film well acted, well directed and reasonable, but not really gripping.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Doesn't hold back,"...or the evil behavior of Mark Zuckerberg, part one. This film really needs a sequel to cover everything that's happened since 2010. It's very well made but I have to say, it's hard to like anyone as they're all so flawed, including the Harvard elitists who came up with (much of) the original concept, the CFO who was a nice enough guy but deeply unqualified for his position, and Sean Parker, at least in the portrayal here, with his narcissism and partying. They're all multibillionaires today, so it's hard to feel too sorry for any of them. And then of course there's Zuckerberg, whose moral failings are apparent throughout, from his misogyny and arrogance in college to backstabbing people along the way. He is a complete a$$hole, and I liked how David Fincher didn't hold anything back while telling the story. I wish it had been truthful about Zuckerberg's personal life, as Priscilla Chan is nowhere to be seen, but the gist of the film seems right, particularly given what would happen in the decade which followed.

Possibly my favourite film of all time.,"To me, this film is perfection everything from the cinematography to the story is astounding I don't think there is anything you could do to improve it.

With a Sorkin script and stunning visuals as well as direction, this film is more indulgent than anything that I watched from the 2010s and would go as far as to say this is in my top 3 favourite films of all time.As far as it goes for the soundtrack all I can say is that it is phenomenal, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross bring everything together (with In Motion being my favourite from the collection). Having watched this many times before and with my favourite scene since the beginning is the original hacking scene where they are creating Face Smash being possibly the best in the entire film.It also the perfect amount of comedy and seriousness that has somehow bonded together extremely well. I can easily watch this film on repeat and no matter how many times I have seen it I will be able to watch it again.For me, this is absolutely a 10/10 and I would go as far as to call it a masterpiece. (With Gone Girl being a very close second in terms of pacing and cinematography). And for it being a 9-year-old film it definitely holds up to any standards that there are today.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Social Propaganda,"I found the movie ""Social Network"" useful in gaining an outline of how Facebook came to be. However, I do not trust any movie rendition of real life characters. After watching the movie I did follow up research to understand better the events of the story. That research showed that Eduardo Saverin was instrumental in getting the book ""Accidental Billionaires"" written as a character assassination of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker.I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg is as self absorbed as presented in the movie, nor whether he was mesmerized by the cunning of Sean Parker. But I doubt it. The movie presents Saverin as complete victim and the Winklevoss brothers as noble, but petty, finaglers who had an idea yet did nothing with it, except sue for wealth from Zuckerberg.I have no fondness for Facebook. I was on it for about a year and later discovered that they are retaining all data that we put on their site to sell to marketers - hence their billions of dollars profit. It is ironic that Zuckerberg hacked into the Harvard computer system to gain the jpegs of all the girls on campus for his Facemash, then later comes up with the system where all the private data is given to him voluntarily. This information is available for the government whose quest it is to profile every American for surveillance reasons. Google is doing the same and I have since stopped using their search engine. It was very difficult to get my data removed. When you close your Facebook account they do not delete the data and you have to go through various ""hidden"" pages to get the data deleted. Even then I am not sure that it is deleted since I am still getting Facebook spam months later.Before they got they first 500 million dollars investment, they wanted to keep their site cool. Now that it is a giant mega corporation, it is not cool, but creepy. Zuckerberg is not cool, but filthy rich. Perhaps Bill Gates was cool at one time but they are both part of the globalist elites now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Great scripting and acting, and then what?","OK I'm a tad prejudiced. I had read most about the Facebook backstory over the past year and I think David Fincher is an over-rated picture mash-up maker.Let's try to be objective. There's not much to learn from the Facebook genesis. Basically it's Fight Club without fist fights. Nice elevator pitch, uh? If it wasn't for the 500-odd million people registered on The Social Network, nobody would give a damn. It Is Downright Anecdotal and Deeply Uninteresting. But the scripting is brilliant. All this uninteresting stuff just flows. There's no gap, no hang, the known reality is perfectly blended in additional fiction to leave no unknowns behind, only bright answers and nice half-answers.The acting is just perfect too. So directing must be very good, not? As a 'project manager' I can admit David Fincher is really good. Yet, since this movie will mean nothing 5 years from now - whatever becomes of Facebook - to the general public, I can just acknowledge it is a very fine marketing product. A - somewhat - good movie? Scripting and acting keep you interested all along but there's absolutely nothing in it you would feel like discussing with your friends after it reaches the 2h mark when it's time to close shop.So you may think David Fincher is a great director, I just think he has a talent for building his team, which is just half the job. Spielberg is a great director, he knows how to (and has the means to) build his dream team, he gets all the funding he wants and still, in every other movie he dishes out his trademark sentimentalism overflows. David Fincher has no trademark, he is great at nothing except feeling the breeze and setting sail at the right time. No small feat; no major achievement either.In the end only a very small number of people are able to see precisely how much of a talents' catalyst Fincher is, and how much he owes to individuals' talent and hard work.

Will you be my friend?,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is a film with good genes. It's based on Ben Mezrich's novel ""The Accidental Billionaires"", screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""West Wing"", ""A Few Good Men"") and directed by one of the best directors working today, David Fincher (""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac""). The film is dialogue driven and my advice is to shift your ears into turbo-mode to keep up. These Harvard types never stammer and are quite speedy in making their oh-so-clever points.This film is not so much the history of Facebook as it is a glimpse into the individuals behind the idea. Foremost, of course, is Mark Zuckerberg (played with rapid-fire tunnel vision by Jesse Eisenberg). The programming guru behind the code, Zuckerberg is depicted as a guy who is not just socially inept, but also unaware of social mores and code. I am not sure if he is best described as a prodigy, genius or even (possibly) a sufferer of Asperger's Syndrome. Whatever he is/was, he became a billionaire in his early 20's by proving he could put together the world's dominant social network while having no redeeming social skills of his own. Fascinating.Zuckerberg's best and only friend (and business partner) is Eduardo Saverin (played by the next Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield). Saverin fronted the money to get Facebook started and was one of the parties who borough suit against Zuckerberg claiming he was cheated out his place in the company.The third key player is the infamous Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake). Founder of Napster and Plaxo, Parker manages to get his hooks into Zuckerberg and apparently was behind the snubbing of Saverin. This is the most charismatic role in the film (and real life), yet also the role that may have the most dramatic license taken.The story is told in non-linear form, weaving multiple depositions from different lawsuits. One includes the Winklevoss twins from Harvard who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea. They later settled for millions.As I said, this is not so much a history of Facebook as it is a display of the characters involved. These are all brilliant people who are also ignorant to the ways of the world. It seems they all have significantly different goals, yet never really stop to agree on strategy. Instead, the growth is non-stop, as is the back-stabbing.Interestingly, the film uses a girl (Rooney Mara) in the opening scene as the single biggest influence on Zuckerberg's brainstorm. Her rejection of his self-centered speed-talking kicks his wheels in motion and his relentless energy never slows for the rest of the story. One thing is clear, Zuckerberg did not single-handedly create Facebook and there is little doubt some key people were given short straws along the way. No matter what really happened as all that was battled out behind closed records in the settlements. What we do know is that Facebook now has over 500 million users worldwide.This is an extremely well crafted movie, though in my opinion, none of the acting is up to the script. It's a film that provides enough insight into the players and enough entertainment for the ticket. That's really sufficient. Coming next ... David Fincher is set to direct and Rooney Mara is cast as Lisbeth in the Americanized version of the fabulous Swedish hit, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". So enjoy this one and look forward to that one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great movie,"I saw this film at a free screening in Denver last night. From the opening sequence, you know you're in Aaron Sorkin territory. His rapid-fire dialogue and the ""that was then, this is now"" editing is a little disorienting at first, but you get used to it. When Mark Zuckerberg breaks up with his girlfriend, you have a pretty good idea of everything going on in his mind. And yet, the film portrays him in a sympathetic light. Everyone was laughing at the hilarious put downs and one-liners. The best one, at least in my opinion, is a reference to the original ""Karate Kid."" All the actors are OK, but this is Jesse Eisenberg's movie. He convinces you of all the insecurities and doubts percolating in his character. While his reasoning is usually explained with a gesture or a snide remark, his confrontation with the Winklevoss twins' lawyer lays out his true motives for being the way he is. Rashida Jones' character although minor is pivotal since she explains to Zuckerberg where he went wrong. There are some brief digressions like Saverin's girlfriend problems which contribute to the 116-minute running time(sans credits.) It's a little too long, and David Fincher seems confident enough in the material not to indulge in any of his usual tricks. I'd say the film is a mix of ""Juno"" with ""Greenberg"" without the self-conscious dialogue of the first, or the nastiness of the second.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"I hate Facebook, but this film is the best of this generation.","No other film, I feel, captures the basement dwelling, computer hacker community more realistically. I would say it's the most realistic portrayal of University life, but I would be talking out my arse, as I've never been. It captures a whole sub-genre of people so incredibly well, and the writing is as such that we can feel these characters as real people, with real struggles and personalities, and not just some nerd robots who pumped out a website.Mark Zuckerberg, as depicted in The Social Network, is a bad guy. He betrays people, he lies, he talks over his dear friends, he cheats, and he's the best at it. The dude isn't even 30 yet and he's built an empire bigger than you or I could ever build, yet he doesn't care. He has no real friends. He has build a multi-billion dollar empire, and for what?I dislike Facebook, but Facebook is also very popular. This was the perfect opportunity to make whatever kind of film you want: dark, edgy, slow, witty, depressing, comedic, etc. as long as it has the background of Facebook, and you're still bound to make loadsamoney off it. And that's what Fincher, Sorkin and Spacey did. This is the smartest, most genius and wittiest film of the past 20 years, only just surpassing There Will Be Blood and Juno.Eisenberg is pure gold as the fast, clever, cynical Zuckerberg, even though he doesn't seem to be all that bad. He talks faster than his own thoughts and often says mean and nasty things without even thinking they're mean and nasty until seconds later. He acts superior to all his friends, and he is superior, mostly. When he isn't superior to the rest, he will strive to be, betraying all in his path. This isn't about money for him, he just wants to be the best at something. And he is the best; he's the best at hacking, lying, betraying, and yes, creating.What stands out for me is the soundtrack, which can only truly work for a film like The Social Network.

David Fincher has proved that even a movie about the dawn of a social networking website can be interesting,"Despite being a user of Facebook.com, I must admit I had some apprehensions about going to see ""The Social Network."" Even though Facebook is an internet phenomenon and even though there is plenty of history and conflict that went into the making of the multibillion-dollar website, I wasn't exactly ecstatic about seeing a movie about it. A cyberspace network can be addicting in the sense that you can talk to your friends in silence and such and according to an article in Forbes last year, Facebook is estimated to be worth nearly eight million dollars, but just how interesting would we expect a movie about it to be? Well, director David Fincher has taken the story behind this incredibly popular website, the stories of the people who created it, and weaved a movie that runs about twenty minutes too long, but is still quite engaging.As the movie starts out, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a nerdy, pompous computer brainiac has been dumped by his girlfriend and in a fit of stomach-stomped rage, decides to humiliate her in cyberspace via a blog and a new website in which female Harvard students are ranked in terms of how physically attractive they are. His trouble-raising prank catches the attention of three other students, who want his collaboration in producing a new social networking website, which would later evolve into a multibillion-dollar phenomenon, and the source for vicious, friendship-splitting conflicts.""The Social Network"" is really held up strong by its creative forces. Mostly because of the skills of director David Fincher, who I am predicting will finally win an Academy Award next February and will most definitely be one of the five nominees. Every single shot of this motion picture shows his craftsmanship and technical prowess. He also shows that he knows how to pace what might otherwise be dull sequences, by having them whip along quickly but still registering an effect. He also has very good actors in his cast. Jesse Eisenberg plays his character in an autistic, withheld manner; a young man torn apart inside but only revealing it under the most dire of circumstances. Armie Hammer was digitally integrated into many shots so that he could play the twin Winklevoss brothers and he magnificently generates two separate characters. Also credit the digital effects artists and the makeup department for making him look like two different people; I was thinking really hard if I had ever heard of Hammer's twin brother until I saw the ending credits. Joseph Mazzello also makes his biggest film since ""Jurassic Park"" as the brothers' jealousy-stricken comrade. Andrew Garfield is charismatic and generates sympathy with his performance and Justin Timberlake chews up every scene he's in as Sean Parker, another networking maestro. There's also a small part by Rooney Mara as Zuckerberg's ex-girlfriend and she does a wonderful job as well.It is the combination of these talents that overcome some of the movie's shortcomings. Looking back on ""The Social Network"" I do still feel that it would have done better as a television miniseries, for that is the sort of feeling it generates. There just is not the firm, glue-applied narrative structure that typically builds the foundation for a movie. As such, about twenty minutes of the picture sort of drags. I must also confess that I only really cared for the characters because the strong performances and the spins the actors threw on them. Save for Timberlake, none of them had any really likable or three-dimensional characters to work on. In addition, the screenplay is a little jumbled, at times making it hard to determine at what point in time we are now setting ourselves. It flashes back and forth too quickly and a straight storyline would have been better.It's not, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year, but ""The Social Network"" is still a movie very much worth seeing. Part of the reason is that I am still amazed that anybody, even somebody like David Fincher (""Se7en"") could make a subject as seemingly droll as this become lively and animated. I have no doubt that this movie will be be on the ballot lists for the Academy Awards next year and that its many overlooked talents will finally get the recognition they deserve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Why?,"The film itself is excellently filmed and acted but I wonder why did they have to choose this particular story. For all I know,not only was the idea (Facebook) not brilliant, but the real surprise is why no one came up with something similar to it back in the mid-90s when the internet just started.plus, the software itself posed no challenge at all from the algorithmic or programming point of view. In this respect, the story behind Google or Napster would have been even more interesting.real characters are rewritten in ways which I'm sure only retain a portion of the truth, and a not-so-subtle commentary on social mobility and glass ceilings is made which in fact is not pertinent at all here.If Fincher wanted to make a film about stupidity and its different forms, and about the mediocrity and the moral desert his society lives in, he succeeded. If he wanted to make a movie about truly brilliant people doing truly innovative things, however, he should have chosen other base material. Fincher should be aware of how his films are understood by mainstream critics and audiences, and if this film was meant to be ironic, then the irony is too thin to be understood by most people, let alone make a point; you just have to read the reviews at Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic to realize this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the definitive films of this era,"While some may consider the comparison sacrilegious, The Social Network is essentially a modern version of Citizen Kane (it even has its own version of Rosebud), and while it doesn't have the same scale of Welles' film, it's almost as good. It's about the true story of Mark Zuckerberg, who became the youngest billionaire in history after founding Facebook. The film uses Zuckerberg's life as a metaphor for the ironic isolating effect social networks have on individuals. He's desperate for genuine human connection, but incapable of fitting into the world of the social elite, so he invents a virtual way to crash the party, which only isolates him even further from the society he wishes to be a part of, as well as the few real friends he started out with. It's an excellent film about capitalism's ""expand or die"" principle. Every time Zuckerberg hits a roadblock in his personal life, his answer is to expand the reach of the company in a futile quest to prove his worth. The Social Network features a haunting score by Trent Reznor; its dark tones establish a sinister atmosphere and prevent the perception that Zuckerberg's attitude and achievements are something to celebrate, and Aaron Sorkin's script weaves together multiple narrative threads in a seamless structure. David Fincher's film should be remembered as one of the definitive films of its era.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"High-profile, but overly hyped entertainment that might date quickly over time (maybe like Facebook itself?).","Internet site Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in Jessie Eisenberg's lanky shape is not a very sympathetic figure: a fast-babbling and socially awkward misfit who was dumped by his girlfriend, and whose embryo of FB started out as a good looking girls-ranking site as a pure act of revenge the same night as the break-up. Progressively, his character traits extend to a reckless million dollar entrepreneur of an unparalleled success concept of social media. Director David Finchers & scriptwriter Aaron Sorkins interpretation jumps between the legal process in the present (where his former college friends intend to sue the crap out of him, mainly for stealing the idea) and the skyrocketing rise of the Internet phenomenon in the past.A solid, high-profile piece of entertainment, with ear-bouncing dialog and fine performances... but it never takes off, dramatically nor emotionally to the heights that a first class movie must do. That visionary director Fincher is behind the helm is a bit hard to understand since the story is – albeit highly paced – unremarkably carried out and ultimately feels surprisingly flat and inadequate at this level of aim and talent involved (one visual 'wow' moment, though, is a rowing contest montage).Maybe this is the catch: it's most likely mainly made with the focus on the Facebook phenomenon being THE Zeitgeist No. 1 thing right now, and for that reason, opportunity must be seized before it fades. Zuckerberg's story might be interesting enough to film - in the long run - but his tale isn't over yet by far, and this chapter might just have been made too soon? Because to me, this movie is good but does definitely not have the whiz or character fate interest to warrant all the hype and high praise surrounding it. It wouldn't surprise me if it will date quickly over time (as FB itself might be?). Trent Reznors cool soundtrack is an asset, though!6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Overall A Good Movie,"Watching The Social Network, after the film came out 8 years ago and after Facebook launched 15 years ago, helped me to better review the social media storm in our lives. How it all began was much more 'humane' than it looks today. Film portrays the college life, 'Harvard' label critic and entrepreneurism process well. I praise Jesse Eisenberg's acting as he was able to convince me how smart Zuckerberg can be in real life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Overrated but still interesting,"The internet has become a part of everyday life for most people and Facebook is something everyone has as least heard of and therefore the whole subject of this film is something most people could relate to. Seeing how this well known site was started by college students was interesting, particularly how it developed from one small thing and escalated.The majority of the characters in this film are not at all appealing in the way that you would normally expect them to be. However this is irrelevant because it is based on real people and as much as I did not like them I still wanted to carry on watching to see how it would develop.I liked the way the story was told varying between the court cases and reflecting back on memories as this showed with an impact how the friendship between Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin was affected.I was surprised how interesting a film about the origin of Facebook and the impact of its growth could be and I think it is definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Why should I care? This film doesn't tell me.,"As one of those who completely fails to appreciate the inherent narcissism that underlies Facebook (as well as its clunky, confusing interface), I was disappointed that Aaron Sorkin completely failed to make me understand why I should have any interest at all in the story he tells. What I saw was a story about a social incompetent who screwed over several people and somehow blundered into something that made him very, very wealthy but, in the end, had no effect whatsoever on who he was as a person.Classic drama is all about how the central character faces a personal crisis, learns important lessons, and comes away changed in some fundamental way. In this film that just doesn't happen. It's just a story about an unpleasant person who created this ""thing"" that appeals to people's least interesting characteristics, made a WHOLE lot of money, but came away from it pretty much the same person he was when he went into. Boring. Just like most of what I see on Facebook.What was really disappointing was that, given Sorkin's powerful work on ""The West Wing,"" I was expecting some profound reflections on what effects this shallow person has had on society. That might have been an interesting film--too bad it didn't get made. Instead, we get a navel- gazing look at someone who made it possible for millions of people to make their navel-gazing public.Just like Facebook, this was mostly just a major time-suck and I left wishing I'd done something more important with the last two hours of my life.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Revolutionary for our time,"When I first heard that David Fincher was making a film about the networking site Facebook, I was definitely very skeptical. Well, there was no need to be. Fincher took Aaron Sorkin's brilliantly clever screenplay and turned it into a film that highlights the best and worst moments of out technology-based life.The Social Network's first scene is brilliantly written and acted, and it sets the mood that both Fincher and Sorkin want to set for the rest of the film. The film is seen as the advancement of how Mark Zuckerberg got his world-famous website started. Now, I know that a lot of the film was exaggerated or fictional, but it does not matter. Sorkin and Fincher have brought us this really interesting character, who is brilliantly played by Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg is one of the best young actors in this time, and while he has mostly done comedy until now, his role demands much more attention to subtlety and character nuances to move along. Last year Eisenberg showed us that he could create some of the most likable characters in films like Zombieland and Adventureland, and this year he proves to us that he can actually create a very flawed and condescending, but still sympathetic character that we may or may not end up hating. This was credit to his real talent. Andrew Garfield was also pretty much equal in terms of performance, and he was a true star next to Eisenberg's character. The rest of the cast are all fine, including Justin Timberlake that has proved over the years that he can actually act pretty impressively.On another note, the film might seem very different than Fincher's other films, which include pretty much all crime/thrillers and a fantasy (Benjamin Button), but I thought that he was able to leave his mark on the film. It certainly took itself seriously, which for a film like this is fortunate. The cinematography was also very impressive, but not showy, and very keen on the real focus of the film.Ultimately, The Social Network is a very hard film to dislike. However, I also know that it is not the type of easy-going, fun but forgettable film that many (including me) expected months ago. It is more profound, more meaningful, but it might not hit a nerve with all viewers, including the young that will only want to see the 'Facebook Movie!'. I think The Social Network has a lot of similarity to last year's Up In The Air. Both represent a dilemma about people's communications in the modern world, and both can be seen as perfect examples of what life in the 21st' century was like. The Social Network is about the many connections that we have with others, and it makes you feel the longing and loneliness that might come with it. It is David Fincher's best to date.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great story emphasized by superb acting from Jesse Eisenberg,"Overall was a very captivating movie, even with already knowing the ending to the story. What was a great performance from Jesse Eisenberg (Mark Zuckerberg), was slightly brought down by the other members of the cast.

The Best David Fincher Film!,"'The Social Network' is a film written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by the legendary David Fincher. It documents the rise of the popular social media network, 'Facebook', and we follow the creators Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) in the journey of establishing this well known website.
The acting is absolutely brilliant, especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield who convey the rivalry between the two main characters fantastically. This was the first big film for Justin Timberlake (playing Sean Parker), who is great in his role and it is very surprising that he is able to hold his own along side Eisenberg and Garfield.
The screenplay is exceptional which shows off the sparkling writing. You wouldn't expect a story about Facebook to translate well to the screen but thanks to every person that worked on this film it is marvelous. The story and dialogues are constructed very well and are spoken incredibly so they feel real.
David Fincher is amazing and in my opinion has never made a bad film ('Seven', 'Zodiac'). 'The Social Network' is very different to all of his other movies, but it is easy to see the progression of his craft. He films this picture with a contrast of light and shadows in order to create an atmosphere that he wants the audience to feel.
Overall, this film is sensational, it lands in every way and I highly recommend it to everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A great Jesse Eisenberg performance!!,"'The Social Network' (2010) is a very good film but I'm surprised it hasn't been crippled by a deluge of libel suits. Jesse Eisenberg is tremendous as the fast-talking, hyper-programming Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. But is the real Mark so blinkered into effecting his own genius as the film portrays – even hinting that Mark is responsible for certain acts of base treachery? Is Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) really the ruthless, manipulating hedonist as displayed in the film? Is Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) really the naive no-hoper displayed here? I've been working with computers for over 30 years (and somewhat over-awed by the 'Young Turks' of the Internet) but I really didn't learn that much about the workings of Facebook. What I did get was a master-class in the nastiness of humans determined to get to the top regardless or, as the Bible puts it, gain the whole world but lose their souls. It's a film that really leaves a bad taste in the mouth. One that I'll visit again, because it's very well made, but not very often. Worth an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

It's well written and directed, so to evoke the maximum response from its audience; and much like Jack Gleeson in his role of Joffery Baratheon in Game of Thrones, Jesse Eisenberg manages to create such a loath-able character, that you find yourself as a viewer, becoming more invested in the story, hoping for the ""villain"" to be beaten by those who you sympathise with.So while I found myself hating the ""based on real events"" story, and some of the characters in it, I have to tip my hat to the production team for putting together a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Great Direction and Great Writing...All At Once,"Quite often, I notice a trend where two artists that I admire work together and then the film turns out to be unsatisfying, it happened with Spartacus to name an easy example. Yet somehow David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin managed to come together to create one of the best films of the last decade, creating a kinetic experience with Sorkin's trademark dialogue, yet with a mastery of tone that can only be attained by a master such as Fincher.I can't entirely pin the film's success on just Fincher or Sorkin, a film is created by many different people, people such as actors, editors, cinematographers, composers, and so on. Yet it is nice to see that all of those threads come together to create a complete whole of an experience. The Social Network is often a film I point to when I discuss films that so admirably binds these threads together and in a way that seems effortless. Everything in this film works, from the acting, to the writing, directing, editing, and even the music.Some scoffed at the idea of Fincher being the director of a 'serious film,' considering he had become known for directing crime thrillers such as The Game, Zodiac, Panic Room, and my favorite of his Se7en (which I prefer far and wide over his 90s opus Fight Club), but Fincher shows that he is not a one trick director and can explore other genres effortlessly. His sense of tone and atmosphere is not lost in this film, though I do miss the grungy, dirty look of his earlier work, I find that he still has a remarkable sense of style and place throughout the film, I sometimes joke that his newer films always look like a bar or a nightclub, yet nonetheless Fincher manages to create a moody, melancholic tone that pervades throughout the film.I am reminded of one of my favorite television shows, Breaking Bad, while watching The Social Network. Much like Walter White, Mark is primarily motivated by ego and insecurity, and many of his decisions are based off of his personality. Mark isn't a very nice man, and he's actually quite horrible throughout the film. Yet the tragedy of the film is due to Mark's short sighted decisions and his allowing his emotional insecurity to define his actions and cause him to burn bridges with the people he cares about, as well as allowing toxic people such as Sean into his life, due to him playing to Mark's ego and manipulating him to his side. The faltering of Eduardo and Mark's relationship also has to do with Mark's ego, as well as Eduardo's own insecurities and jealousy of Sean. The acting of the film is exceptional, with show stealers being Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield, and Armie Hammer in a dual role as the Winklevoss twins. I was particularly impressed by Hammer's dual performance as the Winklevosses, and that he shows his range by giving the twins distinct, yet differing personalities. The exceptional acting gives life to the characters, and their decisions are what defines the narrative. Justin Timberlake and Brenda Song also have turns that show their range as actors, and they're not bad in the film at all.One of The Social Network's great strengths is its use of non-linear storytelling by editing. Much like Soderbergh's The Limey, the film comes together through its use of non-linear editing without seeming disjointed or confusing. I'm still in awe by the way that Fincher and Sorkin managed to work together to create a cohesive whole. The way that Sorkin plays with words is always something that's impressed me, and the way that Fincher compliments Sorkin's vigorous script is, to quote George Lucas, like poetry. This is also apparent in the film's use of similar lines, editing back and forth seamlessly through different time periods while saying similar things to each other. The music, excellently crafted by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, also adds leifmotifs in the film that makes the dramatic impact much more effective as the film rolls along.The Social Network's influence has seeped through not just films, but also through pop culture and our understanding of Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg and some of the other people depicted in the film have criticized the film as inaccurate, but I don't think they got the point of the film. The film isn't a documentary, but a reflection of our times, and one that I found to be more poignant and reflective than many other films that attempt to do the same thing. Fincher said that the film was the Citizen Kane of our generation, and in many ways he's right. Mark, much like Charles Foster Kane, is a victim of his own mistakes, and one who craves love, yet often sabotages his chances of happiness due to his insecurities and ego, and is unwilling to admit to his mistakes or face the consequences of said mistakes until it's far too late and now must live with the consequences of his actions. He's hollow at the end, not unlike Kane or Daniel Plainview, yet is just as powerless as he was at the beginning.I can only sit back and think of how rare it is for a film that manages to combine so many factors together successfully, and The Social Network should be a pointer for how to bring ambling threads so cohesively together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Anti-social networking,"David Fincher does a marvelous job of telling a complicated tale, pulling us in and riveting our attention. he has a history of that.It is curious that so-called ""social"" networking began in such an anti-social stew of class distinction, intellectual arrogance and sophomoric personal viewpoints.Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as the creator of Facebook. However, the amazing role in the film is that of the elitist Winklevoss twins. I don't like to read too much about a movie before I dive into the audience, so I had no clue that one actor, Armie Hammer, played both roles.Seen side-by-side in numerous scenes, there was even a thought in the back of my mind that the twins were close, but not really close enough. What a performance. A supporting Oscar nomination will hopefully follow.Distractions: the glamorization of the party scene at Harvard--I have my doubts. Perhaps it was just a way of emphasizing the fantasy that the computer guys were hoping to obtain? ...and the abrupt ending.It was almost as if a studio exec had said, well, not bad, but we're looking for a two-hour run time. And so...slice, stop, rolling credit explanation as to outcomes. A more natural ending would have been appreciated.But the anti-social nature of the networking is laid out brilliantly, through the Mason of the Harvard undergrads, to the coed user-consumer wannabes, to the don't care attitude of the Dean, to the use and discard context of many of the relationships.In the context of the suicide death of a Rutgers undergrad a few weeks ago after social network bullying, this film accurately tells of our times and directly questions its values.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Meh,"The film is beautifully shot and directed with the shots perfectly placed. The rowing sequence is gorgeous and deserves some recognition. The acting is also quite good, Jesse does a brilliant job of being a hard to love genius but idiotic at the same time as his business skills are awful. However, the dialogue is rushed and badly written. The opening scene is extremely confusing and could be an instant turn off. The story is also very drawn out and the back and forth swap from the original story and the later on questioning. Brenda Song is probably the most annoying actress to have either walked the earth and every scene with her in was insanely cringe-worthy and almost made me laugh it was so awful. All in all, a quite tedious drawn out annoying film with a brilliant director of photography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Youngest Billionaire In The World!,"Before I review the film, I would like to mention that I do have Facebook account, and its sole purpose is to allow friends who I have lost touch with - and who live all over the United States, and the world - to find me if they want to. I also have a extremely rare ethnic last name and no one in the entire world of 6 billion+ people has the same first and last name, which makes my name unique, so I carefully guard my privacy. I have the barest of personal info on Facebook and the highest of security settings. I also spend close to zero percent of my time socializing or keeping track of people I know through Facebook or other social networking sites. Why? As the Social Network makes perfectly clear: Nothing, but nothing, takes the place of real, live people in face-to-face relationships!After watching Social Contract it left me feeling both amazed at Mr. Zuckerberg's good instincts and his fortitude in not letting anyone hold him back and allowing himself to succeed beyond his wildest dreams - and empty - by his profound loneliness and from the persistent discord that swirled around him throughout almost the entire movie. I also found irony in the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg did not cooperate in any way with the making of Social Network because it exposed his private life to the world - but, yet, at the same time, the general public is encouraged to give him (Facebook) as much of our personal information as we can!Social Network is interesting because you see what a person with good instincts can achieve in the real world. While I don't approve of people mistreating each other, the history of inventing anything important is full of stories like Social Network. For example, patent lawsuits are a big business, that's why we have ""patent"" attorneys! (I also found it so delicious that the founder of Napster, who brought the recording industry down on its knees, played a key role in providing critical good advice to Mr. Zuckerberg's success. I know how malignant the recording industry can be. None other than the legendary Nigerian drummer Baba Olatunji told me a how one the biggest record companies in the world viciously screwed him out of a lot of money!)Social Contract is mainly about two things: Interpersonal relationships and money. As far as the ""money"" part of the story is concerned: Mr. Zuckerberg is now a billionaire (actually he's a MULTI-billionaire!) With that huge amount of wealth I couldn't help, but wonder, what is he doing with all that money to make the world a better place? At the same time, I kept thinking about the 18-year old gay college student who recently jumped off the George Washington bridge because someone filmed and then posted his same-sex sexual activities all over the internet. He left his suicide note on Facebook! I hope someone close to Mr. Zuckerberg's reads this review and encourages him to start spending some money on organizations that work to strengthen laws that protect a person's privacy and maybe throw a few bucks to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Suicide Prevention Hotlines around the country, also. They are always struggling for money. It would be a most profound gesture, Mr. Zuckerberg!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Good Movie,"Social Network is really good. I would highly recommend it. It's very dark for a movie about business. You wouldn't expect a movie so dark about Facebook. Trent Reznor does a great job with the score, it's magnificent!!7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Timely and Timeless,"I've been digesting The Social Network for a few days now, and I'm still not sure I'm ready to offer up my thoughts on it. It's rare for a film to make such an impact on me; true, Toy Story 3 tugged at my heartstrings, while Inception raped my mind, but The Social Network appeals to me on a different level. Perhaps it's because of its relevance to our times, like last year's Up in the Air. Unlike that film, though, The Social Network is especially pertinent to me, because Facebook is such a huge part of my life. It's something that (quite literally) connects us all, much like the shared experience of seeing a movie; this is even more true in this case, as the screening I attended was ""sold-out,"" a free screening for Ohio State students. It's thrilling to think how each of us is a part of the story in some way. We are among the hundreds of millions who made this site the success it is; thus, the controversy. Thus, the film.David Fincher follows up his beautiful, haunting Benjamin Button with something completely different. Set in our times, and on our computer screens, the drama of The Social Network isn't confined to a fantastical take on the past. Instead, it's a thrilling look at our present. Fincher directs a cast full of young, fresh faces through performances that show their potential and hint at their future success. He keeps the film moving at a perfect pace, building an appropriate momentum that matches the intense success story that is Facebook.The structure is gorgeous, too. When the film first cuts to one hearing, then the other (as the film's tagline says, Zuckerberg makes a few enemies), you'll likely feel lost. There's no way to ground yourself in the images you're absorbing; the film just throws you in. This brilliant bit of editing portends the morally questionable path Zuckerberg heads down while also reflecting the very nature of Facebook. Just as you're unsure what exactly is happening in these first glimpses of the legal proceedings, so are Zuckerberg and company unsure of what Facebook is going to become. Numerous times throughout the film, characters admit to ""not knowing what it is."" It's huge, epic in a way that few things are. It spans the globe while being limited to screens. It's something profoundly modern, but handled with the film- making mastery of cinema's finest auteurs.Perhaps the highlight of the film is Aaron Sorkin's phenomenal screenplay. The dialogue flies fast and sharp, ably including the techno-babble but tempering it with humor and enough layman's terms to keep the audience in the loop. The inclusion of multiple points of view lends the film a sense of fairness and accuracy. Of course you expect that there's exaggeration for the sake of being more cinematic, dramatic, or entertaining, but the extensive attention paid to each character makes the story easier to believe than other films based on true stories.Sorkin's words sound perfectly acidic and natural coming out of Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg deserves awards attention for his performance as Zuckerberg; this is the role that will hopefully catapult him to the star status he so deserves (and has received in moderation after great turns in Adventureland and Zombieland). Andrew Garfield continues to impress as cofounder Eduardo Saverin; he now has three fantastic turns under his belt for the year, with Never Let Me Go yet to come (in my neck of the woods, at least).Justin Timberlake's involvement in the film likely gave some film aficionados pause, but he's a natural fit for Napster founder Sean Parker. He exudes confidence, energy, and just the right amount of sleaziness. Also worth noting is Rooney Mara, who has a small role but does big things with it, and will get her chance to shine under Fincher's direction again as Lisbeth Salander in the American take on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.At two hours, The Social Network is a long movie but it never feels like it. The film possesses an elegance of design not unlike that of the website it revolves around. Every aspect of the film is handled just so; from the gorgeous cinematography to the great cast, from the fitting editing to the unforgettable writing. The Social Network is, perhaps, the film of the year. It's timely and timeless, a combination that few films can ever hope to achieve.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
not a masterpiece but fairly entertaining,Let me start out by saying I am not a big fan of face book so when I picked up this film i was not sure what to expect. I personally think this film could have done a little better but it still managed to keep me interested for most of the movie. The acting is excellent the storyline is slightly stale but still pretty good. This film is flawed on many levels but still manages to maintain my interest. For a film on face book I found myself pleasantly surprised. Personally I think this film is is a bit overrated but is still fairly decent entertainment. Even people who don't like face book should give it a watch. Still not a bad film. 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Sorkins web/back,"If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing. One of the best TV shows produced ... EVER. Really great writing and smart plot combined. I didn't know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the ""Facebook"" movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can't really answer that, but I'm guessing he read the book, the main ""character"" of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don't know, but it's not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder. And Mr. Timberlake might finally get recognized as a real actor, too. He's earned it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Informative and carries an important message,"It's hard to believe that it's been almost a decade since this film's release. Since then, Facebook's grip on people's lives only seems to have tightened and Mr Zuckerberg's public profile has grown significantly. In this social media-dominated age this film was definitely necessary and it provides an informative and compelling insight into the story behind one of the biggest invention of the modern day.'The Social Media' is a well-constructed film that gets the balance between educating and entertaining about right. The characters are the most interesting part of the film and I thought they were brilliantly portrayed by all involved. This film, while primarily aiming to tell the complicated story behind Facebook, also carries an important message - no amount of 'friends' on social media or money in the bank is a substitute for 'real-life' friendship. The sooner people realise this the better.I deleted my Facebook account many years ago now and don't miss it one bit. My problem isn't just with Facebook, rather social media as a whole and the (in my view mostly negative) influence it has on people.

Good but dragged out,"Facebook and the Internet in general is a massive part of today's world, so making a film on this subject seemed like an interesting idea.The acting in this movie is very good, Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield in particular (two of the main characters). The way the story develops is interesting and seems like it would be very realistic but I found myself losing interest just over half way through, there is just so much talking and it feels extremely dragged out, 2 hours is a bit too long. Yes this is a good drama but I can't see why the critics have rated this so highly. I guess its all about personal opinion.For me this is worth a one time watch. 6/10",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Superb Acting!,"I just saw this movie at a screening in Chicago, IL and was so drawn into the story. Jesse Eisenburg, Andrew Garfield, and even Justin Timberlake gave superb performances. I was pleasantly surprised with the storytelling itself. Despite many critics saying Zuckerberg is portrayed in a negative light throughout the movie I found myself pulling for him, caring for the character and even feeling badly for him at times. Which is just silly when facebook is worth at least $25billion. I believe it was Eisenberg who gave such a great performance who make me like Zuckerberg so much. Bravo to everyone involved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fincher is still the king,"Can David Fincher make a bad movie (well lets forget about Alien 3)? The Social Network is so amazing on so many levels. The story is captivating from the opening scene, the scene between Mark & Erica in the bar. Sparking dialogue that leaps off the screen- so many memorable lines in just the 1st scene alone. The narrative hurtles along at such a pace & doesn't really let up until about the last 10 minutes of the movie. This is definitely a movie to watch a few times. The acting is awesome- the 3 lead actors are just great & there are some excellent supports (notably Rooney Mara). It is incredible the way the leads are depicted, very flawed, often unlikeable people in so many ways. Aaron Sorkin has written a really impressive screenplay (got to get a nod at Acadamy Awards!!!!) & plays an exec in 1 scene. There are so many great scenes, the opening is outstanding & the scene where Mark Zuckerberg looks at Sean partying through the window is really impressive too. We just got home from seeing it- it opened today & i cant wait to go back. But Im a Fincher fan & even his worst movies (Panic Room, The Game) are excellent. His best (Fight Club, Seven, Benjamin Button, Zodiac) are amongst my all time faves & this is more in the Zodiac style. Fincher for best director or Nolan? Highly recommended & what i would call a 'must see'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
all linked up,"First, I should admit that I can't verify the accuracy of ""The Social Network"". Nonetheless, David Fincher's look at Facebook's origins is a very engrossing movie. Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire. Then again, did anyone become a billionaire 100% ethically?Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student, taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and using it to enrich himself. He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). At least as portrayed in the movie.""The Social Network"" does come out really good. The main question that it seems to be posing is how honestly any business has come about. Of course, people might not consider that as they spend all day on Facebook.Definitely worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Binary Society,"Title, money and beauty are the three forms of aristocracy as director Preston Sturges once observed and they are the governing forces of our society. Connected to all three forms are curiosity and jealousy. Both are very powerful human emotions that give people a certain false sense of power and ""raison d'être"". Facebook the website/phenomenon is primarily built on it. Curiosity and jealousy intersect in unexpected ways, desires are triggered via mouse-clicks and somehow a whole new way of existence is created and released.What's even more powerful, David Fincher, writer Aaron Sorkin, the work of the entire cast and crew rounded off by an amazing score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross completely captured all the above mentioned aspects.But the ultimate feat, that ""The Social Network"" manages to achieve, is to show to an entire generation of internet users that no life can be lead if identity is not based in reality. Every life has a profile, not every life is profiled to have a soul. Mark Zuckerberg seemed to have grasped this and, according to the film, failed to choose the right side of this equation.Now this is one hell of a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Interesting story,"The social network movie was definitely much better than the Steve Jobs movie which bored me pretty much. I did watch the movie cause I wanted to know a bit about how facebook was created and how everything started. I liked the movie even if I am not a big Jesse Eisenberg fan. The story was told in a very interesting way and I liked how it showed the interactions between the different characters. Kudos to Andrew Garfield, this was some incredible performance.I know that the movie is probably not 100% accurate, cause it is a movie, but if Mark Zuckerbergs personality is really like they represented in the movie then his is not a nice person you want to hang or be around with, he comes off as very arrogant, a know-it-all who doesn't care about what happens to other people around him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
No Facebook in Facebook movie shock!,"Laggards may scoff at this film about Facebook, the current cultural phenomenon at the peak of its networking power, but the tale of it's genesis from the dorm rooms of Harvard to the bedrooms of every man, woman and child in the western world is as old as the carrier pigeon. So old that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has been at pains to point out that it's themes of betrayal, jealousy and friendship could have been written by Shakespeare or Chayefsky. This may sound like Sorkin starting to believe his own golden award enriched hype but there's an element of truth in his deserved self-aggrandising.Director David Fincher, sometimes prone to brilliant and artistic flights of fancy in films such as Fight Club, plays a steady hand here by letting Sorkin's quick fire script roll off the tongues of the leads and push the narrative with every sardonic quip and computer jargon soliloquy. It really is a testament to the mutually beneficial partnership between director and screenwriter that when The Social Network moves it's attention from computer screen to litigation room via three separate testimonies and perspectives like a Ritalin starved 14 year old, it is still able to hold your attention throughout. Of course there are the odd Fincher touches and themes, the exclusive frat party which is shot like one of Tyler Durden's wet dreams and his constant penchant for dark, autumnal, desk lamp lighting for example, but really this is an Aaron Sorkin film with the auteur Fincher providing a beautifully lit blank screen for typing.Facebook itself plays a relative backseat in proceedings, Sorkin all too aware that placing the website front and centre would be as interesting as accepting Farmville invites every two minutes. Instead the website's creator Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is the focus of attention. His inability to be included in the hierarchy of the American higher education system, be that via the exclusive rowing clubs or romantically with female classmates, the catalyst for the ironic creation of this all inclusive behemoth.Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg as a computer genius outsider with borderline Asbergers is engagingly restrained , neurotic and amusing in equal measure. Each million he makes and each friend request he accepts taking him further away from any semblance of real life and real friends. There are also stand out performances from Andrew Garfield as the frustrated friend, exacerbated admirer and co-worker Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as Napster creator Sean Parker. Timberlake especially enjoying the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of Zuckerberg's genius with Iago like arsehole zeal and cowardice.The Social Network is an almost perfect film that packages the early 21st century version of the American Dream in a simple and engaging morality tale.

Don't bother,"This movie is annoying from beginning to end. Zuckerberg is a thief, yes but mostly he is a snot-nosed, smart-ass, arrogant, spoiled little boy and a robot with no personality to speak of. (I think maybe students at MIT built him?) Either way, he's a loser and so is this movie. I had to force myself to sit in front of my computer to watch it. Really, the best part about it is being able to take in the lovely vision of the Winklehoses (or whatever their names are) as there certainly isn't any other eye candy in this movie. Apparently, except for the Winkelhineys, everyone at Harvard is just plain ugly, inside and out. A waste of film and two hours of my time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Smart, snappy and engaging thanks to good writing, performance and structure","As someone who has never joined Facebook and don't have any desire to do so, I approached the film on the subject with a certain caution since, although I was aware of the various back and forwards legally between all the individuals involved, I had generally treated it with only slight interest because I really don't care to consider how much money those involved now have. So it is to the film's credit then that I was easily held for the duration of the film and that the two hour running time zipped past. Opening with a scene of rapid-fire dialogue that only people in Aaron Sorkin's world talk in, the film keeps up the pace throughout with lots of snappy and convincing dialogue. This is also impressive when one considers that the majority of the ""action"" is either occurring in coding within computers or in stuffy conference rooms between two legal teams.This is where the importance of structure comes in and the film effortlessly moves between the two lawsuits and the events themselves as they unfold. None of it is in flashback per se but rather the audience is being told the story and getting to know the characters across the different time-zones at the same time without any real problem in terms of losing the audience or fragmenting the telling – it is a very strong structure and one that is edited together really well. In the telling, Zuckerberg is the focus and he doesn't come off well at all (although I imagine his immense wealth will perhaps soothe him a little). Here though he is very much an intellectual geeky type, difficult to get to know and, once he is able to ""be himself"" one discovers that actually he is even more of a jerk than when he at least had some sheer of politeness about him. He is the cynical heart of the film when it comes to the rather selfish manner in which the business unfolds – with Zuckerberg caught up in himself and seemingly motivated by some deeper sense of failing and inadequacy that manifests itself in a barely concealed jealously.Thankfully the film balances this character with the much more sympathetic Eduardo, who is really the heart of the piece in that he allows us to see Zuckerberg more clearly by virtue of outcomes and not just actions. How much these two and their relationship is dramatised as opposed to fictionalised, I'm not sure, but within Sorkin's script they both work well. Fincher also delivers and makes the film feel cinematic despite its very talky and chair-bound nature. He produces great shots, sets the scenes well and produces good performances throughout. Eisenberg stopped being the poor man's Michael Cera for me with this as he produces a character that he really understands and gets into – it isn't that he is saying the lines in a certain way so much as it is him ""being"" that character so that the rather bitter edge to him is always there even when the scene doesn't need it to be more than a shadow. Garfield is equally good and does make a lot of the scenes with his more emoting character, while Timberlake is great – OK a rather swaggering character but he pulls it off well. In support there are plenty of good turns from Hammer (who does great with his two roles), Mara, Jones and others and the only ones that did distract me a little was Disney's Brenda Song and a totally silent Adina Porter (True Blood) who seemed to be in a character that one would normally just stick an extra in – I doubt she was actually even in focus once during the film.Anyway, True Blood fan gripe aside, The Social Network is as strong as everyone says it is. It has the snap and pace that you know it will have thanks to Sorkin but it also has a strong base of characters and makes this tale of invention, betrayal, business and lawsuits into a fascinating and engaging character-driven thriller of sorts. The performances and direction are all on the money to make the most of this great script and the film does stand as one of the best of 2010 – hopefully the upcoming Oscars will reflect that as well.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Fincher and Sorkin in top form,"The Social Network is an immaculately crafted Facebook origin story and character study of Mark Zuckerberg that cuts to the heart - or lack there of - of what makes Zuckerberg (played by a razor sharp Jessie Eisenberg) such an unlikable guy.
It's an unflinching portrayal of a misanthropic, social climbing opportunist, who enriches himself by building a social network under the pretense of bringing people together and, in the process, double crosses his business partners and his only friend, Eduardo Saverin (an empathetic Andrew Garfield) when it becomes financially and socially prudent.Whether it's in business, friendships, or in any other relationship, honesty is the trait we prize most. Its what we look for in people we either hold dear or have close dealings with.The Social Network is an unflinching takedown of the unfeeling opportunist at it's helm. If you still have a Facebook account and have even the slightest urge to delete your account give The Social Network a watch. It might be the cure you're looking for. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that David Fincher masterfully directs Aaron Sorkin's great script and Trent Reznor's score is fantastic.

Zuckerberg's Personality Traits.,"I didn't much like this originally. In essence, it's a well produced film exhibiting Fincher/Sorkin/Reznor's talents.

This also makes him driven enough to be now considered as one of the 'Big Tech' elite. An intriguing film, but not a person I would aspire to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The director is the real star here! (no spoilers),"This is one of the movie I had on my watch list for a long time and which I wanted to see almost ever since it came out. I only had the chance now because I wanted to watch all the movies from the 2011 Oscar highlights list. The Social Network tells the story of the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg and how he created Facebook and later dealt with the problems it raised.This movie is directed by David Fincher and it can be seen from almost the first shot. The cinematography and the pace of the movie reminded me most about Fight Club because this is mainly Fincher's style of movie making. This movie was a blast from start to finish. I was captivated and drawn into the story from the first couple of scenes. The movie is not shocking or with a lot of twists and turns but the way is directed feels like a live experience. This movie is 2 hours long but it felt almost like an epic of 3 hours because the pacing was somewhat fast and there were a lot of things happening in it. First of all the performances were all top notch especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. The cinematography beautiful along with the directing which in my opinion should have won David Fincher the Oscar. The story is very realistic and extremely well told, I mean it captivated me even though there were no plot twists or CGI extravagance and props to the screenwriter for that. The only reasons I'm not giving this movie a 10 are 1. The poster for this movie is in my opinion misleading in a way that makes you think that the movie will be about how unsafe Facebook can be at times but the movie is almost about something completely different. 2. Some of the politics and laws were way to complex exposed in movie and it was hard at times to keep up with all of them. 3. The score was a big let down. Now, I know David Fincher wasn't renowned for being a director who utilizes music score very much to enhance the quality of the movie (example Fight Club) but this score won an Oscar that year and compared to Inception's score (which is the only one I know from the nominees that year) is completely underwhelming. I can't understand how they didn't gave the Oscar that year to Danny Elfman or Alexandre Desplat or other composers who I think did a better job than the composers for this movie did.Overall: A very interesting and captivating movie with terrific performances, great direction but with a slightly misleading poster that made me believe the movie was going to be about something else, some hard law science and poor score. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
How common boy change the world,"As everyone knows, this is a biographical film about the founder of Facebook. Many people watch this film for the purpose of finding the way to success and knowing how to succeed. Just like many Chinese people are scrambling to buy Ma Yun's books, this is very funny.

The film's response in China is not very strong. There are many people who don't like the film very much. I think it should be that I want to find the way to success through the film, but I let them down. This is also a very traditional biographical film. Everything is very close to the real life of the protagonist. Of course, we can't describe the specific plot content here. Here we need to vigorously praise our actors. Their tension is not always perfect, especially the performance of the actors, which really conforms to their personal characteristics.

An unpleasant time had by all,"It's a story of really despicable people making a lot of money. If you are interested in making a lot of money, too, you won't find out how they did it by watching this movie -- all you will know is that Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the US.The flashback technique is used very ineffectively. The scenes of depositions (or whatever it is that is going on at those tables -- why aren't we told?) are unnecessary for introducing the next segments. It seems to me that the movie makers, while telling us about two lawsuits, are actually only protecting themselves from a lawsuit. They are trying to persuade us that the events in the movie, true or false, were presented in sworn testimony. Who cares? The story could have been better told straight forward.Also, if the flashforwards had been omitted, there would have been some time left to let us see what happened that turned the company into a money-maker.The actors did a great job of portraying unpleasant human beings who destroyed everyone who tried to get close to them, but that's not reason enough to see the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"An overall good, yet over-hyped ride","I've got to admit, I was not entirely enthusiastic about a movie based on Facebook. For one, I didn't really enjoy the website and I didn't see why everyone was so obsessed with it. Secondly, I didn't think that the material in the movie would be all that fascinating, seeing as it was about making a website. Big Whoop.But boy, was I wrong. While the basis of this movie is about building a website, the fundamentals are not. At the heart of this movie are the relationships that were built, the relationships that grew, and the relationships that were lost. What sucked me in was not all the mathematics and computer mumbo jumbo (something that, as a non-computer scientist, I didn't understand). Rather, the dynamics between the characters are what resonated with me.Jesse Eisenberg plays Mark Zuckerberg with such a delicate mix of iciness and shyness, that in some scenes you don't know which one he is really portraying. He pulls of the fast dialogue really well, and although you tend to fall towards the ""hate"" side throughout the movie, by the end he'll still manage to leave you feeling sympathetic to his case(Although I have to say, if this is Mark in real life, the movie did not do much to make him look heroic). Andrew Garfield does a spectacular job of playing Eduardo Saverin, Mark's best friend and initial co-founder of Facebook. He conveys a sympathetic, honest and kind spirit about Eduardo, and we can all root for him as well as relate to him. This is a story of a friendship gone wrong, and in the climatic final scene, when Garfield really lets loose, is when the performance is at its strongest. Other notable characters are Justin Timberlake who proves he can act (and FINALLY be hated!) as a slimy, get under your skin, all around annoying Sean Parker (which means he is doing his job well, seeing as that was the goal) as well as Armie Hammer, who impresses by donning a double role as the winklevoss twins.Overall, don't see this movie for girls (who did not add anything special to the plot and shouldn't have even been there), or even really for facebook. But see it for the impressive portrayals and for the relationships built. You'll root for some, you'll hate some, and overall, you'll enjoy the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Genesis not quite Genius,"A few minutes into The Social Network we are presented with a fairly staggering piece of irony that stuck with me for the rest of the film, and that is that the would be creator of the ultimate social networking tool would himself be a socially inept outcast eager to find acceptance and inclusion within the Harvard University elite. So in tracing the genesis of the Facebook The Social Network whilst wrestling with concepts of creation and inspiration finds the idea in it's simplest form early on, defining the subject in it's own necessity from the outset.Core to the film are relatively routine thematic dynamics such as greed, betrayal and of course friendship, those who are familiar with Director David Fincher's previous works such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2004) will recognise Fincher's look at the inner workings and purpose of his characters relationships, as well as the speed in which those relationships come and go in way reminiscent of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).The Narrative of the film is constructed cleverly through the use of two depositions which effectively provide a running commentary of two stories. Both depositions feature our central character Mark Zuckerburg (Jesse Eisenberg) as he attempts to stave off those claiming credit for the invention that would go on to define him ""The Facebook"". The first sees Zuckerburg headhunted to be chief programmer for ambitious entrepreneurs and athlete twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and their associate Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The trio ask Zuckerberg to help them build a Social Networking Website called ""Harvard Connection"" one of many notions suggested as a potential forerunner for the Facebook concept, the similarity of the sites leads the twins and Narendra to press for legal charges after Facebook explodes in popularity.The second and more interesting of the depositions focuses on the creation and rise of Facebook, as well as the relationship of co-founders Mark Zuckerburg and Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield. It is here we are also introduced to Justin Timberlake's smooth talking portrayal of Sean Parker who attempts to muscle in on the Facebook frenzy. As mentioned earlier the inner workings, nature and strength of the relationships are inspected by Fincher and the cast here.So what did I like? Well the cast does a sound job with the nicely calculated script. Eisenberg and Garfield are the highlights for me, both manage to bring conviction and whit to their roles. In addition those who indulge in Facebook themselves will enjoy seeing how the site along with many of it's intricacies were conceived, also there is much to relate within the film's references to how the site has impacted peoples lives and created new social behaviours.On the flip side the subject matter is ultimately more captivating than it's subjects, who for the most part are reflective of over privileged American youth culture. The climax of the movie is pretty unremarkable and lacks any true climactic tension. With that said it's not enough to detract from what is a solid project, guided by fine work from all involved which should be a largely inclusive viewing experience for movie goers and Facebook lovers a like.Go see it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Vindication,"First of all, I don't have a Facebook account. Second of all, after watching the film I still don't have a Facebook account and I'm not planning to have one. That was as far as I could go for Facebook sakes, but what really made me see the movie was its jaw dropping trailer and the relevance it accounts in today's connected world.The film as a whole is superbly crafted. The screenplay brought by the genius Aaron Sorkin is taut, witty and spitfire like machine that requires people to fully invest their attention. It takes the audience to a point where they can't help but ask ""What did he just say?"" or say ""Now that's cool, that's really cool.."". The screenplay stands equally superb as the direction. I'll just simply state that Fincher is Fincher when it comes to his direction and roving camera work. But what really haunts me in this film is his signature lighting. Unlike any other of his films in the past, in here it flowed vividly unscathed. It's always dark yet captivating to look at. It has an effect perfectly blended through the immaculate score and story that in my opinion, results in subtle resonance of every photographed scene.On the side of acting I'd like to give recognition to the casting director for it is a great job putting all the ensemble together. From Eisenberg to Garfield to Timberlake who I am not surprised to live up an over the top role, to even Jones' short but sweet participation are all suited. Although the stand out award I'd like to give to Mr. Armie Hammer. His role is just Tailor fit, literally as his jacket. From his statuesque as a rower all through out as a dapper at Harvard, he is just believable in that field. He is after after all the Winklevoss BrotherS.The Social Network is a significant film to be shown in this day of age. People are at the coffee shops, internet hubs, computer room at their houses all wanting to be connected and have a connection, socially of course. This film is so evident that people are somehow meant to socialize, I'm not speaking as an expert here or whatever, but by just witnessing all my friends and relatives speaking the lingo ""Facebook Me"", or ""Add Me As Your Friend"" is such a testament that we actually do care to care about other's lives I don't know if it's good, but most people claim it's fun and so the rest of the film.Based on my few learnings about this movie, Mark Zuckerberg just like many other guys got the better out of him because of a girl and the inevitable Heartbreak which, on the other hand brings out the best out of a man. Then subsequently enforced him out to build the phenomenal Facebook, or should I say The Facebook.com. The way I see it, Zuckerberg in the film doesn't really know how to properly socialize in public and maybe it is in real life. But we all know all of it doesn't matter anymore, for he just founded the biggest and most influential social connector existing in our technological world today. Facebook is his outlet. I think it is part genius and part love, which in the last scene of the film tells you it is a social vindication out of a sullen admiration.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"great casting, but too over hyped",Yes I get that this film won awards and that people hold it in high regard. First thing is that the casting is great. Eisenberg plays zuckerberg well and I really don't think anyone else could pull it off. Garfield and timberlake did good always and I enjoy seeing rashida jones in things. The characters were good and I felt the cast played them well. I'd say the dialog however was a little half baked in places and the scenes depicting the hearing were not the best. Apart from that though still an enjoyable film with good acting and directing. But not as great as everyone makes out.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Doesn't Fully Connect,"David Fincher has always been one of my favorite directors, a visual stylist unafraid of pushing boundaries or putting his full effort into controversial (and sometimes even grotesque) scripts. With the exception of ""Alien3,"" my affection for this auteur has maintained stable through the years; even more difficult, patience-testing, mainstream-leaning works like ""Zodiac"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" maintain a human solidity and warmth at their labyrinth cores. And hot on the trail of those mainstream-leaning works comes ""The Social Network,"" a film that has been hailed as capturing the Zeitgeist of our time (embodied in Mark Zuckerberg -- played here by Jesse Eisenberg -- the founder of Facebook); and while nobody ever said a Zeitgeist needed to be embraced by all, I found the coldness of the film overall to be its most notable (and most crippling) aspect. The film presents Zuckerberg as a motor-mouthed, self-absorbed, and socially inept college kid who, in a fit of anger over a girl who has just snubbed him, germinates the seed of Facebook over the course of a few drunken hours (the film will return to the theme of romantic/personal failure as the seed of vengeance-through-technology retribution more than once); the remainder of ""The Social Network"" criss-crosses between present day and flashback, chronicling the bridges Zuckerberg burned as quickly as they were built, and the wake of angry, ripped-off colleagues and contemporaries left in the dust as Facebook became the Internet's premier social networking site. While Aaron Sorkin's whip-cracking dialog all too often feels like a less endearing, less caustic version of Mamet-speak that is never as clever as it thinks it is, the real surprise of ""The Social Network"" is the utter conventionality of Fincher's direction. For a film as jam-packed with characters as this, we never feel especially close to anybody, and Zuckerberg (who is essayed with an admirable lack of grace, couth, and empathy by Eisenberg), who dominates the proceedings, is both loathsome and pathetic. Perhaps a second viewing will be more fulfilling, but for now, ""The Social Network"" is a rather unappetizing contemporary history lesson without much beyond its incendiary content to recommend it. Actually, it is worth viewing for the fantastic minimalist score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Hyped to the max,"There was a great deal of hype about this movie. I was sucked in. I watched it last night. It was a good movie. However. I watched Black Swan earlier that day, and I think that both that movie and Inception were in a different league to The Social Network in terms of concept and execution. The film offered an engaging insight into the machinations of Facebook's launch and subsequent growth, supported by excellent performances from the cast of relative unknowns. I expected it to use that central story to focus on the tragedy of the split in the friendship between the two founders. It didn't and I'm not sure why. I think there was a lack of real emotion behind the slick facade of this movie. I might be in the minority, but I think it would be a travesty if The Social Network won best picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Rubbish film. Avoid.,"The opening scene, namely the one of the boy and the girl in the bar was pathetic. The sound mix was so badly edited, that I could hardly hear the dialogue over the intrusive music. Add to this the fact that the boy spoke as rapidly as Woody Allen on speed, it made for an instantly annoying experience and I switched the DVD off. I won't be watching this film ever again, no matter how good the rest of it is supposed to be.The opening few minutes of a film are supposed to entice you in, get you hooked, make you care and want to watch the rest of the story unfold. The opening few minutes of this film did the complete opposite - it made me angry (never a good thing where I'm concerned because I just go B*LLSH*T and switch off the DVD).If that boy speaks as rapidly throughout the film, as he did in the first few minutes, then I consider switching the film off to be a blessing. Rapid dialogue annoys the hell out of me, mainly because people just don't talk like that - like they don't need to think about their response when engaged in conversation, taking only a nano-second before answering a question or responding to a prompt for opinion, etc.If this film wins any awards, it should be for the worst opening 2 minutes of a film in the history of cinema.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

For better and worse this movie represents America.,"Was everything in the movie 100% accurate to what actually happened? Almost certainly not. Did that stop the filmmakers from taking basic facts about the situation and turning it into a riveting piece of new era drama? Absolutely not.For better and worse this movie represents America. The ability to create, free enterprise, the internet, without having a dollar to your name, you can use these things to make yourself a millionaire. But we all know, being a millionaire isn't cool anymore. What is also inherently American is to take someone else's idea and improve upon it, with or without their consent. Though what follows, will likely be a lawsuit, another American tradition.From a filmmaking standpoint the story was told incredibly well by one of the greatest screenwriters of his generation, Aaron Sorkin, using the legal proceedings as the wraparound for the plot from start to finish was a clever device that intrigued and enlightened without being a distraction. The score by first time screen musician (and long time Nine Inch Nails member) Trent Reznor and his tandem composer Atticus Ross was probably the best thing to happen to this film. Without the score it isn't the same movie, it provides a somber tone that gives the movie it's unsettling feel.You could make the point that the movie also embodied another American ideal, greed. Although Zuckerberg didn't seem to care much about money (in the film and apparently in real life) the corporate greed of the lawyers during the takeover, as well that of the way Sean Parker was portrayed seemed to leave a heavy footprint.But in the end Rashida Jones' character was right. Paying everyone who was rightfully owed a piece of the pie was nothing more than a speeding ticket. At the time of writing this Mark Zuckerberg has a net worth of $49.7 Billion (making him the eighth richest person in the world), and no amount that was given away could even be remotely considered as significant to that sum.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
By Far David Fincher's Best Work,"This film offers what purports to be the true story of Mark Zuckerberg the founding of Facebook. I suspect it is fairly accurate, as it is based on court documents. What may seem like a simple story of geek innovation is also a story of theft, betrayal, and the rise of modern social networking technology.Jesse Eisenberg is amazing as Mark Zuckerberg. How accurate he is (or any of the actors are) I do not know. But his geek genius and social ineptitude are clear, and I think that is spot on. Eisenberg was the right choice for the role, as no other person has the geeky vibe but can be a very serious actor (as well as comedian).Justin Timberlake is also great as Sean Parker. Timberlake does not act often, but when he does, I am often impressed (he was great in ""Black Snake Moan"", for example). Maybe being a talkative big shot is not a stretch for him, but he pulls it off, and gives me a whole new perspective on Parker, a man I have somewhat admired. Though, I admire Shawn Fanning much more, and viewers should not confuse the two -- the film does not make this distinction clear. I had no idea he had any involvement in technology beyond Napster (and I find it odd that a geek would be so party-happy, though I guess he worked more on the investment end).Kevin Spacey produced this film, and I love him for it. Spacey is an amazing actor, and I am glad to see him move into the realm of producing, not unlike George Clooney if I am not mistaken. Trent Reznor was also involved on the music end. Fincher has long been a Reznor fan, so I think this is a perfect choice, and Trent nails the score. I am surprised his involvement did not get a bigger notice.David Fincher has been a great director for years. ""Seven"" is obviously his masterpiece, and even the troubled ""Alien 3"" is decent. ""Zodiac"" was a great telling of a classic true crime tale. I think ""Social Network"" might be the best yet, though. While ""Seven"" is his best overall, it suffers from not being a film everyone would want to watch. This one is more universal and very timely, especially with Zuckerberg being 2010's Man of the Year.If you have not yet caught this one, do so now. I suspect it will get a handful of Oscar nominations, and maybe even a win or two. Fincher's dark visions brought the world of Silicon Valley? Oh, yes!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Terrific and Thought Provoking,"With 10 films up for Best Picture these days I think it is a pretty safe bet that it will get a nod, but back in the days of 5 nominees I would really doubt it unless the winter crop of Oscar Contenders is a big disappointment. Personally the only two films that I have seen this year that I enjoyed more were Inception and Animal Kingdom ( I have not yet seen the Town.), but as I said before I expect to see several more terrific films during the next 4 months.I am not a huge Fincher fan. I have liked every single one of his films. I have loved none of them. This is now my favorite Fincher film. Since Zodiac he has really made fantastic looking films, and this continues that trend. Panic Room was my favorite film of his prior to this, though I am sure I am in a minority there.Eisenberg should really got nominated. I haven't a clue if he can win, but he was brilliant. Every little nuanced scene he shined in. I really believed his character. It truly is his film.I would like to see Andrew Garfield nominated for Best Supporting Actor as well. He is one of those guys that I know that I have seen in a few things to date, but I have never found him memorable. However; he does a wonderful job here and this should give his career a big boost.I have always been surprised at how solid Justin Timberlake has been in his films to date, and he does a great job here too. Not as strong as either Garfield or Eisenberg though.The screenplay by Sorkin was rock solid and will certainly get a nomination. You have to wonder how a story about Facebook is going to translate to the screen. The answer with all the talent involved is brilliantly.The movie opens a sort of Tarantino type restaurant scene with Eisenberg and a girlfriend, prior to the credits. It sets the tone for the Zuckenberg character and lets the audience know that they are in for a fascinating ride.One of the great successes of the film is to cause one to ponder just what an impact social networking has had on our society. It really has changed the way people interact with one another. And it is subtle but powerful. In my opinion as a man who lived through the last cultural upheaval (Hippies and Vietnam), this is not for the better.One last thing I must mention. There are a very important set of twins in the story, and I thought these guys are really good. I wonder what else they have done. I was totally blown away when I found out that the two guys who played the twins are not even related in real life. I mean they looked exactly alike.A lot of humor and a fascinating story. I love a good character study and this was certainly rock solid in that category.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Not quite the movie of the year, but...","This is the true story film of the year. The big problem with it is that the story is so good, it would be brilliant in any narrative medium. Personally the most cinematic elements of the film were the rowing race and the inter-cutting of the court cases. The former being superfluous to the film in many ways.The rest of the movie only works great as a movie because of the acting, which is top class. Other than that I'd happily read the story in a book or see it as a play (probably the medium where it would seem it's most profound). There are standout scenes, but nothing struck me as anything exclusive to film. This is why I rate it a seven. The story and acting make the movie worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Price of Success,"Well, I certainly wasn't all that excited about The Social Network when I first heard about it. A movie about a Web site that was founded by an obnoxious twenty-something sounds awful on paper. Even the dynamic duo of director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin didn't generate all that much enthusiasm from yours truly. But three phenomenal trailers later, and I couldn't wait to see this film. It helped that early reviews compared it to Citizen Kane and The Godfather, among other all-time greats. So does it live up to the hype? The short answer is YES! It's a very compelling film about the time in which we live and a man who impacted our time greatly. He's not the most pleasant hero, but his story makes for two incredible hours of cinema, and all those involved should be proud.While this film certainly is more than just ""the Facebook movie,"" it still is, first and foremost, about the founding of the irritatingly inescapable social networking site. In 2003, Harvard student and computer whiz Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was dumped by his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara), an event that ended up changing the Internet and turning Zuckerberg into a billionaire. But that certainly didn't happen overnight.After his breakup with Erica, Mark went home and drowned his sorrows online, writing some demeaning blog posts about his now ex-girlfriend and creating a site called ""Facemash,"" which asked users to choose the hotter of two female Harvard students. The site crashed the Harvard network almost instantly and attracted the attention of the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler (Armie Hammer), popular and athletic twin brothers who are looking for a programmer to create a site they came up with, The Harvard Connection, which will allow Harvard students to connect with one another on the Internet.Zuckerberg agrees to work with them, but instead, he goes to his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) with a similar idea—The Facebook. Essentially, it's like MySpace, but exclusive. Only students with a Harvard e-mail address will be able to use it. Once launched, The Facebook becomes a hit. Everyone at Harvard is using about it, and Mark and Eduardo are the most talked-about students on campus. Once The Facebook expands, it attracts the attention of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), party boy extraordinaire and founder of Napster. Sean wants this project to succeed, but his ideas drive a rift between Mark and Eduardo. This rift eventually becomes permanent, and the latter sues the former, who is also facing a lawsuit from the twins he screwed over years ago.I've always been a big fan of Aaron Sorkin's fast, smart dialogue. The man knows how to grab your attention with his words, and his work here might just be better than anything he has ever done. But even more than the exceptional dialogue, the way he crafts his story is just masterful. The Social Network is so many things that giving it a label is almost impossible. It's a drama, a coming-of-age character study, an examination of entrepreneurship and the things that often get tossed aside in the endless quest for more, and a look at who we are as a society in the digital age. This film succeeds because of a number of things, but in my opinion, number one on that list would be Aaron Sorkin.Mark Zuckerberg is an absolute fascinating character played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg. I really didn't think the young actor capable of a performance like this, but he's great. This is a man who is completely driven, but he's not driven as to make money as one might expect. Instead, the currency he seeks is status. And while he obtains a kind of superficial acceptance (thanks to Parker), he never gets what he desperately wants. In fact, everything he does moves him further and further away from true acceptance. Eisenberg pulls of all the complex layers of Zuckerberg exquisitely. He's a fighter, energized at the prospect of finally being ""cool."" But by the end of the film, he seems exhausted just being him—almost as if he knows he has defeated himself. I think this will be the defining performance of Eisenberg's career, as he is another big reason the film succeeds. I also think he's a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination.Eisenberg's costars are uniformly excellent, especially Andrew Garfield. He has a scene near the end of the film in which he confronts his former best friend, and he's just dynamite. It's what gives the film an emotional pull (the proceedings until that point were, for the most part, a little distant). In this scene, things become clearer and we recognize Eduardo as this story's tragic hero and Mark and Sean as its villains (though again, credit Eisenberg for making Mark a somewhat sympathetic villain). This scene just might land Garfield, who's taking the reins from Tobey Maguire in the Spider-Man franchise, an Oscar nomination, and he just might be there on Oscar night with none other than Justin Timberlake, who's got just the right amount of charm to make Sean Parker tolerable to watch. He's a scoundrel, no doubt, but Timberlake makes him a magnetic presence on screen.There will be those who debate the veracity of events in The Social Network as filmgoers debate the truth behind any film that's based on real events. What can't be debated is this film's expert craftsmanship. Sorkin and Fincher, with the help of a handful of perfectly cast actors, craft a tale that works on a number of different levels. It tells the story of a conflicted and fascinating young man while also outlining the rise of perhaps THE company of the Internet age and showing us what an obsession with social status can drive us to do. It doesn't matter if you use Facebook or not, The Social Network will sweep you up completely from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Network,"The Social Network is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich and follows Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg as he creates what is now one of the most visited websites and forms of social networking ever entitled Facebook.The film shows the socially awkward and acid tongued Mark Zuckerberg as he creates the website and after time he keeps getting more and more members signing up and joining it and after it becomes a big success that is when the different lawsuits come out. I am not a particularly really tech friendly person. I know how to use parts of a computer and the internet, but if you were to ask me to build a website from scratch, design anything, or anything to do with coding I am completely lost. The Social Network does talk about how they create the site and some big technical words may come your way, but it is not the whole film and doesn't leave those who are unfamiliar with it confused and not able to get into what is going on in the film. There is so much I absolutely loved and adored about The Social Network that I will try and remember it all and get it into this review. First off the direction is great. Yes this is a Hollywood big budget movie, but it does not feel like one. Because the film itself is pretty dark the atmosphere and mood set by the director is more low key and has a haunting and at times macabre look to it that suits the going on happenings of the characters around. When, I talk about this I do not mean to say that The Social Network is a horror film, but instead that in other ways it is disturbing and very dark and the dim lighting and use of what I guess would be fluorescent lights to give some scenes a haunting glow, I thought was pulled off perfectly and set the tone for the film really well. The script to the film is amazing for several reasons. It takes a true life story that in the hands of another director, or script writer could have become a fairly unoriginal biopic, but instead it breathes life and there is so much energy here. The characters, or at least a lot of them in the film have very rich vocabularies and they tend to talk very fast, but just listening to some of these conversations is fascinating because of the quick wit of some of the characters and what they say as well as some of the awkwardness around it as well because a lot of these characters have very poor social skills (is that why they created a social networking site?). The script which goes back and forth from the characters at school to talking with the lawyers during the lawsuit is all absolutely fascinating and with the quick jump cut editing it feels fresh, alive and something that we do not see all that often. The acting from Jesse Eisenberg who plays Mark Zuckerberg is a brilliant performance because of his smug arrogance as well as his sharp wit and acid tongued speech to his social awkwardness. It's all here in this performance and it's great. At the same time all of the supporting characters do a great job as well. The Social Network not only looks at the creation of one of the biggest and most profitable websites of all time, but also shows the decline of today's youth. The teenagers and young adults that are portrayed in the film all have huge egos and are really egocentric, narcissistic and nihilistic. They care for themselves and themselves only and in some ways will do whatever it takes to succeed. In it's own way, perhaps the creation of Facebook has led to some of this. Instead of talking to a friend, or family member on the phone, you now all do it on Facebook and you lose that sense of personal touch and the relationship to the person. The conversations one has on the internet or cell phones is a lot different than it used to be and illiteracy and bad grammar and English skills are on the rise and is some of these sites to blame? The film also looks at these dangerously empty lives of these young adults who try and fill in what is missing with drugs, alcohol, sex and money, but we see that they are never really happy and continue to lead an empty existence. The film is a brilliant character study in that way. I found myself loving The Social Network from close to the beginning right up to the end and the film lingered with me. I thought about it and what I would tell others and say in this review about it. The film is powerfully and masterfully made with an enormous amount of talent behind it. Mark my words in years and decades from now The Social Network will still be watched and talked about by a lot of people and will go down in history as one of the best films of all time. The way it captures the mood and feel of today's youth is brilliant and is a real eye opener while being tremendously entertaining at the same time.

"A masterful film ...""I'm CEO, Bitch""","The real-life Facebook saga, beginning and ending with Harvard University student Mark Zukerberg, a computer nerd permanently dressed-down in T-shirts and a sweat jacket, who turned one drunken night of blogging about his ex-girlfriend into the top networking site on the web. The success of Facebook, an internet phenomenon currently worth some 25 billion dollars, did not come to Zuckerberg easily, what with his best friend and CFO squeezed out early on; twin Harvard athletes and their business manager suing Mark for stealing their idea; and Napster co-founder Sean Parker appointing himself Zuckerberg's unofficial business manager. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, adapting Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires"", keep the past-and-present action moving lickety-split; no corners are cut, though the duo speed so quickly at sharp angles that viewers could easily get lost in the shuffle if not paying rapt attention. No problem, as Jesse Eisenberg (as the curiously ever-complicated Zuckerberg) gives one of the finest performances of the decade. Supporting cast, including Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer (playing both Winklevoss brothers), are excellent as well. Films like ""The Social Network"", which are predominantly made up of conversations over action, run the risk of becoming bogged down in talk (or, worse, repeating themselves). Fincher is highly adept at creating inner-tension within his scenario--so that the picture is never boring--and substituting visual thrills with vicarious thrills. This is a smart, prescient, tightly-edited piece of work, one with the sting of defeat as well as the sting of success.

"A movie about the founding of facebook, and the ensuing legal problems. I really enjoyed this, more then expected.I say A-","Movie about the founding of facebook (was it stolen), and the legal problems Zuckerberg (Eisenbeg) faced. After his girlfriend breaks up with him Zuckerberg decides to get revenge on her by starting a billion dollar company. I have to admit going in I really did not have any desire to watch this being that I'm not into facebook(I don't even have a personal facebook page). Also from what I knew about Zuckerberg made me go in wanting to really hate the guy. The first half I found it easy, he was really cocky and only thought of himself. I don't know how accurate Eisenberg's portrayal was but he was pretty much what I expected. Has the movie progressed I started to feel sorry for him, Facebook took off too quick and he was at the mercy of everyone he came in contact with in order to be liked. For some reason when ever a movie takes over all media and becomes the place to be (like this one did) I have a feeling like I need to find something wrong with it so I can hate it, (like I do with Titanic...different review) but I found it difficult with this one. I'm not positive that it is good enough to win best actor or best picture at the Oscars but I would not be surprised if it did. I really liked it, much more then I thought I would. I give it an A-.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"The filmmaking is all top-notch, but the story's analytical approach dampens its effect somewhat.","The filmmaking is all on fine form in 'The Social Network (2010)', which you essentially always expect from a David Fincher flick regardless of if it has an Arron Sorkin screenplay under the hood. There are, for all intents and purposes, no faults to be found whatsoever when it comes to this aspect of the piece's production; the quick-firing, quick-witted script meshes wonderfully with the astutely self-assured direction and the almost sickly slick cinematography. The movie only goes so far in being an entertaining experience, however, mainly because it has a somewhat seedy feel to it and it usually takes a more hands-off, analytical approach to its focal events. It always feeling like there's something slightly off at its just out-of-reach centre (ironically, this is perhaps a fantastic allegory for both the central character and his ever-expanding creation). Still, there's no doubt that this is a compelling story that sinks its teeth into you and, ultimately, leaves things up to audience interpretation - mainly in terms of who you feel is 'right' and who you want to root for - while also including a number of nuanced performances that make that decision a lot harder than it might, at first, seem. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An amazing piece of work!,"Fincher is a true original and must have a lot of power in all areas of the film process because as usual, he avoided making a ""Hollywood Movie."" And since it wasn't a hackneyed movie that we've seen so many times before, he made it very interesting with the help of music, sound design, manic conversations, wonderful photography. The acting is all superb. I am still amazed how multi talented Justin Timberlake is.Jesse Eisenberg stole the show. He played a cold nerdy brilliant workaholic with nothing else on his mind. He created a character who was easily annoyed by improper questions and anything mundane.Thank God there was no happy ending with all sides doing a group hug. This is a fascinating film with tons of facts and evidence that of which I had been grossly unaware.Highly recommend!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Geek Tragedy,"This film chronicles the founding of the website Facebook. The story is told in flashbacks, turning a simple tale into a rather clumsy narrative. It is somewhat of a geek tragedy in that Zuckerberg, the founder of the most successful social network ever built, is a social misfit - basically a rude, arrogant jerk. Yes, it's the story of the little guy who makes it big, but the little guy is such a wet blanket that one can't root for him. Eisenberg delivers his lines so rapidly that one has to strain to understand what he's saying. Sprinking the dialog with technical jargon doesn't help matters. It's entertaining for the most part, but never rises above mediocrity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Stunning,"And fascinating, this story of how the Facebook network was conceived, born and implemented by the work of a young Harvard student against winds and tides of all kind. We see how a small computer program turned quickly into a social network of friendship congregating now more than 1,000,000 members spread all over the world, composing a nation of more inhabitants than most countries. The movie is well directed and the cut is a very effective succession of short sequences whose conducting thread consists in the depositions in the lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg the young student above mentioned, motivated by the several legal complications his activities provoked. These sequences contain a succession of flashbacks related to the questions and references that arose during those depositions in a very vivid rhythm in which the lively dialogues and the excellent acting of all the cast members play a no less important part. I didn't cast a higher vote to this movie only because for all that its theme is not as important as to allow it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Non-stop fast talking,"""The Social Network"" is a movie where the character never shut up throughout the movie. But there is nothing wrong with that.The story is non-fiction but the script is mostly fiction. It was dramatized. So it's not very dramatic in real life when Zuckerberg created ""FaceBook"".The movie has a lot of dialog and that is not a flaw. The dialog is too deep and the tempo of the dialog is too fast. It's not very easy to understand but it was overwhelming + amazing.The acting was great. Jesse Eisenberg is always a great actor. Andrew Garfield's performance makes me wanna watch the reboot of Spiderman which I was suppose to boycott. Justin Timberlake's acting was unexpected. It's his best performance so far.""The Social Network"" tells the true story of Facebook but the best thing about this movie is the dialog, acting, directing. I have nothing else to say but this movie is one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A toxic combination of being a nerd and being arrogant,"""The social netwerk"" is based on ""The accidental billionaires"" (2009) by Ben Mezrich. As Mezrich already indicated in his book the story is not a biography in the strict scense of the word but more a character study of Mark Zuckerberg.In contrast to the book the narrative structure of the film consists of a series of flashbacks with a a lawsuit between Zuckerberg and some of his early business partners as a starting point.The film is an exception in the oeuvre of David Fincher, most of whom's movies contain a crime element.In the film Zuckerberg stays first in Harvard and later (when Facebook outgrows the campus) in Silicon Valley. In both instances Zuckerberg is a loner who stays away from the wild parties. Parties that have much in common except for the fact that in Harvard they are celebrated by ""old money"" and in Silicon Valley by ""new money"".The main deficiency of the film is the lack of character development of main character Zuckerberg. He is and remains a combination of nerd and asshole.At the start of the film his girlfriend Erica Albright breaks with Mark and comments that:""You're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.""Fincher spent a lot of attention (that is takes) to this scene. Rightly so because it is maybe the key scene of the whole film.At the end of the film in a famous last line Zuckerberg's lawyer says that it is better to settle the disputes because he will certainly make an unsympathetic impression with the jury. She says:""You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be.""After this conversation she leaves Zuckerberg. All on his own he tries again to make a connection with Erica via his own network. It is the only time in the whole film we feel sorry for him.After the key scene with Erica I just described, there is another important scene. To take revenge on Erica Mark hacks the Harvard network, steals the pictures of female students and makes the website ""facemash"". On facemash one gets random pictures of two female students and can vote which of them is the most sexy. At the same time it was party time for his fellow students. A busload of pretty girls was brought in
and entertained the Harvard boys. Tha revenge of Mark Zuckerberg surely was sexist, but I am not sure if the campus party was not equally sexist.These two important scenes are in my opinion the best part of the film. Of course the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin is razor sharp during the whole film, but with the terrible techno house like soundtrack the dialogues are often hard to follow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Advertising and critics demand we love a mediocre film for the rich.,"The trailers are the best I've seen, the reviews eerily better, making me wonder what cost more, the advertising or paying off critics, because bottom line is if Facebook were not popular, you would not care at all about this film. AT ALL. People raving about this film are simply fooled by the trite joy that ""Hey, I use Facebook and here are the guys who made it"", when the film itself is dismal. I was hoping for another Zodiak, and refuse to believe David Fincher had anything to do with this bland wreck. It's a film made by rich people about rich people for rich people.All characters are one-dimensional with no arc Critics rave of witty dialogue, but only three moments offer any (you can see them online and save your money). Any potential emotional conflict is COMPLETELY left out, most notably sharing in any inward struggle the main character must have had to betray his only friend for no reason. We are given blow-jobs and cocaine over character growth and anyone we can relate to.This film demonstrates two trends in Hollywood that in my opinion are destroying cinema, first and most importantly is that if a film is ""based on a true story"" it need not tell a story well. There are recreation scenes on ""America's Most Wanted"" with more character growth than this film. A documentary would be more entertaining because we would not be expecting to sympathize and vicariously bond with any characters.The second destructive trend in Hollywood is pouring advertising money into bad films. It seems the better the film, the less advertising money is put in because they know people will love the film for the film. Here we are told from every ad and critic on the planet to love this film before entering the theater and the entire time watching it I sit there are say ""when is the part I'm supposed to love, or even care about."" I recognize a few smart lines from the trailer and the audience seemed to smirk at those, but even the woman who pretended to be shocked by ""22,000 hits over 2,200"" had a sense of boredom and confusion in her gasp that reeked of doubt as to ""why should I care?"" Why should anyone? We've been had!",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
No-one owns ideas,"This is an intriguing movie, still fresh in my mind despite having seen it some weeks ago. I was surprised at the ""warts and all"" portrayal of Facebook's putative founder Mark Zuckerberg, who, being now seriously rich, can afford the very best defamation lawyers. A good alternative title would have been ""Citizen Zuckerberg"" though he apparently still lives in a nondescript suburban house and drives an old car.Several points stand out. First the film makers have rather ingeniously used as a framing device two separate court cases dealing with who really invented Facebook, the social networking site, which I am happy to say I do not belong to. Second, Jessie Eisenberg's performance as Zuckerberg is uncanny. It may or may not be true to life but it is absolutely convincing. His Zuckerberg is either afflicted with Asberger's syndrome or else is seriously weird, yet somehow we connect with him. Third, his opponents in one of the cases are the egregious Winklevoss twins, two of a vanishing breed – handsome rich WASP boofheads with an unshakable belief in their entitlement to privilege. They are also now seriously rich, though just a few days ago they lost an attempt in the Federal Court of Appeals to overturn their 2008 settlement with Zuckerberg. They are played by the same actor (Armie Hammer) who puts in two seamless performances. Fourth, Zuckerberg's treatment of his collaborator Eduardo Saverin, which leads to the other set of legal proceedings, is almost beyond belief. Fifth, all the litigation seems to be about a property right which does not exist, namely the ownership of ideas, though the lawyers try to dress it up by inventing contractual rights of doubtful provenance.As a film, however, this one works very well. The supercharged and chilly atmosphere at Harvard College, where the super-bright slug it out with each other and the super-rich is superbly realized. You may have allies, but no real friends. This writer has some experience of the law school at Harvard and it all rings true. I'm not sure the origin of Facebook can be put down to Zuckerberg taking revenge on the girl who dumped him; Facebook was one of those things whose time had come, though no-one realized its full potential at the time. The Winklevosses, snobs that they were, saw it as a Harvard only site, while Zuckerberg thought the Ivy League colleges were about the total market, though of course he soon discovered the world was his oyster.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Network was one of the more compelling movies from the last year,"Just watched this movie on Netflix with my mom. While I don't think this was one of the best movies of last year (True Grit and The King's Speech were more worthy to me), The Social Network was certainly quite an attention-grabber what with the speedy dialogue from Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher's going back and forth from the depositions to the actual-if a little fabricated-events that lead to those court scenes and the performances of Jesse Eisenberg as the co-founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake as that Napster founder who charms his way into being one of the investors. Another compelling performance was that of Andrew Garfield as the embittered co-founder of Facebook who ends up suing Zuckerberg because of the latter's betrayal. So on that note, The Social Network is well worth the viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fincher at his best,"The Social Network had high expectations- apart from the fascinating subject which will be of immediate interests to driven millennials the film was being helmed by David Fincher and penned by Aaron Sorkin. The film justifies the expectation and all the credit goes to the men stated above. The Social Network is about friendship and jealousy intertwined with creativity and flashes of collaborative brilliance among a bunch of highly motivated young men. How much the film is close to the actual truth should be irrelevant as the screenplay itself is based on a book. But the resultant book is compatible for big screen fodder. The screenplay is as expected from Sorkin full of witty banter and cool exchanges. Fincher's direction is crisp, and the pacing is incredible. Cinematography is suitable for the subject location and Fincher never overdoes anything. Of course, this is riveting drama because of the actors, many of who have become well established today and they are all exceptional.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Broad Strokes,"I've found myself watching a few ""true story"" movies lately so fittingly I came back to 'The Social Network'. Such a huge film. Critically well received. Finely directed by David Fincher with a script by Aaron Sorkin, but wow, what a difference almost 15 years makes. My perspective has changed on FB, Zuckerberg, social media. Maybe yours has too. I certainly feel differently about this brand of movie making. Where does the truth lie ... does it matter in the face of entertainment?Tracing the humble beginnings from Harvard student co-founders Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) & to a lot lesser extent Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello). The young men's up and down slopes with women, the faculty, rule breaking, teen angst, triumph, success. Oh yeah and a lawsuit or two along the way as the website becomes the next big thing and not just a flash in the pan.With each viewing the misc side players - fellow students - in a lawsuit doesn't hit as hard. They contend Zuckerberg stole their idea. A lot of time, energy gets sunk on this weakest portion. Relationship troubles and socially inept attitudes provide some made up fun, but the story is at it's peak watching two former best friends splinter. When Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) a la Napster becomes involved it gets even juicier. However because of NDAs we never really got closure in reality on who was to blame and to what extent. The film which was fine in altering or making stuff up for flavor isn't able to overcome this at the end. Providing a very light finale where some on screen text, a fabricated idea is rolled with and a licensed music track is supposed to be enough to bring things home.Here's the boom. What obligation does a ""true story"" film have to the truth? 'Social' in a bid to have layers, emotional weight mixes an amalgamation of facts with pure fiction. Don't know much about Facebook & Zuckerberg before watching this? Good. All the better. They have a perspective they want to feed you, but it's okay ... because ... Hollywood ... movies ... money ... are you not entertained?I don't wanna take anything away from this package with fantastic performances from Eisenberg, Garfield & Timberlake. It put Jesse on the map in particular. However I'm older, more informed about the subject than in 2010 and weary of this business practice. If you want a rudimentary tale of Facebook's creation with sprinkles of fairy dust this has you covered. I won't say 'The Social Network' isn't well made or entertaining, but in turn I ask you to consider the narrative being sold here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Moves At A Breakneck Pace!,"Saw this when it first came out and loved it. Aaron Sorkin writes such crisp and witty dialogue and David Finsher directs at such a breakneck speed. Plusthe soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross simply adds to the intensity. And in his limited screen time, Justin Timberlake steals the show.I don't really care how much of it is true. It's a great story of ruthlessness and conniving and that's the enjoyable part. You want to hate everyone involved but you also have to admire their foresight. Maybe Zuckerberg did just start this whole thing to impressive an ex-girlfriend, but you can't deny he changed the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
smart film no doubt but definitely overrated,"It is a smart film no doubt but definitely overrated.The director's earlier movie ""the fight club"" had generated so much hype and when I finally decided to see it, I was very disappointed that the whole issue was so allegoric to the point of aversion. This is definitely a better movie where you see some fine performances by the leads, some whacky dialogues, a non linear screenplay which adds thrill to the drama and doesn't let your attention waver till the end as you see the protagonist wait for acceptance desperately. The biggest strength of the movie is that it is a true story based on a novel which lingers on the back of your mind throughout and you decide to excuse the director of some minor glitches like use of too much Harvard and geek jargon, slightly undercooked characters of Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker. One character you could easily connect with is his only friend Eduardo played by Andrew Garfield. ""This is not a movie for everyone"" is supposed to be an excuse for the overrating but in that sense even Avatar or Inception were not for all. This may be a smart movie but cinema is much more than being a nerd like his girl friend tells Mark at the beginning of the film. Going with 3.5 stars out of 5 for David Fincher's The Social Network. A movie you don't want to miss especially if you have a facebook account.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
21st Century Gold,"The Social Network (2010) - [8/10]I am really close to review this as a 9/10. The Social Network (2010) is a fantastic film. I am a huge fan of David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin, and this film fuels the admiration I have for them. Fincher directs masterfully in this horrific biopic, coupled with Sorkin's elegant dialogue. Without Sorkin, the film wouldn't work. Without Fincher, the film wouldn't work. Two masters work together to create an amazing film. I really would like to give this film a higher rating, but there are a couple things holding me back. In my opinion, it lacks something spectacular. Whether that be from the emotional detachment of the main character(s) or the fact that some scenes feel unneeded, I think it misses something that could have made it perfect. One scene in particular was very strange. It involves a CG, but not CG, effect during a boat race. When I look back on this scene, in terms of the rest of the story, it's really out of place (the music choice is also quite strange). Thinking about it more, it's still very important for multiple reasons. So it feels out of place, yet deeply important... very conflicting ideas. Another issue I had, and it's actually part of why I like the film, is the pacing. For the most part, The Social Network (2010) is extremely fast paced. Dialogue races by with each shot. There are scenes that are short, but sweet with excellent cutting. But, because it is so fast (and complex), you can get lost in what is happening. Some of the most important scenes happen very fast and it's hard to digest, analyze, and remember everything. This is also a positive for The Social Network (2010). The fact that you need to watch it multiple times to pick up on every little complexity is genius (Sorkin is a master in that way). This was the fourth time I watched the film and, don't get me wrong, I really love it. I think it's one of the best biographical films that has been made, and its message is just as powerful - if not more powerful, today. The acting is exceptional (especially from our leads, Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield) but, there is quite a big emotional disconnect between this film and the audience (at least for me anyways). This is a result from our lead character, Mark Zuckerberg - played by Jesse Eisenberg, who just isn't likable. In fact, he is the villain of this story (rather one of them). For the most part we're against him, morally and legally. The only likable character is Eduardo Saverin - played by Andrew Garfield but, he is the supporting character (I could actually make an argument that he is the main character of the story and very well should be, but I digress). I think because of the choice to have only one hero, who is a supporting character, this film loses all the emotion it could have generated. The moments where Garfield stands in the spotlight are highly emotional, and I applaud his performance. It was really rewarding to see Garfield's talent when a great director utilizes it. I've always believed that he is one of the most underrated actors of this generation and if more directors see his potential, he could be one of the greats (similar to Adam Driver). Eisenberg is excellent in this film. He perfectly portrays an unapologetic, selfish jerk - alongside Justin Timberlake. Eisenberg is emotionless, and fits Zuckerberg's character perfectly. He is extremely detached from humanity and human emotion, yet he makes founds social media phenomenon that strives for human connection. It is so compelling, and Eisenberg makes it so. The cinematography of this film is stark, detached, and formulaic - just like it should be. The editing is fast paced, but sacrifices slow, emotional moments for orchestral dialogue. The writing is exceptional (and one of the reasons I want this film to be a 9/10). This film features one of the greatest scripts that was ever made. David Fincher directs with meaning, mastery, and minimalism. In the end, I really think the biggest problem this film faces is emotion. It tries desperately to conjure emotions (albeit it is able to conjure negative ones very easily), as seen with the very last scene of the film, but fails to do so in the long run. The Social Network (2010) is one of the greatest films released in the 21st century and is a must see for anybody that has ever heard the name, Facebook.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Out Come The Geeks,"Who would have thought a feature film could have been made about a bunch of nerdy students creating a web-site? I suppose though in the time-honoured fashion of the likes of ""The Paper Chase"", ""Cider House Rules"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" there can be gold in campus drama,although the difference here of course is that this isn't fiction, being an account of how Mark Zuckerburg with a little help from his friends, got the concept of Facebook out of his head and onto the market, making billions in the process. You'd have thought, mind you, that was more than enough money for him to share, rather than allow himself to be embroiled in high-profile and no doubt expensive court-cases by some of the people he trod on and used to get to the top, but thin as it is, that's the premise for the movie.Right from the start, director Fincher shows Zuckerburg in an unflattering light, a geeky, self-centred, pretentious student who expects everyone to bow down to his intellect, but after his then girlfriend dumps him, a petty act of revenge on her leads to his Eureka moment in setting up an online club appealing principally to the young set.The film is highly watchable, due to the pacey direction and Aaron Sorkin's ear for needle-sharp dialogue, but some posters here are right when they say that this film probably wouldn't work as fiction at all and it's only our real-life interest in the background to one of the biggest business success stories of modern times which compels our attention. Certainly there are no likable main characters here, besides the venal Zuckerburg, his meal-ticket friend and partner Eduardo Saviano seems just too gullible to be true while Napster-king Sean Parker ruthlessly lords it over his adoring acolytes in repellent messianic rock-star style. I almost wished that Zuckerburg's girlfriend stayed in the film throughout (she turns up briefly again later) as she seemed by far the most credible and sympathetic character here. Seems to me she should have shared in the mega-wealth too, as she inadvertently inspired Zuckerburg in the first place!The acting by the leads is very good, none better than Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerburg, plus there's an excellent modern soundtrack courtesy of Trent Raznor. On the debit side, there's some uncalled-for gratuitous sex and Justin Timberlake is too big a celebrity to play big-nobody Parker. On the whole I'd probably hit the ""Like"" button for this film, but consider it a bit overrated both by the Academy, where it received a Best Film Oscar nomination and probably the public at large including the community here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Facebook's story,"It was called ""The Facebook"" !?

Six years later, he is one of the youngest billionaires ever, but Zuckerberg finds that his unprecedented success leads to both personal and legal complications when he ends up on the receiving end of two lawsuits, one involving his former friend (Andrew Garfield).The movie that's based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires."" doesn't only explore all the success Mark faced, but also all his struggles during his journey. Although it's mainly just dialogue occuring throughout the movie, it does keep the audience engaged.Great performances from the whole cast but especially from Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, as Eisenberg does a terrific job delivering the lines while Garfield handles the emotional part pretty well. The script is amazingly written and the characters are also well rounded however you struggle to feel any connection with any of them as they all have major and minor flaws, especially Zuckerberg as he is described as an unethical and arrogant outcast.Although the movie is beautifully written with great performances from the whole cast, it is a bit forgettable but it is informative and entertaining if you want know about Facebook's history.Score:7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Great visual style and acting.....but why make it so dirty and immoral!,"First off i want to say that the look of this film was very sophisticated, it was very stylised in looking fresh and stunning. Also Jesse Eisenberg was beyond amazing as Mark Zukerberg. He really played the role of a person with a lack of social skills with intelligence very well and he stole the show, without him this film would not have worked. Justin Timerlake was really good as well, his character i am not a fan of but still, he acted really well in this film. The rest of the acting was good as well. Andrew Garfield acted OK in this film, not to be praised as much as Jesse but still a good performance. But why did he have to be the one who blasphemed throughout the whole movie! I think i have stated the positives of the film, but what really ruined it for me was the immorality found on this film. There were lots of party scenes where lesbian kissing took place, provocative dancing, drinking of alcohol, explicit use of drugs, swearing, some rude scenes. This really tainted the film and you could have done without it. It should have had a 15 rating, it's a 12A so even a 8 year old could watch all that filth...that is a disturbing thought. A thing to note is that it felt that the film had no narrative structure, this is not necessarily a criticism but it felt that it was hard to see where the film was going to end up. Yes there were flashbacks and it was a bout a court case, but it felt the film was all on one level. It felt like going on a journey with the characters which was interesting. the film had great style and acting but it was tainted by the filth in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Surprisingly deep and moving film,"I think the majority of people were very skeptical upon hearing that a film was to be made regarding the invention of everyone's favourite social network site: Facebook. Such a film sounds like a quick cash-in, aimed at today's youth who live part of their lives through the said website; however, when David (Fight Club) Fincher was announced as director I immediately became intrigued. Fincher is, in my eyes, one of the best directors around, and his attachment to a film ensures it will be entertaining yet deep. He's proved this with his past projects, and this is exactly how I would describe The Social Network. I'll admit, I have a Facebook account, although I had no idea who created it or how it was created. The Social Network tells the story of how Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard University student, comes up with the idea of Facebook, and the ensuing legal battles he faces. Now, since seeing the film I have learnt that much of the film is in fact an exaggeration of the truth; but what film isn't these-days? The Social Network begins with Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) being dumped by his girlfriend Erica in a bar where they had visited to just have a drink. You learn a lot about Zuckerberg in this scene, how he is a complete ass, yet simply wants to have friends and be recognised as having friends. In retaliation to the actions of his ex, Zuckerberg returns to his dorm and creates a website called 'FaceMash' where Harvard female students are rated against one another based solely on levels of attraction. Zuckerberg creates FashMash in one evening alone, whilst intoxicated, although he is aided by several friends, including Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) who supplies him with an algorithm necessary to allow the site to function properly, and it is this feat, along with the fact that the Harvard network crashes due to the amount of traffic on FaceMash, that alert Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to Zuckerberg's talents. They hire Zuckerberg to create a social network site called The Harvard Connection, which Zuckerberg agrees to. However, he then approaches Eduardo with idea of 'Thefacebook', a site where Harvard students can see information regarding each other without invading privacy. Zuckerberg asks Eduardo to put up 1,000 dollars to set up the site, which he will create. Eduardo agrees and Zuckerberg quickly creates the site that becomes an instant hit across campus. During this time, Zuckerberg avoids any meetings with the Winklevoss'; however, they eventually become aware that Zuckerberg is the creator of Thefacebook and claim that he stole their IP. Meanwhile, Thefacebook expands to schools across the US, and comes to the attention of Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who arranges a meeting with Zuckerberg and Eduardo. Zuckerberg is impressed with Parker, whilst Eduardo notes his unprofessional past, and is skeptical of him in general. No deal is reached with Parker, though he recommends that they drop 'The' from the site calling it simply 'Facebook', which is taken up by Zuckerberg. The decision is then taken by Zuckerberg to move the base of operation to Palo Alto, while Eduardo remains in the East trying to secure investment through advertising. When Eduardo shows up at Palo Alto he is enraged that Parker is living with the Facebook team and making business decisions, while Eduardo is ignored. Zuckerberg then agrees to a decision whereby Parker is given 7% share of Facebook and Eduardo's ownership is reduced from 30% to less than 1%. Eduardo then decides to sue Zuckerberg, whilst Parker and Facebook interns are arrested for possession of cocaine at a party. Throughout the film we see Zuckerberg testifying in the two lawsuits (Winklevoss' and Eduardo's), and the finale sees a junior lawyer inform Zuckerberg that his defence team will recommend a settlement agreement with Eduardo and she suggests that he settles. The film ends with Zuckerberg sending Erica (his ex) a friend request and waiting for her to reply. I must say that all the performances in this film are fantastic, something that deserves recognition considering the cast are all quite young. Eisenberg steals the show as Zuckerberg, portraying a troubled youth with immense talent that, as Eduardo recognises, ""needs looking after"". Timberlake puts in an admirable performance as sleazy Parker, and I think he deserves some respect for playing a character that really isn't supposed to be liked in the movie. This isn't a happy movie, there's some jokes, but generally you will leave the cinema somewhat downbeat. This is a film about how friendships are destroyed, and how people are manipulated. The audience are probably most sympathetic to Eduardo (he was a consultant for the movie, whilst no Facebook employee, Zuckerberg included, had anything to do with it - perhaps this has some bearing on the telling of the story), he tries to do the right thing and look out for Zuckerberg, but Zuckerberg's treatment of him leads him to being kicked out of the Facebook team. Fincher's direction is superb, a memorable scene being the Henley Regatta featuring the Winklevoss' boat race, which I would like to watch again. The film is very relevant right now, as Facebook is huge and still growing, and it is impressive what has been achieved in a film regarding such a subject. I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed with The Social Network, and it ranks up there with Fincher's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Fun for about 2 minutes, just like Facebook","Here we have Jesse Eisenberg whose rendering of genius is to talk really fast in hurried, clipped vocalizations. Fine. You know what, it's better than Matt Damon saying, ""How do you like them Apples?"" So Jesse Eisenberg's acting is annoying. But that alone only warrants going down to a 6 or 7, how have we gone down to a 1? Because, this movie goes beyond being overrated. It's not just overrated, it's something like ordering a $100 dessert at the best restaurant in America and being served an empty dish save for a solitary blue skittle on it... And all this after reading in the NYT that this restaurant had the best desserts in NYC. I think any half-wit could see what is really going on. This pile of junk is being promoted by the mass media for some godforsaken reason that speculating upon would have me labeled a paranoid schizophrenic.So I won't speculate on why the media fawned over this strangely moronic film as if it somehow foretold the second coming of Christ. What I will say is that this movie is disingenuous crap that is filled with clichés, racial stereotypes, bigotry, and elaborately staged scenes of sheer human idiocy surpassed only by Jackass 3.5.This movie warranted more than a 1, it's really a reaction to the hype, the hype which is absurd at best, and criminal at worst.It's actually quite funny, the way all absurdly overblown Hollywood movies are.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Remains an engaging movie more than ten years after its release,"It's a biopic of Mark Zuckerberg set from 2003-2009 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto, California. It follows Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook.Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), an undergrad at Harvard, is a programming genius with negligible social skills. His girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara), breaks up with him, and he retaliates by negatively blogging about her and setting up a website that rates female students at Harvard. That site's success crashes the Harvard servers and attracts the attention of the wealthy Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer), who are working on a social network for Harvard students. Zuckerberg agrees to program for them but instead creates his own site called ""The Facebook"" with financial support from his roommate and best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield).Eventually, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the earlier creator of the music-sharing site Napster, becomes involved and encourages Zuckerberg to think much bigger and take the company to California. Parker's involvement leads to battles for the company's soul and legal disputes between Zuckerberg, Saverin, and the Winklevoss twins.""The Social Network"" remains an engaging movie more than ten years after its release. It makes villains of both Zuckerberg and Parker and hints at the social networking dominance that Facebook would achieve. The film cleverly intersperses legal hearings among the parties that reflect how the law uses minor details from one's life to build legal arguments. If one doesn't like Mark Zuckerberg, you probably enjoyed the movie, though its historical accuracy is open to some debate. ""The Social Network"" seems similar to how Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the script, would portray Elon Musk.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

He loves language and uses it to make even the smallest of roles memorable. Every character is real and three dimensional and that is a testament to Sorkins writing.I don't really care about Facebook or how it was created but what I do care about is strong, well crafted theatre, TV and film and whenever Sorkin is attached I know that is what i'm going to get.Hats off to the men - he is a genius.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An average celebrity movie,"They did it all before, the movie about some famous person that lives his life in a somewhat higher state of existence than anybody else, yet has human problems and deals with them while the story of their great idea is being told. I've seen stuff like that made about Einstein and the only different thing is that it is based in a college environment and the celebrity is still alive and that everything has to be put on fast forward because it is happening with young cool people. They even have Justin Timberlake in it... eeaayy!Now, is it a bad film? Not at all. It does what it is supposed to do. It brings the drama and the story together while conveying the feeling that anyone can do it, if they are focused enough. And that's the main push of the story: genius is different and you must allow for some issues and forget uncommon behaviour. Einstein was Jewish too and kind of an asshole, as well, but he was brilliant. You might think that I am making a leap comparing these two guys, but it is not me, it is the makers of the film that made the two media personnas as similar as to draw connection.Mark Zuckenberg was a pretty pathetic human being, but that was the kind of thing that made him able to push away every distraction and devote his life to a purpose. Put this way, anything is easy to do, certainly easier than when you are also trying to have a life. He was also inspired by others and it shows in the film, which is the best part of the movie, if you ask me.Bottom line: average film, obviously altered story for dramatic purpose, everything looking really fast because it just had to feel dynamic, but good production quality and good acting. A masterpiece it is not and I can see this film split into little scenes that then are montaged together in a Discovery Channel celebrity show. It does give food for thought, as it shows you have to start early and get there first, but also that for the same reasons, the vast majority of people could never do that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The score is phenomenal, the club scene with Mark and Sean Parker in particular is a masterclass of sound mixing.

Each character lacks depth, the script paints them all as two dimensional and I found there was only one moment throughout the film where I felt sympathy for anyone.

Dishonest to the last frame.,"This film is so desperate to sex up the life of a code-nerd with Asperger syndrome and ram home its banal theme (the man who created Facebook has no friends) that the truth, complexity, and to my mind, fascinating aspects of the real story gets thrown under the onrushing bus of one dimensional fiction. It's a hit job on a pack of real human beings and their motivations. Tonally, thematically and factually dishonest to the last frame. Good music though, and Eisenberg deserves the praise he's getting.The very source of this film is suspect. The book it's taken from was solely the revenge creation of Eduardo Saverin who approached the author after Saverin felt he had been jilted by Zuckerberg. The book was a revenge hit that left out facts, defamed people and made no attempt to interview any other parties involved in the matter. It was considered a joke and was never taken seriously by either the tech-crowd or the press. Now the movie hits and has Saverin being the good guy and Sean Parker - who actually helped Facebook grow into what it is today and is still a behind the scenes consultant, not to mention one of the most influential coders of our time - as the bad guy.I don't think Sorkin or Fincher have any clue about the code-monkeys who have changed their world forever, and if they do... they certainly don't seem to care enough to make real, complicated, ambitious art about them.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Heavily adapted but brilliant story,"I've become a big David Fincher fan over the the years and I've come to expect something when i see his name linked to a film, a certain sense of dark witty humour mixed with subtle clever storytelling and a sense of rebellion that always make the films different from the others available at the time. When i watched the Social network i really didn't know what to expect but wanted typical fincher trademarks and in a way i was disappointed with the lack of darkness about the film i wanted a tale of betrayal and deceit displayed on screen, however i was not disappointed as it was replaced by a film that showed us the emotion between the characters involved with a lot of comic relief which is always witty and never resorts to American slapstick we find so much these days which i believe only children under the age of ten still enjoy but Hollywood still insist on producing. What the makers of this film have managed to do is make a documentary into a vivid and in-depth story, with drama and emotion that all audiences can relate to. I do worry however that the screen play is so good that large amounts of the story have been added to make the film flow and add aspects about character and storyline which in turn has been at the cost of the truth of the situation around the actual creation of facebook. Even to the extent that the real life actors counterparts in some cases refused to help in the making of the film as they felt it was not accurate or true to their real life personalities. Finally the film offers us one very confusing scene in which there is a rowing race in the UK which seems as though it has been agreed to be added as a favour by fincher to a cinematographer as it does not seem to fit in with the pacing or storyline of the film at all but contains some brilliant looking shots and aesthetics to the extent of a cinematographers wet dream.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the best films of the year.,"It is not Citizen Kane, but David Fincher's Social Network has the energy of young Charles Foster Kane descending with his wunderkinds to take over a newspaper because it ""would be fun.""So too Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), who has become the world's youngest billionaire by inventing Facebook. This biopic chronicles his rise from an undergrad at Harvard, where he and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) begin a campus wide comparison of coeds that led to a global social network phenomenon.Along the way Zuckerberg, not destined to win any congeniality awards, legally fights the upper-crust Winklevoss brothers (Armie Hammer), who claim he took their idea, and Saverin, who didn't fit well as CFO. Whether or not Zuckerberg contributed to Saverin's downfall is an important consideration in establishing Zuckerman's complicated character, who not only comes up with winning programming but also must engage and disengage operatives as brilliant as Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster.The opening sequences where the great ideas take shape on the campus are the most electric and closest to helping us to understand the workings of genius. We learn he's a computer nerd and a workaholic who gets results just as Kane/ Welles did. As in the latter cases, we really don't know who these gifted entrepreneurs really are inside, yet listening to their witty dialogue, more like frat-boy screwball comedy than ordinary repartee, is the film's greatest joy, albeit some of the words are lost in the race.But it sure is fun trying to find out.

Kudos to David Fincher and Jesse Eisenberg and the rest of the cast for bestowing us with some the most compelling characters I've seen in what seems like an eternity as well as a clear-cut drama without being too vague or melodramatic. I honestly didn't believe, at first, that a great film could be derived from a topic involving Facebook, but... there you go. Anyway, most of the film isn't about Facebook at all, but rather the people in the told events. What do I recommend? Give it a shot, is it a ground-breaking film like the Matrix.

It literally feels like coming of a new time as your watching to movie and the screenplay shows that so well. I also loved all the performances. In hindsight it's easy to see why the cast would be good but at the time they were very young and up and coming. They killed this challenging screenplay so well. It's one of the defining stories of my time and I couldn't see a better way to portray how it happened 9/10.The reason such a defining movie of a decade isn't a 10 is because how real the story is. I feel because we know the ending and what is to take place, there isn't that movie magic to walk away with after the film. That isn't to say if it's based on a true story that it can't be a perfect film. Movies like Schindler's List prove that wrong however, this one doesn't have that extra edge that moves like Schindler's does and at times can feel like it is just showing us events or moments of a time in history.

Intelligent and well crafted biopic of the Facebook founder,"Facebook has been held position as the most popular social media website for almost a decade, beating other popular social networks like Myspace, Twitter, and one more popular towards the adolescent crowd Instagram. This biopic directed by David Fincher, focuses on Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook; and the story behind how it became the enormously popular social website it is today. Beginning in the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) is a student at Harvard University who is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara). Upon the break- up, Zuckerberg creates a website known as ""Facemash"" where users compare girls online based on their attractiveness. The website's high traffic causes a breakdown in Harvard's computer network, resulting in Zuckerberg to place under academic probation. During this time, he builds up a social media network known as Facebook which soon leads to a global success and lands Zuckerberg to a billion dollar business. However, he also faces conflicts with his friends in the process, pitted against two lawsuits, one by his best friend Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield), and the other by two brothers (both played by Armie Hammer) who accuse him stealing their idea.Thanks to the masterful writing by Aaron Sorkin and superb performances by its gifted cast, this biopic sparkles the legacy of Mark Zuckerberg's work and the story behind the creation of the globally popular website. Based by Ben Mezrich's novel 'The Accidental Billionaires', the film introduces us to the main character in the opening scene as someone not too likable due to his attitude towards his girlfriend, and later his friends. His ways of running his newly founded business leads to him squeezing his best friend out of business and making more enemies in the process. So Mark Zuckerberg is proved to be have been not the most desirable person to work with, but very intelligent nonetheless. Jesse Eisenberg brings such a sensational performance in what becomes his first Oscar-nominated role of his career. He looks so natural in his role that you almost forget its him instead of the character he is playing. Andrew Garfield who plays the main character's best friend that later turns into his enemy brings satisfaction to his role as well. Let's also not forget Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker the founder of the computer sharing service Napster who later partners up with Zuckerberg in his business.The story works exceptionally well from start to finish, and the elegantly written screenplay by Aaron Sorkin should be credited for this. The film gently highlights the important points of the story based on the events that took place, and though there a few noticeable liberties taken from both the book and real-life events, Sorkin keeps the story solid and satisfying without overdramatizing or sugarcoating the events. The whole subplot dealing with the lawsuits against Zuckerberg are lavish the storyline, and director David Fincher handles this subplot in a solid manner.The Social Network is one of the most intelligent and well crafted biopics ever put to screen, and demonstrates some of the best filmmaking from David Fincher. This is an A+ film that everyone is strongly encouraged to watch regardless of they are users of Facebook or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The journey of Mark Zuckerberg's invention and establishment of Facebook,"College is a time where every student defines him or her self. It's when many people meet their spouse, some of their closest friends, and when they get the degree that turns into a career. For Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg), his time at Harvard has been less about the classes, and more about his time in front of a computer screen, hacking into the school's database and blogging about his life. We first see him infiltrating Harvard's student directory and creating a site where two students' pictures are placed beside each other, and viewers vote on who's ""hotter"". 22,000 page-views, and many outraged students, later, Zuckerberg is called into the school officials' office, and it is now that we see why he has very little friends. The two friends he does have are Eduardo Saverin (Garfield), the finance genius, and Dustin Moskovitz, a computer programmer like Mark. After witnessing the impressive computer work by Mark, brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss meet with him and propose their idea; a social website featuring student bios, info, and statuses, and they want to call it The Harvard Connection. Mark agrees that he's interested in helping the brothers, and leaves. About 6 weeks later, a new social media site is activated featuring student bios, info, and statuses, and it is called The Facebook. The brothers find this new site, and the conflict of whose site it is, and who deserves the potentially billion-dollar revenue, is launched into actionAs an American teen that has been a Facebook account-holder for about 5 years, I was interested in this film. Facebook revolutionized how our society meets and interacts with each other. Coming into this film, I knew two things. 1.) David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, and Curious Case of Benjamin Button) directs it, so I knew that it would be well done 2.) This was the ""big break"" for both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, so I was curious to see what made their performances so good I thought that the actors were good in the film, particularly in the case of Andrew Garfield. The only other role I had seen him in was as Spiderman, and this performance was far better. I thought that Jesse Eisenberg did a great job of capturing the quick-thinking and slightly smug Zuckerberg. The story itself is true, and the truth behind the history of this company is quite emotional. This film was nominated for 8 Oscar categories, and it won a trio of them (Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing, and Original Score). My one negative comment is something that I'm still unsure of. In the movie Mark comes off as very egotistical and pretty cutthroat. I'm not sure if this is what the real man is like, or if Eisenberg's performance is what created this impression. In the case of the former, it disappoints me that one of the richest men in America is pompous and conceited.The run time is exactly 2 hours, but it seems longer than that. While stereotypical college life and the ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" do involve sexuality, I found it to be a little too much for my taste. I also found that the film leaves the viewer with the idea that tricking your business partners and friends out of a piece of the company that they helped you create leaves you rich. However, it does show the moral message that you can have billions of dollars, but you may not have many friends, whether in real life or on Facebook.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""The New Socialism""","Have you ever wondered what a collaboration between all your favourite creative people would look and sound like? To be honest I had not - it's such an improbable event, the chances of such a thing happening are so remote, that it's not even worth thinking about... (Roll VT)...I am sitting in the superb Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's West End about to enjoy the latest offering from David Fincher, 'The Social Network'. I know that it is scripted by Aaron Sorkin - he of West Wing fame - either one is a strong recommendation on its own, but both together bodes very well indeed, I am anticipating eagerly. Trigger Street Productions - ah, an unexpected bonus, my favourite actor of the 90's (and probably the other decades too) Kevin Spacey (Glengarry Glen Ross (92), Swimming With Sharks (94), Se7en (95), Usual Suspects (95), LA Confidential (97), American Beauty (99) - an incomparable body of work in such a short period) has produced, truly a stamp of quality.Even now a full house has not even entered my head, and then the opening bars of the soundtrack creep from the speakers as the camera tracks up the stairs, only the first handful of notes are required, it's only Trent flaming Reznor who's written the soundtrack, prophet of an alternative generation and my touchstone for musical inspiration. Right from the opening lines you have to run to keep up. Sorkin's dialogue is as snappy and intelligent as the West Wing or Studio 60 ever were, it's nasty, smug, angry when it needs to be, but always, always, very, very clever. Who do you pick to write a script about a computer 'genius'? A scriptwriting genius of course.The central performances are all good, Jesse Eisenberg in particular as the anti-hero Zuckerberg, excellently portrays a detached and somewhat bemused persona that I would imagine most computer 'geniuses' have, while Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake provide excellent foils for our 'hero's' single-minded petulance. The protagonists all have their faults and none of the characters elicited any sympathy in me. That's usually a cue to switch off, but 'The Social Network' transcends the characters and the plot, which is largely irrelevant, in the sense that we all know how the story ends (to this point at least). But the script holds everything together and I found it impossible to take my eyes off the screen.On paper this is a turkey, a movie about an Internet billionaire and the contractual and legal fog that surrounded his success? It could not be a better example of what true genius can deliver to the screen. As a child, like most children, I used to think that the actors did all the work, and I wondered who all the other people in the credits were - if ever there was a lesson in how naive that childish view is it in the team that brought us 'The Social Network'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

More great cinema from Fincher,"When we sit down at our computers in the morning - our hair disheveled - with a thunderous bowlful of Rice Krispies, what do we do next? That's right, we head straight for the internet and – more than likely – any number of websites that connect us in some way with our fellow earthlings. Chances are that one of the stops on our internet itineraries will be Facebook, the social networking site that we have all helped to develop into a worldwide phenomenon. However, like the human race trapped in The Matrix, we tend not to ask questions of where the things we use in our daily lives come from. Facebook falls into that list of cherished pieces of our lives; it is hard to imagine a world without the internet, let alone Facebook. There are incredible stories behind even the most common – and essential - facets of our culture, and the same goes for our beloved Facebook. Behind the friend count competitions, the ridiculous cat memes and the half-naked pictures of our favorite drunk coed Sally is a fascinating origin tale that is worthy of a superhero - or super villain, depending on who you ask. That, my dear friend counts, is the spirit of director David Fincher's 2010 cinematic splash The Social Network.While the film takes many creative liberties with the story of Facebook mastermind Mark Zuckerberg (fittingly played by Jesse Eisenberg) and his rise to ten-digit immortality, The Social Network is by no means an unwatchable pile of bloated hyperbole and special effects. Instead, David Fincher presents us with a film that oozes charisma and atmosphere, created in no small part by the witty, pistol-quick dialogue and dead-eye acting. The set designs are carefully drab, underplaying the glamorous associations with such idealized places as Harvard and Beverly Hills. These elements help to draw us into Zuckerberg's world, one that thrives on gossip, greed, betrayal, sex, and everything else in the Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) handbook. wait a minute, that sounds an awful lot like the real world, doesn't it? The Social Network is completely self-aware, calling into question everything that is presented at face value, including the superficiality of social networking and even us.Even the soundtrack, composed by Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) and Atticus Ross is an exercise in artificiality; the keyboards weave an intricate (world-wide) web of ear candy, featuring a plethora of beeps and boops mixed with icy flourishes of piano and guitar. This sonic formula, although unorthodox for a ""young person rises to the top despite an x number of setbacks"" movie, perfectly captures the heart of The Social Network's story as it glides throughout the scenes, always present and poignant, but never distracting.On the whole, The Social Network does not necessarily break any boundaries in terms of plot, nor is it the first film to question a staple of American culture, but it does not have to. The film takes what many films attempt to do and does it much better, and it is sure to create a buzzing discussion over French fries and coffee at many a restaurant or living room. and quite a few Facebook status updates as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I'll be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page!,"From the director David FINCHER (The Curious case of Benjamin Button, Fight Club, Se7en), THE SOCIAL NETWORK is the story of the development and rise and rise of the world-wide Social Networking phenomena FACEBOOK.Shortly after breaking up with his girlfriend, Harvard computer nurd Mark Zuckerberg (JESSE EISENBERG) sits down at his computer and ""blogs"" bad things about his now ex-girlfriend .. and, in an act of revenge decides to create a website where students can ""grade"" the girls within the university. News of the site goes around like wildfire and they get hundreds of students accessing it  and an idea was born  the power of the internet as a revolutionary new communication medium for social networkingMany began to see the potential in the new social medium and attempt to jump on the bandwagon and get in at an early stage  with the hapless Winklevoss brothers claiming to have spawned the original idea of having a unique ""Harvard"" exclusive social site  many tried and many fail  but it is the Mark Zuckerberg's tenacity and clarity of focus with THE FACEBOOK site launched in Feb 2004, that forces it's way through the dead wood and grows and grows in popularity at a phenomenal speed  and pretty soon it has expanded to many of the other universities and schoolsAs a computer genius come geek, Zuckerberg is himself a social misfit that finds human interaction and communication difficult, and he turns to his one true friend Eduardo Saverin (ably played by Andrew Garfield), for financial support in setting up the servers, routers and infrastructure required to cope with the every increasing demand for the Facebook site  Zuckerberg and Saverin decide to jointly split the company they create 70 / 30 (in favour of Zuckerberg).Things progress well until Saverin decides there is a need for more investment and to get advertisers interested  a move which Zuckerberg opposes claiming that it would detract from the ""purity"" of the Facebook ideaMeanwhile on the scene comes the another headlining entrepreneur way ahead of his time – Sean Parker (played excellently by Justin Timberlake) – the founder and genius behind NAPSTER and music downloading / sharing site. Fresh from a recent legal defeat against the Music industry (over Napster), Sean still believes he has won by changing the face of the music industry forever . And he is chomping at the bit for a new challenge – and sees THE FACEBOOK as the next big thing (he is actually the one who suggested renaming it to just FACEBOOK).There follows a series on wide parties and roller-coaster wheeling and dealings and Sean Parker eventually engineers a situation where there is finally a breakdown in relationships between Zuckerberg and Saverin and they go their separate ways.The film is primarily based around the legal dispute of over ownership of Facebook brand and intellectual copy write of the product – by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo Saverin against Zuckerberg with flashbacks to previous times elaborating on claims and counter-claims made during the case.Launched in February 2004, Facebook was born, and a mere six years and 500 million friends later, making Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history ... but as the tagline for the film states – ""you don't get 500 Million friends without making some enemies ""I must admit after seeing Jesse Eisenberg's awful performances in the truly woeful Zombieland and Adventureland movies – I really didn't hold out much hope for his acting career  but I was pleasantly surprised in this instance  as in the Social Network he is ""better"" (still not great) but he can actually actWith no real ""heavy-weights"" in the acting cast – this was a film that had to stand up and fight with a decent story line – which I was quite impressed with (being a ""true"" and interesting story)As a trivia side point, the director of this movie David Fincher will also be taking the reins to direct the ""Americanised"" version (God help us all ) of the remake of excellent THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO  along with Rooney Mara (who plays Erica Albright in the Social Network) taking on the leading role of Lisbeth Salander.I imagine that this will be a popular movie as almost everyone I know has a facebook account – and I'll even be posting a link to this review onto my facebook page!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Unlikable Kids All Speak Like the Same Person.,"If you like Sorkin's writing and would like to see a film of unlikable kids all speaking as if they were channeling him, then you may like ""The Social Network"".If you like movies with a non-stop score through pretty much the entire movie, and if you like NiN, you may appreciate the way the filmmakers are trying to give the film some sort of life.The Michael Cera actor is the same as he is in all his films, but not nearly as enjoyable. Can't really comment on the other actors, but Justin Timberlake seemed uncomfortably out of place. Female characters were basically non-existent.If you know the basics of the story then there are no surprises there, it's about the Facebook founder. There are also some litigation and party scenes, plus several dorm scenes.That pretty much sums up the film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Jesse Eisenberg is smart,I love a good biographical movie and this is not too shabby. Jesse Eisenberg does a wonderful portrayal of an anti-social super nerd by the name of Mark Zuckerberg. One thing I will say is that this movie is much more educational than I would expect in regards to the history of Facebook. It is entertaining to see how the characters progress in the movie. It is a pretty standard film that I won't necessarily recommend watching but also definitely not complaining about seeing in the first place.

"Very Good Performance, Boring Movie","I was bored out of my head trying to watch The Social Network it was just a boring and pointless movie! The lead actor playing Mark Zuckerberg or Zuckerburg whatever the spelling of that crazy name, he did a great job playing the part and I bet he will be nominated for an Oscar for best actor and I can't argue with that, but the movie over all was just boring and a waste of time. I can't believe it has a rating of 8 out of 10 here on IMDb. The other actors were mostly okay but Justin Timberlake was not good or believable at all in his role even though he lost that weight to look younger he doesn't look younger. I thought the whole movie was just boring and pointless, we already know that this Zuckerberg guy is a total a-hole so why do we need a movie about it?",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Another misleading fabrication from Hollywood,"Taken out of context, this would prove an entertaining movie. However, the story is based on a character assassination. As the real characters have said - the movie focuses on being extremely accurate by portraying the wardrobe accurately, and then blowing up minor truths which were not important in real life and distorting the facts to offer us a perverse version of the truth.This smacks of mudslinging on the big screen, and I don't like that - though I did rather enjoy watching the movie, it was for me more a commentary on the Hollywood licence to lie and cheat us out of the truth because it's too boring, instead presenting us with a fake dramatisation and passing it off as a true story.Truth has little to do with this story - Hollywood is indeed the Lord of Lies - not something to be proud of.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"Who would have thought that the birth of Facebook could be turned into an entertaining film? ""","""The Social Network"" makes a point on how a nerd with zero social skills could create the most popular social network of his generation, and at the same time explores the interpersonal relationships behind the development of young startup companies. The slick cinematography and fast-paced dialogues full of sarcastic remarks and one-liners turn the least charming subject matter into an intriguing entertainment piece.The story is told during two major lawsuits against Zuckerberg through depositions and flashbacks, and the point of view of both sides are explored simultaneously.

One of the Best movies of 2010,"David Fincher's The Social Network tells the very interesting story of how the popular website Facebook was created by the youngest billionaire in the world Mark Zuckerberg.

Director David Fincher really knows where his facts came from for the movie, and the screenplay by the great Aaron Sorkin is what I call very good as always. Thee movie also has great supporting work from the new Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield, and current music success Justin Timberlake.

The Social Network: A Fitting Modern Treatment,"A movie about Facebook? A movie about Facebook?! Not even the bottom of the barrel could be so lined with mawkish garbage as this, a film following the foundation of a bloody website. Have they no better ideas? My thoughts exactly, dear reader. My thoughts exactly.Dumped by his girlfriend, who finally recognises his apparently incurable horridness, Mark Zuckerberg slanders her on the internet and creates a website for comparing the attractiveness of female Harvard students. The success of this and the invitation to programme a Harvard-exclusive online social network combine in the mind of the professed genius to create what would become Facebook, and the eventual pair of lawsuits that would turn up along the way.Like just about everyone else, I was incredibly sceptical toward such an idea as a Facebook movie: surely a ridiculous concept for any film. The involvement of well-liked screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and acclaimed director David Fincher seemed to win a great deal of sceptics over to the premise, yet I remained unchanged, dismissing it as uninteresting and silly. A website's success warrants a film now? Pfft... The scene which opens the film is the one in which Zuckerberg is dumped, the particular posterior-based vulgarity applied by the departing girlfriend the general label hung upon him by many of the film's characters. Jesse Eisenberg portrays Zuckerberg, combining the flashy sarcasm of Sorkin's dialogue with his own cynical glances of self-assumed intellectual superiority to create a character that we never quite get to like. His sneering put-downs alienate us as they do their recipients, preventing all from ever really sympathising with the computer maverick. And so too it should be, the protagonist—if even that title can rightly be applied to him—portrayed as largely deserving of the general disdain held by most toward him. The narrative is structured as flashbacks told through two contemporaneous depositions as the now multi-billionaire Zuckerberg is sued by both the proposers of the original website idea and his former best, quite probably only, friend Eduardo Saverin. The reason behind the former suit is evident, the latter initially unknown. Both Zuckerberg and Saverin appear to maintain a cordial respect for each other, never quite making eye contact and each appearing sorry that this is what their friendship has come to. As Saverin, Andrew Garfield is perhaps the film's strongest facet, his performance as the popular guy still faithful to his nerdy friend reaching a splendid climax in the scene wherein we finally learn the reason behind the lawsuit. Eisenberg and Garfield play off each other very well, the tension between them when the latter's character is accepted into a social club greatly desired by the former left to subtlety rather than a more visceral reaction on either part. Throughout the film, the comedy of the script plays a key supportive role, keeping us thoroughly entertained with Sorkin's quick-fire wit. It's not all heavily quotable one-liners, however, the simple story of friendship the film's thematic core. By its finale, as Zuckerberg sits alone in the deposition room, we are left to wonder if his newly amassed multi-billion dollar fortune has really changed anything. Riches, as his ex-girlfriend might argue, do not an asshole unmake. An old and well explored parable it may be, but it is given a fitting modern treatment here.A movie about Facebook? A movie about Facebook?! No, actually. A movie about friendship, about jealousy, and about the destructive influence of one upon the other. Perhaps the explanation for the somewhat exaggerative praise heaped upon this film lies in the fact that such an initially bizarre idea has—through a well written script and powerful performances—become so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"The desire to get laid earns him 25 billion, but he did not get lucky","Recently I got more and more annoyed by the fact that every site I went on wanted me to log in with my facebook account . I thought that facebook was a site for people who wanted to get laid, and I did not see the connection with my political views or opinion about a TV show, so I saw no reason to join.( Also I had enough bad lays in my lifetime, I do not need any more.)When I heard all that Hallelujah about the Social Network movie I went to see it in the hope of understanding the younger generation and facebook better.My reaction leaving the theatre was mainly relief that I am not young anymore. The representation of life on Harvard campus and in California did not look like fun to me. Especially the way the girls were depicted was nauseating. I found myself confirmed that facebook was originally created by boys who wanted to get laid and that becoming a billionaire is easy nowadays if you find a way to promise social contact to enough lonely and desperate people . It is the same principle they sell deodorants, silicon breasts, hair transplants, botox, cars, make up, wonder bras, Oprah, mouth wash, fashion, Viagra, porn, alcohol, Dr. Phil, drugs, etc with. The only ones who get lucky in this game are the sellers not the buyers. The good message of the movie was that all the money in the world cannot buy that so much desired social contact.I found myself frequently checking my watch, which is not a good sign while watching a movie. The acting was good the guys were all supposed to be a-holes and they played that role quite well.

"Smart, Engaging Drama","The Social Network is incredibly intelligent and engaging. It has a great cast and a very strong screenplay.The movie is about college student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) who, with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin ( Andree Garfield), creates the global phenomenon Facebook. The story is framed around two lawsuits against Mark, one from the Winklevoss twins (Arnie Hammer) and Eduardo himself. Justin Timberlake plays the playboy character of Shaun Parker, he does such a good job I really hated him at the end.The actors do a great job in this film. Jesse Eisenberg delivers his lines with speed and sarcasm, which is very entertaining to watch. Andrew Garfield is also fantastic, he brings a vulnerability to his character and makes the friendship between the two leads believable. Arnie Hammer is playing two versions of himself yet each of them feels distinct.The music stands out as well. It perfectly matches each scene and is tonally accurate.
The dialogue is written by Aaron Sorkin, who is known for his snappy screenplays. This film is no exception, it really elevates the movie and makes it more exciting. The pacing is quick, it moves along without feeling rushed or too long. The themes of fame and wealth are profound and subtle, adding a very important layer to the film.Overall, this is a fantastic movie.

I believe that, those are reasons that drove Mr.Zuckerberg(great break out role for Jessie Eisenberg), and his accomplices(also great Justin Timberlake among others) during they journey of making now famous social network system called face book. There are few quite amazing thinks about this film. First of all I must praise it for very good pacing.The whole thing runs for about 2hrs, and it is assembled from scenes of arguing, discussing things etc. yet you will not find any dull moment in the story. Also what I found worth pointing out is that even though this film is filled with high tech slang, you will always be interested in what is happening on screen, even if you are just mildly aware of the possibilities that your good old PC provides.

Far from Fincher's best,"I have to agree with one of the other reviews here - if Facebook were not so popular, there would not be so much credit given to this film. Its far from Zodiac or Seven, Fincher's best films by far. This is competent film making from Fincher and no more. It is him going through the motions of what he's done before. He's not pushing or using his craft as he has done in the past. Also the dialogue, while clever, fast paced and self aware, means that all characters sound the same, its more about showing off with dialogue than being true to the characters or story.

One of the most interesting character dramas made,"The Social Network was never a film on my radar but upon hearing that David Fincher directed it and Aaron Sorkin wrote it, I had to go check this film out. I have no regrets.The Social Network is definitely one of the most engaging dramas I've had the pleasure of watching. Everything was pretty much bang on. Fincher's direction was immaculate. Every scene was clear and had a great style to it. What really stood out to me was Sorkin's script. I knew Sorkin was one of the best scriptwriters working today but here I was just in awe at his work. Each and every dialogue felt captivating and added a lot of personality to everyone's character especially Mark Zuckerberg. The cinematography was top-notch and the music throughout felt very fitting to whatever was going on in the scene.Jesse Eisenberg owned the role of Zuckerberg. He delivered his lines so well and proved to me that he is capable of handling a serious role. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake were also perfect in their roles and gave their best performances.Even if the film is factually inaccurate at times, the drama and conflict that takes place between the characters creates such an investing experience that you tend not to think about what aspects of the film are true or false.I would highly recommend The Social Network.

over hyped just like facebook but still good,"So I watched 2010's most over-hyped film ""the social network"". So was it good, well yes, was it as awesome as advertised well no. This film has quite a pedigree Oscars, David Fincher, Aaron Sorkin (not a fan, I personally think all his characters speak with the same tone, just watch Sports night to get an idea of what I am talking about), and universal critical praise. I personally liked this movie but did not love it. It is a fictionalized version of the truth, a truth that is still the present for the most part. I personally don't see what is so great about facebook. I have an account, but most of the time when I log on I see someone ""likes q-tips"", thanks for sharing. But it is fascinating that this genius named Mark Zuckerberg, basically took being socially awkward, having a chip on his shoulder, and programming skills, and turned all that into a company that is somehow magically valued at around 25 billion dollars (another thing that I just don't understand). Zuckerberg apparently did all this while he sacrificed friendship, and screwed over a couple of uber twins to become the king nerd. This film does give us some sense of the basic story of how someone became the world's youngest billionaire. It is also interesting, well acted, and has broad appeal.

The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. (pauses)Mark Zuckerberg: Did I adequately answer your condescending question?The Social Network (2010)PG-13 ,120 min , Biography, DramaThe plot follows- as Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking site that would become known as Facebook, he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea, and by the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business.Who would have thought this was the history of Facebook? well - could be partly fictional and yet I must admit, 'twas much different from the other #socialnetwork themed movies I've watched so far. The director did an amazing job here as did the main cast. The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross set the tone perfectly. The dialogues, the cool that our young Zuckerberg played, just everything about this movie fell in place to make it a hit!

Clever,"Overall, this was an entertaining and well made film. The narrative structure keeps you engaged. There is a lot of detail about the creators of Facebook and it's fascinating. The actors do a great job for the most part. Andrew Garfield's Performance is inconsistent at times but he nails the emotional scenes. Eisenberg creates a very interesting character. Timberlake does a good job in his supporting role, but the character is quite generic. The film at times became boring especially in the second half where too much time was given to the other part of the story about Harvard connect. Solid film overall",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Time to learn about the pioneer of real Social Network,"Eisenberg was at his best !! The acting was total class . The adaptation was noteworthy! Its not easy to adapt such a film with such a confusing story line. But there are times when u don't quite understand what's actually going . But overall the movie is a kind of must watch.Other people also did a good work especially Andrew Garfield ,he was my favourite all the time. Those who liked JOBS the biopic of Steve Jobs will definitely like this one.went into this film with little or no hope. By the time the movie was over, with the Beatles' ""Baby, You're A Rich Man"" playing over the end credits, I had a huge smile on my face.

Necessary inaccuracies,"I think this would be a completely different movie if it attempted to be very accurate. That's why I view it as mostly fiction, not to say that what is shown here is mostly fiction, but it is definitely much more stylistic and thematic in its approach than a documentary esque film would be. Viewing it like this, in my eyes this is a 9-10. I'll go with 9 because I think it should have been more clear about its inaccuracies - many people now hold on to this false version of reality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
7 stars for Movie creation and for Mark Zuckerberg,"I don't like Mark Zuckerberg for some reason but I realized (not because of this movie though it impacted very little on my decision):

A Constantly Intriguing Movie with Little Flaws,"The Social Network is a great movie with only a couple of downfalls.I really enjoyed the cast and I think that they were great at acting. They played their characters very well and I think that Jesse Eisenberg did especially well as a socially awkward Mark Zuckerberg.I realize that you are supposed to feel frustrated at certain points in the movie but I felt like I was too frustrated at the characters and it made the movie-viewing kind of slow at the time.Other than that, the story has a lot of great moments where you are glued to your seat.This is a movie that you should definitely watch if you ever have the time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Compelling story and acting,"It's not a very glamorous story but David Fincher does a good job of adapting it to the big screen. The best part was the acting.

Like,"Perhaps I read too much into this, but I thought the friendship between Zuckerberg and Saverin in The Social Network ran very much parallel to the friendship of Jedediah Leland and Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane. The disillusionment that Leland faces in having to expose his friend, Kane, as a fraud insofar as a man abandoning his core principles in running a newspaper to become a power hungry politician is in line with what Saverin faces in watching Zuckerberg be taken in by interloper Sean Parker and Parker's influential ideas on how to expand Facebook.Both films feature scenes where the best friends of the lead characters confront their friendship/conflict while reflecting nostalgically on their declining importance; Leland's saved declaration of principles from the hand of a younger Charles Foster Kane and Saverin during a moment of reflection with Zuckerberg discussing an algorithm written on a dorm room window pane.Both films are classic tales of young entrepreneurs becoming wealthy, powerful and influential...albeit without any friends.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
a story how Facebook began,"Through watching this film, I can understand how the Facebook started; however, I was slightly shocked because the reason Mike established this system in Harvard University wasn't good.

As the advertisement says, ""you don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies"". This message represents his way to promote his company, I suppose.

David fincher is not the suitable director for this movie.,"I don't know much about facebook and mark story, maybe because we don't use facebook here in my country or at least I don't .I'll not say I had high expectations for this film, but at least I was looking for good story telling. Unfortunately I didn't like it.I have get lost in the middle of the events, it maybe because of the timeline of the story, or also because of the cutscene. I'm sure it would be a better movie if the story told by another way and also contains some of the events in the true story they didn't show it in the film.Also david fincher is not the suitable director for this kind of movies, he's a great and talented director in ""thriller and mystery "" movies, but not in this kind!He did a lot of good movies like ""Zodiac, se7en"" and others.

The movie this generation deserves,"In a Frank Zappa interview, he once discussed the changing music industry & how it slowly went downhill due to executives not taking any real risks while thinking they ""knew"" what was cool or what the kids wanted in order to meet their bottom line. He goes on to basically say that the current (at that time) decline in music quality/originality is what our society deserves; Since the masses obviously keep buying into the MTV culture where ""good"" art is more about looks, money, & style than actual content.I think Zappa's idea applies to this film and our declining society as a whole (in terms of film, music, and the entertainment industry in general). We deserve this type of tripe, shallow, & superficial ""pop culture"" fad praising art that we throw gobs of money at each year. This film is a cookie-cutter ""what's cool now"" made-for-TV special with apparently a wild squirrel randomly jumping on piano keys for the soundtrack.There are some solid performances here but overall it is too panderous to the contemporaries who will remember the rising popularity of Myspace 2. What is worse is that they didn't even make a Steve Jobs film until after he passed & Jobs (and company) did a lot more to change the way we interact in all aspects of life. Why did Facebook/Zuckerberg need a 2 hour film about him even as the site's popularity was rising? I guess because it's ""hip"" & so ""IN"" right now.They may as well start making films about eBay's rise to power & the evolution of YouTube starring Justin Bieber as Chad Hurley.Our watered down, over hyping society is sadly continuing into a dangerous trend of accepting essentially superficial and empty products that all look the same but with a slightly different package. Everyone wants to be a star or know something about stars; Both desires, just like this film, do not result in anything worthwhile.I give it 10-15 years max before Facebook becomes as relevant as Pet Rocks & Gangnam Style. If critics and audiences keep buying into this garbage, it is certainly what they deserve more of.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Incredible Film with amazing acting and many themes.,"When I first saw this movie in my feed, searching for what to watch, I saw it was about Facebook, laughed a bit, and added it to my watch later, because I had heard it was considered classic but I was skeptical. Plus, it featured Jesse, an actor that, while I don't know many actors in general, is one I respect a lot.I finally get around to watching the movie and I am floored. Nearly every scene you can tell the mood, what every character is feeling. Mark in this movie is an incredibly deep character, and the other supporting roles, while not the most developed, don't need to be, as seeing how Jesse interacts with different roles and stereotypes is fascinating.You could watch this movie through the lens of Mark being the villain, or a man just trying to stand out. I cannot overstate how impressed I am with how all of the themes and conflicts entangle themselves in this film.A great work to be sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fincher rolls on into gold status with Social Network,"David Fincher can now be considered in the ranks of legends or at least modern masters- a list that includes Tarantino, Denis Villeneuve and Soderberg and PT Anderson. Penned by scribe supreme Aaron Sorkin the film details the creation of Facebook and the circumstances surrounding its inception. The acting is top-notch as is the visual and production design aspect. The film makes you feel amidst a giant maze of campus buildings sometime around Fall- and under the direction of Fincher all this boils into a fantastic drama brimming with the age old codes of envy and jealousy. This is a must watch for anyone.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"""..You pretentious d*uche bag!""","B+Despite avoiding the direct title, this film will forever be known as the 'Facebook movie'. In the same fashion as Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"", this film's focus is on the greed for money and thirst for power that drives people. I hear people constantly go on about how the film was shot, and yes, I acknowledge that it does look rather fantastic, with a fine polished look to the images.And the performances do surprise you. I'm not familiar with Andrew Garfield, but he did quite well. Brenda Song of Disney channel stars, who I thought would anger me, actually serves up a nice performance. Armie Hammer I must definitely give kudos to and Timberlake, another popular pop icon, does very nicely. And then we come to Jesse Eisenburg, the perpetual Gordon Gekko of the movie. Now the problem is, I don't care what any critic says, Eisenburg literally kept the same facial expression during the ENTIRE movie. His talent lay in several smart-aleck quips he delivers thru out the run time, culminating in his eventual hollow victory. At least it's portrayed as hollow, seeing as he sits there refreshing a Facebook page belonging to a girl he humiliated. Speaking of which, because I assume the character was an ex, I had no idea today's college students, with all our texting, e-mails, and whatnot, actually passed notes in classrooms, but I digress.The tactic is clear, to tell a story about the abandoned morality of the business man, fueled by a contemporary techno-like score I didn't care much for, leaving us with a climax where a substantial profit is made, some profit more than others, and man ya character feel cheated and no one appears truly happy. IT's charming to look at but like Eisenburg's character it feels hollow. Director Fincher definitely knows how to tell a story, and how to say mouthfuls about his characters (some of them), but the story everyone praise seems off to me. I'm not a guy who roots for the hero; after all, I find Michael Douglass' portrayal of Wall Street tycoon Gordon Gekko to be one of my favorite roles of all time. I deeply enjoyed the character, but the ones here I repeat, just come off as hollow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
10th anniversary!,"In a dingy and nondescript college town bar a fastidious, snide and awkward kid is emasculated by his girlfriend, who is breaking up with him. At this moment around the world the same thing is happening to a lot of young people, but this is no ordinary end to a relationship. This break-up is the spark for an idea that truly changes the world and is now worth hundreds of billions of dollars besides. It is the Fall semester at Harvard, 2003, and the student getting his balls busted is computer wizard Mark Zuckerberg.The Social Network provides a fascinating glimpse into a pivotal time period in the life of Zuckerberg who ultimately turns this rejection into a colossal corporate juggernaut, instant stardom and billions of dollars. The film is not a biography, but something more compelling. It revolves around a time when Zuckerberg is just making a name for himself, is being sued for ripping off other people, and is most vulnerable to being influenced for better or worse.Characters are introduced in novel and intriguing ways as Zuckerberg himself is. We meet the founder of Napster, for instance, awakening after a one-night stand. Ambient street sounds of traffic, footsteps and random conversations contribute to the film's vibe of authenticity.The Social Network is not a typical college-life story. Instead of focusing on dysfunctional, fictional slackers who stumble upon a fleeting, drunken and hazy sort of happiness there are real and ambitious young people seizing opportunities that will bring them riches and power beyond their wildest dreams. Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary, is no bumbling Dean Wormer. In one hilarious scene Summers, the President of Harvard while Zuckerberg was there, totally humiliates two arrogant and privileged students who come to enlist him to take on Zuckerberg. Still, as in the fictional stories, much happens by chance. Like getting people to willingly share their personal information instead of hacking it, or having a broken relationship serve as the genesis for a social media behemoth and massive fortune.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Masterpiece,"First off, The Social Network directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin. I mention the names because both are largely responsible to what this film is: a masterpiece. The Social Network has one of the best screenplays of any movie ever. The dialogue is snappy, fast-paced, delivered with pinpoint precision, but most of all it's meaningful. Every word holds meaning, and none of it detracts from the story. Every conversation serves its purpose in moving the story forward, and all of it is such believable dialogue. The film's story centers around the creation of Facebook, and although most of this film isn't accurate to what actually happen, every aspect of the true story that could be used for a dramatic purpose was utilized. Everything just works so well together in this movie, the story, the places, the age of the characters, the style, the performances, everything is done so wonderfully. This is one of those movies where you think about it for days after seeing it, and so much of it still sticks closely with you. This is a modern masterpiece, and I could go on dissecting every element of the film for hours with how carefully crafted it is, but I'll leave it at that. The Social Network gets an 8.5/10.My Rating System:1/10- hot garbage

A Movie That Appeals To Every Generation,"When you first hear that a movie is going to be made about the creation of Facebook you don't think big things from it much less that it would be consider one of this generations masterpieces. Thought I wouldn't go as far as that I still love The Social Network and I think that it's a close second for David Finchers best film. After seeing this film I legitimately could not have seen someone else directing this film he just knows how to direct a movie his process of taking as many as takes as necessary works for this movie as it mirrors the themes of inventiveness and betrayal. This is arguably Jesse Eisenberg most icon role and it is for a reason he's just perfect in this movie his acting style matches perfectly with the character of Mark Zuckerberg who is a fascinating protagonist. Even though he isn't always the most likable character his say-things-as-they-are attitude makes him an intriguing and sometimes funny character that always captures the viewers attention. Most of the events of this film are shown through flashbacks and while that has been seen before it works perfectly for this films narrative and makes for some truly amazing editing. Aaron Sorkins screenplay is one of the best written of recent years it's a script that in some way relates to everyone we've all had something that we're good at in life and want to strive to be the best at, we've all had friends that we want to keep but can't because real life gets in the way all of this is addressed in The Social Networking making sure that everyone will in some way be able to connect with this film. The supporting cast are all fantastic in this film Andrew Garfield was worthy of at least an Oscar nomination in this film he bounces perfectly of Eisenberg and serves a reflection of the audience in this film. Justin Timberlake also really blew me away in this film he just is so good at playing his almost unlikable character and has never since been able to live up to this performance.Overall The Social Network is a guaranteed classic that will forever be remembered by this generation as one of its most relatable movies and one of Finchers best efforts.100%/A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Rags to riches story, but is someone's soul at stake here?","Funny thing about The Social Network is that it started life as ""that Facebook movie"", even with Fincher's name attached almost anything that wasn't a string of facebook relationship statuses updated would seem like a knockout success, then people started pouring out of theaters in raving enthusiasm about how good it actually is, expectations were miraculously installed, and now I'm forced to write surreal things like ""that Facebook movie is not that good"". That Facebook movie is not that good! There's a scene early on that annoyed me. As a bunch of computer geeks huddle around a computer screen to find cool hackster ways to get back at girls for not giving them any, we see a busload of young college girls all dressed up to please unloaded at the doorstep of a very exclusive Harvard club. Once inside they dance on laps and strip and are excited to be pawed by spoiled rich kids. That's not to say either of the two parts of that scene don't happen in real life or shouldn't happen in a film, but the juxtaposition is jarring. It's almost like the film is saying those same girls deserve to be treated as pretty face fodder for online voting contests because they are sluts.I had forgotten all the negative things I was hearing about ""that rowing scene"" until it came up on screen. What the hell was Fincher thinking? His visual style for the duration was so mute and perfunctory that when he decides to flex his muscles, like a recluse who hasn't talked to another human being for a week will speak in an awkward voice, the results are cringeworthy. I haven't scene more out-of-place mood killers since the time Pino Donaggio was scoring lame funky comic relieves for Brian DePalma in Carrie.Which brings me to that style. I don't like Fincher's toilet-stain brown in anything but this is muted by another remove. The Social Network has all the visual imagination of a newspaper; which is not bad for it, because it's trying to be the newspaper. It's all fact and ""he said that and then I said that"", talky like a stageplay and I don't like talky films any more than I like the theatre, and even introduces a dual flashback structure that is more framing device because nothing meaningful happens within the flashbacks. I don't want to make claims for pure cinema because that would mean some kind of ""impure cinema"" exists as second-choice for those still apprenticing to reach a cinema of higher order, but I wish more of what goes on here was translated in visual means. Like the ""happy days are over"" metaphor of the shot of coming clouds casting a shadow over tall buildings.I like these rags to riches stories to be Shakespearean, to end in tragic hopeless notes, to take me to heights as a means of plunging me to black depths of the soul from where a future can't be surmised. The Citizen Kane comparisons are not completely without merit, but CK ends with a panoramic shot of a huge warehouse filled with boxes of his things, memories of life ready to be carted away. Kane is not there but the loneliness of the image chills my bones. Zuckerberg is alone at the end of Fincher's movie, but he's alone at a business room, with a laptop, and an apprentice attorney offers to order something to eat for him. He's not spent and damned like Daniel Plainview, he f-cked up but he's only starting out. The final glimpse into the soul of a man who made it to the top and is alone there, is Zuckerberg refreshing a Facebook page. What I mean to say is that his damnation doesn't ring throughout eternity for me, I never feared for his soul. I can see an easy bright future ahead of this man who is young and rich and healthy, the fall is not deep enough and so the rise is equally irrelevant to me.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Need to be in the right mood to watch,"Well just finished watching this film and didn't really click with it that well. It could have been a lot more fascinating than it was. The casting was good (but not great), the scripting was, as you would expect with mentions of web programming terminology, server hardware and general geeky use of language, but I guess I just wasn't in the right mood for it. It only really picked up when Timberlake's character steps in. The comedy aspect of the film was pretty average and the lead character did come across as a little too 2 dimensional for my liking. All in all not in my top 5 or top 10. It won't make me want to watch a film about the founders of twitter or my space, if anyone writes a script for them too.

thoughts on the social network,"I personally really enjoyed The Social Network, it was able to tell the story of Facebook without becoming boring. When films are based around certain real life event they can sometimes be too scared to stray too far from the facts which can make the film end up being boring and too realistic (if people wanted that they would look for documentaries). The Social Network pretty much keeps to the story line of creating Facebook without feeling to much like a documentary.The script/dialogue you can tell just by watching the first scene with Mark and his girlfriend, Erica. Jesse Eisenberg especially captures the tone/personality of his character just by his execution of his lines (fast pace).I found the scenes where they were arguing in the meeting a little confusing and erratic but other than that this movie is able to keep to entertained while giving you real insight of the story of Facebook.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Recommended if you like dramas with comedy elements and are interested in Zuckerbergs story,"Finally came around to watching the most popular movie about mr. Zuckerberg and the founding of his little website..The film opens with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) at Harvard University in 2003. Mark was just dumped by his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara) for being a jerk. His reaction to this is to post insulting things about her on his blog while simultaneously hacking the University database to illegally download pictures of all the female members and drinking lots of beers. With the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) he uses the downloaded pictures to create the website ""Facemash"" (which ranks two girls and the user picks the hottest), which is so popular that in a short time it crashes the whole University computer network. The University is not pleased but Mark's website did draw the attention of three Harvard upper-class members, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra, who have an idea for a social network featuring exclusive Harvard members and aimed at dating. They ask if Mark likes to join their project as a programmer.
Mark agrees to work on their project but then starts to create his own online social network called 'thefacebook', funded with the help of Eduardo and leaves the Narendra and the Winklevoss brothers in the dark of what he is really doing. When he launches thefacebook website it immediately becomes a success, which infuriates the Winklevoss brothers who blame him for stealing their idea. Things get more and more tense when thefacebook grows and Mark draws the attention of playboy and Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who would like to work with him and make it a billion dollar project..Overall this is a good movie; I really liked the chemistry between the main characters (Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, who stole the movie for me) and it's story kept me watching even though you already know what happens (I guess everybody knows what Facebook is during this day and age). The supporting cast did a fine job as well and I was surprised by the performance of Justin Timberlake (or was he just acting as himself..? ). The message of the movie is clear (the young techs are coming!) and it leaves it to the viewer to make up your mind about Zuckerberg true intentions.What bugged me the most in this movie is that they portrayed Zuckerberg as a lonely nerd and that he was still lovesick about some girl he dated years ago. The real Zuckerberg was in a relationship during the time this movie takes place and he married his girlfriend in 2012, which is a huge difference with the Zuckerberg we see in the movie. It's also interesting that they tell the story in a flashback style with the courtroom being the present time but it's sometime a little bit difficult to follow what event happened first. But despite this it's a fine movie with good acting, some comedy moments and an interesting story about how one of the biggest websites ever was founded.Check out this film if you like dramas with some comedy elements and are interested in Zuckerbergs story and the rise of Facebook. But don't expect it to be 100% accurate. (as is usual in biography's)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Network Review,"A biographical drama film from 2010 by David Fincher.The film sheds light on the foundation of Facebook and the period when Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) became the youngest self-made billionaire in history. The characters other than Zuckerberg are also handled very successfully. I think Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) are handled more successfully than Zuckerberg, because while we can understand the motives of the other characters, the film cannot convey to us the reasons other than the breakup that led Zuckerberg to establish the Facemash site. The answers to the questions of why Zuckerberg did what he did, whether he cheated on his friends, and if he did, why he did it are unfortunately not available in the film.It is indisputable that Mark Zuckerberg, who left his dorm room at Harvard and became the owner of almost all the applications used by the world today, such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, transformed social media and therefore the whole world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
slickly made but relentlessly creepy,"Being in the computer biz I was interested in some of the ins and outs of the rise to glory of Facebook. This movie has the feel of truth as far as the character of the individuals depicted and what I know of the backstory. But for me that was the problem. Almost everyone in the film was creepy and despicable, and the lesson I drew was that this is the way things work in the Brave New World of virtual friendships. That's fine as far as it goes but by the time I escaped the theater I had a dank aftertaste in my mouth.The dialog is pretty snappy. I kind of liked the music, but it was a bit overbearing in those big disco/party scenes. I try to avoid these in real life, preferring to have conversations with people where I can actually hear and understand what that other person is saying. I didn't have the choice here.Too many scenes were just irritating to watch. Is everyone at Harvard really a complete, overbearing, condescending superficial bore with an overinflated sense of entitlement? Interesting scene with Larry Summers, who has always struck me as one of these. But it gets tiresome.Who do you root for in this movie? After more than an hour and a half I the only one I found was the girl from B.U. that called Mark and asshole and blew him off. His partner is decent but hopelessly naive, the other parties in the lawsuit are only marginally less creepy and arrogant than the main character.Easily the most overrated movie of the year.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A rightly restless movie!,"The thing I love about The Social Network is, the flow of the movie resonates with the characters it depicts. The movie proceeds with breakneck pace, is raw, visceral and restless, much like it's characters. Another reason why the movie works is,Impeccable casting. Jesse Eisenberg playing Mark Zuckerberg with an air of arrogance nails it. Andrew Garfield is the most likeable character in the movie, as Eduardo Saverin. No one could have played Sean Parker like Justin Timberlake, and Armie Hammer playing the Winklevoss twins is fantastic too. We usually associate David Fincher with those dark psychological thrillers, but this movie proves, he is not a genre specific filmmaker, he is much more than that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A semi-accurate history, but a transcendent movie","When I first saw this film in 2010, I definitely recognized Sorkin's brilliance and Fincher's craftsmanship (always)...but I kept getting distracted by accuracy questions. Why did they change Zuckerberg from socially awkward to the most confident and eloquent nerd ever? Why did they leave out his then-girlfriend and now-wife? How much of this story was true? Revisiting the movie in 2020 was very different (and not just because Zuckerberg feels more and more like Eisenberg these days). I was able to just watch it as a movie. This film tells a company's origin story through depositions and flashbacks. That should not work. But it does. From Resnor's score ramping up the intensity to the brilliant pacing/cuts to the pitch perfect performances of Sorkin's dialogue, this story just cooks. No matter where you come in, you HAVE to keep watching. And for once Sorkin's resists explaining his theme through speeches over and over. You just see the way connection and isolation coexist, for the main character and honestly for yourself. It is all pretty brilliant, and it was worth a second watch, for sure. Is it accurate? Somewhat. Is it a great film? One hundred percent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Worth watching, even if a touch longer than necessary","How far can one girl drive a guy to go? That question is at the core of ""The Social Network."" The movie follows Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) through all of the twists and turns of developing his now- famous Facebook web site. The social scene of America's elite universities - portrayed as elitist, filled with peer pressure, and driven towards getting what you want – provides the backdrop for the legal battles between both Mark and his friend Eduardo, as well as a group of students from one of the most prestigious clubs on campus. The money involved, however, is always secondary to the more important issues of status and social standing, and the contrast of that pressure with developing actual friendships. It is also, of course, about that one girl – Erica, a BU student who we first meet in a bar with Mark, whose occasional appearances remind us of what gets Mark started in the first place.The movie's story is definitely compelling, giving us flashback insights into the process by which Facebook became a social phenomenon. Though most of us know how successful the site ends up being (I even got into this site through Facebook), we are still left intrigued by the complicated process which drives the site forward from its humble beginnings in a Harvard dorm room. The college social scene that is at the heart of the movie is also skillfully articulated, with Trent Reznor's musical influence providing a tremendous soundtrack that highlights its darker undertones. The film also raises a number of great questions about what it means to be social in the 21st century – how are our relationships shaped by technology, and in reverse, how has technology developed in response to the way our relationships have already changed. How we can develop a whole ""social network"" - and lose all our real friends in the process – creates the powerful but disturbing narrative behind this film.There are a few weaknesses in the movie. The story does not seem to fill the entire 120 minutes, with lulls where the plot is moving a bit slowly and the characters do not provide enough of an emotional connection to keep things interesting. Cutting 15-20 minutes and/or further developing some of the secondary characters may have helped the story feel more consistently strong. The rest of the movie's strengths, however, more than make up for these weaknesses, and make this film well worth watching – and then, perhaps, posting a note about on Facebook.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
sure,"Sure its well made but this wan't really that impressive to me. The story had a nice flow to it, but the story itself wasn't really that well made. Especially the ending, gawdy. So yea, well made, but has very little substance.6/10: theres better out there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Entertainment. Not biography,"This film won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar and a Golden Globe for best picture. Now many would argue that better films were written/made in 2010. But let's consider this movie on its own.It has budding stars in Eisenberg and Garfield, who'll be taking up the mantle of the non-traditional hero in the future and The Social Network will be a big reason why. Timberlake made me take notice too. The music (Best Original Score) is a big reason why people enjoyed this movie and its not hard to see why Trent Reznor is so popular among those who care.Now as the audience, the only things that got me interested in the movie before seeing it, was Facebook and the masterful David Fincher. Like in most of his films, he wants us to open our eyes to stuff we wouldn't usually even think of (Se7en, Fight Club). Before watching The Social Network, we know we love Facebook and we just want to know more about its creator, Mark Zuckerberg. And we find out stuff we wouldn't know otherwise about Mark, his girlfriend, his best friend Eduardo and others his Facebook venture touched. We are thoroughly entertained and pass this news to our friends, mostly through Facebook.But in the end, we're compelled to ask ourselves a doubt (unlike in Se7en or Fight Club): ""Was Mark really an a**hole?""",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The simple story turned into an extraordinary film.,"Intelligent, funny, and energetic. The Social Network is a spectacular film that David Fincher flawlessly crafts. This is probably the only film that I've given 10 stars and the film is just dialogue. The film is exciting with each line of dialogue. Jessie Eisenberg portrays Mark Zuckerberg as a smart, witty, and hilarious man who begins making his network without knowing how much money this network would make. The music is used cleverly and the editing is constantly extraordinary. Andrew Garfield also is wonderful and he gives an extraordinary performance near the end. The film is two hours and it never feels slow. I could even watch another half an hour of the film. It never is uneventful. It keeps your adrenaline pumping. They are able to tell a story that offers more than just dialogue. David Fincher directed this film with much care and I appreciate him for that. I hope I can watch more of his films soon. (I have only seen Seven and this film). Overall, The Social Network works and it takes a simple ordinary story and makes it better than any other film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
An interesting insight into how Facebook came about,"This movie in my honest opinion is a little too long, its extremely boring at times with the tedium of litigation fought out in a 'boardroom' but nonetheless engrossing, engaging and interesting - and lets face it, who doesn't use Facebook nowadays? Imagine if they made a similar movie about Bill Gates and the creation of Microsoft! It is also interesting to note from here that David Fincher was the Director behind Benjamin Button, Fight Club and Seven, all good movies in their own right. This is also a very good movie, but as others have said, it is just that - good - trying too hard to be great.I have got to say that the main character portrayed for creating Facebook in the movie is extremely annoying throughout. Very obnoxious and offensive and I felt sorry for the two guys who worked with him in the Facebook set up.Justin Timberlake steals the show to some extent as Napsters Sean Parker, impeccable acting, as an actor, he never fails to deliver.I quite believe that the drift of the story in the film is accurate but there are clearly changes to create a drama. If the real lives story are followed, then there should be no drama for us to enjoy and it is the drama which makes the film for me, not the actual telling of the Facebook story which was thrown in for good measure.We can all watch this and think - wow, what if I had thought of that simple concept back in the Autumn of 2003, but then again, would I really want such a life changing experience which would jeopardise my relationship with family and friends.The movie is flawed in a number of basic areas. I assume nobody gets into Harward without some academic and family qualifying criteria but this is never mentioned in the movie, unlikely the twins who are clearly guys from a family with money.More than once, the point is made that the guy has become the youngest billionaire on earth and that he was ruthless in his determination to execute his plan and get Facebook online, to the cost of friends (and perhaps family) connections.With this in mind, as others have said, the film should have objectively explained to us how the Facebook website could come to be so valued by such a high figure after such a short time. Certainly Sean Parker speculated during the movie but this was way short of figures being talked about in litigation.This was a dangerous film to watch in some ways and yet worth watching a second time to 'comb the dialogue' which was constant throughout. Dangerous because we might be wrongly inspired by its message and perhaps even distrusting of the purpose of a social networking site.I always enjoy 'insight' films and I enjoyed this one despite anything I say which may be construed as negative. The opening scene between the guy and the girlfriend was incredibly tedious and could have been considerably shortened but never mind that, maybe that is the screenplay writer trying to score early points for an Oscar nomination.Not an Oscar movie for me but its a very credible movie overall",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
disappointing,"I do not really understand the hype over this movie. I understand (the) Facebook craze as I use it myself but so many good reviews for such a mediocre movie is just surprising. I didn't want to see it at first as I thought that one cannot turn such a contemporary and known story into a good movie but when I heard so many good opinions from people around me I decided to give it a chance. And I left the movie theater really disappointed. Apart from a good idea of the plot being intertwined in two lawsuits and a couple of nice scenes like the row race in the UK (wonderfully filmed) the movie is just impossibly schematic and, let's not be afraid to use this word, boring. I am a fan of Jesse Eisenberg but even he couldn't get over that lame script. And what is with the obligatory 2 hours of a movie nowadays even if the authors do not have that much of a story to tell. What happened to the good old 90-minute movies? Instead of longer movie for my money I would prefer better value for my money.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Instantly transports you to the early 2000s.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great acting movie,"In some ways I do think this film was made a bit early. Facebook isn't that old a phenomenon, and thus a movie about its origins seems rushed as I don't think we have enough distance to view it objectively. That being said, David Fincher has pulled off some miracles here and I think this is about as perfect a movie about Facebook as was possible to be made. Some of its events and depictions can be argued with and you can definitely see that sometimes things are stretched in the name of drama, but as a story it works really well and will definitely give you some perspective on the web page most of us have come to rely on.And at the centre of it all is Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg in probably his best role performance so far. Zuckerberg is a great character. From the very first scene, where he's talking with his college girlfriend, you get this guy. He's a genius and in his case it's also a burden, a curse. He's in a constant state of frustration because to him everyone else seems to be moving in slow-motion. Everyone is always one or two steps behind and he has to slow done to let them catch up.The movie deals with Zuckerberg's days in college while he was getting Facebook off the ground and with the legal battles that he had to go through later because everyone tried to stake their claim on the pot of gold he had founded. The movie is good at not taking sides and showing that while Zuckerberg certainly did some slightly questionable things, it's not like the other side was completely in the right either.All in all The Social Network is worth a watch because it has great actors lead by a great director and the subject matter is something we're all familiar with and know personally. Best film of the year? Probably not, but it's up there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Zuckerberg: Deer in the Headlights?,"The reviews I had read of ""The Social Network"" implied that there was a bad guy, but after seeing it tonight I came away feeling that Sorkin had drawn Zuckerberg's character with the compassion and huge brush strokes of insight, snappy dialog and ambiguity for which he is famous. OK, so Zuckerberg made a few mistakes, but for the most part, he was as much a victim of Facebook as its creator. (I know, I know - a rich victim, but a victim of his own and others' ambitions, opportunism and greed.) Rage, anger and frustration are the fuel that fire the world's most brilliant creations; add Facebook to the list. You can't teach that in B school; you can't bottle it, you can't aspire to it either. You have to live through the hard stuff - the rejection, the insecurity, the primal angst (which Zuckerberg had in spades even if Sorkin doesn't beat us over the head with it) to gather the kind of motivation required to take a company where Facebook has gone. Of course, I loved seeing my beloved San Francisco as one of the stars, and getting a snapshot of Sean Parker.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Inspirational story but imperfectly packaged.,"On seeing the trailer initially I thought 'who the hell thought about making a movie about Facebook'. Yet after discussing it with friends, I thought it was worth a try and seeing another trailer made me warm to the idea of going.As someone with Asperger's as Zuckerberg is portrayed (without a name for the personality traits) in the movie, it is an inspiration tale of an Aspie doing something with their talents and also it's great to see him being so AS and yet not caring too much (college has brought me a lot of anxiety on that one, so it was therapeutic to see someone with more confidence in a movie). Aside for the therapeutic, happy tone of the movie for me, I find the film making does leave a bit to be desired. The long legal scenes are extremely tedious however I guess there wasn't any way to make the movie without emphasising that aspect of setting up Facebook. Thankfully the vignette technique made it more bearable and the dialogue in the college scenes made the characters really endearing and it was good to watch.Overall, if you're interested in tales of creativity and can put up with some tedious elements of the film then it's worthy cinema night choice, for someone who is interested in these kinds of stories. I don't know if it'll go down as a classic or not; for me it's brilliant, but only in some elements of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Suprisingly loved it,"I stopped watching biopics because I usually find them slow and boring. I came across this film on netflix and this film was worth a shot. It's hugely entertaining and the story is really gripping. Those two hours just flew past I didn't even notice. That's when I know I really like a film. When I just don't notice the time passing. The story doesn't just focus on the foundation of Facebook but also ln the conflict between the different parties involved. I think what made the film really captivating is the editing because in the film we constantly go back and fourth between the present which is like a legal court and then the past which coincides with the events described at the court. Anyway you'll have to watch the film to properly understand but the editing and directing is really good and top that with great performances from Jesse eisinberg and Andrew garfield. I'm just shocked that the film didn't win best picture and lost to ""King's speech"" like no. And this film should have at least an 8+ rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The film, written by Aaron Sorkin, masterfully captures the ambition, betrayal, and complexities of the digital age.At the heart of the film is Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg, a complex character driven by a mix of genius, insecurity, and social awkwardness. Eisenberg perfectly embodies Zuckerberg's intensity and vulnerability, making him both sympathetic and reprehensible. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Andrew Garfield as the betrayed Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as the charming and manipulative Sean Parker.Fincher's direction is visually stunning, with a cold and clinical aesthetic that mirrors the impersonal nature of the digital world. The rapid-fire dialogue, a hallmark of Sorkin's writing, is delivered with precision and wit, creating a sense of urgency and tension. The film's score, composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is haunting and atmospheric, adding another layer of depth to the narrative.""The Social Network"" is a thought-provoking film that explores the dark side of ambition and the impact of technology on human connection.

Favorite biography of all time.,"The Social Network.As Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking site that would become known as Facebook, he is sued by the twins who claimed he stole their idea and by the co-founder who was later squeezed out of the business.It is about Facebook, it is directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, instant classic that might be considered as one of the most important films of all time, that story is a one to tell, they did in the best possible of ways .Directing was masterful, the frames mostly dark with a yellow theme and it served the movie in many ways .Writing was decent, Aaron wrote some great dialogs, the ones that kept me interested and entertained.Technically this movie is a perfect one, it was flawless and I can say it's the best biography I've ever watched , Besides it can be very rewatchable.Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield carried the film, especially Jesse as Mark Zuckerberg, zero mistake.I still don't know why I haven't seen it till today!

This is more then just 'Facebook the Movie',"When it was first announced that there going to be a bio-pic about Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook it was seen by many as a quick cash-in on the popularity of website. But luckily Aaron Sorkin wrote the script and David Fincher was setting in the director's chair and that made The Social Network one of the most highly anticipated film. It is clear that The Social Network is going to be one of the big hitters at the Oscars this year (though my preference is for Inception).The film tells two stories that are interlinked. The first from 2003 when Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg) as a Harvard undergrad who after breaking up with his girlfriend Erich (Rooney Mara) has a misogynistic rant on the internet and make a website, FaceMash where men get to rate Harvard female undergrads against each other. When he gains notoriety the Winklevoss Twins (Armie Hammer) recruit him to make a website, but he ends up making his own website with his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). But as Facebook grows Saverin believes that they need to make money out of the website and Zuckerberg falls under the spell of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the founder of Napster who wants to isolate Saverin. In 2007 the film tells the two lawsuits Zuckerberg is facing with the Winklevoss twins and Saverin both suing him.Sorkin is a great writing and The Social Network shows his skills and usual traits of quick, intelligence, witty dialogue, intelligence well developed characters and quick pacing and excellent plotting, using the legal proceedings as a framing device. The film sets out to show that Harvard is controlled by social elites, with misogyny raging in the Final Clubs. Sorkin was unable to speak to Zuckerberg so most of the script was a fiction, but it was an entertaining fiction. Fincher's direction added to the script; keeping the film down to Earth and Jeff Cronenweth's dark cinematography adding to the tone of the film. Fincher kept the film in the real world and unlike Oliver Stone who tried to be stylist with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (a film that was difficult to make visual), Fincher takes a more gritty realistic tone. Fincher and Sorkin shows that Harvard can be a sleazy place with heavy drinking, drug taking and treating women as no more then sex objects: but there are also intelligence people there and people who disagree with what Zuckerberg did. Fincher and Sorkin make a fast paced, entertaining drama with moments of comedy.There is a very good young cast in the film. Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg almost like he was autistic, a young man with great intelligence but almost no social skills, who as Erich said 'But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole', which is true in the context of the film. Zuckerberg is a shown to be a man willing to steal other people's ideas and concepts, use people and string them along and hides behind computers, becomes horribly bitter if anyone dares cross him and the internet because his lack of social skills. Hammer has a tough job of playing twins and two different characters and he puts it off. Both men are from a wealthy background and felt wronged by Zuckerberg. Garfield is a strong performer, playing one of the few truly sympathetic characters of the film, someone royally screwed over by his one time friend. Before the film Timberland did not have a great reputation as an actor but Fincher was able to get the best out of him and show he can be a good acting talent. Sean Parker is made to be the real villain of the piece, a man who looks a like a 30-year-old who wants to be a uni student, a man who speaks pretentious rubbish about the internet and what he did with the music industry; a man who used Zuckerberg.Sorkin worried that his characters would not sound real because of their age: but Sorkin knows that everyone is an individual and have their own speech pattern. Whilst there is slang that every generation claims for themselves most teenagers and young adult speak the same as everyone else and it great that Sorkin makes his young characters sound intelligence. Language has not changed much between generations and if anything the internet has made it more universal.With all the good things about The Social Network, I am critical of their portrayal of England in a short sequence, going through all the posh stereotypes of what an American would think England is like. I would have expected better from Fincher and Sorkin who are both intelligence men and well travelled. Also it was a shame their didn't use the Kolacny Brothers and Scala version of Creep in the film.Overall, an excellent film and deserving of most of the praise it has received.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Why didn't Andrew Garfield win an Acadamy Award for best supportning role?,"I do belive that this movie has a very well written script, great locations and good actors.

I wonder if he would've involved Eduardo if he'd possessed these traits, as a companion unrelying on him for money or width of the company.I really dislike the character Sean Parker since he ruins the relationship between Eduardo and Mark.I belive it's one of the best biopic movie in the last few years because of the accuracy to the real story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!,"The best reviewed film (so far) this year and early Oscar front-runner 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is upon us! David Fincher (one of my all time favorite directors) directs this adaptation of the popular book 'The Accidental Billionaires: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal' by Ben Mezrich from a script written by Aaron Sorkin (who also wrote 'A FEW GOOD MEN', 'THE American PRESIDENT' and created the TV series 'THE WEST WING' to name a few of his credits). The book, if you haven't heard, is an account of how the internet social networking site 'facebook' was founded, mostly centering on the lawsuits that followed it's immediate success and the relationships of the people involved. Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg (the majority stockholder) and Andrew Garfield co-stars as co-founder Eduardo Saverin. The real Zuckerberg fought hard against this film's release (in this form) fearing it will tarnish his image and he denies it bears much factual bearing at all, to real life events, but the real Saverin was the main consultant on the book. Fact or mostly fiction the film is still a masterpiece and a must see!The story is mostly set in 2003 beginning at Harvard University in the fall and then flashing back and forth between court procedures involving the litigation battles over the ownership of 'facebook'. As the film opens Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica (played by Rooney Mara, who was just cast as the lead in Fincher's upcoming remake of 'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'). Mark is so upset that he goes back to his dorm room, gets wasted and blogs about her and then creates a brief internet site called 'facemash' comparing Harvard girls to each other in ranking of 'hotness'. This gives him notoriety and he is approached by the Winklevoss brothers (both played by Armie Hammer, in addition to a stand-in) about programming an internet social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students, in an attempt to help get them laid. Zuckerberg leads the brothers on, as well as their business partner Divya Narendra (played by Max Minghella, son of award winning director Anthony Minghella), and tells them he's working on their project while coming up with one of his own, facebook, in an attempt to beat them out the gate. He enlists the help of his best friend Eduardo to finance and promote his venture, with the return promise of thirty percent of the profits, and later Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake), the co-founder of Napster. Zuckerberg becomes inpatient with his long time friend Eduardo and tricks him out of the majority of his stock sharing which (along with the Winklevoss dispute) leads to the core legal battle of the film and the heart and humanity of the story.I've been a fan of Fincher ever since his first feature film 'ALIEN 3' (which I'll admit doesn't match it's two predecessors but is still a very underrated sequel, much better than the 4th installment as well as the 'ALIEN VS. PREDATOR' films). He's been responsible for some of my all time favorite films ('FIGHT CLUB', 'SEVEN' and 'ZODIAC') and he's one of the most diverse big name directors working in film today. Here he demonstrates universally appealing thematic abilities (like he attempted with 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON', my least favorite of his films) and I predict he'll finally take home a much deserved Oscar come award time early next year. I also think the film will win best picture and screenplay (Sorkin's script is so witty and brilliant it would be a crime if it doesn't win). The acting is all very impressive as well and Eisenberg, who I've always been a fan of, should finally be able to shed the 'poor man's Michael Cera' image he's been labeled with by many. I'm a big fan of Cera but Eisenberg has been around longer and done much more serious and diverse work; after this film's release the two should have no problem standing apart. The supporting players are all more than adequate and the film's score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is mesmerizing. It's still a little too early to over confidently predict but I'm guessing no film in the next three months (and definitely none already released) will be able to top it come award time.Facebook is probably the most popular and relevant invention in use by the majority of society in at least the last decade and for that reason many say they're not interested in seeing this film; they don't want to further support mankind's biggest fad. This film isn't really about facebook though, it's a dramatic character study. It's about two best friends who are torn apart by money and fame, envy, the desire to get laid and the desire to be approved and envied by others. The film could be about the invention of anything and it wouldn't change much as long as the characters remained the same. This is an intriguing, amazingly fast paced character study with plenty of litigation battle action to keep anyone from falling asleep. The movie is much more entertaining than it might sound and it has a lot of emotion and heart as well. While the Zuckerberg character is appalling and hate worthy at times he's also a well intentioned and good heart-ed person at other times. He uses his show-off smart-ass pretentious nature as a defense mechanism for his insecurities and need to feel liked. He's a flawed anti-hero but a likable one and those are the most interesting in my opinion. The character, whether true to life or not, is the relate-able heart and core of the film and makes for one of the best stories, if not the best, to come to cinematic life this year.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Starts with an annoying conversation.,"Once you get past the annoying conversation and through the credits and plan to settle on the intriguing film of history and success, you will find to your chagrin a blasé pre-cursor give-and-take conversation, a long conversation, a monotone conversation, a dragged-out conversation. It seems like hours of a monologue with a dash of dialog thrown in. As the ending credits roll up you realize that all he did was talk and talk and talk.Of course, if you like long boring conversations this is a great movie and a perfect representation of one great big long diatribe that starts from nowhere and goes nowhere. On the positive side, the music was nice and the period costumes were up to acceptable.I only saw the Blu-ray. I'm not sure they made anything other than Blu-ray. There are the standard scene selections, languages special features, and whatnot however none of them contribute to this presentation. You might want to listen to the audio commentary to see what they were trying to do.Don't get me wrong I like history's I like biographies but this thing wasn't history or biography.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A well made film that draws out what it can from a rather limited topic.,"It's hard to make a film about Facebook sound interesting. How do you jazz up the most banal of topics? It would be like trying to sell a storyline gravitated on the walk to the shops. How many people would spend their hard earned dough watching someone buying a pint of milk and a few hundred grams of Crunchy Nut. Any takers? No? Well, you're just going to have to go with it. Stick with me please as I give you the lowdown on the hottest bit of reel this side of Inception. This recent release didn't get 8 stars for nothing, you know.The Social Network is a film about Facebook yet there is barely a poke, like or wall post in sight. This is not, as one may imagine at first glance, a rom com played out through the interweb. The focus of David Fincher's latest flick is the stuff behind the scenes, the stuff many of us have little idea about and have even less interest in.The plot is simple: Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is a Harvard Computer Science geek desperate to join the frat scene. He invents Facebook although others are keen to make claim to their stakes. We thus see the rise of the company through a retrospective retelling of events as scrutinised in a rather awkward pre-court hearing.The narrative naturally gravitates the viewers attention to focus on the Zuckerberg's blunt autisms. We feel his pain, his frustrations and his vision though, because of the man he is, we remain distant. This is a guy that pays more attention to the architecture of a nightclub than the music it plays. Yet there is an honesty about his straightforward manner that appeals, that amuses.Just as this is no triumphant celebration of the youngest billionaire in the States, neither is it a scathing critique of those that launched successful assaults to rob him of his dollars. The Winklevoss twins, played by two people but both featuring Armie Hammer's head, are what we would call 'preppy'. They are snobs who readily use Daddy's contacts to yield the desirable results. But we don't hate them for it. No, they seem like nice enough chaps. Instead, the viewer is drawn to giggle at this double-act's forthcoming whit. Think Price William meets the Chuckle Brothers. The best thing about the Winklevoss pair has to be the perplexing technical mastery at work that enables the one actor's head to be digitally sewn on to another actor's body to give the illusion of identical twins that are always stood side by side!The biggest surprise undoubtedly has to be the coherent acting of Justin Timberlake. In the role of Sean Parker, the bankrupt Napster founder who flirts with drugs and underage girls, Timberlake adds a bit of spice to the mix. Parker pushes both Facebook and the narrative to more exciting places. Whilst his revolutionary spirit is most prominent, we are occasionally reminded of the geek behind the flashy façade. Ultimately though, we, just like Zuckerberg, admire the man that pioneered the rise of music sharing software and the subsequent decline of the music industry. This is the story of youth fighting back.The Social Network is also a story of the geek fighting back and in order to connect the audience with the social outcast a series of subplots are set up. One of these is a rather dire love story. This underdeveloped series of exchanges is placed on the periphery of the narrative. It seems as though they have been tagged on to the first an last minutes of the film in order to round off a rather open ending and give the impression of a slightly more traditional narrative structure. All that it does though is give a rather soppy, nice finish to an otherwise different sort of film.A fairly uneventful 120 minutes puts The Social Network more in line with Fincher's prior release, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, than his earlier thrillers, Fight Club and Seven. Although a grand climax is neither built nor delivered, there is not a minute of stagnation. The two hours rapidly disappear as the audience remains hooked by the tightest of scripts whilst an abundance of commendable performances bring a turbulent blend of conflict, passion and humour to the screen. The Social Network is a well made film that draws out what it can from a rather limited topic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Very informative, tight screenplay and cast perfectly!","This one is a winner! Many people don't know the rise of Facebook and although Mark Zuk has no affiliation with this film, clearly the writers (Aaron Sorkin -screenplay and Ben Mezrich -book) did their research and came up with a tight screenplay.David Fincher's directing could have not been better. But the most memorable part of this film is Jesse Eisenberg's performance. I don't think they could have cast anyone better to play Mark Zuk., or for that matter anyone to play just that role... of the Harvard nerd kid who made it. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake where also outstanding in their roles.This is one of those films you can watch over and over and pick up something new each watch without getting bored. I know I have.Truly a winner and a perfect 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"don't use facebook, so I really didn't find this movie very interesting","First while there is some good dialog, the movie's downfall is that it was too long at over 2 hours. Also, there isn't a lot that happens since it is just a film about the start up of facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as sort of a nerd/genius but he is also a jerk with how he treats his one good friend, Eduardo. He basically tosses him aside once the hip, outgoing Sean Parker shows up, whom has connections to get facebook funded.FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was that great, but I can see how a lot of people would find it entertaining. Since I don't care anything about Facebook, I say skip it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Crappy gift wrapped so nicely,"I agree that the director and the script writer do a great job of dramatization. Biographical genre is a tricky to have an interesting structure of narrative, but Fincher and Sorkin surmount this handicap by choosing a few important events and focusing on them. Sorkin trim down the whole success story of Zuckerberg into two hours in organized way. He is smart enough to create the outer narrative which is Zukerberg's lawsuit happening in 2008. The history of foundation and development of Facebook is told as inner narrative, and he can skip trivial episodes without worrying about leap of logic or gap in chronological order and focus on big and important chunk of events by coming back to present after that each chunk.It is strange that 'The Social Network' grasps audience even though most characters are petty, unappealing, one-dimensional, and short-sighted. Their lawsuit and even their achievements look pathetic and stupid because they are originated from their jealousy, pretention, and inferiority complex. However, the power of story compensates for weakness.Fincher's portrayal of women is problematic. From the very beginning, a group of women in tight dress are shown. In Harvard, some make history, participate in Olympics, or invest & create jobs while women in Harvard just party naked. Fincher can just omit pointless scenes. Overall, women are described as tools, tools in building Facebook and tools in making this film. Zukerberg publicly writes personal attack mentioning her body and comparing her with farm animals and encourages Internet users to compare women. Of course, the movie can describe his action or behavior; so many cruel and inhumane things can occur in the movie. However, what upsets me is that his criminal activity is dealt so lightly and carelessly. Same goes with Sean Parker and his involvement with teenage girls. It is just Okay behavior both in story and in film.I hate everything the movie tells, but it tells well with eloquence, so I listened and remained focused the whole time. Very strange.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Aka Im David FIncher Bit*h,"Im a big fan of david finchers work, but somehow i was not able to watch this movie, it kind of get postponed to another date, cleaning the toilets on that day can be a reason for postponing this movie as well. And another important factor that made me not wanting to finish this movie was i came across a crucial spoiler in instagram reels and it was a major one.So when i started watching this movie i kinda know what im being dragged into, But even me doing that this movie was excellent to watch. David did david things once again. For some reason it never felt like drama, it was more of living with those charecters and looking at there betrayals ,sorrows and them getting laid easily at a closer perimeter.I would love to do that once again !!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Social Network,"In the evocative realm of cinema, we find ourselves immersed in the tale of Facebook's genesis, as envisioned through the lens of Mark Zuckerberg, brilliantly brought to life by the nuanced performance of Jesse Eisenberg. One cannot help but marvel at how deftly he captures the essence of a mind so fervently driven, yet, perhaps, overshadowed by an air of hubris. The film endeavors to illuminate the intricate tapestry of his journey - a journey that, while undeniably monumental, raises poignant questions about the price of ambition.What sacrifices did this architect of connection endure? While the tides of wealth surged around him, I ponder whether joy was a companion in his youthful endeavors. In the cacophony of success, does he find himself solitary amidst a sea of acquaintances, rather than true friends? It leads one to muse - in a world where we can digitally connect, how often do we truly unite?All is not lost in this portrayal; it resonates with both intrigue and caution, yielding a respectable 7 out of 10. A complex story that serves as a mirror to our times, beckoning us to reflect on the shadowy edges of triumph.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of those rare movies that is perfect.,"This movie is simply amazing. Everything about it just amazes me. The dialogue is fantastic, the acting is wonderful, and the direction is perfect. First thing I really want to talk about when it comes to this masterpiece is the acting. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE is excellent. The performance that surprised the most was Jesse Eisenberg. I loved him in Zombieland and Adventureland, but here he will amaze you. With his roles in Zombieland and Adventureland he was hilarious, but here he shows more range then you thought an actor could ever have. He goes from two funny roles to an amazing dramatic role. Now I know that many people who have not seen the movie will call me crazy, but I think that Jesse Eisenberg deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. I also will go farther by saying that his performance is one of the finest I have ever seen in a film. Andrew Garfield is also fantastic in his role as Eduardo Saverin. Justin Timberlake is one to mention also. Justin should stop singing, and stay in the movies because he is excellent in this movie as Sean Parker. One last person I would like to mention is Brenda Song. Many of you may know her as London Tipton in ""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"". At that point you probably doubt that she will impress you, but you would be wrong. In her role as Christy Lee she shows how she is more than just some actor from a stupid Disney show. In her role she is very good, and I hope that she looks for more roles like this. Then there is the excellent dialogue. The lines are fast, witty, and full charisma. It shows what these characters are like just through their mannerisms. We also have the excellent direction from David Fincher. This movie is just so well put together throughout. Not one camera angle doesn't work. This film has become my new favorite film of 2010 and I hope that this wins a lot of Oscars. It is masterful.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"A visual information streaming without any real cinematic, artistic and emotional effect","It is surprising and quite shocking for me that most people appreciated the work David Fincher had done, especially the style, the approach, the pacing, the editing etc. The Social Network is a ""cinema free"" and ""art free"" movie, also I didn't consider it as an entertainment film. The Social Network has no heart and soul, it is almost impossible to feel anything about anything happening on the screen including the characters. I didn't hate the main character as I didn't like him either, but the problem is not the character. I can't see any artistic touch or cinema feeling in this movie. It was like ""just story and dialogs nothing else, so I found the movie ""mechanic"". See Fincher's other works, especially his early period, there is a huge gap between those and The Social Network. As for entertainment, personally I was not entertained, but also I don't think that this movie intended to be entertainment. If it was, then it is a failure! It was impossible to be entertained for me because of the pacing of the movie and probably it was literally the most exhausting movie I have ever seen in my life. Not only the characters speak too fast, but also the pacing of the film. This editing style, course of events with no break is something I really hate as a moviegoer like that shaky cam and if you ask me it doesn't add brilliance to the movie. The another main problem of the movie is lacking of any message, depth or social commentary. I had expected a thought provoking film and I can easily say that Benjamin Button includes much more themes, messages and comments on life than The Social Network. The Social Network has no background, think about a movie without a background, just the story, the characters are there and dialogs. This is such a movie, so the movie doesn't let you feel anything about anything. I saw a lot of biographical movies, but haven't seen such a film before. If things such as ""cinematic experience"", ""dramatic structure"", heart and soul, character and story depth etc. mean a lot for you like me, then prepare yourself for a poor and very exhausting cinematic journey. Unfortunately, some great directors like some great actors lose their talent, even if not, they don't make great movies as they did in the past such as Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, Tim Burton etc. and as I a big Fincher fan, it is too hard and painful for me to say this, but Fincher is now one of those names either. Considering David Fincher's career, it is like before Panic Room and after Panic Room. By the way, I really liked and enjoyed Panic Room, but it was the transition movie of Fincher. Personally I prefer the period before Panic Room, because I wasn't that impressed by the movies he did after Panic Room. In this movie, if Fincher did something brilliant, I couldn't see what it is. A ""smart"" movie for me is something like 500 Days of Summer. If in the history of cinema, there is any other movie similar with The Social Network, in terms of style with real pacing problems, that could be Syriana, but even Syriana was a more important film than this if you ask me, despite I wasn't impressed by that movie either. I would have wanted to see scenes from life, scenes from Facebook users' lives, some social and psychological comments and the most important relationships! I don't know, but there is one thing I am sure about that which is it would be very interesting and useful to see such a film for every of us. Then what is the point of this film? Just to give us some information? If so, this is not ""cinema"". The Social Network is a visual information streaming, just that.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Extremely entertaining,"This one had a lot of things going against it, at least for me. First, I generally don't like David Fincher, with the one exception of Zodiac. Second, I also don't like Aaron Sorkin. I'm not extremely familiar with his work, but I used to watch his show Sports Night and it's pretty freaking difficult to forgive him for that pile of crap. Third, I could not care less about Facebook. It just seems incredibly unnecessary, I don't like people I barely know or haven't known in a long while having any knowledge of my current comings and goings, and, heck, IMDb takes up so much time of my life why would I really want another bit of the internet biting off chunks of my life? Of course, this movie is solely about the founding of Facebook and really does little or nothing with the way Facebook has affected the concept of friendship in the 21st Century (although, honestly, that sounds like an interesting film itself, but I probably wouldn't watch it because it would make me feel so out of the loop!). And it is a fairly interesting story. As for Fincher, that one exception of Zodiac is the reason I will probably see anything he makes in the future (some may wait for video, however). Plus, this one seemed like it would be tapping into Fincher's Zodiac talent, what with its being a complex true story. His talent is in his attention to details, and it serves him well here. Sorkin is a little harder to get over, and during the opening sequence, in which Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) has a quick-witted conversation/argument with his date (Rooney Mara), I was very afraid that I was going to be beat down by his overly clever dialogue. Fortunately, that scene is the worst in the movie, and, while occasionally the dialogue feels overwrought, generally it's smart without showing off. So, with all of the challenges conquered, how did it fare for me? Very well, in fact. It's far from the greatest film ever made, which is what the insane buzz was saying beforehand, but it's very entertaining. Really, the story shouldn't be anywhere near as entertaining as the film turns out to be. When I went over it again in my head, it felt fairly shallow. But it rushes along with such energy that it swept me along with it like an ocean wave. Fincher does a great job, and he's helped exponentially by the editing (Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall) and the score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). I really want the score to win the Oscar, if for no other reason than to give Trent Reznor an Oscar. My 17 year old self would be ecstatic at that proposition. The cast is also excellent. I think they work best as an ensemble, but, yes, Eisenberg is wonderful, Andrew Garfield shows off his star potential in his biggest role yet and Justin Timberlake is amazing as the guy who created Napster. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely one of the best films of 2010.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"A original movie, cold, but quite fascinating and captivating","The Social Network is a good film to contradict a frequent argument that cinema is running out of Ideas. History is always in the making, so there are always new stories to tell. The question is not so much which stories are worth telling but how they are told. This one is worth telling and told well enough to earn its place as one of the best films of the year.FACEBOOK is among the greatest cultural innovations of the free world so far this century, and even with 500 million users, I'm not even sure the site is in its prime yet. (It has yet to be legalized in China). Ironically, the simple fact that FACEBOOK is young is the movie's only problem (from a film point of view) David Fincher is telling a story that feels incompleteImagine if Citizen Kane ended with Charles Foster becoming the king of American Newspaper. It would be an epic build up, but there would still be much to tell. That's sort of the way it feels with The Social Network. The ending is rushed, but then again what else was there to do, wait eighty years for Mark Zuckerberg to die, and make the movie then? (encompassing his whole life).The Social Network is about how Zuckerberg came to power. When the film ends, he has a little over a million users. It is a short time span to work with, but it is to the great credit of David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin that this motion picture is without a dull moment. This is a rapid fire motion picture, is one clever line after another, and some are pretty funny. Jesse Eisenberg gives a fiery performance, aided in part by his dialogue, and I also got a kick out of one sequence with involves a kayak race directed in music video fashion (which is where David Fincher has his roots)I can definitely see the Social Network finding its way to the Academy awards. It will certainly be a proud moment for David Fincher who with each movie seems to be getting a larger voice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Not one instance I felt the movie was boring or has some unnecessary scene. It has an amazing touch of class from start to end.Very few true stories are converted to good movies which are as effective as the story itself.

The Social Network,"You have to wonder whether Mark Zuckerberg would ever have liked this career defining portrayal by Jesse Eisenberg? His character comes across as an arrogant ass of a man who is prepared to chuck just about everyone under the bus in order to get his original concept of an inter-connected network that enables folk to chat with each other in real time online. He is fed the germ of the idea by the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) and using $1,000 from his best (and only) pal Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) is soon well on the way to developing ""Facebook"". That comes to the attention of the savvier Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) but it's pretty clear that he and Saverin are no match made in heaven. As the story progresses, the personalities are quite sensitively and intensely developed as ambition takes over and Zuckerberg finds himself more and more isolated. Eisenberg is really quite effective here. His portrayal of a man who is fiercely intelligent, sarcastic and focussed is quite compelling to watch - even if it does, frequently, make you want to shoot him. Garfield, too, works well as the almost diametrically opposite sort of character who only towards the end realises he is being played and institutes the legal proceedings around which the entire biopic is based. There are so many NDAs involved to know the extent to which this might be true or just speculative, but Aaron Sorkin is at his writing best and David Fincher likewise in the director's chair as we are introduced to an embryonic industry riddled with selfishness and innovation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Dark, haunting, with more than a grain of truth.","These days it seems harder and harder to go to the cinema and see a movie that isn't frankly rubbish. The Social Network is the best movie I've seen since the last century.It portrays the beginnings of Facebook, probably the most famous and popular website ever, creating the youngest billionaire in history, Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is played by Jesse Eisenberg who gives an incredible performance of a young man with vastly superior intelligence , desperate to make an impression and become ""somebody"". By pure chance he is asked to design a website for the college, which he agrees to, only at some point he decides that the site he's working on should belong to him, not them.It's well known that a lot of this movie is fictitious but I believe the core emotions and events are very true to what actually happened. Zuckerberg fed off the thrill of playing people like pawns, gradually shedding his nerdy teenage persona and turning into a ruthless businessman.The movie tells the story with atmosphere using dark, brooding, menacing music, it just all comes together and exudes some intangible quality that makes it seem hard to believe that this just happened a few years ago, you feel the gradualism of the build-up as Facebook gets bigger and bigger and how people quickly get left behind and how Zukerberg and Parker became perfect business partners to create something the world has never seen before.It's very brave to make a movie about a true story so soon after it happened. If this movie was made 30 years after Facebook was invented it would have been very different. The residual emotion that was floating around after these events would have long since evaporated.David Fincher did something bold and brave by making this movie. The fact that it upset Zuckerberg himself is an achievement in itself. He's been portrayed with more accuracy than he's willing to admit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Film as Greedy and Irritating as Its Subjects; Eisenberg - Wow!,"In ""Social Network,"" Jesse Eisenberg blossoms into an Academy-Award-worthy actor. His performance as Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg is, by turns, clammy, cold, vacant, snarky, and mean, as it should be. If this were a better film, I'd watch it again just to savor Eisenberg's performance.Zuckerberg's/Eisenberg's perfect foils, Cameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss twins, are both played by Armie Hammer, and his performance is also noteworthy. The Winklevoss twins were Harvard students and Olympic athletes from old, WASP money. Actor Armie Hammer is himself from old money. He plays the Winklevoss twins without irony – just, here I am, tall, gorgeous, blond, athletic, brilliant, rich, a superman product of WASP breeding. Given how the politically correct cultural elite of the US has demonized its WASP founders, it's amazing that the twins are not portrayed as bad guys here. They're not good guys, they're just really lucky genetic freaks / Aryan Gods. They are also shown to value old fashioned concepts like honor in business.That a nerdy, super-smart, manipulative, romantically unsuccessful Jewish kid, Zuckerberg, requires establishment WASP princes and ubermenschen like the Winklevosses to sponsor him, and that the Jewish kid eventually manages, through his triumphant sneakiness and cleverness and litigation, to screw the WASP princes over, is a timeworn tale treated many times before, significantly in Lion Feuchtwanger's ""Jud Suss."" Given how many times storytellers have gone to this well, given the explosive and indeed deadly stereotypes at play, I wish that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had ventured anything probing or original here, but they do not.""The Social Network"" is every bit like the subjects it treats. The film is desperately needy, and it works too hard. The film is very loud. Characters often exchange key dialogue in clubs with loud music in the background. The dialogue features, every few seconds, a sarcastic retort.Every scene shouts at the viewer: SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU AND THEY ATTEND EXCLUSIVE PARTIES AND MAKE MONEY YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF. And snort coke off hard-bellied coeds and bungee jump into built-in swimming pools and are serviced by crazed groupies in the stalls of men's rooms. Then they betray each other, and their lives are not always fully emotionally satisfying. You know, I got all that the first time the movie told me, and I really didn't need it repeated over and over and over and over again. The final scene of ""The Social Network"" is unbelievably cheap. If anyone tells you he was moved by that final scene, that person needs to get out more. It's a blatant, failed, attempt at a ""rosebud"" scene.I liked the film at first, but it really doesn't have anything new to say that I didn't know before I went in, and I was really eager for it to finish up. What, besides Dutch angles and noir cinematography, separates a film like ""The Social Network"" from a masterpiece, also about ambition, its rewards and costs, like ""Sweet Smell of Success"" or ""Citizen Kane""? I think those who made those classics managed distance between themselves and their subjects. Orson Welles did not fall under Hearst's spell.Fincher and Sorkin appear to be very much in thrall to the smarts, power, and money they want to skewer, but never really do. ""Look at this man! He's much smarter than you! He's much richer than you! And pity him because his social life is not as good as yours!"" They shout.But then they don't give you any reason to care about this film except its zombie dedication to money and power. ""The Social Network"" says nothing about the power of facebook, or how it's changing society, or even if it is. Scenes exploring those questions would not be as cool as scenes of snorting coke off a blond teenager's belly, or watching one rich man screw over another.Finally, there's a miracle story here that no one making the film is interested in pursuing, but that shines through, in spite of the film's lust for decadent wealth. Mark Zuckerberg really is smarter than you or I. That's a very wonderful thing. It's also a wonderful thing that he managed to find his way to 21st century Harvard. Had Zuckerberg been born in a mud hut in any number of locales and centuries, his abundant gift at manipulating zeros and ones would have been wasted, or even a curse. That Zuckerberg's gift was allowed to flower in capitalist America is a much bigger story than the pettiness, excess and spite the filmmakers insist on focusing on. Zuckerberg's gift, like Gates' and Jobs', etc, will live on long after he and his cofounders and fellow travelers and everyone who envied these guys or wished them dead is forgotten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Money, genius, asshole, attitude and betrayal","Money and wealth: No spiritual things are mentioned here. We only talk about the Material. What is ""money"" and what is ""wealth""? You spend one hour, write a program and sell it to Microsoft. Then you get $1000 and buy your girlfriend a coat. That's wealth! Studentship or the money that our parents support is far from called wealth, until you know how to use it to make more. In the movie, Mark and Eduardo are rich. But for the twin Winklevoss, I have to say that they are not rich enough.Talent excitation: Everybody has the potential to become a genius. However, a so-called genius must be stimulated, which makes the genius-population limited. Provocation from his girl is the original motivation to start the facebook. Challenging tasks in programming may help Mark forget the unhappiness at the same time. Actually, real excitation is very hard to get, because you have to obtain a woman you care and a project you like.Asshole's logic: Mark is called ""asshole"", because he is incredibly meticulous and nerdy. Everything in his eyes has to be precise and correct, just like Binary. During the foundation of facebook, I think Mark understands very well how much stake each of them, Eduardo, Sean and himself should hold. In Mark's opinion, Eduardo has to pay for his mistake. If we say that the freezing of accounts is excusable due to Mark's behavior which made Eduardo has unfair treatment feeling, then the praise ""I love talking to people who understand finance"" went to his head, which makes it obvious that he was careless! Therefore, Eduardo should not get 30% stake in Mark's point of view. But will it be only 0.3%? We don't know.Attitude and power: A very interesting phenomenon is that in China, when you drink with your friend, although both of you do not want to get drunk, you all do finally. Sometimes, people are living for a kind of feeling, for example, feeling balance and fair. Unless you are as nerdy as Mark is, you always have to show some attitude although it seems to be meaningless. That's why we saw ""Harvard gentlemen"" and ""I just want to get my things back"" in the movie.Betrayal and Self-harm: Are Mark and Eduardo friends? This is just like asking whether Mark and Erica are lovers. Different people have different way to express their emotions. There was a very talented and pretty poetess ""Lin Daiyu"" in Chinese fiction who liked get-together, but she actually did not enjoy it because before get-together, she always worried her friends' leaving. She could not endure this feeling, as a result, she said she hated get-together and never wanted it! Maybe Mark values friendship very much, but simultaneously, he fears his friend one day will betray him! Mark would rather hurt his best friend, in case of one day's probable betrayal, which is kind of helpless protection. But who will be hurt more? He keeps doing this, and falls in love with this self-harm feeling gradually! Does he remember once he said to Eduardo ""WE did it""?""You're not an asshole, Mark. You are just trying so hard to be.""At the end of movie, Mark refreshes the web page over and over again. In fact, he is hurt seriously, more than Eduardo, and more than Erica. Although he has got to 500 million friends with only a few enemies, the biggest enemy is himself ironically. You can say he is poor, you can sigh he is tragic. But after all, he asked for it, he does not even dare to imagine his girl will come back! Instead, he is enjoying her rejection from time to time, like... drugs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Network is an Instant Classic,"I can't remember the last time I attended a film that had me simultaneously entertained and engaged. After the movie TSN instantly became a hot topic for discussion at my house. The people I went with to see the movie were all across the board age group wise and everyone walked away with a different perspective and opinion. Sounds silly, but I hope they make a sequel 10 years from now as we continue to experience the effects of Facebook and become privy to the power play and players involved.

Text-speak as high drama,"If the idea of the creation of a social networking site for college students yielding the world's youngest billionaire feels surreal, then the notion of a box office smash hit about a young man creating a website should prove even more indicative of the disorientation of the self- appointed ""age of media"". Nonetheless, David Fincher's The Social Network is happy to hit the ground running, apparently thinking of itself as a current day All the President's Men (or, as Fincher calls it, ""the Citizen Kane of John Hughes movies"") through being a suspenseful, youth-oriented movie providing a 'commentary on its time'. That the film's overall tone is far more snappy, cynical and noncommittal is as telling of ""the times, a-changin'"", as it is poignantly hard to tell whether Fincher's film fails to make any grander statements about its era or youth culture, or, ironically, through skirting the issue it perfectly represents them.However, first and foremost, The Social Network functions as both drama and character study, detailing the now infamous story of 19 year old Mark Zuckerberg's spark of internet genius spiralling into a series of heated dramatic confrontations, lawsuits, explosions of stock and cementing a place in the cultural lexicon unlike any other, now known as the website/company/landmark Facebook. It is important to keep in mind that the film, while rooted in fact, is an unabashedly embellished and fictionalized telling predicated more on dramatic effect than factual realism (with some of the points of the story reeking more of obvious artifice than others – particularly the tragically ironic ending). However, if nothing else, there is no doubt that Fincher and screen writing Aaron Sorkin have created one of the more exciting films of college students speaking fervently over computers to hit cinemas in ages, as Sorkin's slickly polished script allows each line to crackle with the visceral immediacy of a fistfight.In fact, the film functions so well as an impeccably oiled machine that it largely vetoes its own concerns about bias within the story (whether or not Zuckerberg is 'to blame' for allegedly stealing the idea of Facebook from a commission from fellow Harvard students, ruthlessly cutting his own best friend out of his company, troubling preconceptions of private and public spaces and so forth), treating everything, characterization included, as if subjective, circumstantial evidence at a trial, up for individual interpretation and reprocessing. Sorkin leaves it nearly impossible to 'root' for anyone or anything in particular, as the narrative feels locked into a consistent feeling of wheels inextricably in motion, beyond all notions of emotional investment and simply intended to be appraised and marvelled at. One could raise the concern of the film being too emotionally closed and distant (particularly ironic for a film about a social network predicated on ""bringing people together""), were it not for the envisioned rebuttal, as if delivered in a rapid-fire, acerbic monotone by Jesse Eisenberg, that it simply has bigger fish to fry than satisfying trite, conventional emotional expectations. This is a film with a story to tell and a message about its times to convey (albeit in a somewhat muddled fashion), and, like a good piece of software, it refuses to compromise or slow down in the midst of accomplishing its core objectives.Even Fincher's visual aesthetic captures this sense of sleek efficiency, his crisp, clean cinematography drinking in a depiction of Harvard neither excessively romanticized or banking on stereotypes. Channeling the driven anxiety of his antihero protagonist, Fincher shoots conversations and programming sessions like nail- biting stakeouts and college parties as if alienating action sequences, keeping the pace brisk and the tone ominous throughout. If nothing else, it is refreshing to see a film set at a college which doesn't come across like a beer commercial montage (although it is clear which beer brand gave Fincher the most funding), thankfully concentrating more on the story and characterizations as self-contained rather than wallowing in attempting to deliver another banal treatise on ""this is what the point of college really is"".As characterizations go, it would be difficult to ask for a more grimly memorable one than Jesse Eisenberg's (undeniably artistic licence fuelled) take on Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Muting his natural neurotic charisma through a steely deadpan and constant, unmoving half-frown, Eisenberg proves scarily good not only at inhabiting the piercing, controlled mania of Zuckerberg but also turning him into an oddly sympathetic, Machiavellian antihero, just as easy to respect and even like as to despise – it is easy to picture business majors worldwide taking notes. In contrast, Andrew Garfield brings a far more familiar emotional centre to the film as Zuckerberg's eventually jilted friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin. With a casual, likable aura and welcome strains of humour (one of the best scenes of the film is Saverin's agonized confession at not knowing how to change his own Facebook relationship status), Garfield makes Saverin's fade out from the Facebook all the more upsetting, providing intriguing counterpoint to Zuckerberg's snappy success. Finally, in a gleefully self-reflexive piece of casting, Justin Timberlake oozes glamour and sleaze as the manipulative creator of free music downloading site Napster, not chewing scenery so much as salivating upon it and providing a deliciously detestable face to corporate ambition.While it may or may not have as much to say about the presence of technology in contemporary social relations, the blurring of the spheres of private and public and the tension between individual or collective success as it may or may not mean to, The Social Network provides an impressively assembled slice of fun and profundity, with all creative talents concerned functioning at the top of their games. Even (or perhaps especially) for those few still to be drawn in by the seductive allure of Facebook, Fincher's film still proves an intriguing and even exhilarating watch, and one of the best films of its year.'Like'.-8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Good movie, just overpraised","When I first saw the trailer to this in theater, I thought it was ridiculous and stupid. Like they are really running out of ideas, but to some degree it beat my expectation. I personally didn't think it was a masterpiece like some critics claim, but David Fincher did a very good job with what he had. The plot is basically about college students at each others throat for a idea a site that is worth billions. Now Jesse Eisenberg has been getting a lot of credit for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg and for the most part he did a pretty good job, but I didn't find it outstanding or anything like that. I mean he played his role very well but didn't think it was anything special or anything like that, his character just had one note. But besides that he did nail the character very well. Andrew Garfield did a really good job as well with his character and showed a lot of emotional depth. In fact the acting and dialogue of this movie is almost flawless. Now there maybe many viewers that may not enjoy this movie as much, I personally thought it was pretty good though, with the bickering, backstabbing, betrayal, and greed that lead to making facebook. And shockingly Justin Timberlake put on a great performance. Who knew that guy could actually act. But he was probably just playing himself. Just not a amazing awesome movie that some critics claim it to be, I mostly liked the visual style of it all. Again the best part about this movie is the performance and the sharp dialogue. And I know this movie is about how facebook came about, but it wouldn't have hurt to dove into the mind of Zuckerberg more and more development. The film just didn't grab my interest, it didn't really have a good start but got my attention a bit during the middle and started to lose it when it got near the end. This really isn't a bad film, it has good camera techniques to go with some of the positive aspect of the film I named. But the topic at hand just isn't interesting, and didn't feel all that compelling.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Facebook: the heart in a heartless world,"The great insight of David Fincher's brilliant The Social Network is that social inadequacy was the main driver of the Facebook juggernaut.The film kicks off in 2003 with the nerdy, OCDish Harvard student and future Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) meeting Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) for a date. After Zuckerburg fails to impress with his rat-a-tat-tat of facts and feelings - think The Simpsons' comic book guy mashed with Stephen Fry - Erica torpedoes him with one of the film's many memorable lines: 'You're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.'Facemash, via a couple of posh, handsome, Harvard twin brothers asking Zuckerberg to help them build a social-networking site for students, becomes Facebook - or TheFacebook, as it was originally known, before the founder of Napster, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), made his enormous contribution to the project. 'Drop the ""the""', he tells Mark. 'Makes it cleaner.' Initially a Harvard-based info-sharing site, Facebook, in Fincher's telling, is born directly from a student's need to hook up with people in some fashion, when so many of the traditional ways of doing so - meeting in bars, conversing face-to-face, joining clubs - are increasingly closed off to him. In this way, Fincher subtly yet profoundly captures what remains the lifeblood of the extraordinary Facebook phenomenon: not social inadequacy per se, but certainly social discombobulation.Written by Aaron Sorkin of West Wing fame and directed by Fincher of Seven fame, The Social Network focuses on the lawsuits filed against Zuckerberg in the mid- and late 2000s. With Facebook a household name and worth an estimated $25 billion (Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire ever), he was sued both by those posh twins, who claimed that he stole the idea from them after they asked him to construct a social-networking site, and by his best friend and the original funder of the Facebook project, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is ruthlessly ousted by Zuckerberg as he gets closer to Parker the Napster maestro.The Social Network taps into what has made Facebook so popular: the desire to carve out an identity, a life narrative, at a time when it seems increasingly hard to do that through real social relationships in the real world. 'People lived on farms and then in cities and now they will live on the internet', says Parker. He says it's no longer enough just to go to a party – you must 'go to a party with a digital camera and share the photos on Facebook'. Everything – from their job title to their interests, their relationship status to their religious beliefs, their social antics to their childrearing experiences – gets recorded and logged by the FB generation, as a kind of makeshift but also permanent personal narrative, which tells everyone who they are and what they believe.This is what is really significant about Facebook starting off as a university phenomenon before spreading to the rest of society. At uni, people's cultivation of a personal identity is necessarily a bit forced. Lacking the social cachet that goes with having a certain kind of job, living in a certain kind of neighbourhood, and moving in certain kinds of adult social circles, students instead physically sign up for societies or join clearly demarcated and often caricatured social networks (the Rugby Drinkers, the Political Club) to demonstrate who they think they are. Today, in the absence of the old solidarities and the old informal networks of community and shared interests – that is, at a time of great alienation – that experience of needing fairly self- consciously to magic up an identity is repeated across society. So a fundamentally student site now has half a billion members.Facebook is better understood, not as a country, but as a refugee camp for people who feel today's lack of identity-forging social experience. The scene in which Zuckerberg tries to befriend – or rather 'friend' – Erica on FB after their disastrous date and his pathetic apology, where he keeps hitting the F5 refresh button to see if she has accepted, is as painful a study of alienation as you are likely to see in the cinema this year. An intelligent, funny and humane exploration of society's new networks – if I were on Facebook, I'd definitely 'Like' this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Fincher Doing Facebook?  He Makes It Work,"Social Network, The (2010)**** (out of 4)Terrific look at Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the man who would become the youngest billionaire due to him coming up with the idea for Facebook. The film follows the creation of the website all the way up to the litigation's of two lawsuits from people claiming Zuckerberg either ripped off their idea or ripped them from money rightfully belonging to them. I'll admit that I'm not on Facebook and I knew very little of its ""history"" when going into the film. I'll also admit that I found it strange when I first heard someone like Fincher would be doing a movie about a website but after viewing THE SOCIAL NETWORK is becomes so clear why the director would be interested in the material: Zuckerberg is a terrific scumbag and one brilliant villain. Perhaps not knowing the story of the people involved helped but I believe even if you do know the story then you'll still be blown away by this movie simply because of how masterfully directed it is and how brilliant Fincher tells the story and gets his words across with such simple ease. The closing shots, which I won't ruin, say so much about the Zuckerberg and one could argue that these closing shots say more than anything leading up to the shots and I'm sure these shots are more damning than anything you could read in a two-thousand page biography. Fincher has the ability to jump back and forth from various aspects of the story but the main focus is on how the website came to be and how Zuckerberg had assistance from his best friend, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) who would eventually sue him. Seeing how brilliant their minds were would make some think that the story would lose you but instead the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin perfectly lays out everything that went into creating it and everything that could possibly cause it to crumble. When you think about it it's really hard to come up with an interesting movie about a computer programmer but Fincher pulls it off because he structures it like a thriller and one can't help but feel as if they're being pulled into a dirty game with the villain willing to cut throats for his own ego. Eisenberg is downright brilliant as the Facebook creator and what amazed me is that I'm fairly certain the actor really isn't as smart or brilliant as the man he's playing yet he's still able to pull it off. There wasn't a single frame in the film where I didn't believe he was this young genius but what impressed me most is how cold he could be with that stone face of his. Buster Keaton was considered the great stone face of his era but I'm sure he'd even be impressed with what Eisenberg could do with the way he'd simply look at another person. Garfield is perfect as the ""other"" guy and Justin Timberlake continues to impress. His performance as the seedy Sean is perfectly brought to life by the actor and no matter what you feel about his ""pop"" reputation you have to give him credit here. The music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seems like something you'd here in a horror film but it perfectly sets the mood and atmosphere here. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth perfectly puts you in the film and the editing is exceptional as well. THE SOCIAL NETWORK is winning a lot of awards and it's certainly easy to see why. I think the majority of people were scratching their heads when they heard Fincher was doing a movie on Facebook because it just seemed unfilmable and uninteresting. What he's done with the film is something extremely special and I'm sure many decades from now people will be looking at this film to see the time capsule, which was this social networking days.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Facebook Story Earns a Definite ""Like""","I'd heard of Facebook, of course. Who hasn't? But it wasn't until just about two years ago that some (college-age) friends of mine convinced me to set up my own page. To tell you the truth, I didn't think a whole lot about it. Innovations on the Internet are proceeding at such a rapid pace that I can't keep up with most of it let alone all of it, so the fact that Facebook existed really didn't make me think anything of it one way or another much less do any research into it. And then I saw The Social Network.Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is a brilliant Harvard undergraduate in 2003 with far more intelligence than he has social skills. After a brutal break-up with his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara), Zuckerberg opts for some very public revenge. He begins by posting some less than flattering blog entries about Erica and then, in an all-night flurry of programming, he sets up a Website that features photos of female Harvard students where each can be rated for ""hotness."" These actions not only wound Erica but garner the attention of the Winkelvoss twins (Armie Hammer, with Josh Pence as a body double upon whose face Hammer's likeness is digitally imposed) who have a Website idea of their own.Zuckerberg meets with the Winklevosses (or ""Winkle-vi"" as he amusing terms them) and their friend Divya Narenda (Max Minghella) to discuss doing programming work for them on an application they want to put together to enable girls to date Harvard guys. But Zuckerberg thinks he can do something both broader and better, and ""The Facebook"" is born. With assistance from his friends Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzell), his idea takes off in a major way even as the Winklevoss twins are still trying to get him to do something—anything!—for them.""The Facebook"" has such an impressive take-off that it gets the attention of Napster's mastermind, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). And once Parker and his marketing skills and ideas get involved, Zuckerberg never looks back even though his few friends are being left further and further behind him.The Social Network is based (obviously) on true events, though those involved with the movie have never pretended that parts and pieces aren't dramatized for the big screen (Zuckerberg insists that most of it is). Written by Aaron Sorkin (who was the driving force and writer behind one of what is, in my opinion, the best written television shows of all time, The West Wing), the dialogue is both witty and strangely natural when being voiced by the true computer nerds who are featured in the movie. Eisenberg says his rapid-fire lines so convincingly that I almost believe I was there when he loved, lost, and then won in a big way with his online creation.The other cast members prove they are also well up to the task of bringing these real life people to movie life. Though Eisenberg carries almost every scene on his shoulders, he couldn't be as good as he is without the very able efforts of the supporting cast. I'd also point out that the one genuine special effect in the movie—that of making Armie Hammer's face and voice an integral party to the body of Josh Pence—is flawless (and I was watching).BOTTOM LINE: The Social Network has already been touted as a potential Best Picture nominee come Oscar® time. I'm not entirely convinced that the movie as a whole is quite up to that standard, but I'd be truly stunned if the screenplay wasn't nominated, and I certainly wouldn't consider it undeserving if Eisenberg got a nod. I'm not always interested in recent American history (after all, I was there for some of it), but I also found the behind-the-scenes look at the invention of a phenomenon to be fascinating. And frankly, even if computer applications or online interactions aren't your thing, The Social Network remains a compelling exposé of what has become a huge influence on relationships in today's society. That it's entertaining, amusing, appalling, and heart-rending by turns is almost just icing on a very substantial cake.POLITICAL NOTES: There have been numerous privacy concerns related directly to Facebook. In fact, one of Zuckerberg's problems with his first ""hot"" ratings site (which he called Facemash) involved what school administrators termed a violation of the privacy of Harvard students. Facebook has addressed some of the issues, and continues to say it will correct or modify others. It remains to be seen, though, just how much privacy some people will willingly forgo in exchange for the complete experience of what has become very much a real life social network.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Social Network is rated PG13 for ""sexual content, drug and alcohol use and language."" There are moments within the film where parents of younger teens may find themselves having to explain things they'd rather not, or where they could feel obligated to comment on things so their children don't think those actions are quite as ""cool"" or acceptable as they appear on screen. The plot is also fast-moving, and scenes switch back and forth from several venues and viewpoints, which makes the storyline relatively complex, perhaps too much so for younger viewers. I'd recommend The Social Network for older teens (15 or 16 and up) and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Actors weren't very good but still, the movie is good.The history of one of the worlds biggest companies is very interesting to see and isn't boring at all. the movie shows how friends can make decisions, how they see what's right and what's wrong. there is friendship, argue, love and betrayal in just 2 hours which is filmed, directed and edited very well.For me, this was the best movie of the year. King's speech is quite a good movie but it can be watched once or twice, but social network, is the movie that never makes me fell tired of watching it. from a great book was made a great script and from that script, Fincher made a movie, which would be interesting, entertaining and good to see. the music in the movie is also very good. it fits with the movie so well that you're just getting pleasure both with watching and listening to it.The social network shows that money isn't the most important in life. it shows how a person get a lot of money and power, and at that time, lose friends and make more enemies.The movie is very good to see. if you've not seen this movie yet, don't miss it just because of the fancy actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

This leads to a long night of laptop use for Zuckerberg, and in this night, he creates ""Facemash"", a website that received somewhat 20,000 hits in 2 hours.It is then where Zuckerberg finds his talent and works on an idea that today is facebook. With his best friend Eduardo (a thrilling and empathic debut performance from newcomer Andrew Garfield) financing, Facebook is born.As the site becomes more popular and wealthy, and when Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake, don't judge him from his singing career, he's a good actor) joins the team the stakes become higher and betrayal, success and billions of dollars are what is to follow.Brilliant performances from Eisenberg, Garfield and Timberlake, David Fincher (The Curious case of Benjamin Button)'s masterfully simplistic direction and Aaron Sorkin (creator and screenwriter of TV's The West Wing)'s amazing screenplay make The Social Network truly a film for our times, relevant for many reasons, the biggest being Facebook is probably one of the top 10 words you would use to describe this decade.It seems that the end of the decade has brought the best films. Just this year we have been privileged with Inception, The ghost writer and this reviewed title just to name a few. I strongly suspect, no, I KNOW that The Social Network will be a huge contender at 2011's Academy Awards.Also, do not judge this film as garbage simply because it's about facebook. The central points are what wealth and fame can do to people and betrayal of friendship to achieve these goals.A very good drama.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A dialogue-driven movie,"This movie has been receiving unprecedented praise and this naturally leads one to ask 'is it worth it?'. Well, a reserved yes. Reserved because I can't say that it will become an influential film, it certainly may become a classic film, but besides from a sharper (read quick intelligence) dialogue it doesn't offer anything new or open up new directions for cinema - aspects I would consider for overwhelming praise. What the film does do, however, is bring together its cinematography, screenplay, music, acting and all other cinematic elements in such an intelligent and entertaining way that is rarely seen in Hollywood movies.To watch this movie you don't need to have facebook, in fact, you don't even have to care about it (of course these things will help as in-jokes and nods to teenage society are found throughout). This is not a movie for people with facebook, nor is it necessarily about it (at least in its effect on society), but rather it is about the creator/s. Basing it around the people involved means it becomes a film about 'real' relationships and not screen-to-screen ones. If Fincher decided to focus the film on the influence of facebook then it would have become a quasi-documentary. Instead it is a drama, with the screenplay echoing the rapid-fire dialogue seen in many plays (which isn't a surprise considering Sorkin is also a playwright). It certainly isn't natural speech but it didn't need to be. This isn't supposed to be a mirror of reality, it is too polished for that; instead it is a (loosely) true story represented as entertainment, and the witty dialogue is used to create the intellectual atmosphere of Harvard and its characters.Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg (the founder) does a great job as a person who has an idea and wants to create it himself. But for this he will have to rely on others. This is where Eduardo (played by Andrew Garfield) comes in with the money to finance it all. What Eduardo brings to the movie is what lifts it into the higher echelons of film: the delicacy and balance of human relationships. Without this it would be a nice movie, with a nice storyline that is nicely filmed. We get that from a lot of Hollywood productions (see Inception), but Sorkin and Fincher are able to add a depth and complication to the characters that ultimately drives the already interesting story. More than any other character, Eduardo is similar to us; he is down-to-earth, wants to make money and does not possess a freakish talent, and thus we can empathize with him. Zuckerberg is different from us, and this is what makes him a fascinating subject. We do not know what to make of him, and are left with the question posed throughout the movie: is he really an asshole?http://waitingforthrenos.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
He's More Fred C. Dobbs or Charlie Kane than Daniel LaRusso!,"Absolutely brilliant, and very hard to define. Is it a drama? A satire? A coming of age story?I went to Columbia University in the Reagan Eighties, and I hated every minute of it. This movie captures the environment perfectly -- spoiled rich kids, binge-drinking, callous administrators, self-impressed instructors, hatefulness and evil triumphing over ideals and hope. Man, I hated Columbia. And I loved this movie for explaining why.Yet at the same time I hated this movie, because it's so craven and so desperate to uphold the status quo. In terms of tone it's really not so much a modern KARATE KID as it is a mash-up of CITIZEN KANE and TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.Except that John Huston treats his bums with a lot more compassion than this movie treats its heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Flavour of the Year?,"I remember 17 years ago, I'm guessing, buying a film magazine (presumably Empire, here in the UK) that had an article entitled ""The 100 Greatest Films of All Time"" or some-such. Somewhere in the list was Interview With The Vampire and I remember thinking that it was only in the list because it was new and that if a similar list was drawn up at any year in the future then the film wouldn't appear. Sure enough, I've never seen it on such a list since, fine film though it is. It's very good, but one of the best 100 ever? I don't think so. Which brings me to TSN. It's a good film, possible a very good one, but one worthy of IMDb's Top 250? I don't think so. It's an interesting story with some interesting characters that tell the story of one of the major social developments of our time but it certainly isn't a Great film. Much of the acting is of a high standard, the direction is strong and the film certainly looks nice thanks to some inspired cinematography but I just didn't think it was as good as the IMDb rating led me to expect. I saw it last night; within a week of watching The Secret In Their Eyes. To me, unless you have a pathological hatred of subtitled movies there's no question at all as to which is the better film. One is good going on very good; the other is magnificent. Yet their scores on here are almost identical. But, we're all different. If you haven't seen TSN I'd recommend that you do so as it's a nice way to spend a couple of hours. If you go to see it expecting to have to re-write your own personal list of Greatest Films Of All Time then you might not need to do so after watching it. I'd be interested to see if the film's score drops over the years. My bet is that it will.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A fascinating take on the origins of Facebook,"The Social Network presents a fascinating take on the origins of Facebook and the social media craze.

Slick product of a cynical age,"Hollywood seem to have forgotten that to make an emotional investment in a film (and this is a long one, about 2 hours) we have to care about the characters and their story. Script writer Aaron Sorkin slickly moves his puppets about and has them say archly cynical things in his usual way but by the end the audience feels nothing but indifference.Really, Hollywood thinks we all want to see a bunch of privileged, entitled people screw around then screw each other and we're supposed to care? These shallow self-interested people may be typical of Hollywood (and obviously connect with the critics who were almost unanimous in their praise) but in the real world people are more concerned about paying their bills not worried whether ""entitled person A from Harvard"" sues ""entitled person B from Harvard"" for xx million dollars.Huge efforts have been made to make ""The Social Network"" as slick and self-consciously 'cool' as possible, so those suckered in the hype can delight themselves as to how smart they are getting it. The dialogue is sharp if unnatural (typically Sorkin) and delivered in rapid-fire fashion, sometimes (as in the opening scene) hard to follow (but the fans of this won't admit that, because that wouldn't make them smart enough); it is set in a subterranean darkness, much favoured by modern films (does nobody like daylight anymore?); it has a 'clever' (but dramatically distracting framing device; and a soundtrack designed more to sell CDs as to work on screen from the awful opening plinky plonky piano tune (representing what exactly?) to the loud inappropriate underpinning of the various scenes of drug taking or programming (the music makes no distinction between these activities).In the end, we feel this is a typical product of the post-modern age: slick, shallow, cynical, derivative, dark and disposable.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

It's not about Facebook; it's a story of ambition in a high stakes modern world,"You'd be hard-pressed to think of a film concept more socially relevant and relatable to 500 million people than a movie about the origins of Facebook. ""The Social Network,"" however is not some insouciant attempt to capitalize on the world's most popular social networking site for revenue purposes. It is a loaded drama that unlike most based-on-true stories, is a bit unforgiving of its ""protagonist"" (or anyone else for that matter) and unafraid to handle the unflattering side of human nature. Check the idea of this being a ""Facebook movie"" aside; this is the story of what can happen in today's age when an arguably stolen idea can be born at a frat party and turn into a $25-billion-dollar property in fewer than 10 years.We learn right away that our quick-tongued smart-allick main character, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), is ""special."" After the opening scene finds him dumped by his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) for obsessing over winning social approval from the elite Harvard clubs and insulting her in the process, he goes back to his dorm, pounds a few beers and writes a website code for evaluating the comparative hotness of Harvard girls using the his best friend Eduardo Saverin's (Andrew Garfield) algorithm and pictures he hacked off the women's clubs' sites. We're then overwhelmed with techno-babble in this early scene that one can't help but realize not just anybody could've created Facebook.Although we're certainly not asked to like Zuckerberg, we never find him so deplorable that the film becomes intolerable. The first of many contentious actions in the story involves Zuckerberg using the idea of Harvard boys Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss as the springboard for creating Facebook. With the excitement of watching Facebook unfurl also comes the web of deceit. The script doesn't give Eisenberg many redeeming moments to work with, but the humanity comes through just as much as the jerky characterization in his performance.It doesn't take very long to get hooked into ""The Social Network."" The pacing of David Fincher's film is exquisite; the scenes are meticulously calculated and never let up on drama or intrigue with the lone exception being an overextended rowing scene/analogy toward the end. But the highlight is certainly ""The West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin's script: sharp, intelligent, thought-provoking and seamlessly telling two narratives at once as the film jumps between the story of Facebook's creation and the ""present day"" civil suits filed by Eduardo and the Winklevosses, separately. Throw Trent Reznor's cool mood-generating electronic score underneath and you have one of the better produced films in a while. ""The Social Network"" certainly has a share of live horses in the Oscar race.Anchoring it all are these young, blossoming actors. Fincher has a reputation for bringing along remarkable talents (just look at what he did with Brad Pitt) and Eisenberg and Garfield might be two of the best in their generation. Eisenberg will shed the Michael Cera comparisons with this performance, but Garfield (future Spider-Man) really impresses. It's possibly because his character earns the most sympathy, but his confrontation scene with Mark is powerful. If the best actor categories weren't such gentleman's clubs, these two would certainly be there.The strength of ""The Social Network"" lies in the ability to show the flaws in every character and to make us realize that in the shoes of Mark and Eduardo, we would have made just as many mistakes. When Justin Timberlake's character Sean (creator of Napster) enters the picture and starts trying to sell the boys on becoming billionaires, we begin to see how unforgiving the business world can be. Mark might have done some questionable things, but he kept himself afloat. Eduardo might have been cautious and pragmatic, but he got lost in the shuffle.So ""The Social Network"" is not ""the film that defines our times."" It's not about social networking, but a story of ambition and dreaming big and the harsh realities of the business world. That's a timeless motif, not a modern one. Sure, there are plenty of nuggets for those ""fans of Facebook"" who will enjoy the moment when Mark realizes to put relationship status on the site or when the Facebook wall is referenced, but that merely dresses the film up as ""with the times."" If anything, it shows how we live in a world today where there's a value on intellectual property and it's a high stakes competition to turn ideas into tremendous revenue. So how can you fault these ""kids"" for the mistakes they made? It's a lot for anyone to handle. ""The Social Network"" helps us recognize that admitting fault and making amends after the fact is sometimes the best you can do.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

"""Like""","I saw this much-buzzed film in an advanced screening yesterday, and I must say it lives up to its hype. I was really doubtful how anyone could charge up a story about such sedate topics as computer and business, and create a generally engaging movie. However, watching ""The Social Network"" dispels those doubts.This movie shows us how the Facebook came to life. It seems that hell hath no fury like a computer geek scorned. From that one night when Mark Zuckerberg was rejected by Erica Albright, events were set into motion that led to the creation of an internet phenomenon. The subsequent events involving friendship, inspiration, back-stabbing, and double-cross that drives this story forward. It is said that the story was derived from court documents. Zuckerberg himself denies the story happened exactly that way. We will never really know how much of this is false testimony or dramatic license.The lead actor Jesse Eisenberg perfectly plays the flawed protagonist Mark, who was so self-absorbed that you'd hate him, yet still admire him for his talent and drive. Justin Timberlake plays Napster founder Sean Parker, who was instrumental to push Facebook into the big time. This character was written to be so annoying, and Justin succeeds to annoy. On the other side, Andrew Garfield sympathetically plays Edward Saverin, Mark's only friend and financier in Harvard, and alleged ""victim"" of Facebook's rise into the financial stratosphere. Comic relief was provided by the ""Winklevii"" twins, who turned out was just portrayed by only one actor, Armie Hammer. Good camera trickery there. Also, you will be surprised by what the foxy Brenda Song (ex-Disney's Wendy Wu) will do here.However, as a movie, ""The Social Network"" works. The script of Aaron Sorkin (best known for writing ""The West Wing"") is very rich and witty. The direction of acclaimed director David Fincher was sure and precise, following the tradition of his previous films like ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac."" Yes, this is a movie with a lot of talk, but the pace, cinematography, and editing were all on point. It was not boring at all, as the atmosphere is kept interesting and tense despite the techno-babble and legalese. If this movie were a Facebook page, I would click ""LIKE"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Genius is Double-Edged,"This film attempts to serve multiple purposes. It tells the story of the founding of Facebook, employing flashbacks within the context of subsequent lawsuits. It's a character study of a peculiar boy-genius and his associates, and it offers a sociological depiction of elite universities. Finally, it includes implicit commentary on the mindset of the ""Digital Generation."" Aaron Sorkin can write well. Some may say that real people don't talk with the rhythm and glibness of ""Sorkinesque"" characters. In his defense, his goal is to entertain first and foremost. However, it's not unrealistic to attribute great lines of dialogue in clever streams of consciousness, to brilliant youth.This movie employs many memorable lines, and makes us wish we could be half as witty in our daily interactions. There has been some criticism that some of the main characters exhibit an eerie coldness. I had no problem with that, given the fact that the ex-girlfriend, and the best friend, both show signs of warm humanity.While Jesse Eisenberg is no stranger to roles as the socially dysfunctional nerd, this role required a darker edge, and he pulled it off to perfection. Particularly ""driven"" people are more likely to achieve their dreams than the rest of us, and Eisenberg skillfully portray's Zuckerberg's driven nature. Congratulations also to the Director for his role in bringing that out in him.I particularly enjoyed the shots where the main character is trotting across campus with focused purpose. You actually hear the pitter-patter of his tiny footsteps to imply his drive.Don't overlook the power of loneliness to scale mountains or level buildings. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber of 1995, was a deeply frustrated individual. Much of that came from his awkwardness with women, and his inability to get a girlfriend.Apparently girls were at the root of Zuckerberg's drive. His ex referred to his project as a ""video game,"" while rejecting him. He immediately steps up his effort to expand, presumably to show off for her.At one point the Zuckerberg character remarks to his associates that meeting someone of the opposite sex is the motivating factor behind many or most of our decisions in college.His best friend gets positive recognition from an elite campus social club, and begins a relationship with an Asian girlfriend. Eisenberg does a wonderful job of portraying his character's brooding jealousy.There is no ""action,"" per say in this film, but it moves quickly. We do not see any back story involving the childhood of the characters. The father of twin students appears once, and the best friend refers to his dad once or twice, so it is not entirely one of those movies about kids that seemingly exist without parents. There is no reference to Zuckerberg's family.We do get a decent shot of San Francisco and feel the contrast between the East and West Coast settings, with the use of a swimming pool and a few shots of a suburban street. There is no actual sex, but we do see a couple of implied sexual encounters.What started as an arguably shallow social enterprise, evolved into a vehicle for families and friends to stay in touch, aritsts to promote their projects, businesses to share their latest concepts, and thinkers to discuss their ideas.Facebook itself can be used for good, for evil, for vacuous mediocrity, and for profane narcissism. Zuckerberg has the free will to use his genius for whatever legal means he wishes, and we have the free will to use Facebook for whatever legal means we wish.I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys quick, clever dialogue, likes technology, or identifies with underdogs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Solid Win For All Involved.,"Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend in the opening scene and in a drunken rage he goes online and hacks into different websites to take student photos and create a site called FaceMash, where people pick which girl is hotter. This leads to some academic probation, but it catches the eyes of three other students who want to create a social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students. They tell Zuckerberg the idea and he joins the team. Unfortunately Zuckerberg shuts them off from communication and writes his own codes and brings in his best friend as CFO. Thus The Facebook is born. As the site gets more popular, Zuckerberg loses his connection with his best friend and ends up getting sued by him and the three students for millions of dollars.When I first heard that there was going to be a movie based on Facebook, I rolled my eyes and asked why even bother. Then, to my surprise, I heard that David Fincher was set to direct. My interest perked up a little bit, after all the guy directs some stellar films. It wasn't until the trailers starting popping up did I really want to see this film. The accolades that it has been receiving added more anticipation. Now that I've seen the film, all I can say is bravo.Fincher and soon to be nominated for best adapted screenplay Aaron Sorkin, have created a film that defines what this generation is all about. Facebook is such a cultural impact that some people can't live their lives without it. I have it open in another window as I'm writing this review right now. The film will undoubtedly receive more award nominations than screenplay, I'm just curious to see if any of those are in the acting department because this cast is great.Jesse Eisenberg, who people always claimed to be a Michael Cera rip off, commands the screen with his awkward and pseudo intelligent riffs in his speeding bullet laced monologues. The guy (Zuckerberg) is brilliant at code writing, but his social skills are clearly lacking. His best friend, Eduardo Saverin (soon to be Spiderman Andrew Garfield) is desperate to get into elite clubs and has his emotions close to the surface. Eventually they explode when he learns he's being shifted out of his CFO position. Garfield plays well opposite Eisenberg. To my surprise Justin Timberlake wasn't irritating. He plays egocentric Sean Parker and while I don't see any awards heading his way, he does help complete a well put together cast.The story jumps between two timelines. The present, in which Zuckerberg is facing two lawsuits and the past, which we see the creation of facebook. Heaps of praise should be thrown on Fincher and Sorkin, they pulled off this structure perfectly. The film feels just like his previous efforts, dark and cold. Much like the depiction of Zuckerberg. I can't comment on how true the film depicts the events, but we all know he did get sued and the filmmakers stand by the truths they tell in this film. It's all heightened to be entertaining, but with Zuckerberg trying to steer clear, I see a lot of truth in this film.The Social Network is one of the years best films. It's solid direction from Fincher, who knows what he wants from every aspect. Sorkin delivers a timeless story set in our age of the internet and facebook. Friendship, greed and loyalty are all called into question. The performance are strong across the board with such a young cast. Eisenberg standing out in the lead role of Zuckerberg. The score is phenomenal, Fincher knew what he wanted and he got it with Trent Reznor. His style of music perfectly matches the film with the technology it's bringing to the forefront.I wouldn't call this the film of the decade, but it is good enough to be in the high ranks of Fincher's best work and one of the best works this year. For a film that is simply people talking, it feels natural and goes at a breakneck speed. I highly recommend The Social Network.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I think this movie would be a lot funnier if Michael Cera played Mark Zuckerberg,"In all seriousness, this movie was very good. It takes an interesting perspective on what is required of someone to be massively successful. I liked Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg, although I can't see it being completely accurate as I feel they dramatized how mean Zuckerberg was in this movie. There wasn't a whole lot of passionate acting from Eisenberg but that was really because his role didn't require it. It seems like the director wanted Zuckerberg's character to be almost emotionless and completely driven by success which Eisenberg did quite well. Andrew Garfield's acting was kind of weak at the beginning but somewhere in the middle of the movie something flipped and Garfield started to really act. I don't know if this was an accident or if it was intentional but it almost seemed like the more Eduardo Saverin was ripped off by Zuckerberg, the better Garfield's acting got. Justin Timperlake did a great job as the mildly annoying and cocky Sean Parker because Justin Timberlake is mildly annoying and cocky so that worked out perfectly. The plot was great, although I did wish that it deviated a little from focusing on the lawsuits that were filed against Zuckerberg and pointed more at the effect that Facebook has had on the world and how social interactions have changed because of social media. Also, I thought it was funny that the movie continued to include the Winklevosses. They didn't really have much of an effect on the plot of the movie other than the initial idea of the social network but they did create an interesting side plot I guess. Overall, I almost feel like this movie gives a message that if you want to be successful, you are going to make some enemies. Although Zuckerberg did make a lot of people mad with his selfish drive to make the next ""big thing,"" it was also that drive that made him successful in the first place. It's almost depressing how some of the smartest and most successful people on earth are some of the biggest jerks. Either way, this movie was very interesting and definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Did I adequately answer your condescending question?,"David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin form a cinematic union to tell the story about the founders of the social-networking website, Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is an eccentric and brilliant Harvard undergrad who intellectually and fundamentally creates the social-networking site we all know and love, Facebook. ""The Social Network"" is a dramatization of the creation of Facebook, but also the civil case(s) Zuckerberg went through to create the one of the biggest sites in the world that is worth billions of dollars and is used by over 500 million people across the world. But to make 500 million friends, Zuckerberg had to make a few enemies. ""The Social Network"" is an absorbing film that makes you question yourself, 'What is Facebook?' It's a philosophical question that essentially bridges the gap (More like chasm) between the sides of baby-boomers, and the sides of Gen X and Y'ers, and stimulates meaningful discussions about viewpoints, ideas, and values. This is a very talky film, but thankfully the dialogue is excellent, and Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War) pens an exceptional screenplay that will likely get an Oscar nomination (And perhaps even a win). Besides a fantastic script, the film is beautifully directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en), who paces a talky, 2-hour film while keeping the audience more than just entertained. He also directs a fine cast; all members of the cast give their best performances to date. Jesse Eisenberg especially gives an astonishingly sophisticated performance of calculated detachment. Every movement he makes is a stimulating one, he makes you laugh and happy, and at times makes you hate him and question his morals. The rest of the cast is solid as well, particularly Andrew Garfield, who is a star in the making, as well as Justin Timberlake, who proved that his breakout performance in 2007's ""Alpha Dog"" was not a one-time thing; He can definitely act. A lot of people were not sure what to expect of ""The Social Network."" It really doesn't matter whether you love or hate Facebook, or even have one. Cinematically, it is a great film. It is a ballsy and risky first effort by Fincher and Sorkin, which turns out to be rather brilliant and controversial (Many people are wondering how factually accurate the film is). The Social Network reminds me of the ""Rise and Fall"" narrative of the gangster film narrative, with Networking being the subject of the rise and fall. More directly, the film is a lot like ""Citizen Kane,"" with our protagonist (who infuriates us and pleases us at the same time) reaches the heights of the communications empire. This film isn't for everyone. It requires thought, and I foresee some people being bored by it (Mainly the average ADD movie-goer who isn't entertained unless they see an explosion or hear a one-liner every three minutes); It's flashy, entertaining, funny and interesting. Unlike Facebook itself, ""The Social Network"" has little to no flaws, and is well worth ""friending.""Rating: 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Heck, even if Zuckerberg IS the bad guy, you are able to forgive him for that. My one and only regret: that the music from the trailer was not played at the beginning or end of the movie.

A Class Above,"Subtly and slyly David Fincher turns to address head-on a theme which has only been tangentially hinted at in his previous movies - the American social and power elite. Fincher turns his attention to a depiction of the intellectual and social elites that attend such schools as Phillips Exeter and move onto attend Ivy League universities such as Harvard where the action takes place. Seemingly a story about the founding of a website this movie is also a blackly comic look at the most privileged section of US society during their formative student years before they go onto enter politics and business at the highest level. It is an excellent depiction of the Facebook creation myth in that it is very funny and quite gripping - and it takes skill to make a story such as this either funny or gripping. Hats off to those involved in making this movie - it is an entertaining treat.Here we encounter the angst-ridden but aggressively acerbic IT genius Mark Zuckerberg who founded Facebook and his clashes with friends and rivals who wish to claim the invention of Facebook as their own. Fincher and Sorkin portray Zuckerberg as an outsider-insurgent motivated by resentment at exclusion from a ""hierarchy within a hierarchy"" represented by exclusive fraternal societies at Harvard such as the Phenix Club. Compliments must go to Aaron Sorkin, the scriptwriter, along with Fincher for this absorbing, and sometimes outright hilarious, portrayal of competing ambitions in the intellectual dog eat dog hot-house of Harvard.Here students are portrayed as already self-consciously worrying about what mark they will make on society before even graduating let alone accepting their first seat on the board of a Fortune 500 company. Armand Hammer (his own casting a worthy joke in itself) steals the movie in the role of the Winklevoss twins who claimed they were owed a slice of ""The Facebook"" equity - but he has stiff competition from none other than Justin Timberlake who gives a powerful and smart (in its restraint) performance as Sean Parker of Napster fame.Fincher's interest in the entrenched, dynastic social networks of wealth and privilege which rule America - despite one of the culture's strongest myths being that it is a ""classless society"" - could be glimpsed tangentially in previous movies. The representations of institutional politics,big business and the legal system in Seven and The Game were not centre stage although the placing of Jodie Foster's character in Panic Room among the social elite of Manhattan was a clearer marker of where Fincher's real interest might lie.In these cynical and ""post-political"" times it might be thought redundant - or even ludicrous - to describe this movie as subversive or to even think that subversion was Sorkin and Fincher's aim. The movie merely portrays in a scathingly funny way a part of the American social fabric which is normally either invisible to most people or whose very existence is denied - the American aristocracy. A great movie. Fincher's last movie Benjamin Button was an adaptation of an F Scott Fitzgerald short story and the influence of Fitzgerald is all over this movie too. Mark Zuckerberg as a Gatsby for the 21st Century? The biggest joke of all of course is the alleged valuation of Facebook - but that is a different movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Polishing of the Talent,"Do you think that Social Network main character Mark Zukerberg is a real asshole?To call the person who created the ""greatest fun ever"" an asshole would mean that all its users are literally f..d up. Basically in the cinematic reality created by David Fincher we could find the number of eternal messages, which are wrapped in a beautifully shot movie. Social Network makes us laugh, hate and disguise. But over all we receive the old messages about what stay behind the greatest inventions. Fincher doesn't stop to look back, when 10 years ago he acclaimed his greatest success. Nevertheless no one would punch someone on face these days; it is easier to write an asshole on a Wall to relieve anger.The story line is based on the origins of the creation the Social Network called Facebook. Young Mark Zukerberg pushed the idea of his fellow students so far, that it turns into the billions dollars worse on-line project. The web-site which managed to gather more than 100 million users and not going to stop its extension. Coming up from the film title ""Social Network"", it doesn't tell us about Facebook, no it's about what stays behind every great achievement. Without reliving the details of the plot we come through the certain judgment of what the main Character Mark Zukerberg did. Was it right or wrong? Is he a real jerk or he'd done what has to be done?For somehow Fincher is afraid to ask what is Facebook? In a certain way he laughs from the ""blondes"" who get hysterical about the relationship status of their boyfriends. Nevertheless, he's not pointing finger that such ""a great thing"" Facebook, a magical feature, is mostly pointless in the hands of its users and they are just a bunch of the space monkeys who don't know what to do with themselves.The great things are always based on ugly and miserable thoughts, like selfish revenge or youngster's teenage jealousy. We are all the sources of our own miseries. However, unconsciously during watching the Social Network I want to come back to the Fight Club.Project Mayhem was created to free the human beings. But it is unreal and can survive only on the screen. Facebook is real, but does it have any purpose? Yes, in real life we can acclaim how it connected us, make closer to each other. However, excuse me, we've got internet for this. There was no conflict between Mark and his Creation. Fight Club leads us to the X-point of the screen reality. Tyler was doing his thing, considering it was totally crazy, to change the reality. Mark even doesn't care much about his creation, he's proud of it, but in the end of the day it leads him to another point of emptiness. Mark and his Social Network – the relationship which was missed by Fincher. Facebook is acclaimed as a tool, just a cool thing, like a party, an awesome one, the party which will never end; Fight Club was the reflection of ugly truth, a disease which is spread in a human society. But its fictional, Facebook is real.David Fincher polished and improved his director's skills during the decade; the tension which movie brings is tremendous. The disappointment comes when it gets clear that we have seen it before, 10 years ago, when it was wrapped in a broken collarbones and pints of blood. Today it is modest, nice and clean, wrapped in blue paper with a white ribbon.Thumbs up, when comments are not necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Does ""The Social Network"" Define an Entire Generation?","Early reviews of The Social Network claimed that the film based upon the book, The Accidental Billionaires, about the sordid history of Facebook defined an entire generation. When one gets passed all of the hyperbolic praise and adulation I would say that The Social Network is indeed a very well made film. It does indeed sum up the 00's in a way that no other film has done so far. And much like previous films about generational conflicts, The Social Network takes a snapshot of how young people socially interact with one another in the new millennium. Still, many people have accused the film of doing a hatchet job on Facebook's CEO and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, but I would argue that this film does no such thing. Instead this is a film where Zuckerberg is portrayed as a rather ruthless character with the drive to take Facebook as far as it could possibly go. No one else in the cast, despite their accusations of being ripped off by Zuckerberg, had this driving force behind them. Simply put, if you would have invented Facebook, then you would have invented it. It isn't original ideas that have made Zuckerberg a multi-billionaire, but being in the right place at the right time, riding the ascending cultural wave of a major fad.It is this ""moral ambiguity"" that makes The Social Network a compelling movie. The characters live in a dog eat dog world. Certain individuals are propelled to the forefront, but that success doesn't come without any sacrifice. Friendships deteriorate, grudges are formed, lawsuits are filed, and the very legitimacy of Facebook itself is questioned. In the end, I would have to say that this is one of the year's best films and definitely deserving of an Oscar nod.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Nutshell Review: The Social Network,"Who would have guessed that the next big thing that took the Internet, and the real world, by storm, would be the application that crafts our social network digitally for the online world to see. There's hardly a time I encounter anyone without a Facebook page, or are not actively updating it, unless of course you're stuck in a country that has barred access to it. It's a simple but brilliant idea translated which made the founders billions of dollars and propelling them into the elite club of the superrich, and David Fincher's The Social Network maps a dramatization of how the world's social network got created from the dorm rooms in Harvard University.Based on the book by Ben Mezrich, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay doesn't bog us down with a mountain of details, choosing instead to focus on the sexier parts which kept the narrative moving at breakneck speed, beginning with the introduction of the socially inept Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) on a disastrous date – the irony of course that he'll be chief architect and co-founder of a social networking site – before heading back to his dorm room in a fit of anger and creating a site that melts the university's network while drunk, and gaining notoriety overnight. With the writing on the wall, Fincher paces this film with such velocity that you'll hardly ever realize that two hours had passed when we reach the obligatory closure titles that pepper a biography.As with almost every biographical film it comes with a tinge of drama to spice things up, so it's obviously not wise to take this film like the bible word for word, but it does provide an excellent study into the nature of human friendships and business relationships, and how the two often come dangerously close to a collision that will make friends and/or partners fall out of favour with one another, especially since it is fairly easy to surmise that everyone has an opinion of how a company should be run in a post dot-com bubble burst – whether risks are to be taken in a giant leap of faith, or to go down the more traditional route of monetizing a site through ad revenue.Fincher adopts a non-linear narrative for The Social Network, and you'll be forgiven if you find yourself a little bit disorientated in the beginning, since he throws you into the middle of not one but two lawsuits, one between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss brothers Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer) who are adamant that the technology whizz had stolen their idea when they pitched it to him in the confines of their exclusive club, while the other is between once best friends and roommates Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield, the new Peter Parker/Spiderman) in a relationship and friendship that had gone sour and communications between the two conducted with lawyers as intermediaries. But you'll find your balance soon enough as both narrative threads are equally compelling and engaging to sit through, and you'll begin to see the plenty of issues and challenges that always automatically come along when something or someone becomes successful, otherwise who would bother at all?As if that is not engaging enough, the introduction of Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) spices things a lot more, as he seduces Mark easily since they talk on a technological level, leaving Eduardo a lot more cautious because of Sean's shady background with drugs and his womanizing ways. But of course if someone brings funding and expertise and know-how for having been there and done that, as well as experience in navigating the tough business waters, then perhaps Sean's deemed as the necessary evil to bring Facebook forward, having to contribute to workable, iconic ideas even, off the cuff.While Jesse Eisenberg is spot on in his portrayal of a highly intelligent geek with a problematic EQ and as someone who doesn't mince his words, and Andrew Garfield being quite suave as the business economics undergraduate who cannot believe their collective success that skyrockets their popularity and a groupie following, it is Justin Timberlake (who would have thought) as the relatively sleazy Sean Parker who steals the show with his anecdotes, having some of the best lines in the show and being the quasi-villain that the story lacked in the driving of a wedge between two best friends in the dogged quest to have something to do with what he sees as potentially the next big thing in the world. As he will attest to, great ideas somehow have their connections stem back from the female of the species, and here there's no lack of that reference, and truly the film comes alive with the Mark-Eduardo-Sean axis of characters coming together that has trust issues, business and personal friendships all put on the line.One thing about David Fincher's filmography thus far is his aptitude to tell stories that are dark in nature, epic and biographical. The Social Network has all these rolled into one, with a story about one of the world's most popular website, and the ugliness of how a business relationship can sour genuine friendship into nothing more than a bitter aftertaste. It doesn't pass judgement on its characters, but allows you to form your own conclusions. Definitely one of the best and engaging films of the year, perhaps also because it's something easy to identify with, and based upon a pop cultural tool that's still, I believe, yet to achieve its peak. A must watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""The Social Network"" just might be the best film of 2010!","""The Social Network"" tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), who at this point is known to the world as the guy who invented (or stole based on who you talk to) Facebook. ""The Social Network"" is an interesting take on the story as it doesn't really give any concrete evidence of whether or not Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook or had the idea all along and just needed the push from the Winklevoss's to get it going. The movie not only focuses on Zuckerberg but also on the sites co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and Napster creator Sean Parker played by Justin Timberlake. This movie while it doesn't feature any amazing special effects or any breathtaking animation, it does feature the best acting I have seen in a film all year, not to mention probably the only film that has a more interesting story than ""Inception.""Despite what people have been saying about 2010 being a bad year for movies, I have to disagree. I have given four films a solid 9 rating, with ""The Social Network"" being the highest 9 of the bunch. The story alone of Mark Zuckerberg is fascinating but there is just something about David Fincher's vision of this story that made this movie something out of the ordinary. Maybe its the pure fact that Fincher decided to hire a cast of mainly unknowns to the mainstream film world to star in the movie. I knew most of the actors before seeing the film but than again I am a film buff, who loves independent film making. Fincher made a bold move casting unknown leads to play in a film about Facebook because this could have caused the film to flop but not with Fincher. He not only knows how to direct films but market them as well.The cast as I mentioned above is superb! Jesse Eisenberg may actually earn his first Oscar for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg. The role seemed to be tailor made for him. He seemed sincere and really fit the original Mark Zuckerberg's shoes. Even the outfits he wore in the film were similar to those that the real Zuckerberg has wore. I always been a fan of Eisenberg and always labeled him as an underrated and under appreciated actor. He has had several solid roles before this film including ""Adventureland,"" ""Squid and the Whale,"" and ""Zombieland"" but ""Social Network"" will mark the film to put him on the map. He hopefully will be featured in more roles now!As for the other lead roles, Andrew Garfield, who is set to be the new Spider-Man, was terrific as Eduardo Saverin. He was emotionally charged and just perfect in the role. Timberlake, was everything you expected him to be. He played the smooth talking and ultra cool Sean Parker like a pro! Its odd to see a film feature so many actors who seem so perfect for their roles. I also have to give Rooney Mara a little bit of credit here. While Mara wasn't in the film for very long, she definitely makes a mark in this film. Having met Mara in real life and seeing some of her other work, I was wondering when she was going to be put in a film that would exhibit her talent. ""The Social Network"" doesn't really feature much of Mara but gives her a chance to prove she deserves better than ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Tanner Hall.""I must give some credit to Aaron Sorkin, who was the writer on the film. Now remember folks, this movie was based on a true story but also based on a book by Ben Mezrich. Sorkin proves that he is not only a great writer but great at adapting a book to film. Books to movie translations don't normally spell Oscar but in this case it does. Sorkin's script was powerful, interesting, funny, and thought provoking. Fincher and Sorkin is a match made in heaven for the film world.In the end, ""The Social Network"" is hands down the best film of the year so far. I definitely predict this film getting a lot of Oscar Buzz and being one of those films that will get a lot of nominations. The film is a near perfect masterpiece. It is brilliantly acted and the story is fascinating. When you add Sorkin's witty sense of humor in with the amazing story and Fincher's vision and eye for excellent casting, I don't think you could ask for a much better film. ""The Social Network"" is the must see film of the year and should be seen by everyone. This is probably one of those rare films that people from the ages of 15 to 85 could really appreciate.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Social Network"" is a high 9 out of 10. This is definitely the years must see film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Mark Zuckerberg and the story of Facebook...,"""The Social Network"" is a movie which shows us the true story of Mark Zuckerberg who is now a well known person because of his creation, the Facebook. It shows us also all the story between him and two brothers who sued him because they claimed that he stole their idea. Another thing that this movie shows us is that Mark Zuckerberg squeezed out of the business his best friend and co-founder of Facebook.I liked this movie because is based on a true story facts and because of the direction of David Fincher which I think that it was just magnificent. I also liked the interpretations of Jesse Eisenberg's who plays as Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield's who plays as Eduardo Saverin the co-founder of Mark Zuckerberg and Rooney Mara's who plays as Erica Albright and is simply beautiful.Finally I have to say that ""The Social Network"" is a really nice movie which I believe that everyone have to watch it because it shows us many things that all of us must watch and think about them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Script works wonders with Fincher's awesome direction.,"David Fincher has yet to direct a bad film as none of them had ever been badly directed. The Social Network is never boring in many ways-- with an amazing script from Aaron Sorkin, an alluring soundtrack/score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, a convincing story with great depth, outstanding performances from Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg -- everything is paced out well, that makes every scene interesting. Even when a scene is supposed to be serious, there are lines of dialogue that gives way for humor that makes the film stick out until the very end.The cuts are perfect that just works great and won't leave its audience bored. Perhaps, it's one of the biopic films ever made that I can re-watch all over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Austin Layne likes this,"""A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion dollars."" Sean Parker's statement sets a mood for the battleground that is the Social Network. A film that depicts the bitter battle between the simultaneously brilliant and conceded Mark Zuckerberg, and practically everyone else who was involved with the invention of Facebook. But not only does the statement give a summation of the movie's core, it gives a summation of capitalist U.S. culture, as does the rest of the movie. Think about it as you watch; the alcohol swilling Harvard rich kids are eerily familiar to the Wall Street royalty who really rule this country. Is the destruction of Mark Zuckeberg's relationship with his best friend do to a business venture and greediness meant to parallel the collapse of the economy due to the continuous push of businessman for more money? I think so.But that is another essay. Let us now speak of the other fantastic aspects of this film: Jesse Eisenberg and Justin Timberlake without a doubt give the best performances of the movie. I would like to shed special light on Jesse Eisenberg who plays a character that is much more than the nice guy geek he usually portrays. Here he plays a man who is drenched in his own configuration of loneliness, alienation, despair, and pessimism, a man who suffers from an over-inflated ego, who despite being brilliant cannot advance past the point of a computer screen. The character of Mark Zuckerberg is much darker than the role Jesse Eisenberg took on in The Squid and the Whale, who was almost as irredeemable, but eventually proves to be likable. The Mark Zuckerberg within The Social Network is entirely irredeemable, unlikable, but Jesse Eisenberg's amazing talent saves him from being unwatchable, and he can at times even be charming.Justin Timberlake gives perhaps the best performance of his acting career, playing Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster who sleazily snuck onto the Facebook bandwagon, in every scene whispering things into the ear of Mark Zuckerberg, almost in an allusion to the Serpent of Genesis, causing the change in Adam and Eve that caused their fall from grace. This all could've been overly obvious, but the charm Justin Timberlake infuses the character with makes it very subtle, and much more ambiguous as to whether it's even there or not.All in all, I believe The Social Network to be the satire of the decade, a title I previously rewarded to There Will Be Blood. The only difference for me is that at time There Will Be Blood can be unwatchable or hard to watch for some people, and seem like five hours instead of two and a half. The Social Network is infinitely watchable and entertaining, something that There Will Be Blood just isn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Great Movie but even better screenplay,"The real star of this film is the extraordinary screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin. The characters he creates here are dark, flawed, and the epitome of the worst of the 2000s culture that the target audience of the film sprang from. Fincher does a fabulous job of interpreting this and bringing it to life on the screen. His visual of the script is bold and vibrant, exactly what was called for by the script.The problem with this film is that the performances aren't really that spectacular. They are good enough to carry the film but that's the best I can say for them. Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins was probably the weakest link of the bunch. He hammed it up big time and turned them into caricatures. I still haven't figured out why Jesse Eisenberg's performance was so applauded. The performance at times was two dimensional.All in all this is a great film. Fincher has done better with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons"" but this was arguably one of the better films of the years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Lullaby of nerdland,"I wasn't all that impressed with ""The Social Network."" I didn't buy the whip-smart dialog and the rapid-fire conversations. I thought the script was way too showy, and too clever by half. I've heard Mark Zuckerberg speak. He's not that articulate and he is definitely not that spontaneous. I also tend to believe that his characterization, while unflattering, was very likely not unflattering enough.More incredulously, the movie portrayed him and those around him as cool geniuses, untouchable by us mere mortals. Indeed, it presented the high-tech milieu as if it was an endless array of wild parties and ecstasy-fueled dance raves. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think you would get a more accurate depiction of Silicon Valley life from watching ""The Revenge of the Nerds,"" for what it's worth.Some high marks for the score and the cinematography are in order, and the pacing and direction are competent enough. It will be interesting to see what happens to this movie, once the level of interest in Facebook subsides, and the next big thing in cyberspace comes along. My sense is that it will be seen as nothing more than a dated artifact whose once great significance will seem quite mysterious to future audiences.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
West Wing: Student Edition,"I knew I wasn't going to like this movie. It's about some snotty, elitist, privileged kids at Harvard who don't have to work at Pizza Hut to get through school so they have plenty of time to enjoy their lives and join social clubs that will ultimately populate the West Wing. No worries about health care here.But, curiosity got the better of me, and I finally broke down largely because of David Fincher whose storytelling abilities i admire, his films being favorites--Seven, Benjamin Button, Zodiac. Facebook does not quite fit the list. Although I hated the movie, largely because of its a-hole protagonist--I admired the filmmaking--the cinematography, musical score, and narrative flow were sublime.I hated the West Wing cadence of the dialogue and wonder if the actors had to be trained to talk that way. The only writer & filmmaker who can do that superbly in my view is David Mamet. Here--really, all the West Wing cast kept swimming before my eyes.The other problem with this movie for me--nobody likes an a-hole kid protagonist. The guy lied and stole ideas from friends and acquaintances--the American way. No wonder Goldman Sachs put so much of its blood money into the company.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Money Never Buys Happiness,"This movie begins with future billionaire Mark Zuckerberg talking to Erica Albright, a (ficticious) Boston University undergrad who Zuckerberg was currently dating. After insulting her education (he was a Harvard undergraduate) among other things, she calls him an asshole, breaks up with him and leaves. Erica ultimately played a huge part in the story.Led by a fury of fast talking dialogue and witty pacing, there is not much to dislike about ""The Social Network"". The actors are fine suited in their parts, with Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, founder of the ""social network"" Facebook, Andrew Garcia as Eduardo Saverin and Justin Timberlake as the scandalous Sean Parker. The film mostly takes place from fall 2003 to the reaching of 1 million Facebook users, switching between then to a lawsuit in 2007 against Zuckerberg.The ending is a partially sad one, due to him losing his best (and only) friend. To me, that is what it means about money not buying happiness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Just a speeding ticket.,"Rarely does a film come along that poses important issues and ideas about what it means to live as a human being. Even more rare is a film that truly gets to the issues at hand; what is happening to us right now in these modern times. The Social Network is such a rare film.Everyone with a computer knows about Facebook. In less than five years, it has gone on to become the latest and most fashionable way to keep in touch with people you either know, don't know or would secretly like to know. It is the ultimate source of knowledge about people; whoever doing whatever whenever. Because this is such a permeating idea, the decision to release the film only six years after the website was launched is indeed brilliant. Then again, so is the film itself.With a film based on computer programming and website building, in order for the vast majority of people to be drawn in, the screenplay must be exceptional. Aaron Sorkin's is such. Each and every character has that unique brand of speaking he has used in dozens of scripts: the dialogue is suave and intelligent, the delivery is snide and sarcastic. There is so much talking crammed into this two hour film that most people will be amazed they sat through a film like so. Yet, with the acting and directing, this is hardly a chore.In the acting department, all are sublime and elegant in their respective performances. From Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins to Andrew Garfield as co-founder Eduardo Saverin, not one actor misses a beat or step. Everyone is remarkably on track in keeping within the confines of the story. Of course, the characters with the most face time are the ones everyone will remember and everyone needs to remember Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg come Oscar time. Both are magnificent in their respectful performances, portraying two men of opposite personalities but similar goals.However, David Fincher must be given most of the credit for the sheer intensity and brilliance of the overall structure and experience of this film. In the end, it doesn't matter what actually happened or what is accurate. Being a fictionalized interpretation of the facts, Fincher creates with his slick editing, low-lit scenery and smooth camera-work an intelligent and marvelously well-sculpted piece of filmmaking that will be remembered for a very long time.The final issue that must be addressed is the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook and the youngest billionaire in the world. Some, including Mark, think it's a bit harsh on him, seeing him as a totalitarian and ruthless businessman with no heart or sentiment. I would argue that it actually is very sympathetic to the Zuckerberg character and the real villain of this story is Sean Parker, who lured Zuckerberg away from his friends and supporters with the sensational dreams of changing the world. He's already done that and there's no telling what Facebook will turn into next. Of course, we'll all know about it. Just check your Facebook.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

The Social Network - it's Oscar Time!,I folks. Saw the Social Network a little while back and so far I'm with all of the experts who think that it is a shoe in for the Oscar.Great movie that speaks to people of all ages given the rise of the internet and the social interaction on it.To take a guy who was in my view virtually unknown and throw him into the role of the youngest self made Billionaire was a great coupe.He was Zuckerberg based on all of the information that we have about him.It also showed an intense business side to how quickly you can lose potential life long friends by being in business with them.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
From bedroom to boardroom,"Steve Jobs didn't invent the graphical user interface. But he did produce the first implementation of one in which enough of the details were right for it to be popular. And Bill Gates (who makes a cameo appearance in this film) did not necessarily produce the world's best computer operating system. But his system became the first standard, and the advantages of using a standard system meant that once Microsoft was big, it was destined to become huge. Both of these factors (technical refinement and network effects) help explain the story of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. And while it's interesting to observe the fine lines that makes one person a billionaire whereas another goes bankrupt, it also perhaps tells us that the detailed biographies of those who happen to end up on top are maybe not that interesting or important. One might make an exception for Jobs who showed an uncanny knack throughout his career for shaping sector-defining products. But is Zuckerberg, whose social networking software happened to win out over the competition, really worth the attention? This movie, describing the story of Facebook's foundation, is perhaps most interesting because its participants, most of whom are presented badly here, are still alive (and indeed, young): I don't quite know how the script was steered around the lawyers, or how true it is. It's certainly quite fun to watch a tale of almost-schoolboy capitalists, hopelessly out of their depth when their business venture turns out to be worth billions (although this part of the story would probably work as well without the crazy numbers); and when the concept is so nebulous, the business so fluid, it's easy to understand the lawsuits which led to many people claiming that they really owned the company: in some senses, the business made itself. What does grate is the sense of self-assurance, and self-entitlement shown by the class of Harvard, all of whom are depicted as both arrogant and brilliant, when their most obvious merits are merely their own well-connectedness. Again, this may be true to life, but you won't find any socialistic moralising here. Instead, there's a snappy (though glib) script and a surprisingly breathless journey from the bedroom to the boardroom. It's a fun film if you like this sort of thing, but less insightful than it thinks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Cold And Soulless,"It took about a minute for me to know I was not going to like this film. The male character, Mark (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard University computer geek, addresses a college-age girl sitting across from him in a pub. In an annoying voice and with all the warmth of a dead computer, he speed-talks his way through what is supposed to be a romantic date. As the plot moves along, Mark morphs into a kind of juvenile Gordon Gekko, obsessed with his work, greedy, self-satisfied, and unconcerned with the welfare of anyone but himself.With the possible exception of Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), almost all other characters, including Mark, are cold as ice, selfish, and downright soulless. The Harvard University President is portrayed not only as obnoxious but also unethical. Basically, the script consists of a thousand villains and no one to applaud.One really good line of dialogue stabs like a dagger. In a scene where Mark sits in a conference room staring at his laptop, as usual, a female legal assistant named Marilyn asks him: ""What are you doing?"" ""Checking in to see how (Facebook) is going in Bosnia"". To which Marilyn responds in a tone of sadness: ""Bosnia, they don't have roads but they have Facebook"".The cast is too big. Acting is acceptable, given the heartless subject matter. Visuals overall are too dark. Sound quality in some scenes is terrible. Filler scenes could have been edited out.Trying to be ""hip"", ""The Social Network"" cashes in on the ""success"" of a contemporary internet fad. Twenty years from now the film not only will be dated; it will play like some relic from antiquity.

Dialogues are well written and they are delivered in the most orderly way that there were times which made me stop for a few seconds and appreciate the screenplay of Aaron Sorkin after some lines uttered by Mark.Even though the story tells how one of the most famous social networking sites of today was founded, it's told in the most chilling and inspirational way possible that I started to listen to Hand Covers Bruise (the intro soundtrack) whenever I'm working on something and need motivation.Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield have a really good on-screen chemistry that two different characters with very contrasting emotional ranges give the most emotionally profound friendship story.David Fincher's cinematography and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' soundtracks make the film a cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
world's youngest billionaire,"David Fincher is a great director with his own trademarks. I think the fact that he is the director of the film was the most anticipated thing in the movie for me. And I didn't disappoint. Fincher again showed a great skill to keep that intension till the end. He uses several time differentials which may confuse viewers who are either a little dumb or are not paying their attention. However, it's not quite clear how can you not focus cause the story is enthralling. What I mean is that, you, who you read this, you probably have a facebook account, right? And I believe you are a bit interested in how a regular 20-year old student with a bright brain managed to create the second most visited website in the world. Well, you could get you answer in this movie.Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire. When Bruno Mars sings that he wants to be a billionaire so bad, then Mark Zuckerberg actually has proved that even a young man can hit the absolute top. All you have to do is to come up with something which basically fascinates the whole world. If you visit facebook daily, you should see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Curious Idea of Mark Zuckerberg,"This film makes you think, but more than thinking about anything in particular, it makes you remember. Much like remembering your introduction to the website itself, you'll never forget watching this movie. I remember first hearing of the movie. I'm on another website, TheInternetMovieDatabase...drop the ""the,"" and I was where you are now. I was worried about the future of liberty in art, seeing that David Fincher was making another PG-13 movie.I was ignorant. When I see Tarantino get caught by commercialism, I'll be back to talk, but not before I see why. Neither here nor there, some movies deserve bigger audiences.Much like ""Pulp Fiction,"" the nonparallel storytelling is propelled by pages upon pages of dialog, and we eat it up. You're dropped onto the Harvard campus in ""The Thirsty Scholar,"" if that's the name of the place where we're placed, further more, into the brutal final moments of Zuckerberg's best human relationship in the movie. As brutal as it gets, you're paying attention, as if you're sitting with the couple amongst the noisy thirsty scholars.When the noise fades out, an angry tone fades in, but under an almost childlike melody of only three notes. This is our main title, and our main theme. We'll hear it again, and then again, but it means something different each time. If you listened during that opening scene, then you're ready to pay attention. They introduce not only the idea of who Mark Zuckerberg is (at least the character)...but introduce the reason behind the idea Mark Zuckerberg gets...The best scene is the second time we hear the sweet melody. ""Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?"" The questioner becomes a blur and the questionee is in focus. ""It's raining."" This is movie-making. At its finest. This is dialog. At its finest.Also brought to our attention is Aaron Sorkin, the man behind The West Wing, and ""A Few Good Men,"" one of the most powerful plays you'll ever see. The power is fully on here. If only life could be so perfect as to have our daily conversations be dialog written by Sorkin.For those of you not paying attention, you'll become aware of David Ficher. The man behind your two all-time favorite films, ""Fight Club,"" and ""Seven."" The two-disk special edition is worth more than what you pay for, especially if you bought the Blu-ray version on Amazon when it first came out. The second disk allows your eyes to be open behind the scenes in a very entertaining documentary, but even so, you'll be able to enjoy the movie again and again. I'd say its one you can easily watch over and over, like Siskel and Ebert said about ""Pulp Fiction,"" since the film isn't told in chronological order, just a logical order. It's as if you're watching the film for the first time, every time.""The Social Network"" is the best film of 2010, and has been said to be the best film of the past decade. Its rare that we watch something perfect, but this movie is fireworks.It's refreshing that we don't need bombs, explosions, violence, or gore to be entertained. Take a look at the previous year's best picture winner (The Hurt Locker). It had all the things I just mentioned, but they are honorable mentions when it comes to that one.""The Social Network"" is not necessarily about Facebook, but it will last longer than the website does.

THE SOCIAL NETWORK: The Zenith of Privacy Deprivation,"The amount of information about the film THE SOCIAL NETWORK driving it toward being named Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor etc etc etc can only be compared to the global blast of privacy invasion that the topic of the film - FACEBOOK - has caused. The story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, acted with as much flatline self absorption as the character he portrays - a compliment) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield in the most sensitive, multifaceted performance in the film) and their brainy computer manipulated program that became the ruler of the computer universe is well told. The fact that the idea was 'lifted' from the Winklevoss twins (recreated a la 'The Parent Trap' concept by one actor - Armie Hammer) and Harvard sidekick Divya Narendra (Max Mingella) provides the story driver here: the history of Facebook is told through back and forth sessions at the depositions for law suits alternating with transmission of the incidents of the developmental struggles of the toy. It is story of obsession, of the fragmentation of trust between friends, of the proliferation of a challenging brainy idea into a billions of dollars scheme, and it is a documentation of how the current state of mind of the students to adults feed on gossip and instantaneous information dissemination, the results of which we are only beginning to appreciate as individual privacy becomes a relic.Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires' as been transformed to the screen by writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher (Seven (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), and Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). As with his other films Fincher successfully creates an atmosphere that captures the message of his films. Here that atmosphere includes degrading women, drowning dialogue with inordinately loud music on the soundtrack (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), maladaptive behavior, and the gradual loss of dignity of those young people who propel this concept of Facebook to success - not the least of which is a study of Napster Pro Sean Parker well played by Justin Timberlake. This is a long, loud, noisy, crude, roller coaster ride of a film that probably is true to the mark as a docudrama and as terrifyingly thought provoking.Grady Harp",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Its Amazing to know a few things we didn't know,"Don't Get angry if you knew about the reality before this movie well i'll be honest i didn't know a lot of things but i knew that he had problems.The movie is great splendid enough to make you feel the presence on screen of the cast itself. Mark is really a bright fellow. OH the movie in itself presents what type of culture we are in. A guy comes up with an idea has the initials to do it and when he do it then there are people how are there to get him To pay them for nothing simple. This movie puts you in whole a lot of situations where you ask yourself a question yeah man i wanted to be the founder of facebook yeah i wanted some part of it but you do things out of things which had some impact on you but what really matters is how you take it. The movie soundtracks, music, direction, dialogues and say not acting too is awesome. This is a must see movie for everyone you don't have to be a user of facebook to see but a special must for facebook users.

"The Social Network (2010) - A Tale of Friendship, Loyalty, Greed, & Betrayal","""The Social Network"" takes us back to the time when Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg creates the social networking of Facebook and the consequences that follow. But even though one of the movie's supporting details is the Facebook creation, there's actually a real plot behind that. It's about the presentation of everyday society, and how the Facebook's creation tears everything apart. The many consequences of society include friendship, greed, loyalty, and betrayal. These lessons of life are brought together into a movie that represents today's society, and that's what I like to see. Every single moment in this movie was written brilliantly, directed brilliantly, casted brilliantly, and everything brilliant was involved. Aaron Sorkin wrote a powerful memoir of everyday society, and David Fincher used his clever mind to bring it all together. Fincher's directing gave the film a certain style unlike his previous work. He wanted the viewer to dig deep into a world where it can sometimes not be a bright place. He used the creation of Facebook to represent not only how social media has affected our world today, but how certain real-life events such as greed and betrayal can be involved in the process. Aaron Sorkin's script is filled with well-written dialogue shared between the characters, clever and unexpected twists, interesting side info, and terrific depth. The movie is also accompanied by a haunting score that helps guide the audience through the story, the fast-paced editing used to go back and forth on Facebook's creation and it's aftermath, showing it's cause-and-effect theory, and the performances are some of the best cinema has ever seen. From Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, the trustful co-founder, to Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, Napster founder that joins Facebook to make it more edgier. But it's Jesse Eisenberg's Oscar-nominated scene-stealing performance as Mark Zuckerberg himself that definitely carries the movie. His fast-paced usage of the dialogue helps give the script a lot more attention to detail, and keeps the viewer along for the ride. If one is expecting to watch a biopic on Facebook, they'd better not think that much of that. They should really see this movie, while knowing it's actually a modern representation of today's society, with Facebook's creation at it's core. ""The Social Network"" is David Fincher's best film since ""Fight Club"", and it's one of my all-time favorites. ""The Social Network"", in my review, ""Expertly written, acted, and directed, a master-class"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
David Fincher's best film which guards his Oscar.,"The Social Network 'appeared' to be one of the most anticipated/profound films of the year, so my expectations for this film were high. The Facebook 'story' was a one I had actually never known about, and was extremely curious/interested to find out more. Lastly, with David Fincher, who had directed so many great and underrated films, you couldn't go wrong...To tell you, I wasn't a tad bit disappointed with the outcome of this film. It was actually almost perfect! It featured fine performances, a sophisticated soundtrack, brilliant writing, and outstanding direction.I wasn't expecting too much from young lads such as Eisenberg, Garfield, and Timberlake. In the end, they were all perfect for their roles. Eisenberg was strong, aggressive, and jubilant to show his hidden talent. Garfield was even more impressive; playing his character with speed, expressions, and perfection. Last but not least, Timberlake was actually the weakest. Yes he was aggressive and near-perfect for his role, but at times, he just blew it! The sophisticated soundtrack was creepy and made me shiver the daylights out of me! Reznor and Ross did an excellent job of putting it together.The writing was actually the 'stand-out', meaning the best category I praised this film for. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay seemed hard to follow, but the guy did one hell of a job! Overall, (as you can see), The Social Network is one of the best films of the year that guard Fincher's deserving Oscar. I'm just keeping my hopes up for him to get it, otherwise it'll be another foolish mistake from the harsh Academy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
David Fincher Is God,"Mr. Fincher I love you, and I love you again I have been looking forward to this film since it was announced, but I became really really interested when I found out Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, who has written many wonderful things including Charlie Wilsons War, a little favourite of mine From the beautiful direction, to the use of music (Trent Reznors score), to the use of digital (which I'm proud to be sold on and glad David Fincher is as well), to the incredible performances thanks to Davids numerous takes. I am told the opening scene went to 99 takes, and it shows, beautifully.I was hoping this film would have universal themes in the making of something of the now and that's exactly what I got Jesse Eisenberg who is officially one of my fav actors now after seeing him in The Squid and The Whale, Adventureland, Zombieland (I still have to see Rodger Dodger) and now this. He gives a stellar turn as Mark Zuckerberg. An unconventional leading character for a film is not unusual for Fincher Andrew Garfield was excellent and could make a great spider-man and I hope he has a long career.Rooney Mara was great in all her scenes and I can't wait to see her in 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' Justin Timberlake once again proves to be the real deal, following his great performances in Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan, he is indeed the real deal David Fincher just goes in the most exciting directions, from Alien 3, Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and now The Social Network His films are haunting and inspired, he is addicted to intelligence and driven to scar his audiences.Some have been calling it Finchers best film since Fight Club. This can't help me think about how Tyler Durden says ''Welcome to Fight Club'' Mark Zuckerberg says ''Welcome to Facebook'' Both make me think about what coming into certain worlds does to us in the long run, if it will bring good and bad.I will adore this film forever",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Boring film about a narcissist,"This film won loads of awards, is loved by the critics and is popular with audiences. I was given the impression that it's a fast-moving, witty film with great characters. I was disappointed that it's dull and that its protagonist is a very unlikeable narcissist.

Man in the Net(work),"When news that this film would be made was first released, the internet was aflutter - but mainly with skepticism. The names seemed solid enough - David Fincher as director, Aaron Sorkin as the scribe, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross scoring - but, understandably, everyone asked ""how would one make a movie about Facebook? Who's going to watch that?"" The thing is, ""The Social Network"" is not about Facebook. It's perhaps like saying ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was about the Ark of the Convenant. We all know ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was about Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood, Belloq, Thot...but less I digress, the genesis the success of this movie is in deciding the route to take.The film is based upon the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"", by Ben Mezrich. Mezrich has had another of his books turned into a film before, and that film was the awful ""21"". That's the thing - when I heard of ""21"", I desperately wanted it to be something like ""The Social Network"" turned out to be.Spurned by his ex-girlfriend (Rooney Mara), gifted but very unlikable Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) spitefully creates ""facemash"", a website to rate the appearance of the campus femmes. And so begins his roller-coaster journey to becoming Time magazine's 2010 Person of the Year and the youngest billionaire alive. His best friend Eduardo Saverin (Garfield), the affluent and influential twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer, Josh Pence as stand-in) and freewheeling and charismatic Napster founder Sean Parker all become chess pieces Zuckerberg plays – and pieces will fall off the board.David Fincher is known for being able to spin engaging yarns that affect on a psychological level, and pull audiences along for the ride. ""The Social Network"" is no different. From the get-go, it's a kinetic, mile-a-minute experience, akin to watching a high-quality action film - only that there's not one explosion in ""The Social Network"". With a screenplay like Aaron Sorkin's, it doesn't need any at all.""The Social Network"" is slick and a complete filmgoing experience - it feels like a great amount of effort was put into every aspect of production. Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield carry the film ably, natch, and have immediately become hot commodities in Hollywood - the former nominated for a Best Actor Oscar (up against the likes of Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges), the latter the new Spider-Man. Indeed, Garfield gave off a strong Peter Parker-type vibe, changing my early opinions about ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (after seeing that horrid costume).Stylistically and aesthetically, the film is pretty much perfect, glamorous and sexy – Jeff Cronenwerth's cinematography is smooth and cool, the film fashioning itself as an exclusive inside look behind the scenes, giving us hoi polloi a peek at the dangerous and exciting underbelly of the Facebook machine. However, that's the thing – it looks too pretty to feel like it's based on a true story. Indeed, most of the film does feel like conjecture, but it doesn't matter because it tells a good story. ""The Social Network"" probably didn't set out to be a documentary anyway.Jesse Eisenberg's Mark Zuckerberg is actually one of the greatest screen villains of all time, in the company of the likes of Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, Heath Ledger's Joker, and Malcolm McDowell's Alex. When characters who display traits of Asperger's Syndrome feature in movies, they're usually very nice deep down, or quirky and odd but likable. Zuckerberg as portrayed here is anything but – ruthless, cold, incredibly intelligent and with barely a shred of sympathetic quality until the very end of the film.The way the film presents it, the only true ""good guy"" swimming in the sea of sharks is Eduardo Saverin, as played by Garfield – probably because the real-life Saverin was the only member of the Facebook team who served as consultant to author Ben Mezrich. Still, Garfield is charming, real and puts his game face on to tackle the screenplay, and wins.The supporting cast is strong, particularly Justin Timberlake's suave, self-assured turn as Napster founder Sean Parker. However, I do question the decision to have Armie Hammer portray both Winklevoss twins, his visage digitally pasted onto body double Josh Pence to achieve the effect. Sure the CGI looks almost flawless, but it does sometimes (blasphemous as it sounds) remind one of any of the awful Eddie Murphy comedies where he insists on playing both characters. Hammer is a decent actor, but try as he might he was unable to sell the idea of two separate characters who look and sound alike but are otherwise individuals.Aaron Sorkin, master of the ""walk-and-talk"" genre as displayed in The West Wing, gives us a ""run-and-talk"" instead, his screenplay demonstrating incredibly brisk and astute pacing, throwing in the right amount of technobabble so we can tenuously believe the computer know-how that went into creating the website, and also developing compelling, complex characters that you just can't look away from.Ultimately, the film is much like a modern-day retelling of Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein"" – of how a brilliant, misunderstood and possibly evil genius created a monster, a monster that escaped his control, granting him fame and fortune by way of invading the lives of 600 million people around the world – and for so effectively getting such a frightening reality to take strong roots in the minds of such a mass audience, The Social Network is exceedingly praiseworthy.Jedd Jong",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Baby your a rich man and a great mo-vie,"About three years ago, Columbia Pictures released 21, a docudrama about a group of collage students who changed the face of the card game Blackjack. However, 21 was awarded with poor reviews and made 82 million in the U.S. So, why did I put a short review of 21 in my review of The Social Network? Well let me tell you this. The true story of 21 had white actors playing African Americans while The Social Network was true with the characters in real life. Yes I know that in both movies some have untrue facts (mostly 21), but This movie has more than 21. It's not just about the beginning of Facebook (and ConnectU), its also a tale of the Demons in life (greed, drugs, booze, and sex). Anyway, long story short, The Social Network is one of those good movies that doesn't want to go out and letting the bad movies come out. We need a film that's like this one, well acted, directed, and written. That makes The Social Network one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A great film that leaves you wanting more,"When The Social Network was first announced as ""a film about Facebook"" , I was skeptical about whether the film would be worth seeing or not. However once I saw the trailer, I could not wait to see the film and I am glad to say that it does not disappoint.David Fincher is one of those directors whose style is in everything that he makes and while at first that may not seem appropriate for a film about Harvard students creating a social website, it somehow makes the film better. Were this in the hands of another director, I don't think the film would have been as well received. The choice in music, camera angles, editing, lighting and the cast is all brilliant.What will immediately hook the audience in is the which, which is so sharp and witty. From the first five minutes, we quickly get to know who Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Isenberg) really is and what he is like around other people. While at first it may seem strange that someone like him would be best friends around the likable Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is caring and forgives Mark for some of his actions, their friendship it believable. This makes it a shame that we know that their friendship will never last.The acting in this film is great and all of the cast fit their roles perfectly. Jesse Insenberg is fantastic to watch as is Andrew Garfield (who is an actor clearly worth watching), Rooney Mara despite a small role is good, Armie Hammer who plays both twins is excellent and Justin Timberlake shines in another role as the founder of Napster.Despite how engaging the film is, I found myself wanting to see more as if the film had been edited down for commercial reasons. The film lasts 2 hours and within that running time it tells the story effortlessly thanks to David Fincher's direction but I wish more time was spent on the relationship between Mark and Eduardo as the film is constantly progressing forward.The film is well worth watching and I will certainly be interested in watching it again. Fincher continues to impress and I look forward to seeing what comes next for him and the actors in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
PBS Documentaries are more interesting,"This was a complete an utter borefest. The previews made it look like it was fun, informative, and maybe even a little bit sexy. Guess what? It wasn't.The story about Mark Zuckerberg is an interesting one, so you would think a movie about it would be interesting. I was wrong. Unless your idea of a good time is sitting around doing calculus while a bunch of other nerds talk about calculus, this movie is a complete waste of your time. Just wait for a documentary to come out about it or read a book, it is bound to be more interesting and exciting.Basically this is also a movie assembled by Zuckerberg's spurned former business partners and enemies, and is indeed a pretty unflattering view of the man.Jesse Eisenberg played the part of the socially inept Zuckerberg pretty well, if he truly is the annoying person that the film portrays him as. In fact, if you were to make a movie about an annoying geek, Eisenberg would definitely fit the bill and I'm not sure he is very far off from that character. Justin %Timberlake plays the only interesting person in the whole movie, the creator of Napster, but he is barely in the movie.I should have known this movie would really be a disastrous borefest, but I didn't realize David Fincher was the director. With the exception of ""Se7en"" and , ""Fight Club,"" most of his films are unwatchable.This is a good movie to put on if you are trying to put grown adults asleep before their bedtime. Otherwise just put the DVD down because the studio should pay you to sit through this.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Great dialogue film!,"I went to see this in Mexico the last day of showing, which meant that i already knew lots of opinions and praises this film is getting.Taking that into account, i really liked The social network. The story is not anything groundbreaking (and it being themed with facebook does not count as anything new, but a new and modern way to tell this kind of story, which made me feel it like a win for this film for how it was presented).The acting was great to say the least. Jesse Eisenberg was more than good for me, and i liked his annoying role. Andrew Garfield was amazing, and not only because of his looks, but because he really does a splendid job, and it wouldn't be the first time. I did like Justin Timberlake, but i found nothing major there. And it was funny to see the Disney channel Asian girl on the film, considering i had no idea she was on it.The pacing is good, but what really keeps the film going is the quirky and intelligent dialogue. If there is something this film deserves is the adapted screenplay. I was emerged from the dialogue in the film, and quite liked it. It was obvious how the story was turning out, but how it was presented with the lawsuits and real life experiences combined that made really glad to watch this film.Congratulations Fincher, good job... again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A masterfully understated modern saga.,"Firstly, I thoroughly enjoyed The Social Network. The acting is fantastic, the direction and score pleasantly understated, and the whole package wrapped up nicely as a biopic-cum-rise and fall saga. Special mention must go to Jesse Eisenberg for an absorbing performance that manages to make the most of Aaron Sorkin's lightning-fast script. The wicked humour of the early stages of the film mellows towards the end as we start to empathise with almost all of the characters.So what's wrong with it? I found the film to be almost a little too quirky, a little twee. The characters of Zuckerberg, Parker and the Winklevi seem heightened, a little too exaggerated to be fully believable. Part of this is in the dialogue which is clever, but a little too perfect for characters who are all struggling to make themselves understood. Part of it is in the occasional flashes of artsy music and camera-work, as if Fincher is trying to distance the film from the Hollywood pantheon. Maybe it is because by the end of the film, I still wasn't really sure what the message was, or what the characters had learned.But maybe that's the point. We may never understand what goes on inside Zuckerberg's head, but we are absorbed by watching how it plays out. The intelligence that sets him apart also keeps him apart, and his fierce individuality set up the emotional strain that follows. While it may not quite have rung true, The Social Network is a very good film, all the more interesting given that Facebook is still gaining followers and taking up more and more of our collective free time.A final note: Justin Timberlake's decision to take up acting is the best career move since Joachim Phoenix decided to stop rapping. A very talented man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The 452nd review of a film about someone who now has a piece of all of us,"Difficult to add to everything that's been written so I'll attack this obliquely: Aaron Sorkin's script drives the actors and the story and it's a very well-written script. I've read it and it does have a sense or urgency and discovery straight off the page which translates very well into a fascinating and hyper-realistic version of the truth.If you didn't already know, the film charts the rise of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard and his journey from dorm geek to billionaire and the subject of countless law suits.If you are one of the few people who do not use Facebook then this film will have less of an impact on you, that's for sure, but I think that the inter-relationship between Zuckerberg, his initial partner Edouardo Saverin and their nemeses 'The Winklevi' is fascinating.My favorite parts of the movie are where people wrongly under-estimate Zuckerberg and he surprises them, closely followed by the Winklevi trip to Larry Summers' office which doesn't end quite as they expected.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Very thought-provoking and real,"I'd like to give this at least an 8.5. Maybe one day IMDb will implement a system that allows decimals. Oh well.Honestly I thought this movie would be underwhelming just because many of us know the gist of the story. I underestimated the creators and actors because this was a very well done film all around.I'm all about court room dramas and internet culture separately and it's all blended well here. The actors are all pretty much unknown to me but I enjoyed just about everyone and no one was cliché or distracting. All were believable. The movie is never boring either so I appreciated the deliberate and consistent pace. Going back and forth from the evolution of the site to the law suits was done perfectly.I'm not really sure why I really liked but didn't love it. There's virtually nothing wrong with it. Maybe it's just because Facebook is such a part of our culture nowadays that it seemed old hat before it even began. Not sure, but the movie succeeds on all fronts in my opinion.Some people here don't seem to understand that this is based on real life. If the characters seem cold or boring to you that's just because their portrayals are based on people that exhibited that kind of personality. It's not about what you ""want"" out of a story, they're just showing you how past events unfolded. I don't want it twisted into a story that's only about two friends who split apart or something, I just want to hear the story as it is. So many reviews ask why it wasn't about this or that. The answer is because it's about what happened, not what you want to see. I thought this was obvious but apparently not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Please stop making movies about j*rks!!,"I wasn't planning on seeing The Social Network. I love Alien 3, was blown away along with everyone else by Fight Club when I was younger and now find it to be nostalgic at best, absolutely hated the ""adaptation"" of Benjamin Button, and haven't really paid too much attention to Fincher otherwise. I also don't have a Facebook page and haven't good things to say about Eisenberg.But, everyone else seems to be digging the film, and Aaron Sorkin is one heck of a writer, so I thought I'd give it a go.The film itself was average in quality. No great highs and no great lows, in my humble opinion.The biggest issue for me, though, is more of a slippery slope I've been noticing as of late of movies such as this coming out, all about a slew of j**ks (or ""a***oles,"" as the Network itself would claim) who no one would ever care about.Back in the day, it was all about the underdog, the Brando schmo scratching at himself and wearing a dirty white T-shirt. It seems today, though, the new ""underdog"" is really just some selfish bozo whose only means of being empathetic, according to the filmmakers, is that he/she might be a computer nerd or short or not so good-looking. As though that's enough to make us care about him/her?The specific problem for me with The Social Network is that none of the characters deserve any empathy (or even sympathy) at all. The main character--whether the real Mark Z. is or not--is a total narcissistic b***ard who doesn't seem to even want anything or have any real goals aside from pi**ing off his ex-girlfriend with whom he seems to have no real chemistry or intimacy in the first place. Just because he continues stalking her doesn't mean he cares about her; I had trouble even believing that he would care that much about her anyway, considering the inhibited/introverted solipsist the movie made him out to be.Then we have his best friend (or ""ex-best friend"") who was probably the only slightly sympathetic character in the film (which in this case is like being Valedictorian in summer school). But, even he seems to be selfish, childish, and immature throughout, using his family's money as a means of making or breaking friendships throughout the movie.Everyone else in the film seems to be ""even bigger"" j*rks than the character of Mark Z., going around trying to intimidate their enemies and each other without really accomplishing anything or, again, wanting anything real except for ""revenge.""It's difficult watching a movie like this where there's no one to latch on to emotionally. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly charismatic and charming throughout the movie, but as much as I wanted to like at least him--at least one character in the film--his character was also so incredibly despicable and conniving (not to mention somehow very wealthy despite everyone saying he had no money anymore) that it became impossible. I guess he was supposed to be the antagonist? The villain to the other villain(s)?Another issue with this kind of slipshod writing and filmmaking is that we're not granted any semblance of three-dimensionality or humanity that can lend itself to realism. Jesse Eisenberg might never smile (and he never seems to in movies or interviews alike), but I'm sure Mark Z. does. In fact, whenever I see that fellow in an interview or photo, he seems to be smiling quite bright. Maybe it's just now that he has $25b? But, come on. ""Cheer up, Charley! Give us a smile!""An easy fix to this could have been involving characters from Mark's actual life to show the humane and more complicated side of his persona. His parents, for example. Where were his parents? He was 19 during all of this, a minor. His parents could have been injected into the movie to give a fresh and more complicated perspective of the guy, to have them maybe speak with him and with each other about the scared boy inside the angry robot the movie makes him out to be. Or his real-life girlfriend who was there in those early days, perhaps making a composite of this girl and the one-dimensional ""Erica"" of the extant film. A girlfriend who stands by him, who caresses him and lets US in on the ""real"" Mark who SHE sees, as opposed to, again, the robot the movie makes him out to be.In the end, Mark Z.'s character was just as bad a guy and just as hypocritical as the biggest blonde-haired, Adonis bully fratboy character you might find in an 80's teen movie. Just because he happens to be a ""nerd"" (?) doesn't make him Louis Skulnick.Charles Foster Kane wanted the innocence of his youth and craved that time in his life before he became Hearst. And this is exactly what makes him more like ""us,"" more of a character with whom we can empathize, regardless of how venal he becomes over time. Mark Z. just wants to pi*s off an ex-girlfriend who, again, I don't even really believe he gives that much of a d**n about anyway. When there's nothing to care about in a main character, a movie is failing. When there's no characters to care about at all, a movie FAILS.Hollywood: please take a memo! You can't combine Revenge of the Nerds with Varsity Blues anymore! J*rks will always be j*rks no matter if they're computer nerds, alienated little eight-year-olds, Southern working moms, pregnant teenagers, or fat. Work a little harder to create real, three-dimensional characters we can care about. There's always something there; it's just a matter of finding it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
More Than Face-Value,"I admit I fell in love with The Social Network: It was smart, funny, and sympathetic. I liked it so much I watched it thrice, even though I was sitting for my GCSE 'A' Levels.The Social Network is not just a snarky narrative about awkward and rich young men. It is also a portrait of human nature, as we learn how to grapple with self-identity. On screen, the characters spar with their wit and their lawyers; off-screen, we are left wondering how much authenticity is masked by their defensiveness.I adored The King's Speech for it's sheer humanity - the latter made me cry, while the former made me laugh. The King's Speech appears to be the better of the two, in my extremely subjective opinion, because I was laughing and crying WITH the characters - while I was probably laughing AT the characters in The Social Network.Nonetheless, this movie made me a converted Aaron Sorkin fan. He ranks next to Alan Bennett, the wonderful British playwright who wrote The History Boys. Perhaps like The History Boys, I would learn to outgrow The Social Network, with all its awkward charm and angst. However, it was a profound movie that made me question issues that plague our lives today: why we are driven to success, and why we seek to escape from ourselves, to hide from our own darkest shadows.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Computer guys the new Rock Stars,"There will probably be a surge in computer science majors as we witness youthful, tech savvy, nerdy types emerge as the new rock stars of the 21st century. Their computer ingenuity and creativity lead them to fame, fortune and even groupies.A character study about someone who becomes a billionaire in his twenties is expertly blended with subject matter that is so relevant to our times results in one of the greatest movies of the past decade. The filmmakers and actors created such a believable Zuckerberg with such human emotions and motivations that we totally connect to this all too familiar, idiosyncratic, ""smuggy nerd"" who fascinatingly becomes one of the billionaire rock stars of the information age. He is mentored by fellow internet rock star, Napster founder played by Timberlake. The subject matter of the business and legal ramifications of conjuring an online site raises interesting philosophical questions. Questions such as, who is really deserving; someone that comes up with the idea or the creator themselves, and how deserving is a confounder who plays a small financial role at the onset but who was nothing to do with the creative drive. These are some of the questions that will make the audience think about these contemporary issues.The dialogue written in a way where characters go tit for tat at unnaturally supersonic speeds was a throwback to Carey Grant classics, however, the modern edge and relevancy makes it engrossing, and ears will be fully opened to the intense verbiage.Amusingly tells the story of facebook founder's development and initial success with the site. Much of what he did in the initial founding years created controversy amongst those somewhat connected to the site and those wanting a piece of the pie. Two major legal disputes ensue and the film is structured through depositions dealing with these disputers. The haughty and annoyed Zuckerberg is visibly put off by these minor encumbrances and is seething to get back to his passion and baby (facebook). We hear of new controversies during the depositions and we see the flashbacks to the college years where these controversies got started which is a major part of the saga of the spawning and growth of facebook. The tad Gothic and moody atmosphere with the highly sensationalized decadence gives an entertaining if a little over the top feel to the collegiate setting.The movie opens and wraps up perfectly with a speculative, witty theme of the human component that creates the drive and motivation for these youthful internet entrepreneurs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A great film!...,"I remember when this came out there was an awful lot of debate, praise and general talking about it. Unfortunately it never made it to my local cinema (surprisingly), but it finally made it to a pay TV channel this week. I was quite keen to see it given the amount of attention it got, and also because it was written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher, both of which I admire greatly. Here's a little about the plot before I give you my thoughts.After a disagreement with a girl, Erica Albright, computer genius Mark Zuckerberg goes online and writes a program called ""Facemash"". It was available only to students at Harvard University, where he was studying. It caused quite a stir when the University servers crashed. He had the help of his friend, Eduardo Saverin, who would eventually be credited as a co-founder of Facebook. Moving on from this, Mark is approached by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and their associate Divya Narendra, to write a web site for them that had elements common with what Facebook would become. Instead of working on their site, Mark works on his own idea, with backing from Eduardo. Eventually 'The Facebook' goes live at Harvard University and is an instant hit. They expand to other Universities in the United States and eventually across the world. Mark is contacted by Sean Parker, the inventor of Napster, and he eventually moves out to California to use his expertise. All this time, Eduardo is being squeezed out of the business. It all comes to a head when Mark is sued by Eduardo, the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra. It is this action that forms the central part of the movie and it is from here the various parts of the story are told in flashback. I've probably said too much, but the film is about so much more so I'll stop before the Spoiler Police (Universities branch) escort me off campus.As you'd expect from Aaron Sorkin, an excellent script with some really great dialogue! The film is beautifully made, expertly paced and I found it very easy to get into. Great performances all round, particularly from Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, a real departure for him and he pulled it off brilliantly. I must also give praise to Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, for me, he put in the best performance, maybe because his character was more likable, but still a great performance. Honourable mentions go to; Armie Hammer as Cameron Winklevoss / Tyler Winklevoss and Max Minghella as Divya Narendra.I really enjoyed this film, the subject matter is one that's close to many people's hearts and so I guess it was bound to be a hit. I did find the picture very dark though; so much so that curtains had to be drawn (it was a daytime viewing). I think it's one of those films that will eventually become a classic, but it is one you have to watch It's very easy to get lost in the twists and turns of a piece of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin. (I mean that in a nice way). Over all, beautifully made, a great script, an enthralling story and some great performances Recommended.My Score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 149,604 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 96/100 (based on 272 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Fincher classic,"The social Network directed by David Fincher is the story behind the pillar of our social lives- Facebook. It claims to dramatize the 'events' that took place in developing 'facebook'. Mark Zukerberg(Eisenberg) , just after being dumped by his girlfriend and drunk ,defames her on his blog, he later creates facemash.com a portal to rate and compare university girls based on their looks. All this leads to a lot of flak from others and then an idea. The idea that will become the most used social networking platform, ever. But this 'idea' is built on with the help of the winklevoss twins(Hammer) and funded by his best friend Eduardo(Garfield). But a few years later we see Zukerberg at a court being sued by the Winklevoss brothers and Eduardo. The film is about the events that led to the case.We all know this, the real Zukerberg claimed the film is almost entirely fiction while the makers claimed its entirely true and only 'dramatized'. This very difference of opinion made millions to want to watch this movie. But all that apart, 'the social network' is another Fincher classic. Fabulous performance from Eisenberg and Garfield , also Timberlake was surprisingly convincing as the cunning and suave entrepreneur-Sean parker. The perfect casting is the highlight of this movie and a great screenplay(by Aron Sorkin) complements it. The dialogues are smart yet they don't seem dramatic, the pace of the film never makes any moment of this two hour flick seem boring.And so it really doesn't matter if its fiction or completely real, the events in 'the social network' is something you will remember often , when you 'add a friend' or 'like' a comment on facebook simply because a 25 billion dollar company that puts wheels' our social lives couldn't have been made for the silver screen in a better and classy way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

This film isn't a masterpiece or whatever, and I will tell you why: just a couple pacing issues and confusing dialogue moments, but overall, this film had some great storytelling, characters, acting, and alot more.

Trying To Make Nerds Look Cool,"There's something to be said about the muted palette of the film, the subdued anger the actors try to play off slyly throughout, and the intense slow-zooms used and abused from the first scene, but no amount of sleek and stylish film-making will ever make Zuckerberg's story about blatant IP theft any more compelling than it already was not. And no amount of hard-edged attempts at covering for his character while doubling back to pretend to question his ethics will make him look like a genius.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Fincher applies his usual dark style to this intriguing and relevant story,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFor such a young guy, I'm still worryingly over-whelmed by all the technology that controls the world these days...you seem to have mobile phones where people can watch films, download music, connect to the internet, music devices that can download tunes on the go, and doing the rounds on the internet itself at the moment, 'social networking' sites seem to be all the rage, mainly Twitter, and, arguably the most popular, Facebook. I fail to see the big rage, to be honest, intermittently informing other users of the most mundane aspects of your day, trying to out compete others with how many messages you can send at one time and so forth. But still, FB has millions of followers worldwide, and has made it's founder Mark Zuckerberg the youngest millionaire on the planet. This film charts how Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, used his social alienation and nerdishness to set him on his way to founding Facebook, before it's money making potential became evident and he began to turn on his friends as he became more ruthless making his way to the top (or so the film claims.)At first glance, the material doesn't feel suited to the dark content director David Fincher is more renowned for and so he's an odd choice to be at the helm here. Still, his heavy, brooding style is felt all over the picture, and adds it a layer of authenticism and style that it otherwise wouldn't have had. In the lead role, Eisenberg (weird his and his character's name both end in berg!) brings the character of Zuckerberg to life quite well, showing an already tactless and socially awkward person descend further into a ruthless, predatory and traitorius monster (although this is a dubious depiction by the film.) It is curious that such a socially challenged guy could be responsible for creating the biggest social networking site in the world. And it has to be said, praise is owed to Justin Timberlake in a supporting role, showing more range and depth than could be reasonably expected of an ex member of N Sync.This is an unusual but timely and relevant piece for a director like Fincher to take on, and, applying his usual cold, dark style, he has achieved quite an admirable result indeed. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A Film Worthy Of Its Subject Matter,"Facebook changed the world--it's as simple as that. It deserved a film up to the par of that momentous (for better or worse) revolution, and that's exactly what director David Fincher provides.For a very basic overview, ""The Social Network"" tells the story of Facebook's creation and subsequent legal battles. It is told primarily (via flashbacks) through the recollections of creator Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg) and former best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) as they wade through the various lawsuits.There are three areas in which this movie really shines:1. Direction: There is no dull moment in this film. Fincher really keeps things hopping and upbeat, as befitting a movie about the greatest social invention perhaps of all time. Very deserving of his Oscar nomination.2. Acting: Only in the best of movies can outside-the-box casting choices make you not feel as if they are out of place. For example, Brenda Song (best known as the ditzy London Tipton of Disney Channel fame) plays essentially a ""Facebook groupie"", while Justin Timberlake shines as Sean Parker, founder of Napster, who has a major influence on Zuckerberg in the Facebook development process. Armie Hammer has the unique opportunity to play both halves of the now-infamous Winklevoss twins. Remarkably, all these castings work perfectly.3. Ideas: Besides just a summary of Facebook's creation, the true genius behind this movie is the ideas/notions it stirs up. The definition of copyright, the creative process, and the definition of friendship are all themes that are swished around during the movie. No grand conclusions or black-and-white summations are given. Instead, it is left up to the viewer to decide on the ethics of what just transpired. This remains true--if not perhaps even more so--a solid decade after the film's release, when the overall importance of social media is slightly better understood.Thus, I consider ""The Social Network"" to be one of the most unique biopics I have ever seen. The combination of strong societal implications, Fincher's direction, Aaron Sorkin's dialogue, Trent Reznor's music, and Eisenberg's quirky Zuckerberg make every scene engaging in some way. I'm clicking the ""Like"" button on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

Its script weaves together eloquent conversations about friendship, betrayal, jealousy, and intelligence. Jesse Eisenberg masterfully portrays Mark Zuckerberg, a gifted student at Harvard with a brilliant idea. Little does he know that his brilliant idea will throw him into two lawsuits which ask for a great deal of money. The film moves back and forth through a timeline of a few years, with events ranging from the later involvement of Sean Parker to a fantastic canoeing race. The directing from David Fincher is remarkable, with each scene of speedy, expertly crafted dialogue seeming like cinematic heaven. The performances of Eisenberg, Garfield, and Timberlake are gripping and awards-worthy.

"This intelligent and wonderful carousel of fights and agreements filled with lawyers and deceptions is the perfect way to sum the current society, virtual or not.","When I first heard about this project I was pessimistic since I refused to believe in a story about some website where people interact with each other. Then, David Fincher was announced to direct the movie and that news dazzled me because Fincher is known for his compact, complex storytelling so I was kind of biased on this project and still didn't cared about it that much. But then, months after that, the movie came out and an avalanche of positive reviews started. Right then I said ""I need to see this movie, what the hell was I thinking? It's Fincher for god sake!"". So, I grabbed a ticket and I went to see it. I must say I was completely satisfied with the movie, not only satisfied but impressed and in a way it touched me but I find it a little bit overrated. Aaron Sorkin deserves a nomination for best Screenplay since the narrative story and dialogue was perfect. No mistake and no cheesy lines, just smart content.Fincher's excellent directing and storytelling is the ultimate weapon of audience-attraction a Facebook movie could have had. Each shot followed by next one shows a logical, smart and innovative progress through the Facebook creation. Not only that, but he succeeded to let the viewer acknowledge that's he's not watching just a Facebook movie but more a movie about society's goods and bads... Of course, the story is based on Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the young Harvard student who ""by inspiration and chance"" became the youngest billionaire in the world. Through his moments of brightness he had an accomplice in Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) in creating the main social connector in the world. Many said, this movie is not based on the real deal behind the creators of Facebook, one of them being ""the"" Mark Zuckerberg but Fincher never suggested that this movie is about that but more about the social structure of today's world no matter if the society created it's virtual or not. Fincher analyzes all the possibilities, gives the best interpretation and shows us the naked truth behind the main goals of an adolescent. Mark Zuckerberg is the perfect example of that adolescent who can't integrate himself into a society because he doesn't have the required ""skills"" to make it there, to survive, and because of his personal frustrations he succeeds to create the one thing he couldn't be a part of: a society. Being a virtual society it doesn't really matter in these days when the differences between it and the real one (or the one that finds herself in reality) are close to none. But may I ask... which in fact is the real one? There's the point of this movie... And this intelligent and wonderful carousel of fights and agreements filled with lawyers and deceptions is the perfect way to sum that.The cast of Jesse Eisenberg is not only because of the physical but also because of this guy's talent to portray such a simple but in fact deep character. But Jesse ain't the top notch as far as acting because the secondary roles held by Justin Timberlake who plays the founder/creator of Napster, Sean Parker and Andrew Garfield who plays Zuckerberg's partner, Eduardo Saverin, simply takeover the show. I honestly would like to see Andrew Garfield to be nominated in the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Academy since he managed to deliver such a great and powerful performance.Another place where Fincher always succeeds is the cinematography and editing. This film was beautifully shot, every take has a meaning and no scene alone was boring or dragged too much. The music was also a big contributor to the atmosphere of the movie, it's not something the Academy would look after but it definitely delivered.With all this, the ""Facebook movie"", The Social Network is this generation's movie because it reflects our current society and our current beliefs but I also consider it to be a little bit overrated, especially considering some critics had the guts to compare this with the Godfather or Citizen Kane. I must say this LOUD and clear: It ain't nowhere near Citizen Kane or Godfather. It's a very very good movie but it doesn't have that strong emotional impact like those movies. While I said it impressed me emotionally I am also saying that this doesn't mean it's an powerful emotional movie because it's not. It's like a story of a dark twisted fantasy of some poor loser in life which transcends to reality but that's it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Network... a must for everyone who's on Facebook!,"Genius. And not just Mark Zuckerberg. David Fincher, take a bow.

Fincher handles that expertly with an all-new, fresh cast. Jesse Eisenberg is brilliant as the eccentric, whimsical Mark Zuckerberg, while Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake chip in with brilliant supporting roles.With the way he handled Zodiac and now this, Fincher has shown that he is one of Hollywood's most underrated directors.

"The Social Network, was a great network of success.","You know many people are always skeptical when there is a movie where it involves a website or a certain or based on something involving this society we live in. The reason people don't think this movie could work is because it is based on the global phenomenon facebook.I in all honestly don't become skeptical towards these types of films. I personally believed that this film has a huge chance at winning at least one Oscar this year. Either for best picture, best actor, or best supporting actor.Jesse Eisenburg was spectacular at portraying the genius and or just a crazy kid willing to do anything to do what he thinks is right. Justin Timberlake was also good, this was probably his best film. Unlike his other films Justin was serious and top notch at his role as the creator of Napster (Sean Parker), but the actor who was absolutely perfect was Andrew Garfield.Garfield was amazing he really set the stone for this film his acting I believe is what boosted this movie even more than it already was. The story itself is unbelievable because it shows you how FaceBook, came about, and shows how Mark Zuckerberg was what some people would say an evil genius, I personally believe that Mark was just a misunderstood kid who wanted to prove he was better and capable than anyone else in his field of expertise.Although I did catch one mistake in the film, there was a reference to Snooki from the ""Jersey Shore"". The thing is the reference was made during the timeline in the movie which was at least either 2006 or 2007 at the point of the reference. 2006-2007 there wasn't even a thought of Jersey Shore because it wasn't created back then.

The cast is great, with Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, and Jesse Eisenberg standing out as the biggest and most important roles. The writing and dialogue are very sharp, and the cinematography, especially in the initial setting at Harvard, (though filming didn't happen on the actual Harvard campus, of course), is memorable.David Fincher did a great job cultivating a believable, fascinating atmosphere from all the melodrama. If you're wondering what could be so interesting about a ""Facebook movie"", I recommend that you do yourself a favor and see for yourself.

One of David Fincher's best,"""The Social Network"" was one of 2010's best reviewed films. It was considered one of the front-runners for that year's Best Picture Oscar but ended up losing to the more conventional (but not necessarily undeserving) ""The King's Speech"".The film tells the story of the founding of the massively popular social networking site Facebook. At the outset, co-founders Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) & Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) are best friends but business soon comes between them. This results in legal action against Zuckerberg, who is also being sued for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook from his would-be employers.Aaron Sorkin's justifiably lauded script was adapted from Ben Meszrich's non-fiction book ""The Accidental Billionaires"". Sorkin's dialogue is impeccable but the source material's questionable accuracy could be a problem for some. There's little attempt to present multiple sides of the story and some of the plot points seem more like Hollywood fabrication (particularly the ending). That's not to say that the story isn't compelling but it may turn off some viewers with its selective, embellished viewpoint.From an acting standpoint, the film contains a few standout performances. Jesse Eisenberg deftly delivers his character's intricate dialogue but, to me, Andrew Garfield gives the film's best performance in the role of the betrayed friend. Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake surprises with a colourful portrayal of Napster founder Sean Parker. Armie Hammer and Rooney Mara also stand out in supporting roles.The ever-dependable David Fincher's direction is expertly handled and the film boasts attractive cinematography and crisp editing throughout. However, the film's strong suit in the technical arena may be the music, which was expertly handled by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross.To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of this movie the first time I saw it. I got hung up on the script's veracity and it prevented me from appreciating some of the film's finer points. Now, I'm more forgiving of the liberties taken with the facts and I can see that the film's craftsmanship is nothing short of exquisite. In my opinion, ""The Social Network"" is a must-see and one of Fincher's best to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The most praised movie of 2010. But is it deserving?,"When previews for ""The Social Network"" began running in theaters many people wrote this movie off as the ""facebook"" movie but it has now become one of the most acclaimed movies of the year, and perhaps the decade. This movie follows the young creators of facebook during their college years and throughout their invention's rise in popularity. The two largest roles would be Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, played by Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield respectively. Both of these young actors deliver outstanding performances, with Eisenberg easily putting in the best work of his career. Andrew Garfield is some-what of a new face in America, but this role is a wonderful way for our audiences to get to know him before he takes on being the new Spider-Man. The most surprising performance comes from Justin Timberlake, who has already shown he can survive in the music world but he seems to be turning into a rather promising actor. The real star of this movie would have to be the script written by Aaron Sorkin, with it's witty, speedy dialogue this movie seems to be in a whole different league than most other current films. Director David Fincher also puts forth his best work with this movie since ""Fight Club"" which came out nearly eleven years earlier. Although the movie is primarily about the creation of facebook that only begins to scratch the surface. It really provides a story of a person who is so determined to be known for something and will not stop at nothing to earn his recognition. It provides a good portrait of the current generation because we have the ability to create anything and post it on the internet to be seen by the world. This movie deals with the sacrifices Zuckerberg has to deal with in order to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Who want's to know the Facebook?,"I can't recall seeing a modern Biopic which was so much talked about than 'The Social Network'. In this age where the contemporary community and media cannot live without the word FACEBOOK, it's always a pleasure and interesting to see how its creators have really made it. The picture full of Mark Zuckerberg and his life after 2003 is experienced not so quietly throughout the movie. The story telling is done via bouncing in between two law suits. Starting from the early days of Marks Harvard life up to where the Facebook hits a million subscribers, the events which occur are dramatically represented without making the viewer bored. Some dialogs slip away without giving a split second to comprehend due to the talking nature of Mark which sounds speedier than a F1 racing car. Coz of this maybe a second viewing is recommended. But the story is pretty neat and easy to digest. Specially as many of us already know what really went in the creation of Facebook.The important fact is to the get the line between fact and fiction correct. Especially when it's based on true events and the key character is immensely influencing the society as we speak. So you movie gores better read a few articles once your done enjoying the movie. Movies are always pretty dramatic than real life so you may need to realize that one way or the other.Cinematically 'The Social Network' is a good movie. You won't get bored and the story does not let you down. Its fast as I mentioned before so you might be left out from time to time but catching up is mandatory. Acting is wonderful. I believe Jesse Eisenberg have done justice to his character and hope that Mark Zuckerberg will agree on that. If not we have never seeing the real man and will end up engraving someone else's image on our mind.Overall what started with an investment of $1000 and becomes $65 Billion worth within years in the plot doesn't sound like a bad movie at all. And that's Facebook.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BORING! BUT ITS A MASTERPIECE!,The moment I heard what this movie is about I was like. I won't like it since I am more of an action adventure type of guy. But boy was I wrong. The fantastical story of the making of Facebook is just as intriguing as it is to browse the website itself. Or maybe not so much nowadays. But in any case this does not require you to like facebook to like this movie. The movie is about friends and betrayals which center around a Billion Dollar Company. I loved this masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Iconic,"When Mark Zuckerberg's friend Eduardo pointedly put forwards his point to Mr. Zuckerberg, while testifying for his claims of corporate embezzlement by Mr. Zuckerberg, that he was his only friend and that his facebook friend's list are worthless, you realize the time's that we live in; where each one of us has created a virtual world for ourselves to satisfy our social needs. We have an apparent friends list of over 200 to 400 friends, but fail to realize we are sitting in our room all alone. These are the fine intimate scenes and moments in the movie 'The Social Network ', that makes you feel that this has got something to do with how you lead your life is what makes this movie an iconic movie of the first decade of the 21st century.Directed by the always underrated Mr. David Fincher of 'Fight Club', 'Seven', 'Zodiac' and 'The curious case of Benjamin Button'; this is the movie that should fetch him an Oscar and for everyone involved with this movie. The Social Network relives the story of the creation of a website and company, which defines this generation, from a college dorm room. The controversial natures of its creation notwithstanding, the movie without taking sides, tells the tale honestly and with great compose. The controversial co-founder of Facebook and the main protagonist character of the movie Mark Zuckerberg played by Jesse Eisenberg, seems to have his own story to tell about friendship, which is ironic since he is more or less controlling the social lives of millions of people. As a Harvard under graduate student, Mark was on the sidelines of the Harvard's social scene, when he decides to do something substantial to get attention, after his girlfriend breaks up with him. His little website about comparing woman's face with each other draws lot of attention and a suspension; but also leads him to the Winklevoss twins who have an idea of a social networking site (exclusive for people with mailing ID of harward.edu). Till that step, things are smooth, but soon takes the turn to controversial, with each side having its own versions of the story of a time in their lives that would change social networking forever. As Mr. Zuckerberg went on to create the facebook along with his other roommates, he starts grabbing attention from girls who normally would ignore him. But as he expands his website to other colleges, the website grabs the attention of Napster founder and recently bankrupted Sean Parker, who takes facebook to a new level and isolates Mark from his best friend and co-founder of facebook Eduardo who is a business major and had made the early investments for the website. What we see in the movie is the side by side hearings of two lawsuits against Mr. Zuckerberg. One from the Winklevoss twins for stealing their 'idea' and another from Mark's former best friend Eduardo for deceitful dilution of Eduardo's business share in the company. The director pitches the story towards the audience without judgment against any individual.The razor sharp dialogues of the screenplay are used to pull the audiences in the conversation between characters that are sometimes highly technical but thanks to writer Aaron Sorkin not out of reach of the general public. The great casting cannot be described in any more way, except giving a standout mention to Jesse Eisenberg who played Mark Zuckerberg. In times of heartbreaks he made a generation felt his angst and in times of defending himself he let the world sympathize, feel he was a cheat as well as admire his genius.Speaking about how this generation felt about Mark Zuckerberg's portrayal in the film, it is very much felt it reflected something more to them than the older generation. His was a story of great entrepreneur success in this capitalist world. A socially viable invention that is of some need to all and still all what it is to him is a business, a commanding position that a generation craves to be at this age (and also to be the youngest billionaire in the world). That he treated women like farm animals (or the movie as a whole treated women like meat) meant nothing to the audience. He found success in this dog eat dog world and is sitting on top of the pile. His success made him friendless (at least in the movie) was not a matter of concern since last check his facebook page has 2,912,375 friends. And as in the final moments of the movie, as Mark sits in front of his laptop while sending a friend's request to a special long lost girl and as he sits through clicking the refresh button, waiting for a reply to the request; it defines a generation that is including Mark is waiting for one thing in society, acceptance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
One of the best films of 2010.,"The Social Network has achieved the almost impossible,a movie about the creation of a website should be boring but they not only made it interesting, they've made it thrilling.This purportedly true story about Facebook is primarily a legal drama, mostly focusing on the dispute between Mark Zuckerberg and the other Harvard University students who claimed to have also been contributory in the social networking website's creation. After burning a few more bridges and pissing off his few remaining friends, Zuckerberg finds himself in a litigation nightmare. A script written by Aaron Sorkin, who has created some blisteringly sharp dialogue that will leave you hanging on every word spoken by the outstanding cast. Eisenberg is outstanding and presents the Facebook founder as a socially stunted savant, unable to relate to other people as anything other than a means to some other end, his misogynistic attitudes towards women a particular flaw.The Social Network has a definite ""revenge of the nerds"" feel about it, with its oafish jocks, exaltation of hackers and nerd-groupies. The film is also an interesting product of the hyper-fast social world it has helped to create: a biopic about someone still alive and in his mid-20s and relating events that only happened a couple of years ago. Just how much of the story is really true is anyone's guess but it is certainly thought-provoking, and the brilliant script and Eisenberg's performance make it worth seeing in any case. One of the best films of 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
interesting movie,"If you think this is about lines of programming codes or boring scenes of a nerd designing a website the whole movie, then you are wrong.This movie is about a dramatic, funny, interesting story of success. It is not mainly about Facebook as many would think, it is about the genius guy who invented it to attract this much people all around the world with a simple idea.It shows us the story of being hated, alone, with no social life at all nor girl friends and how a very simple idea which started with hacking and stealing pictures of girls from his university and publishing them online gained all the attraction from all students at the university. and then taking the secret that attracted all these people and developing a new idea that can have the same impact on them and brings the whole college social experience online. It shows you how he started, how this website spread like this, what did he do after that to actually make money of it, and how it ends up with a huge company with the youngest billionaire in the world.a success like that never comes without hatred, without people trying to shut the whole thing down, and without friends betrayal. you will see a lot of lawyers talking scenes trying to sew him for what he did to his friend and to the people he was supposed to work with regarding a similar idea. it's full of funny comments and rude behavior.nothing more can be said except this movie is a big deal. perfect actors, perfect scenario, perfect music.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
I like it!,"I was completely captivated by the movie from start to finish. The opening dialogue sets the tone and displays the level of intelligence that's often missing in this genre. While some have claimed that the film boasts the greatest dialogue ever written, I beg to differ. However, the delivery of the lines is impeccable and some of the best I've ever seen. After all, words are only as effective as the person conveying them.I must mention Jesse Eisenberg's performance, which is simply outstanding. His rapid and confident delivery of lines adds depth and dimension to his character, a disturbed and socially inept individual. Every word he utters exudes intellect and increasing arrogance that stems from his deep-seated insecurities. This performance holds the film together, along with Fincher's masterful direction.Fincher is a director who knows how to craft a story and tell it with precision. In this movie, he not only tells an engaging story that most of us are familiar with but also demonstrates that meticulous attention to detail and scene-setting can enhance the audience's immersion in what is essentially a predictable coming-of-age tale. I was pleasantly surprised by the absence of his usual visual flair, as he allows the movie to speak for itself. I commend him for that.Although the plot may seem superficial, the narrative and its visual portrayal are absolutely fantastic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Nice movie,"I thought I was gonna watch another ridiculous blockbuster, but in fact, it was the opposite. The movie at its totality keeps a nice pace, it doesn't make you feel tired or willing to scream at some point ""That's it!"". Justin Timberlake is a good surprise I must admit. It is not an Academy Awards play, however, I've seen a lot of worse things . But Jesse Eisenberg is such a good actor that he doesn't need to make a huge effort to prove it. Softly, as the movie goes, he makes his character as big as the Mark Zuckenberg's bank account. By the way, Mark on this movie is seen as a genius, fast, non-sociable person, in other words, the villain. But is he? I don't think so. Andrew Garfield's character, Eduardo Saverin, the Brazilian Facebook co-founder, is kind of double-crossed by Mark (in Eduardo's point of view), but he knew that it might happen. The Winklevoss' twins are the really victims on this whole situation in my opinion. Their idea was completely stolen and, as we say in Brazil, it became Mark's golden chicken.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Origins And Evolution Of Facebook,"As someone who is admittedly a fan of Facebook (although I'm certainly no addict - at least that's my story and I'm sticking to it and I'm going to post it as my Facebook status just so everyone knows!) - I have been looking forward to seeing this movie about the origins and early evolution of the most successful social networking site on the internet. It does not disappoint. It's a fast-paced (some might say frenetically paced in places) account of how Mark Zuckerberg became (as the movie notes in its closing captions) the youngest billionaire in the world by developing the site, and of the various relationships that were built and destroyed in the process.Jesse Eisenberg was absolutely convincing as Zuckerberg, who comes across in this as the stereotypical computer geek - he has a certain nerdy likability, but nevertheless has few social skills, few friends and an obsession with computer programming. Zuckerberg's basic personality - or at least what this movie wants us to think is his basic personality (I've never met the guy, so who knows if it's true) - is brilliantly brought out in a hilarious opening scene of Zuckerberg on a date with Erica. The date goes horribly wrong. Due to his social ineptness, Zuckerberg insults Erica without meaning to and without even realizing it, gets told to take a hike and then angrily goes back to his Harvard dorm, gets drunk and still proceeds to blog about the experience in terms quite insulting and embarrassing to Erica, while at the same time developing an immediately popular website that manages to insult a significant portion of the female population at Harvard. His work brings him to the attention of the Winklevoss brothers, who want to set up a social networking site for in house use at Harvard and enlist Zuckerberg to help them. The rest, as they say, is history, as Zuckerberg takes their idea and builds on it (without giving them any credit.)Zuckerberg doesn't come across well in this. He's arrogant and egotistical - and yet at the same time there's admittedly a certain admirable quality to him. He's devoted, committed and totally unconcerned with money. But he also comes across as easily manipulated, falling in with Napster founder Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) - who comes across far worse than Zuckerberg - who helps him build Facebook, but at the expense of his relationship with his friend (perhaps his only real friend) Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield), who had been the co-founder of ""The Face Book,"" its only investor for a long time, the company's CFO and had devoted himself to trying to hustle advertising to generate revenue. If there's a truly sympathetic figure in this it's Savarin, who ends up being almost totally cut out of Facebook and escorted by guards out of the company's California offices.The movie revolves around a couple of legal proceedings. Zuckerberg (obviously after Facebook has become a mega-success) is being sued by both the Winklevoss brothers and Savarin, and the story unfolds as testimony is offered in the respective cases. It's fascinating to watch, and for anyone with an interest in social networking or who is in any way connected to others via Facebook it has to be rated as a must-see movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The morality tale for the 21st century we've all been waiting for.,"It's not hard to imagine that a biopic of the creation of facebook - a project that isn't even complete as its rise to world domination continues unabated - could be monumentally bad. For a start all of the characters in the movie are real, alive and known litigation junkies. In fact the structure of the film is built around litigation.What's more, it's set in geek land, and it's populated by America's landed money generation; a class of kids who are not exactly imbued with likability. Add to that the layer of egotism of successful entrepreneurs, that has to be applied if this is going to be a true reflection of the situation. And early on the movie dwell on a scene where the two key characters get off on the creation of an algorithm in a Harvard dorm and we're in a place that has to be bad; does it not? Well actually, no it doesn't, in fact I can't recall a biopic with such historical realism that betters this magnificent creation.David Fincher is a director of some impact. Fight Club and se7en, to name but two of his grisliest creations, typically hit you hard from the off and keep on hitting. Not the sort of director you'd expect to be behind a successful exploration of coding in the Ivy League's finest Halls of residence. But what Fincher does is dial back the excess and zone in on a cast of young people that somehow creates a magnificent and fully fleshed ensemble whilst giving Jesse Eissenberg the star vehicle that at its core it has to be. His portrayal of Mark Zuckenberg has to be seen to be believed. And believe me you'll believe it. This is direction and acting of the highest calibre.The establishing scene of Eissenberg in a College Union bar being dumped by his lifetime love Erica Albright (played gently and beautifully by Rooney Mara) is jaw-droppingly good for three reasons; the camera work (subtle and gorgeous throughout especially the tilt shift effect later in the movie in England's Henley), the dialogue (well what did you expect, Aaron Sorkin wrote the script) and the acting. And that's it. We're off and running for nearly two hours where the action never stops for a second and yet,; not a swear word is heard, no fights, no sex, no nudity, no special effects - so how can this be an action movie? And yet it is, it's hilarious (but there are no gags, no slapstick) and it makes you think from start to finish. Because what Fincher and Sorkin have achieved is a morality tale for our time; not with the big crass in-your-faceness that Wall Street revels in, but in the intellectual ethics of IP. Wherever you look in the movie you're challenged to think who was right and who was wrong.IP changes hands and evolves at such a dizzying speed that one wonders was it the germ of the idea or its evolution that created Facebook's value? Was Napster creator and serial entrepreneur Sean Parker (slyly played by Justin Trousersnake) a bandwagon-jumping opportunist or the real creator of Zuckerberg's ultimate wealth? Was Zuckerberg an impressionable but lovable innocent or a self-centred traitor to his only friend Eduardo Severin (also played sympathetically and at times the axis of the movie by Andrew Garfeild)? Was Severin a philanthropist or a pariah and were the Winklevosses (I lied there are special effects in this movie) real? I particularly liked the fact that Sorkin and Fincher avoided the temptation to rip into these ridiculous stereotypes , and in so doing, and gave them at least a shred of dignity by the film's end.Oh, did I mention the stunning soundtrack by Trent Reznor (NIN)? Well, if I didn't I should have because I'm going to buy the CD as soon as I've finished this review.This is a very good film indeed. It most certainly justifies a ten rating and I urge you to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"We lived on farms, then we lived in cities, and now we're going to live on the internet!","I would have never thought that the beginnings of Facebook was ""Hot or Not"". I guess there is no accounting for the taste of college boys. It was called Facemash.Thge basis of the film, based on Mark Zuckerberg's life, is who really started Facebook. The film jumps back and forth from a hearing on the matter to the past when it was created.The icing on the cake was adding the relationship status so people could hook up, and it wasn't long before he was with Malese Jow.Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) of Napster fame helped bring Facebook to the international sensation that it is.Zuckerberg was a genius and Jesse Eisenberg really nailed the part.It was a shame that for all his fame and money, he still regretted losing his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara).It helps if you know the companies mentioned, but I really believe you can enjoy the film by just focusing on the characters.

Fascinating story of the other side of Facebook,"It's a rare thing that I've walked into a cinema screening a new release that's been open for 4 days on a Sunday afternoon and struggled to find a decent seat. That was what I found though when I went to see The Social Network, it would appear that like the founding of the website it features the film is becoming a social phenomenon. I also found it interesting to see that perhaps ⅔ of the audience were of a certain more elderly age.You may not be on Facebook, but you'd be hard pressed be among the few that haven't at least heard of it. It is perhaps not important though, because as a film The Social Network manages to convey a fascinating story regardless of your user-ship of the involved site. David Fincher is an awesome talent and despite my reservations of this project when it first surfaced it is a very accomplished piece of work. Direction here is extremely tight, the story is straight forward and unfolds easily interspersed with moments from the legal proceedings. The way that the story unfolds is quite astonishing and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes across as a very clever man, brilliant with computers but also a general grasp of everything which makes him almost a little cold and calculated.Casting is great, Jesse Eisenberg is great as Zuckerberg with his quick fire dialogue, but elsewhere there is talent although I must say I struggled with Justin Timberlake in this. Dialogue and the script shine throughout and that's important as the film really is a dialogue based one, but it never falters throughout. The fascination also remains through out, the escalation of the site's popularity and therefore the financial side of events are incredible and this behind the scenes format gives you a different understanding of Facebook itself. The contrast of friends mucking around with the internet and the onset of million dollar lawsuits which in turn destroys friendships is shocking. The scenes that portray the legal proceedings where friends have become enemies and Zuckerberg almost outsmarts everyone are brilliant and for me are the real highlights of the film, yet as a whole it's difficult not to be at least a little fascinated.What is also remarkable is how Fincher has managed to make this story interesting, a quick look at this doesn't really provide a very thrilling story, but once you start watching, you can loathe Facebook or anything it stands for but still have a excellent film experience, the final outcomes and payouts are worth the journey alone, the outcome left me gob smacked. There is nothing like a good story and Facebook provides it.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Up to date real life success story,"Now you might wonder why yet an other review of this movie? Well, the more the better as it proves the movie is talked about which means it brings a message, like it or not. That is what Facebook is as well, like it or not. But in the end, it does not really matter as it has proved to be a success. The movie is well played. The story well written. It's a very believable story. I am sure not everything is like depicted in the movie but does that really matter? It's a movie, not a documentary. The characters play very believable personalities. I am not a ""drama"" watcher really, thrillers, war movies, that is my thing. But, I really enjoyed this movie.

Bold Face(book) Type,"Like others before me when I initially heard about this project I wondered what could a director as talented as David Fincher see in a Facebook movie? (I thought this was just a project to keep him busy before his take on ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"".)What Finch & writer Aaron Sorkin saw was an epic tale about human triumph & tragedy set in the digital age & pretty much encompassed in one man's soul. And now we see one of the very best films of the year. I rank it along with ""Se7en"" & ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" as one of Fincher's best films.Jesse Eisenberg is spectacular as FB founder Mark Zuckerberg in the most complex performance of the year. He is an unsympathetic underdog & yet I found myself siding with him. He is not an anti-hero. I often root for anti-heroes. This guy is something different altogether. Know what? There is no small amount of Lisbeth Salander in him or his portrayal here.But other actors shine here too: Andrew Garfield & Justin Timberlake (yeah, that Timberlake) hit it out of the park as the burned partner & the Svangeli.Sorkin's script is a marvel of fast-paced dialog & is funny as hell. I never thought I'd be laughing as much as I did here. This is, by far, Fincher's funniest film.Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography carries on his father's legacy proudly.

Didn't know Facebook had such an evil yet an intelligent brain as a back-end....,"Talk about social networking and one thing that pops up in our head first is none other than the famous site Facebook. Who on earth wouldn't be interested in knowing the story behind the famous social networking websites of all time.So Mark Zuckerberg is officially awesome. I was glad that the movie was being directed by none other than Fincher. I was excited beyond limit when I discovered that it was a David Fincher project, the guy behind such amazing movies like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and my all time-favourite The Game. His previous mind-boggling movies surely speaks of his virtue. As a director David Fincher has taken some of the brilliant stories of all times and metamorphosed them into the finest flicks created ever in the history of movies and The Social network happens to be one of them. Albeit Mark Zuckerberg in reality wasn't at all approached for the project and wasn't entailed anyhow in the flick, the movie was manifested as a series of events as they occurred altogether with the assistance of Eduardo Saverin(in real life). Each event was put down to the flick with the assistance offered by Eduardo and Boy! the story of facebook is interesting, must I say. The evolution of how the ideas arose from Facemash to TheFacebook and eventually Facebook is really surprising and wonderful as well. The story began with Mark Zuckerberg's(Jesse Eisenberg's) girlfriend breaking up with him thus causing him to dirty-blog about her to soothe his agonized heart. Taking it too far he compares her face to every girl in the Harvard and thus develops a website named FaceMash which had the feature of comparing 'who's hotter' which eventually brought down Harvard's network. The creation of FaceMash in one night brought him in the eyes of the twin Winklevoss brethren Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (played by Armie Hammer well that barely seemed like a single character) and their business partner Divya Narendra(Max Minghella) who gave Mark an idea about a new project of theirs - Harvard Connection website asking him to be their programmer. The main story begins when Zuckerberg gets his head to build a website named theFacebook without caring to look back at the Winklevoss brothers and in the long run dumping his best friend Eduardo Savarin(convincingly played by Andrew Garfield) as well as Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) the co-founder of Napster. The character Eduardo Savarin is well portrayed by Garfield who brings in the real sensitive part of the flick. Justin Timberlake has become more of an actor now and he did his bit in the flick very convincingly. As Sean Parker he suggests Mark Zuckerberg to drop the 'the' from theFacebook which clearly expounds why the whole world knows the website by the name of Facebook alone. The plot is very intricate and full of surprises as you would see Zuckerberg playing around with his friends turning them into foes while Eduardo's geniality is well exploited in the flick by Mark. There are instances in the movie that clearly depicts how much dedicated Mark Zuckerberg was to his website with more than 10-14 hours of coding everyday while some showed him making fun of the jury and the Winklevoss brothers of their ignorance, while one hilarious moment showed him stunning a teacher by his answers in the midst of his departure from the classroom. The movie is simply awesome. I didn't find anything wrong with the movie and I hope to see David Fincher's next as soon as it gets released. I'd recommend everyone to just go for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Monomania not social skills,"Here is a film that is impossible for me to review without interjecting my own experience as a software engineer. Most of what is shown in the film I have experienced in microcosm -- everything from a lawsuit, intellectual theft, the CS courses, spending countless hours writing source code, dealing with some of the most emotionally inept humans on the planet (and some of the most brilliant), being part of a start-up during the .dot com era, having a company grow exponentially (that company fell faster than Icarus, but that has not happened to Facebook, yet), money freely flowing and being betrayed. There are not many industries that are as paranoid as the software industry. The amount of non-disclosure agreements, paranoia and intellectual theft make the industry feel more like cloak and dagger than what an outsider to the industry might just think as a playground for nerds and geeks.Mark Zuckerberg has an idea. Well technically (the best kind of correct) two twin rowers the Winklevoss's have an idea (both played by Armie Hammer). To improve a social network specific to Harvard. They recruit Zuckerberg after he performs a hack that brings down the school network with a program that allows users to compare the looks of randomly chosen females downloaded from several sites. But Mark avoids the two and with a business partner and best friend Eduardo Saverin (and one additional programmer) set out to create their own version of a social network for the school. Ideas are constantly stolen and you expect that they will be stolen. So it is a bit harder for me to feel for the Winklevoss's on this issue. Their naivety seems a bit much for Harvard, but it does happen. Its exponential popularity helps excite the interest of nerd-badboy (played well by Justin Timberlake) Sean Parker whose narcissistic behavior is legendary and only upstaged by a company he helped create in Napster. With this unholy union the company expands even more. But at what cost and will it survive the enemies that have been created not only by the success, but by the enemies created from within the company.Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg is sublime and spot-on. It does not help if you have been around many variants of this personality and their borderline (or full) Asperger's Syndrome. They are certainly easier to take in a two-hour movie, but not as fun when you work with them and every single perceived fault is ripe for an acerbic comment. But the monomania that is displayed akin to The Nutty Professor while stereotypical is quite true. When you are working on a problem or a perceived solution it can dominate you and make you oblivious to anything else. His surly and sarcastic conduct no matter what the setting certainly defies social normalcy (especially in the trials), but that is also quite true of this creature.While I do feel the film has been overrated, and I am somewhat glad it did not win the Oscar, I do feel it is a good film and I enjoyed watching it. There is some sloppiness to it though. In a particular scene to show Mark Zuckerberg's intellectual prowess as he leaves in the middle of a problem in a CS course (leaving for a personal issue) the professor calls him out and states that not everyone will be successful, in response he of course answers the question to the bewilderment of the professor. This is analogous to the ""Jeopardy"" scenes in films where answering is to show your mental acuity. Another scene was the ""Eureka"" scene where an individual comes to him and discusses an idea which facilitates hey The Facebook needs a marital status. That idea has been used way before The Facebook (BBSs for example).It also seems weird to me that they eschewed the whole MySpace rivalry. I know you have to streamline a story, but that was such an important part of so many decisions and attitude that Facebook went through that it seem like a whitewash of history.Though I have to admit David Fincher made a difficult subject interesting. If you focus too much on software concepts you will have a film full of jargon that is indecipherable to but a few. He kept this at a minimum with a few references here and there with, I think, only one mention of Perl and a few mentions of PHP. This is wrong in the portrayal because these individuals nomenclature would be esoteric (though still quite sarcastic, the amount of jokes I have heard on design patterns like a Singleton or basic concepts like hash maps could drive a person crazy), but I certainly would not dock the film for taking the high road. In fact because of this I really enjoyed the sardonic dialog. Also, the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which would win an Oscar, is outstanding.

"Sharp and refreshing, 'The Social Network' has much to Like.","Directed by David Fincher (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) based on a book by Ben Mezrick called Accidental Billionaires, The Social Network is the story of Harvard undergraduate and computer programmer Mark Zuckerberg (Jason Eisenberg), who works on a new idea for a social website with his friend straight out of his dorm room. Called Facebook, it becomes a global social network, garnering 500 million users and making Mark the youngest billionaire in history, while also creating some enemies and legal complications.Right off the bat, let me first say that The Social Network is a well-made film. Director David Fincher's stylistically visual direction, Aaron Sorkin's acerbic dialogue, and Jason Eisenberg's near effortless-seeming performance are what make this film beyond the usual biographical businessman-and-his-dream Hollywood tale. What's unusual about this film's subject is that the main character of this film is to this day, quite young, which also means the story doesn't span a very long period of time. So, a good majority of the film focuses on the details--dialogues, interpersonal relationships, and brain-storming sessions. I take it the main reason for even making a film about this is the fact that Mark Zuckerberg holds the title of being the ""youngest billionaire.""The majority of the film takes place in Harvard, where we see Mark, his calculated personality, his interactions with his friends, and nurturing of his ideas. Jason Eisenberg is able to bring out the nerdy genius of Mark Zuckerberg with spit-fire delivery helped by witty, acerbic dialogue and geek-speak. His performance is convincing and makes it seem like Eisenberg is just playing himself and that he is the genius. Also good is his business-minded best friend, Eduardo Saverin, played sympathetically by Andrew Garfield (reportedly the next Peter Parker in the Spider-Man reboot), the more level-headed of the two owners of Facebook, portraying both the uneasiness and insecurity of being out of the loop when Sean Parker (played smart and confidently by Justin Timberlake), founder of Napster, comes into the picture, wanting to take Facebook to another direction. AdvertisementOn the whole, the story is about how Facebook came to be and the people who created it and people who fought against it. There are some familiar conventionalities in this film like many biographies of this kind, along with greed, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Structurally, it's nothing new. The story is framed within a meeting between Mark and the people and their lawyers who want to sue him for breach of contract or intellectual theft. We go back and forth between this current event and the past events in Harvard that helped create this popular network.Not unlike Fight Club, David Fincher has a way of making any scene visually interesting. With camera blurs for depth of field, along with his sense of composition and color schemes, he makes scenes feel both surreal and personal. Even the beginning wide-shot credit sequence of Mark walking through the Harvard campus amongst groups of people he doesn't know is interesting in how it visually portrays the whole ""social network"" idea.While Zuckerberg is portrayed sympathetically in this film, he isn't particularly seen here as a good guy, either—thus, the enemies. I suppose the irony of the film is how a site that is meant to create friends also created enemies for Mark. I enjoyed the quick-witted dialogue that came out of Mark's mouth. They don't try to dumb down the character for the audience, which is refreshing. To appreciate this film, it probably helps to know how Facebook looks like and how it works. For those who have used it, they know Facebook itself isn't really that complex or new—it's a site that is incorporated in such a way that it's easy, loads quickly, is somewhat safe, and works great with plugins. And, it is, of course, quite popular. There's little doubt there will be some who will be confused by the computer jargon in this film, but they need not worry as it doesn't contribute much to the plot (yet still cool to hear anyway). I wouldn't go far as to say this film defines the modern generation, like some have, which I found to be a strange statement. It is, however, a sharp, nicely-made film, and more refreshing than usual. I'm sure many users will have little problems putting this film on their Facebook's 'Like' list.You can also follow my movie review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Connected, hooked, obsessed, hypnotized, almost drugged!","First things first: The story is seemingly fictional. Judging by certain interviews, pics and clips, Marc's character portrayed laconically, by Jesse, is quite contrasting to the real Marc. Though both have similar facial features, curly hair, mechanical speech pattern, Marc's eyes have warmth,zaniness and simplicity (also nerdiness). Jesse's Marc's eyes are piercing, sport an egotistic look. Real Marc looks like a video game loving nerd, but the latter is crazily obsessive, narcissistic, unfriendly, stoic and caustic. Anne Wintour of whiz world.Social Network scintillating uplifts what could have been a patronizing Flash Dance/Blind Side ruckus and transforms into a raging tempest, nimble, witty, perky, wondrous and dazzling. An Oscar class script (sadly the Oscars are presently worth nothing due to rash decisions)Another Oscar (and hopefully other related awards) in the kitty for the sharp, audacious, gravitating music. David Flincher's Curious case... was cumbrous, banal, condescending but this proves to be a rebound, scoring one over Inception too. Best Director and Best film of the year (unless better films arrive) for a simulating experience. The beginning of the movie, I wanted to throw a glass of water on Marc's arrogant face, and the movie made me feel claustrophobic, overwhelmed, beleaguered and humiliated like the female character. Crisp direction with no redundancy.Jesse rightfully deserves an Oscar nomination for playing a character of contrasting virtues- respectable yet loathsome, stoic yet empathetic (though in the end), rude yet smart and perky. Another Oscar nomination lock-on is Andrew Garfield whose character undergoes four stages, trust, ambiguity, betrayal and redemption.Supporting cast all exceed expectations: Brenda Song as alluring girlfriend (breaking her Disney Barbie-persona), Justin Timberlake (quite likable) and the twins in a fairly easy performances. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A culturally and socially important piece of work that is enthralling from beginning to end,"If you were this columnist's webmaster, you won't be too happy to hear this confession. Instead of focusing on churning out a movie review, he would be switching between windows to check on the latest news feed on Facebook. How that affects work efficiency is one thing, the other aspect of this six year old social network service is how it has taken over our lives.The last he checked (after writing the above paragraph, nonetheless), this single and January born (hunt down his Facebook account to verify these facts) columnist has 449 friends. Why the constant need to refresh the Facebook page? Mark Zuckerberg would understand – at least that's how the Mark Zuckerberg in David Fincher's movie is portrayed.Adapted from Ben Mezrich's non fiction book The Accidental Billionaires, this drama chronicles the founding of the now famous social networking website. Some seven years ago, no one would have heard of Facebook until Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin and their team of technical experts came together to create this phenomenal online tool. The story also involves a certain Napster co founder Sean Parker and a pair of Harvard twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The 121 minute movie tells the story of how friendships were formed, as well as how enemies were made in the founding of what may possibly be the most culturally and socially important networking website of our time.Given the subject matter, it is difficult not to dwell on the actualities of what happened in real life, but Fincher (Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) knows too well that he is making a movie for the masses. Thus, the resultant work is a crisply intelligent and emotionally engaging movie that further marks his place in the industry as an acclaimed filmmaker.While it is important to note that none of the Facebook staff or employees was involved in the making of this movie, you have to give credit to Aaron Sorkin's sharply written screenplay because it manages to keep the pace of the talky movie going. Highly celebrated musicians Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also come together to compose a very hip electronica driven score to accompany the film. The effective cinematography and editing by Jeff Cronenweth, Kirk Baxtyer and Angus Wall also complement Fincher's clear cut filmmaking style. The flashbacks are well executed, and humour is evident in the characters' dialogues. Most importantly, there is emotional punch, as exemplified by the human connections and relationships which are built and torn apart in the story. Ultimately, it is a tale about how a man who manages to connect the world is a loner desperately trying to find his own connection.Fincher's fresh cast of actors do a fine job of depicting their characters too. Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland) brings out the nonchalant brilliance of Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield (The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus) exudes the will power of Eduardo Saverin, and Justin Timberlake (Shrek Foerver After) personifies Sean Parker's slimy entrepreneurial spirit. They are supported by other fine actors like Brenda Song, Arnie Hammer, Max Minghella and Rooney Mara.This is clearly an ambitious project, considering how worldwide viewers (the 500 million Facebook users included) will be anticipating the story of Facebook. Like the website itself, the movie is culturally and socially significant in contemporary cinema –be ready to see the movie acknowledged for a job well done during awards season.While this columnist is still at it, he would recommend you to life MovieXclusive.com on Facebook, and if you must know, as he ends off this review, he has just added one more friend to his page, making his total number of friends to 450.Now, it's time to upload those photos he took at the party last night.www.moviexclusive.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Nutwing,"The evidence is clear that Mark Zuckerberg (as portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg) could be the poster child for ADHD meds/treatment. Was there MORE to this film?, I thought. Yes, indeed. ""The Social Network"" became more complex and interesting when it got beyond the initial geeky clutter. The individuals who played significant roles in MZ's life and work make the facebook-creation story pretty amazing. Yes, he is an a**hole but the movie isn't just about him. From his ex-girlfriend (played by Rooney Mara) to the Harvard faculty, early fb investors, and the MZ/fb groupies, this IS a remarkable story.To wit: I think Justin Timberlake did a superb acting job as the developer of Napster as he portrays the greedy, self-centered Silicon Valley ""dude"" with obnoxious aplomb. His involvement in facebook's development hilariously brings out the cheesy side of Zuckerberg. Good stuff.""The Social Network"" watched in its entirety proves worthwhile.

Friend Zone,"2 unbelievably spellbinding hours. The Social Network is one of the best films of the 2010's. A film emblematic of the cold, cutthroat word of tech as we know it. Unlike most biopics about influential people, The Social Network does not portray Mark Zuckerberg as inspiring. You could call him an antihero, but that would suggest that the audience likes him enough to sympathize with him. Zuckerberg is a villain. A villain that won. The Social Network tells a story of injustice, with enough self-awareness to know that despite the damning details, it won't matter a wit. Zuckerberg created Facebook and there's not a thing anyone can do about it. In that sense, there's an irony to the story. It's a film about a social network built on the premise of friendship, that was forged in a avalanche of broken friendships. If that weren't enough, Zuckerberg is seen here as an obnoxious sociopath. The opposite of anyone to be friends with. David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin were a match made in heaven. It's Sorkin's most biting and cynical written work, paired with the green, gloomy visual realm that only Fincher is known for. Jesse Eisenberg is Zuckerberg, and it's the role of his career. I don't know what it says about him that he can play this character so well. One would hope he's nicer than this in person.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
The Social Network invites you as a friend; accept it!,"It's been the Internet sensation that you just could not avoid, and it's now on at a cinema near you.It isn't a feel good story but rather charts the rise of the website under Mark Zuckerberg and the recriminations his site creates. Damaged relationships with his girlfriend, best mate and original business colleagues make for a tale that feels more like something from Wall Street's investment bankers rather than the more personable stories of the web.Filmed with the backbone being a set of parallel double lawsuits against Mark Zuckergerg, the story of Mark and his site fills in the rest and quite a meaty story it is to.Good acting with a cast that more than convinces in their roles dive us into this world. Nobody is fully lovable but you won't feel repulsed. Avoids over emotional baggage thankfully and concentrates on the amoral ambitious attitudes that are what is pushing everyone! Filming is great as they avoid lots special effects or the like despite the techie nature of the film (although there is a neat piece of CGI used for the twins in the film which you may not notice).

Is it really a movie?,"THe first thing I should do is declare an interest - or maybe it'd be more accurate to say a LACK of it. I didn't come to this film with a particularly open mind. I actively dislike Facebook and the whole ""social networking"" phenomenon, so if a drama about its origins was to keep me on board for the whole ride, it would have an uphill battle on its hands.Sure enough, by about 20 minutes in, I was getting restless. Simon Amstell - sorry, Jesse Eisenberg - does a great job as Zuckerberg, but the script portrays him as such a thoroughly unlikeable, asocial being that I found it pretty hard to give a damn about what he was doing, and his fellow Harvard undergrads were portrayed as a pretty vacuous bunch of twerps too, which didn't help. Fortunately, the character of co-founder Eduardo Saverin provided somebody to care about. Then - before my hand had strayed too close to my coat - the plot began to thicken nicely, and thereafter the pacing kept us bowling along to the finish line.Was it worth sticking with it to the end? On the whole, yes: it's a fairly satisfying drama. However, I'm not sure that it really qualifies as ""a movie"". A tale well told it may be, but to me it felt more like it belonged on the small screen - as a two-part TV drama, perhaps - not as something you'd willingly part with hard cash to go and see in a cinema. Oh, and one final thing: can somebody PLEASE tell David Fincher that incredibly dingy, yellow-lit interiors aren't atmospheric - they're just very difficult to see!",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Fincher Proves He Can Make a Great Movie About Anything, Including Facebook","I had serious doubts when I heard there would be a movie based on the creation of popular social network Facebook. What could possibly be interesting enough to devote an entire film to a website where people routinely post pictures of their meals, play hundreds of crappy games, and stalk each other's every move? Well if there's one thing I should've learned by now, it's never doubt director David Fincher. Fincher's immense talent coupled with the sharp writing of Aaron Sorkin combine to bring us one of the best films of 2010. Based on the biography ""The Accidental Billionaires"", the film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg, an antagonistic genius who finds inspiration in a drunken night of retaliatory hacking/blogging and a subsequent pitch from classmates for a new social networking website. He focuses his inspiration, along with funding from his best (and only, really) friend Eduardo Saverin, creates Facebook and watches it explode in popularity across the world. The story is framed within depositions for two lawsuits brought against Zuckerberg, one from Saverin and the other from his classmates that accuse Zuckerberg of stealing their idea.Fincher's movie is a slick, fast-paced story that immediately grabs your attention from the opening scene, with Zuckerberg's high speed rant to his girlfriend over final clubs and standing out in a college full of geniuses. Right away, we know from his dismissive attitude and his arrogance that Zuckerberg is not a good guy, and we see over the course of the next two hours how self-centered he really is. I'd thought Jesse Eisenberg was great in ZOMBIELAND and he proves he's more than just the ""new Michael Cera"" with his excellence as Mark Zuckerberg. He helps turn Zuckerberg into a complex character; in the DVD commentary, Fincher notes that it wasn't meant to be the breakup with his girlfriend that drove him to create Facebook as a means of impressing her, showing her why she should be with him. But to me, that's exactly how the movie plays out: Zuckerberg is hurt when his girlfriend leaves him and everything he does for the rest of the film is merely an attempt to regain her attention and show her what he's become.THE SOCIAL NETWORK was my choice for Best Picture this past Oscar season and I was sad to see it lose. Along with TOY STORY 3, this was one of the top movies of 2010. It came as a major surprise and it blew me away. The cast was fantastic; even Justin Timberlake continues to prove he has strength as a legitimate actor (for further proof, see BLACK SNAKE MOAN). Andrew Garfield was great as Zuckerberg's former best friend, Eduardo Saverin, and I'll be curious to see how his career progresses after such a high profile film. Finally, we have Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's award-winning score for the film: a sharp synthetic sound that feels at home in a Fincher film and gives it a familiar feel. This film is wonderful; how accurate it was to actual events, I couldn't tell you. As a story playing out on the big screen, I loved it. I'm sure there are people out there who won't have an interest in seeing a movie about the creation of a social networking website, but it's a lot more than that and I hope most people will give it a chance to surprise them, as it had me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

I thought for sure this film would either demonize him, or them, or everyone. Instead what we got looked like a pretty decent and realistic account of how this deal went down. No one was demonized  well except for maybe Sean Parker of Napster infamy. Every side was represented fairly via their own perceptions. The dialogue was fast-paced – sometimes hard to follow. Zuckerberg was played flawlessly with lightspeed razor sharp quips that left recipients in shock and awe. I went in thinking I would be bored out of my mind.

"Ah, the ironies","Terrific hatchet-job story of Mark Zuckerberg, genius, oddball, killer-competitive greedfreak, and perhaps Asperger-afflicted founder of Facebook. Whether I agree about the value of Facebook is not relevant to the worth of this film, as it is one of the best high tech film stories of the new millennium and revolves around what is now just so critical to many millions of people around the world.....internet social networking(OMG!).Even though his mother may have overdone it with endless ""be sure to close your mouth"" admonitions in his youth(you'll see), Jesse Eisenberg was fantastic as the mind-in-his-head, maybe-inventor of internet social networking(but probably not, as shown)Zuckerberg, as was Andrew Garfield playing Eduardo Saverin, his his best friend and co-founder, maybe not as brainy but way more emotionally healthy. The rest of the cast was equally good, even Justin Timberlake was terrific, but with his outsized ego in full speed mode I am not sure he was ""acting"" as Sean Parker, the cocky inventor of Napster and world-class devious manipulator. This story sadly but powerfully showed so well that youthful vigor, uber-creative ideas, killer-competitive juices, and premier business connections and execution will always be the best allies to selling out all previously held moral/ethical principles for the sake of humongous bucks and great fame.But, that said, the massive in-your-face ironies of the story were what was most interesting by far. Zuckerberg, as shown, was not social at all but wanted desperately to create a ""social network"". He also initially didn't care a bit about being rich, but he is now America's youngest billionaire ever. He also didn't think advertising was ""cool"" on Facebook and was initially repulsed by it, but now his resistance ethics are well past totally sold-out and Facebook makes billions every year in advertising and rivals Google as the net's biggest ad bank. How many more personal ironies could the filmmaker have shown about Zuckerberg? And, can they all be that true?Thus, the story candidly displayed how easily and quickly one's honorable intentions can get left far behind when big money and fame arrives on the doorstep in truckloads. It also showed that even lifelong best friends and business partners are not safe when big success comes calling in its mask of many faces.See this perhaps best film of the year and learn some great net business startup savvy and pitfalls, but try not to get sucked into the money-making end of it. At least try for a minute or two to make your mom happy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
It's About the Girl,"Ironically, Facebook is all about the girl. In the opening of Director David Fincher's ""The Social Network"", Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) gets dumped by his girlfriend BU student Erica Albright (strong and spirited Rooney Mara), and rightfully so. Erica tells Mark that he may rationalize that he is getting dumped, because he is a geek. No—""It'll be because you're an a—hole."" Outraged, Mark bashes Erica on his blog, and exacts his anger in the form of Facemash—where Harvard students get to rate the hotness of coeds. So the inception of Facebook was about Mark using his powers for evil, not good. Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") brilliantly tells the story of the rise of Facebook and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg based on Ben Mezrich's ""The Accidental Billionaires"". Granted his screenplay is part urban legend, and part real life drama about the social network Facebook which has 500 million members. Zuckerberg has altered the world.In the eyes and ears of Fincher and Sorkin is the great paradox: The creator of The Social Network is an alienated genius, predominately by his own doing. Jesse Eisenberg deftly borders sympathetic misunderstood genius and world class a—hole. It may be safe to surmise that the real Zuckerberg lies somewhere between the extremes—or perhaps not. ""The Social Network"" is one the best movies of the year. Whether ""The Social Network"" defines a generation? Only time will tell. ""The Social Network"" plays like Internet tragedy. An ingenious idea captures the social consciousness, and culminates in a multimillion dollar lawsuit, pitting former friends against each other. At the catharsis, Mark's attorney Marylin Delphy (compassionate and smart Rashida Jones) tells him, ""You're not an a—hole. You just try so hard to be one."" Thomas Hardy said character is fate. Mark attained unimaginable wealth and success. No doubt he has an amazing life. In the final scene Fincher poignantly makes us wonder: Is Mark really happy and complete? Because Fincher and Sorkin make us care about this boy genius, who would be king.""The Social Network"" is a warped rites of passage tale filled with deception and fascinating archetypes. Mark (Eisenberg) goes into business with his loyal roommate Eduardo Saverin (brilliant and earnest Andrew Garfield), who actually finances Mark's brain child. Mark's Facemash attracts the attention of the Winklevoss Twins, Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer), who are blond, blue eyed, blue blood scholar athletes. Cameron and Tyler enlist Mark to develop their idea for a Harvard based on-line social network. Enter the seductive Sean Parker (amazing Justin Timberlake), co-founder of Napster and the dark force that discerns Facebook as the next big thing. Unlike Mark's other colleagues, Sean gets that what makes Facebook work is that it is cool. Timberlake is charismatic and dangerous—he is becoming a powerful actor. Sean wins over Mark with flash, money, and women. He tells Mark, ""This is our time!"" Friendships end and unholy alliances form, and in the end—betrayal.So the world may have been a lot different if Mark actually apologized to Erica. Then again, character is fate. ""The Social Network"" is awesome and on some level very sad. Sometimes the very genius that triumphs may ultimately be a curse. ""The Social Network"" asks the poignant question: Was it worth it? On the surface this is a no brainer, and we all have to live with our choices and the aftermath.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"

""The Social Network"" is a movie about the inventors and the programmers, and the things that make them bother to program and invent.Margaret Atwood put interesting words in the mouth of her protagonist in ""Oryx and Crake."" ""The male frog in mating season makes as much noise as it can. ... Small male frogs -- it's been documented -- discover if they position themselves in empty drainpipes, the pipe acts as a voice amplifier and the small frog appears much larger than it really is. So that's what art is for the artist, an empty drainpipe. An amplifier. A stab at getting laid."" Mark Zuckerberg, brilliantly played as a borderline Asperger's case by Jesse Eisenberg, is the very incarnation of this energy. His art is programming. He uses it to get back at the people - women - he feels have given him short shrift. He uses it to gain attention, and perhaps secretly hopes to be loved for it. His frustrations lead him to build the road that half a billion people travel along, on their way to each other. For him, it may be a dead end.The movie gets everything right. The screenplay has been exalted in many words; I'll only say that if you enjoy hearing intelligent conversation, the first scene is all the encouragement you need. As a place where people could plausibly have these kinds of conversations in real life, Harvard is the perfect setting - and justice is finally done to an Ivy League school, after years of nerf visions like ""The Skulls."" The pacing of the movie is relentless - no slow second act, and a big exhale after two hours.

Love the enigmatic disjointed time sequence format by the way,"The advertising of David Fincher's latest film misleadingly introduces a nagging expository sermon on the interlinking worlds of business and cyberspace; however, the film itself heartily agrees with the audience that the aforementioned notions have been tiresomely overdone and instead leads gives them a rousing good time venturing into the thrillingly vibrant lives of several colourful characters. It satisfyingly turns down the obvious option of trying to be deeply moving and meaningful – a hapless endeavour that would inevitably produce another unbearable saccharine bore – in favour of using the opportunity to let us relish the scandalous immorality behind Facebook's creation while it remains safely on the other side of the screen.Computer enthusiast Mark Zuckerberg (brilliantly portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg) is the clever audacious youth miles ahead of the rest who coolly weaves a hazardous tangled web of crafty manipulative feats throughout the film. With a razor-sharp tongue and an unwavering confidence that some may find overbearing, although others may think it justified given his intellectual superiority, he casually and entertainingly parades about the world wielding his remarkable capabilities in a very Holmes-like fashion.Along the way, Mark has a brush with a pair of brawny hot-tempered male twins (both played by Armie Hammer) who at least provided the inspiration for creating the internet giant, and end up suing him for what they belief was the theft of their intellectual property. He also makes ill-fated dealings with fellow networking entrepreneur Sean Parker, (a surprisingly well-cast Justin Timberlake) who effortlessly influences Mark and the audience with his rebellious charm and exciting ideas to secure a share of the company. Sean too carries a sense of fun and upbeat charisma as a movie character harmless in our world of reality.Superbly written by Aaron Sorkin, to whom we have a great many pricelessly witty dialogue pieces to thank for, The Social Network is mostly a slick, stylish, glamorous and highly entertaining medley of ambitious backstabbing teenagers who are also understandably human, but the incorporation of their emotions is kept to a very sensible minimum. The more depressing scenes towards the end and the characters of Mark's loyal friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), gentle ex-girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) and kindly lawyer Marilyn Delpy (Rashida Jones) manage to provide all of the sentimentality that is needed or wanted here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
For Pete's Take - The Social Network,"Movie review by Peter Letso, Jr. On 11/17/10Full disclosure: From the moment I first sat down to watch this extraordinary film, I figured out that writing a review of The Social Network would be pointless, given the large number of accolades it has already garnered. I mean, is there anyone who hasn't heard of Facebook?So, I decided to compose a movie preview. (Not a review, and not a prequel). Why a preview? The reasons are seemingly endless yet definitely worth examining:The film was inspired by author Ben Mezrich's bestselling book The Accidental Billionaires, (2009), and is (obviously) based on an actual event.For director David Fincher, The Social Network may ultimately go down in history as his most lauded effort. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's liberal use of gallows humor has a playful effect on the film's witty dialogue. This film has great depth on very many levels, which is likely the main reason that it's enjoying so much repeat business, a la The Titanic, (1997). Thus, recurring audiences may very well need a refresher, or preview.This is one of the best-reviewed movies in the history of cinema. Along with a plethora of 4 and 5-star appraisals, it has experienced a consistent 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Since its inception in 2003, Facebook has become a worldwide social phenomenon.The casting is spot on: Jesse Eisenberg was fine in Adventureland (2009) and Zombieland (2009). This is his breakthrough performance as the socially awkward hacker extraordinaire and quite possibly neurotic Marc Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield (Never Let Me Go, 2010; Untitled Spider-Man Reboot, currently in pre-production) nearly steals the show as Eduardo Saverin, Facebook's CFO and Zuckerberg's only friend. Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, Saverin's nemesis, proves himself to be more than an award-winning singer songwriter - this guy has real acting chops. Rooney Mara (the U. S. version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, currently filming in Sweden) as Zuckerberg's girlfriend Erica Albright is luminous in her cameo role. Also, the kid from Jurassic Park is in it - Joseph Mazzello (as Dustin Moskovitz) played young Tim in the 1993 Spielberg extravaganza. Armie Hammer excels as the doubly dynamic Winkelvoss twins, who wrestle with Zuckerberg for Facebook's supremacy every step of the way.A number of reviewers have favorably compared The Social Network to none other than the legendary film Citizen Kane, (1941). Crazy? Maybe not so much.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of rock music's Nine Inch Nails fame have collaborated on a positively chilling musical score that you will want to download or go off and grab at the local record store.Finally, you don't need to be a Facebook ""friend""/member to enjoy this film. All you need is popcorn and a pulse.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Socialising for Lonely Sad People,"The irony of the Social Network is....The guy who invented Facebook obviously had a reasonably high I Q. Yet the people who use it (you know those people who use the word ""awesome"" over and over and over..etc. etc.) have I.Q.s bordering on mentally challenged. Those poor things believe they have an average of 130 ""friends !!"". They are the loneliest critters on the planet. Anyway--this is a slick flick. Not a good movie but perfect for all the Facebook fans who went along to see it. Jesse Elsenberg is brilliant playing the horrible, distasteful Mark Zuckerberg. It did well at the box office, and must have made a fortune from the placement of well known bottles of beer. Strictly a movie that does not require multiple viewings....and a few years from now ...it will be forgotten.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
A great biopic about a not too great man,"A movie that aims to capture the success of a single individual tends to be misread by those dissatisfied with their current situation. When I first watched this movie, I had trouble enjoying it due to my hatred of Facebook. As I've gotten older I've learned to enjoy this film as one of Fincher's best directed features.Looking at his backlog, Fight Club can come off as amateurish, preachy, and some scenes feel like they've been done better in other films. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was overlong and given to sentimentality. The Social Network, by comparison, is tight, sharply written, and incredibly wellshot.Its impossible to write about this film without acknowledging the current Mark Zuckerberg and his controversy. The fictional Mark and the real Mark are hardly the same person, and this doesn't affect my score of the film, but I can see it negatively impacting many other people's experience of the film.Seeing Fincher's latest feature The Killer, I sadly believe he will never live up to the heights of The Social Network. However idealized the film may be, I cannot dislike it as others have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Blooming Brilliant,"To be honest, not a film I was anticipating at all. But after watching, i feel it to be one of the best films I've seen this year! there's lots of brilliant acting from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and surprisingly Justin Timberlake. Overall a very interesting movie about the rise of ""facebook"", even more interesting as i am a ""Facebook"" member making the film have a more personal touch to a wide variety of audiences. i can not express how good the film is without giving anything away about the movie as i strongly suggest that you go out and watch it! a must see for anyone and everyone of any age and any preference of genre :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Very Captivating,"A very entertaining and well made movie.
It has an interesting story, it is well written with strong dialog and well directed. The cast and the performances and perfect. The story is presented possibly in the perfect way possible. The movie doesn't try to make Zuckerberg look like a angel, but tells the true story behind facebook. I love the pacing of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"Thoroughly engrossing film about the origins of Facebook, the players behind it, and the reasons for the lawsuits that arose from its birth.","Brilliant! I loved the pacing, the music, the acting and more... definitely one of the year's best!The dialogue and characters are unusual, fascinating, appealing... yet also somewhat repellent in their brilliance. We get a glimpse into the challenge of being a genius at the expense of social graces, but it's also that detachment from caring that provides some of the sharpest verbal comebacks. Stinging in their truthfulness, what normally might be left unsaid is a joy to see spoken with such disdain & conviction!If you have any bit of entrepreneurial spirit, you will be inspired by this movie. It's invigorating to see the incredible potential of one brilliant idea mixed with timing and understanding it's growth mechanisms (so as not to ruin the potential). Also important is the underlying message that poor business decisions and dishonesty will most likely bite you in the butt. The bigger the business, the bigger the dogs chasing you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Movie to justify the most unethical billionaire,"Let's face the facts. The movie is only 40% true. Mark Zuckerberg and his company steals data of non Facebook users, steal videos from original content creators and make money showing ads on them. A movie to glorify the guy is just wrong and definitely biased.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Sensory Overload,"Have you ever had the feeling of being watched, not only by your best friend but your neighbor, long lost cousin, and the kid you randomly met last night? I have, and Facebook is the reason. Now don't get me wrong, I was ecstatic my freshman year in high school when I received the email informing me I had been invited to Facebook, well TheFacebook at the time. Away with Myspace and hello to endless clicking on the mouse for hours at a time. Facebook offers an inside look into your friends personal life, creating sensory overload if you use it too much. The majority of people, even my Grandma in Canada have Facebook and I found myself realizing I could not get away from it. I along with millions have to check Facebook every chance I get, and with technological advances it became easier and accessible through cell phones. What is it that makes a person so anxious when typing in their password to login, if it has't already been auto saved? I'll tell you what is it...it's that little red caption box under ""notifications"" informing you on wall post, photo comments and whatever it is that a friend did relating back to your account. Facebook creates an unspoken language for communicating through a software that understands you because of your interaction with the website. The Social Network leaves viewers feeling like one of the creators alongside Mark and his colleagues. The dramatic music, symbolism and excellent acting makes for a compelling plot. The movie gives you an inside look at the creation of a billionaire and his company. Can you even fathom $6.9 billion, that's Marks estimated net worth? The movie takes you through every detail of the creation of Facebook and the ridiculous lawsuits against the site. It shows how pathetic and greedy some are for the sake of money. The movie exposes how fast and popular the site became in a matter of months and the cleverness of one Harvard student. If anything one might be disappointed when the credits begin to roll because it's one of those movies you don't want to end. Although the movie has ended everyone watching is wondering the same thing, what's next for Facebook? and will it ever end? After watching The Social Network twice and being completely fascinated by Facebook, I decided to deactivate my Facebook account. I couldn't get away from it and watching the movie made me realize this. After six devoted years on the site I've decided to take a break from Facebook and see how interacting with friends is different because I'm not connected with them threw a website. This was an AWESOME movie and I recommend it to any who has a pulse and knows how to use a computer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
First Review for my Favorite Film,"So, I have decided which is favorite movie of all time. It's ''the social network"". And I have no reason to explain that.One of David Fincher's best movie!I can watch this movie in loop, starting from any point in the movie line, for no reason at all.The soundtrack has been in my Spotify wrapped every year since I started listening to it.To some one who wants to learn about editing and screenplay writing, this movie is teaches so many things. The screenplay which is very smart and sharp. Great performances from Eisenberg, Garfield and Timberlake.PS, it was a foreshadow to what kind of person Mark Zuckerberg would become.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Masterpiece.,"10/10. Beautifully acted, directed. Superb soundtrack. Believe it or not, but this movie beaten Fight Club for me. I love how Fincher makes movie about Facebook, and he makes it so damn interesting. This movie alone makes Fincher 2nd favourite director. After Stanley Kubrick. Please if you like good movies, this is movie for you. Everything in this movie is Amazing. Watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
"""Almost"" There, But Not Yet.","I had a great pleasure of watching this movie; almost everything about it was great. It has got a brilliant script and dialogue, spectacular director, well acted group of young actors and though I can't really find the flaw in the movie there was something missing which kept this movie from being a classic.Synopsis: Base on the true story of the man who created Facebook.com (the world largest social networking website).I love the story and how everything has been arrange out in the great sequences. What really amazing was they managed to make movie with all talk so much fun from the beginning to the end. There is no dull moment in The Social Network. The movie is well pace and the script is absolutely brilliant. I love the story but I also think it is the thing that kept it from being a classic – the subject of the story is somehow to me not very ""deep"" (hard to say but I think that is the word I was looking for). Despite all the greatness the screenplay it's seem to lack depth and most character was all in the surface. I wish I could feel more. And also the fact that it was technology base movie, it will get dated sometime in the near future.Love the casting of this movie – they all happen to look much smarter than their counterpart here than in real life. Anyway the actors play their part well and it fitted the movie perfectly, love the character The Winklevoss twin and Eduardo. You got to give credit to Mr. Fincher for casting Mr. Timberlake and turn him into an OK actor here. Now, that was a lot of work.Who can question the ability of Mr. Fincher and his technique of movie making? This man seems to know what he is doing. Anyway what really standout in this movie is the editing and how they unfold and mix present with past in the movie really well without getting distracted. The score also fit the sequences well.Final Words: I enjoy watching is movie through and through. Love the pace, the fact that they concentrated on friendship part rather than on the legal term. And I will definitely adding this to my DVD collection.Recommendation: Not for everyone – but if you do enjoy well written fast pace drama, this might be for you.Reason to Watch: Get the chance to see the life of the world youngest millionaire.Reason Not to: Not Fincher best work.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
Not Only a Spike on the 2010 Radar but a Refreshing Return to Razor-Sharp Filmmaking Precision,"We get the film version of every best seller, graphic novel, comic book series, war and topical phenomenon within reach. And too frequently, they're assessed on the strength of how committed they are to the source. Numerous critics haven't liked The Social Network because it doesn't follow the facts. The Guardian pondered whether a 26-year-old entrepreneur truly ought to have his name muddied in a foggy fact/fiction jumble for the movie-going public's common entertainment. Zuckerberg himself, the film's core subject and fascinating protagonist, said at a conference he really wished that nobody had made a movie about him, at least while he was alive.I fully understand and sympathize with these points. Part of me feels it's unfair to not only fictionalize but hold up to public censure the short life of a twentysomething. But this is a useless attitude toward evaluating movies. What counts is whether a movie is high-quality and gratifying, not whether it's true to a novel, play, real-life figure. To be sure, countless films are magnificent for the reason that they interpret their initial sources into cinema vernacular. Gangs of New York's factually inaccurate, sure, but it's profoundly true to the import and reality of its depicted era and way of life. Hitchcock was painstakingly lucid with facts in The Wrong Man but at the expense of the spirit and power of its characters.Fincher's known for dark, meticulous dramas that tap into contemporary society's anxieties and obsessions. This one dashes through two hours of magnetic dialogue. It makes an ironically incommunicable account lucid, captivating. Many might understandably think it hopeless to make a movie about a computer programmer, as programming's just writing in a language nobody in the audience understands. Still Fincher and Sorkin dramatize the Facebook phenomenon in language that carries the import of the social media revolution with the same degree of vibrance and wit that Network did.To conjure up Facebook, Zuckerberg needed to be familiar with next to zilch about relationships or human nature, and this film's version of him isn't. What he needed was the capacity to perceive a way to engage the human race in the small world phenomenon. I maybe know 50 of my Facebook friends well, 100 I added just for going to the same high school at the same time, another 100 friends of friends. I can't recall the last time I received a Request from anyone with whom I didn't share at least one ""Mutual Friend."" The film begins with a date between Zuckerberg and Erica. He anxiously nurses a beer and speed-talks through an uncompromising cross-examination, almost vicious one-upmanship. Erica breaks it off, reprimands him, leaves. Erica (a storybound character) is correct, but at that instant she puts Zuckerberg in business. He goes home, begins hacking into the ""facebooks"" of Harvard dorms to accumulate campus girls' head shots. He programs a page where they can be ranked for their attractiveness. Chauvinistic and criminal, this proves so trendy, it crashes the campus servers. After it's harvested by a humdrum website called ""The Harvard Connection,"" Zuckerberg propagates it into Facebook.Programming vernacular and methods are broadly recognized, but it's he who discerns how he can associate them with a networking site. Facebook's brilliance entails not mental keenness but its scheme of mingling self-image with social interface. Zuckerberg longs to hit back at all the Harvard prudes he wishes would like him, so he absorbs them in a surrounding substance that's even now on the rise. This is the very reason why I feel The Social Network deserves the Oscar win for Best Editing. It has an associational effect of overtonally aggregating the nature of time, various rhythms to energize the pace and intellectual shot-by-shot links to create an emotional version of the narrative rather than a plodding entrepreneurial dossier.The depositions' testimony makes it clear there's a case to be made against Zuckerberg, many of them sins of omission. It's left to the final crawl to explain how they turned out. The point is to show an interaction of undergraduate chaos, enormous amounts of money and manic energy. Zuckerberg may have had the acument that produced Facebook, but he didn't do it single-handedly, and the movie gets a recounting by cutting between various lawsuit depositions. We gain understanding of the Harvard social structure, a campus where skill enlists affluence and relations as achievement factors. We meet the Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer), moneyed hunks who suppose Zuckerberg stole their idea. We meet Eduardo Saverin, played by a warmly relatable Andrew Garfield, Zuckerberg's closest (sole) friend, who was made CFO, lent the enterprise the money that it required to commence and was driven away. Most remarkably we meet Sean Parker, the founder of two renowned, momentous startups.It's the capricious Parker, fresh out of work but stretched out in celebrity and past triumph, who seemed to be the only person to make Zuckerberg blink, much less haul him into the big time. He rationalized why Facebook needed to move to Silicon Valley. Why more money would come from venture capitalists than Eduardo would ever boost with his humble calls to flush New Yorkers.The dialogue has the pace, spontaneity of Paddy Chayefsky or a Howard Hawks film. Eisenberg, who's concentrated on playing feeble or fastidious, is an infrared homing beacon hunting his own goals. Timberlake stunningly triumphs with the cunning task of playing Parker as both a strutting show-off and someone who takes on Zuckerberg as an academic match. We could see them as symbolic of the relationship between the real-life story and this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama"
