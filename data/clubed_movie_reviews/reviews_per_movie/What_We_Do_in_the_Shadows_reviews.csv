A great film,"Lot's of people are disregarding this movie due to ""Lack of plot"" or ""Poor cinematography"".This isn't supposed to be that sort of movie, it's a mockumentary, done in the style of a documentary.They have nailed that look perfectly, and the plot doesn't matter in a comedy.The comedy is great, the deadpan nature of it is hilarious, the jokes are brilliant.Go in with the open mind that it's not your classic style of comedy.I think it's a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absurdly Funny!,"I watched this movie, knowing nothing about it before, and it completely blew me away. It had me gut-busting from the very first scene throughout the entire movie. The premise of vampire flatmates is absurd, but it works great, because the movie takes its characters just serious enough for the audience to be somewhat emotionally invested in them. The chemistry between the actors is also great. But of course, the biggest strength of the movie is, that it delivers laughs on a very consistent level. Seriously, there was probably a joke every minute, that made me laugh so hard, I cried. I really don't wanna oversell this one, but I think this might be the funniest mockumentary since ""This is Spinal Tap"". If you like mockumentaries, dark comedy, vampires, or are just generally into humor, definitely go see this one. This is the funniest movie of the year so far, but I'm sure, that won't change.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fangtastic Fun!,"The comedy horror is so hard to get right. Then using the Vampire genre and the equally overused mockumentary style you are pushing a boulder up hill. So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the right direction. Great performances by all, apparently a lot of it is improvised but the script is well versed in vampire lore and flatting mannerism, nicely produced and well paced. New Zealand seems to have a talent for comedy horror. Peter Jackson's Brain Dead is perhaps the pinnacle and this from Taika Waititi and Jermane Clement is close on it heels. Gags and gore in equal abundance with a beating heart at its center, entrails to the left. Check it out!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Goes down as One of My Favourite Comedies,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a mockumentary about four vampires sharing a flat together.Going into this movie knowing nothing but the above, I did not have any idea what to expect. What I got was one of the funniest movies of this year or any year for that matter. The jokes where brilliant and more importantly, they were frequent and consistently brilliant. I loved the interaction of the main characters with each other and the supporting characters.Each of the main vampires had their moments and were all equally funny. The movie even had werewolves and they were also hilarious. I was also surprised by the special effects which were really well done.At one point it did feel like the jokes were getting old, but just as I had finished that thought, the movie changes and ends brilliantly. Even though there isn't much of a story, it doesn't really matter for this movie. Just watching some of the hilarious chaos that ensues in their everyday life is enough.There are not many movies that make me actually laugh out loud, but this one did on several occasions (usually comedies, even great ones, just keep me grinning through out). This is easily one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had at the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant,"When you very nearly spray a mouthful of drink over the person in front of you, its generally a good indicator the movie is pretty funny. The sandwich joke had me in stitches! This movie doesn't rely on just a few jokes to carry it, they maintain a subtle layer of humour throughout and then have you in stitches with some brilliant jokes. The cast in this movie are well picked, and Stu was brilliantly played by...well Stu. Taiki Waititi & Jemaine Clement really get the whole dilemma of everyday life as a vampire! Hopefully this gets picked up and the masses get a chance to enjoy this wee gem. Loved this movie and would definitely recommend it. Gave this a 10. A must see!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you liked spinal tap or best in show,you'll probably love this- it follows the mockumentary format excellently but ups the ante because its following a cast of actual (in the worldof the movie) vampires. (oh and some werewolves make a hilarious cameo.). But within the conceit of being a mockumentary its played totally straight.The few special effects scenes are really well done for the budget and all the more powerful because they knew to do it sparingly.,,Anonymous,Horror
This film was hilarious and unique.,"What We Do in the Shadows is a low-budget, horror comedy about a small group of vampires that live in an apartment together in modern day New Zealand. The plot focuses on how these vampires adapt to a new vampire joining their group. The four initial vampires consist of Deacon, Petyr, Viago and Vladislav. Each of these vampires come from drastically different backgrounds and range from a couple hundred to a several thousand years old. This variety in backgrounds allows the characters to be very unique and it makes their interactions funny and interesting. This movie has one goal and one goal, only: the make you laugh. The plot is not very deep and can sometimes lack flow, but the jokes are consistently funny so you really don't care. The film is shot like a documentary. Characters will occasionally talk to the camera similar to Modern family or the Office. The quick cuts and explanatory dialogue allows fantastic comedic timing. The special effects are low budget but are most of the time done very well. Some of the camera tricks are very impressive and make the scenes feel quite real. The flying effects are quite poor, though. It is obvious that the actors are just suspended by wires. This might seem like a negative, but the way it is portrayed on screen makes it quite hilarious. There are a couple of brief action scenes which are done well enough. The chases can get quite shaky, though. This is a rated R film, but the graphic material was handled very well. There are a few f-words, but they are rare enough and used to appropriate places most of the time. The blood is so over-the-top and silly that it didn't bother me at all. If there is anything that would be extremely graphic, it is blurred out. I wasn't expecting much when entering the theater, but I left thoroughly entertained. If you want to laugh and if don't care that the plot is somewhat irrelevant then you will have a blast.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unrelentingly funny,"I wasn't sure about this one, I cannot remember anything about Flight of the Concords (sp?) and comedy is a sticky thing for me. I find that I laugh out loud more often during dramas, horror, thrillers etc than comedies. I thought GRAND BUDAPEST, ZERO THEOREM and THE DOUBLE were hilarious. But this surprised me... a lot.Blade, Twilight, Werewolves, Zombies, they all make an appearance. The plot is actually quite funny in itself... it isn't meaty by any means, but it is also a joke: as the documentary team follows three vampires 'flatting' together: one who is very... camp, shall we say, another who is self-described as being hot... because he is a vampire, of course, and another who seems like a satirical-take on your stereotypical long-hair/metal-head. Oh, and an 8,000 year old friend who doesn't seem to possess the skills of communication.They begin to talk the crew through how they try to socialise, which leads to some amusing scenes of vampires trying to have a nightlife. Then they talk the crew through how they capture/seduce people in order to drink their blood. More funny scenes follow, leading to one of these victims escaping from the flat. Of course he doesn't die, he becomes the new vamp in the gang. But.. He's young, he's stupid, he is not even over a hundred years old! When he introduces his human friend to his vampire friends, you just know its not gonna go well. I won't go any further, but from here the plot delves the movie into comedic chaos. I was missing jokes because I was laughing at the ones previous! There are no immature fart jokes here, there aren't any jokes that make you cringe in their lame delivery.... Even though they are throwing a lot of crud at the wall, most of it sticks. It is also filled with comedic variety. Physical humour, plain old slapstick, facial expressions/body language (especially that camp vampire who always leads the doco crew around, his facial expressions and eye-movements when following the cameras cracked me up every time), and obviously sarcasm and satire are underlying themes.This thing felt that it was running on all cylinders for the entire movie. It also manages to feel effortless; there was no sense of them trying too hard for laughs - the mockumentary setting helped the film in this sense, despite the plot being thin. But, the wide range of comedy used, from slapstick to satire and everything in between, is probably the biggest reason why this movie does not feel forced.I walked out of this movie in pain from laughter. After only 87 minutes! The entire place was in stitches for the entire movie, and I saw people from all ages as I walked out, all with giant grins, talking about this or that scene. I'm chuckling as I am writing this as its stimulating my memory and I am seeing it in my head.www.epilepticmoondancer.net",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wanted to like it, I was bored to tears","The premise is fun, Jemaine Clement is in it, I thought this was going to be a cool movie no matter what. It was not.They went too far with the reality TV documentary style and after one hour and a half of following silly people around who are just incidentally vampires or werewolves or whatever, I was just praying for it to just end.Some jokes were funny, but certainly not laughing out loud stuff. The acting was OK, given the plot, but really, it was a total bore. Add to this the overwhelmingly positive reviews that made me expect something so much better and it all resulted in a terrible disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good to watch with friends,"Summary: 
This movie is a mockumentary movie about a group of 4 vampires called Deacon, Viago, Petyr and Vladislav. They are flatmates in New Zealand and they invite a documentary crew to film their daily activities that are very similar to our lives but with a vampire twist, like bringing people home from nightclubs to suck their blood, or going to undead festivals..What I like: 
This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Normally I never laugh at movies, I just get amused, but this one I was laughing every few minutes, it's exactly my type of humour. 
The funniest moments only work with the expert delivery by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi who star in the movie as Viago and Vladislav as well as writing and directing it. If you told most of the jokes to someone they probably wouldn't get it but with the awkward pauses and absurdity that you see and hear in the movie, it makes you laugh every time.What I dislike:
The way that the story is structured it just seems like a series of skits with some connection in the story and personally I prefer stories with more of a plot. I would have also prefered if we got to see more of what the 4 main vampires lives where like in other time periods",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Outstanding, The Office meets The Flying Conchords","I laughed and laughed and laughed.This is not a Vampire Movie, this is a mockumentary about some flatmates who happen to be vampires, just, y'know, incidentally.It is laugh-out-loud (LOL, young people) funny for extended periods. There is a lot of under-stated humour, but it has the feel of Peter Jackson's Bad Taste, made on weekends over an extended period - ""what can we do in this scene to make it even funnier?""Being from NZ, I feel unsure whether I am on the the inside of an in-joke (the police officers, for example) but plenty of people seemed to get the Conchords, so who knows, really.If you ""get"" The Office and you ""get"" The Conchords, you'll love it.For true.Bro.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Silly But Understuffed, This Needed a Little More Incubation","A Flight of the Conchords mockumentary inspecting the logistics of the vampire social scene in modern-day New Zealand. I was hoping for better. It seems like it's constantly right on the verge of doing something really hilarious, but can't quite flip the switch. The landscape is ripe for this kind of a satire, too, with so much empty romanticism hovering around the fantasy genre. Most of the fun comes from picking apart the hallmarks of the bloodsucker game, exposing them for the lame parlor tricks and absurd handicaps they really are. Mystically swapping a plate of noodles for worms, for example, to the mild annoyance of the victim. Failing to enter a nightclub because the bouncer doesn't explicitly invite them in. In most films, these would be appetizers for the main entree, but in this case there's no second course. This would've made for a brilliant skit on a sketch comedy show, but it just doesn't have the depth for its own feature-length. Even a very short one.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
mildly amusing,"I watched this for about half an hour. A mockumentary about vampire roommates is a cute idea, mixing the day-to-day challenges of shared living with vampire challenges like finding victims, and it was all kind of amusing. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it funny, and the fact that I wasn't actually laughing or feeling interested hinted to me that this wasn't the movie for me.It's very low-key humor. It's so low-key that even the moments that might feel horrific instead just seem bland. In theory, this is a dark comedy, but it never felt that dark or that funny.To be fair, I don't like some mockumentaries that other people love. While I loved Spinal Tap, I never understood the appeal of Waiting for Guffman. So if you just love all the mockumentaries, you might like this better than I did.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Could this be real?,"Let me start with: I don't like ""reality TV"" at all. And there is a reason you have to put """", because it is anything but real. And while this isn't real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.The basics are clear. As is the fourth wall that is practically not existent, because we are in the middle of it all. Does it always make sense? Of course not, that is the nature of shows like that. How did the camera get in there beforehand? But at least the camera (or the guy holding it) get recognized a lot. The group of people behind this are popular, maybe not worldwide, before this movie came out, but at least ""at home"". And it shows, because of the chemistry they have.

Well done and Witty,"What we do in the shadows was a witty and entertaining movie that covered a large amount of ground, and was filled with plenty of genuinely funny humor. Being some what of a fan of the directors prior movie ""eagle vs shark,"" i found ""What we do in the shadows"" to be significantly better, all the while keeping the dry sense of humor and laid back style of storytelling.This movie was well shot, and did not seem overly cheap in production value. The satire found throughout was well executed, and it felt that no stone was left unturned in its analysis of the vampire mythos.Being a mockumentary, everything was done right and explained, and a feeling of realism emanated as the movie progressed. A degree of true horror aspect was held throughout the main backdrop making the humorous aspects all the more enjoyable.Exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend giving this one a watch for any fans of mockumentary films, vampire/horror movies and comedies.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
fun unusual mockumentary,"Every few years in New Zealand, a secret society holds The Unholy Masquerade. A film crew is allowed into the lives of some vampires who are part of the secret society of supernatural beings such as witches, zombies and werewolves. Viago (Taika Waititi), Nazi vampire Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) and ancient Petyr live together in a house in Wellington struggling with everyday vampire drama. Jackie is Deacon's human familiar who is frustrated with the lack of upward mobility.This is a great concept, a funny group and terrific deadpan humor. It's a brilliant entry into the mockumentary genre. It's too warped of an idea for Christopher Guest to come up with. This comic group isn't always the funniest for me but this movie hits all the vampire tropes on the head. It also works as a horror spoof. It's loads of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Interview with Wellington Vampires,"There are a lot of targets in this amusing meta-mockumentary about of group of vampires trying to make it in modern Wellington: vampire myths and movies, documentaries and other mockumentaries. Writers/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi wisely keep the focus tight and mine the mundane (a vampire chore wheel, the tensions of sharing a flat with others) for humor as much as they explore the more absurd elements of the premise, like how to get into a nightclub when you have to be invited in, tricky relationship management with familiars, and run-ins with a rival gang of werewolves. If the best mockumentaries explore the social, cultural and political milieu of its subjects, this one has to make those things up out of pop culture depictions, so it isn't always as sharp and wickedly funny as the great examples of the genre. It is, however, very well-constructed, thoughtful and mostly funny, even with a few dry stretches. And it's nice to see New Zealand as something other than Middle Earth for a change.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Looking at vampires through new eyes,"Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement seem to understand misfits. Waititi explored them in his first two films, Eagle vs Shark and Boy, and Clement's partnership with Bret McKenzie as Flight of the Conchords was an object lesson in not fitting in. Their early works were loved both here and abroad. Between them, Waititi and Clement have been nominated at the Grammys, the Emmys and the Oscars, hardly a pedigree to be sniffed at. I guess the domestic appeal of this is born of New Zealand being a strange little country down the bottom of the world, whose national bird doesn't fly, who dared stand up to the Americans and say ""No Nukes"", and which has been the backdrop for some of the hugest blockbusters of recent years. We're proud of our strangeness. The international appeal is perhaps due in part to the same thing, our unique individuality. I guess, coming from a pair of inveterate misfits, What We Do in the Shadows, an exploration of vampires who live among humans, but are intrinsically not living humans themselves, is a natural growth of themes already explored. As this film explores vampire tropes with fresh eyes, it gives, as well, a poignant look at the value of exploring past beliefs, hurts, losses and prejudices anew and seeing what can grow. As each of us age, it becomes easier to get stuck in our ways, how much more so for vampires whose age is counted not in decades but centuries. For Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr there are many challenges. Viago faces the classic immortal's dilemma; his beloved growing old without him. Vladislav has a beast from the past which could rear its head again. Deacon faces the challenge of meeting a new generation and realising his own youth is slipping away. Petyr is growing ever more ancient, and is working to create a legacy. From these challenges come a fresh look at relationships between old enemies, at the cost of indiscretion, at unfulfilled promises and at the need to sometimes sacrifice your own desires out of genuine affection for another. This is a quirky film, slightly disjointed in places. But it delights in its lo-fi quirk right from the very 1970's looking ""New Zealand Documentary Board"" credit at the beginning. There's plenty of laughs to be had. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, it might be hard for some to follow, but there's entertainment to be found here for all. And now to the reviewer's bias. My grandmother, with whom I attended the Wellington première. Ethel Robinson assured me leading up to the movie that hers would be a very small part. It was, but it was a very necessary component part. And she filled it admirably, as did each of the performers in this piece. From the puzzled police, the frustrated familiar, the affable alpha-wolf, all the way to the venerable vampires themselves, no-one seemed out of place in this gentle comedy. Though it is about the undead, you can feel the warm heart beating below the surface of What we do in the Shadows, a film which will leave you thinking about vampires, and maybe about the world too, in a new way.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Okay,"A fictional documentary exposes the day-to-day lives of four vampires sharing a home in Wellington, New Zealand.The movie begins awkwardly in an amateurish way. This was probably intentional but, at least for the first half-hour, it comes off as bad frat-boy material.Once getting used to it, though, it at least has consistency and the humour begins to take effect especially as the vampires get mixed up with witches, werewolves, humans, and other entities.Rather light but harmless. - dbamateurcritic",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome NZ Comedy,"The three lead vampires in this film were absolutely fantastic, especially Jonathon Brugh (His solo dance routine was one of the most awkwardly hilarious things I have ever seen!). I loved all three of the main characters and their interactions with Stu. I was laughing the whole way through this film which is continuously funny.I actually found some of the scenes to be quite frightening, especially when the vampires are chasing one of their victims through their home! This scene was one of my favourites.I don't think it needed to be a mockumentary though. Sometimes the shots were purposefully too long which felt unnecessary and just slowed the pace of the film. Some of the jolty, hand-held camera shots could be a bit annoying too. Otherwise, I loved it and definitely recommend it!

Love at first bite,"Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vastly Overrated and Not that Funny,"Maybe it is because I'm not a fan of the horror genre or vampire movies, but I found this film tedious and with sparse bits of mild amusement tossed in.This isn't Spinal Tap with fangs. The actors try their best at deadpan comedy, but the timing and absurdity just isn't there. The film is a series of long, boring jokes where you can see the punch line coming from a mile away, falling flat when it finally and mercifully arrives. Then the film starts setting up for the next joke and it you start checking your wristwatch to see how much is left before the credits start rolling.The project is an interesting idea, just not executed very well. Forgive the pun, but I don't think they really sunk their teeth into the topic. The bit about not being to use a mirror was promising, but it went on too long and never went past the obvious jokes. The most obvious logical questions never get asked: why aren't all those victims noticed? what do they do for money? how can they go centuries without updating their wardrobe or learning anything from the modern world?The overall pacing and direction struck me as aimless and flabby, maybe not a surprise for what is an exercise in improvisation, but just shows how difficult that medium can be to perform well. Finally, I also thought the explicit gore, while infrequent, really disrupted the comedic tone.Someone else noted that this might have been an effort better limited to a short film rather than a feature length project and I'd agree. A one-joke premise not all that well done to start with and stretched far past the breaking point.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Weird, wacky and fun!","A few months ago, thanks in part to a Kickstarter campaign, What We Do in the Shadows arrived in film festivals all over the world...and audiences were stunned! Why? Because it's one weird, very weird movie!The film is a marvelous mockumentary that makes fun of the current reality television fad. In many ways, it's like an MTV series like ""The Real World"" or ""Jersey Shore""....meets ""Twilight""!! Somehow, a film crew gained access to a strange home where four vampires lived. And, it's in tiny Wellington, New Zealand of all places! According to the film, this unlikely place is actually a hotbed of vampires, werewolves, zombies and more...and these four undead guys are allowing some humans to come into their previously hidden lives. The residents of this home are a motley and mostly lovable group of loser vampires ranging from the rather likable Viago to the incredibly scary and Nosferatu-like Petyr and you follow them through the course of their evenings over a period of many months.While this idea is crazy and a bit silly, the joke could have worn thin very quickly--and it probably would have with lesser filmmakers and actors. Instead, the film maintains a wonderful tongue-in-cheek mood throughout and constantly delivers laughs...and, oddly, a lot of charm (well, that is when the guys aren't feeding off Wellingtonians). It also really helps that you like these folks! The bottom line is that this film is completely unique and fun...and if you see it with your friends, they won't believe what they're watching!

It rides on the great actors, but also on a wonderful script and an ingenious mix of wobbly ""porno camera"" and perfectly placed special effects. The movie addresses various aspects of being a vampire in New Zealand today:* sunlight leaking into your habitat* vampire wannabes hassling you* virgins can be incredibly hard to get by* Wellington itself feels so dead you constantly have to remind yourself that you're actually undead* discrimination is rife against immigrants (especially blood-sucking vampires from Transsylvania like yourself)* same goes doubly for Nazi vampires* feminist ""familiars"" (servants) constantly bickering while they're ironing your frills* werewolves and vampire hunters constantly riding your ass* mortal friends and chums frequently dieing off* flatmates refuse to do bloody dishesSo you don't have to be part and parcel of the vampire hype to dig this flick.

Painfully unfunny,"The setup is promising but the delivery is absolutely dreadful. They get 70% of the way to each joke and then just seem to stop.This film is about as funny as dental torture.I do not know why everyone says this is hilarious - it's shockingly unfunny. I suppose I shouldn't have been all that surprised - that Jermaine Conchords guy is massively overrated and he's in it.

Good characters but needed more of a story,"Jemaine Clement has a very unique sense of humour. If you've seen 'Flight of the Conchords' you'll know that his is a brand of comedy that is not for everyone, but if it is for you you'll absolutely love it. It's an incredibly dry type of humour which is why I wasn't surprised to hear he was doing a vampire movie. It sounded right up his alley. And he nailed the humour, he really did. The only problem was he never bothered to accompany it with a story and so the film just feels like 80 minutes of improvised vampire jokes.I read that he and co-writer/director Taika Waititi wrote a script but never actually showed it to the cast and just let them improvise almost the entire thing and adjusted the script accordingly. For me they needed to take a leaf out of Larry David's comedy series 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' where everything is improvised but still with very strict guidelines of information that needs to be included to further the story. It works for him and I see no reason why it couldn't have worked here. Improvising everything including the story is just madness and it is sadly what holds this film back from being a truly great New Zealand comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent idea stretched too thin,"I went into this film with the preconceived notion that it was a horror film with comedy elements to it. Not being a fan of the horror genre, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was the other way around. In fact, I don't think it qualifies as a horror film on any level really, except for a couple of predictable jump scares.15 minutes in and I was thoroughly enjoying myself.The set design, costumes and imagery throughout this film are fantastic. The attention to detail and the sly nods to the whole genre in general is a treat.Unfortunately, the joke wears a bit thin after a while. The introduction of the werewolves was a nice break, but otherwise there is just too little material that has been stretched too far over the run time.In summary: a great idea, well executed for the most part, but a film that could possibly have benefited from being far more concise so as to not dilute the impact of the general concept.I want to rate it higher than 6, but 7 seems too generous.

Its a great idea and the effort is visible but the acting is too much ""wink wink nudge nudge"" and the atmosphere too uncomfortable.It's not bad and all its parts are basically functional but it's too mundane for a horror spoof and too gruesome for a lighthearted comedy.In short: A lot of very good parts, decent acting, great concepts and ideas, and good humour are ruined by a dissonant and unimmersive tone.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Something that will blow your fans off,"At first, when I found this piece, I was hesitant to see it. But once I did, I was mad that I hand't done before so.This movie is just pure EPIC. It puts a rambling twist on the modern world with those usual fantasies, old legends, reality show culture and pure ignorance. Every line of the script with it's words and improvisation, is carefully sifted through the masterminds behind it and made to be pure gold.A simple line of letters can not even begin to describe this masterpiece as the picture has a punch after a punch as the seconds fly by.Words of suggestion: If you are looking for some comedy to rest from your long day, this is not for you. If you are looking for something to spike all the funny-cells in your brain, look no further.A true and utter diamond of the industry that faces no boundaries from time nor century. I keenly hope this film will be a cult classic even 100 years from now.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Definitely worth your time,"This is a movie for those who both like and dislike vampire movies. My wife is in the former category and I am in the latter. We both enjoyed this film equally.From the opening scene to the closing credits, it is laugh out loud funny. It pokes fun at every part of the vampire mythology without resorting to simply being a parody of other movies.The film simply follows the life (if I can call it that) of four vampires of various ages sharing a run down flat in Wellington, New Zealand. It hilariously showcases the disadvantages of being a vampire from trying to see how you look when you have no reflection to attempting to get a bouncer to actually invite you in to a nightclub.Regrading the criticisms of the film quality, it is totally in keeping with the mockumentary style but should not be confused with the quality of the special effects. While there are no shots of super villains smashing up cities or firefights in deep space, the special effects are good enough to make you forget that they are special effects.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A deliciously great time,"I hadn't heard about this until now... boy, what a treat. The ensemble cast is utterly fantastic, very devoted to every second of comedy that is juiced out of this film's content and subject. The ""vampire mockumentary"" plot is something that I don't think anyone eve dreamed of, but it's utterly devoted to making every comedy worth it and it succeeds. There are a few sore spots here and there, but overall this was a great time. Definitely something for moviegoers to seek out next year, it really does add a lot of the horror/comedy genre and I think it could be a real hit across nations. I strongly recommend it, and it has a great attitude about itself that won't turn people away.",,Anonymous,Horror
Unique film concept on Vampires and other creatures,"What We Do in the Shadows is a comedy/horror focusing mainly on a group of vampires living together in modern New Zealand. There are also some other creatures briefly included like werewolves and zombies.The idea is unique and there are definitely some funny moments. For example the vampires are learning about the internet and social media. Vladislav is taught how to poke people on Facebook, ""Yes do it, let's poke her""! There's another scene where they have a house meeting to discuss chores and cleanliness. Viago comments on how he puts down towels and newspaper when killing his victims to not ruin the furniture. He expects the others to do the same.All of the actors have really done a great job getting into character; especially Taika Waititi as Viago and Jermaine Clement as Vladislav.For me the biggest problem with the movie is that there really is not much of a plot. The majority of the film is improvised and it moves from scene to scene without much direction. The characters and scenarios are very well done but it doesn't work for me as a full length movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

You have to have a warped sense of humour to enjoy it! 6/10,"Review: I found this film quite funny at the beginning but it gets a bit ridiculous after a while. The storyline is quite original and the different characters brought different flavours to this somewhat weird and wonderful film. Its based around three vampires who live together as roommates. They have to deal with day to day life whilst getting various victims to come to there house so they can feed. One of there victims introduces them to modern life and they end up going to night clubs and exploring the Internet. The whole concept is very well put together and at such a cheap budget, they really did do a good job. It does get a big silly after a while but you have to take it with a pinch of salt because your really not supposed to take it seriously. The fact that they are blood sucking vampires who take to a very normal Nick, who doesn't really say that much through the film, made me laugh along with the servant who is dying to become a vampire. Anyway, it's a light hearted comedy about a friendship and brotherhood which has a unique, vampire twist. Watchable!Round-Up: Were do I start with this film? I recognised Jemaine Clement from MIB3, Dinner For Schmucks and Muppets Most Wanted but I haven't seen the other actors before. The film was also written and directed me Jemaine who has a extremely weird sense of humour, which I saw in Tongan Ninja. The main vampire Taika Waititi, had a brief role in the Green Lantern but this has to be his real shot at fame. He also wrote and directed this movie so you have to give him credit for that. Anyway, I doubt that there will ever be a film like this, made again so it's worth a watch for its originality and warped humour.Budget: $1.6million Worldwide Gross: $7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about 3 roommates, who happen to be vampires, who are shown modern day life after turning a young 20 year old into a vampire. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Matter of Humor,"The first minutes reminded me a lot of American Zombie, a not-so-recent zombie mockumentary, there is also the 2010 Belgian vampire mockumentary called Vampires, so the entire concept didn't seem as new to me as it apparently did to others. In fact the whole formula seemed a little superimposed, it adds up to ""here are three guys that live together AND they are vampires"". Many jokes are taken from roommate/college-night-out situations and translated to vampires, with only a handful of laughing out loud moments in the entire movie. However, after a clumsy start, it became progressively interesting to see how they handled and presented certain occult myths - sadly we never get far beyond pop culture occultism.The production value is in no way detrimental to the comedic quality of the movie and the acting is all around quite solid. In the end it is, as often the case with comedy, a matter of taste. I certainly hope you are able to get more laughs out of this than me. Give this movie a go if you are interested in vampires/occultism and if the humor resonates with your taste you'll have a blast.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hit an Artery,"86 minutes of purse nonsense. What We Do in the Shadows is one of the most unique comedies that I have ever seen. From the first moment, I was doubled over with laughter. The premise is ridiculous, the characters are absurd and the acting is fantastic.Over the course of the film, there isn't much of a plot, which is kind of the point. At times, the chaotic nature of the story and a lack of structure was a bit grating, but I still found it highly enjoyable and rewatchable.Best Character: Petyr

A 7.6 rating is a SIN.,"I cannot comprehend how this movie isn't at the very LEAST in the mid 80's. Personally, I gave it a 9, or a 9.5 if it was possible. It's a travesty to the genius of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi.The spin-off series is perfect IMHO, and is by the same writers, producers...etc. And they manage to intertwine them both at various points in the show. (Just a couple of times at key moments. They don't use the show to push their own agendas and appearances. It's all very subtle and perfectly timed. Perfect, as mentioned)
PLEASE don't let a 7.6 deter you from checking this out! ESPECIALLY if you remotely emjoy the vampire/supernatural comedy genre. And once you've watched it and finally stop laughing. It's like waking up on Christmas morning because you now have almost 4 seasons of the hilarious TV series to binge on next!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I think we drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.""","Meet Viago (Taika Waititi), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and the Nosferatu-like Petyr (Ben Fransham). They're four hip, happening New Zealanders who just happen to be centuries-old vampires (and flatmates). A documentary crew films their activities, and their problems of living in modern-day NZ are sometimes universal, ex. delegating chores. Others are just plain amusing: they can't go into nightclubs unless they're invited in, of course. Some problems arise when the dorky Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) is bitten by Petyr, and can't adjust to the vampire lifestyle as well as the others have.Done in the style of a ""mockumentary"", complete with personal testimonials given by the principals, this vampire comedy is like many movies in the comedy genre. It doesn't always work very well, but the gags & jokes that DO land are quite funny. In any event, the movie is put over nicely by its very engaging cast. Deacon and Nick were this viewers' favourite characters. We also see other individuals who are part of the vampires' little world, such as their ""familiar"", family woman Jackie (Jackie van Beek), who must clean up after kills and procure victims. Another very amusing character is the soft-spoken Stu (Stu Rutherford), Nicks' human friend. His extremely under-stated reactions to the madness around him are a hoot.Among the highlights are the altercations that the vampires have with other beasts, especially a pack of werewolves led by Anton (Rhys Darby). For once, we see a movie where men who are werewolves actually take off their clothes before they transform so the clothes don't get torn to shreds! Waititi and Clement also wrote and directed the film, and they get the look and feel of a ""mockumentary"" just right. They also know just how to send their viewers away with a smile.Followed by a TV series.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A nice quirky comedy,"What a lovely film. It is based on a very simple premise: it is mockumentary on modern time's vampires that are living as roommates in New Zealand.
It is very funny and is the perfect example of character comedy. Each vampire being a trope that the film is laughing and commenting on.
You get what the film is going to be in the first five minutes. The rest of the runtime is a series of vignettes, of different encounters that the vampire group has, but there is no story to speak of. It is simply a straight ""what if"" scenario. Yet it works and it is enjoyable and interesting because the film treats the comedy with a straight face. It is a very deadpan sense of humor. Shall I say humour.The movie's jokes are nearly entirely devoted to the vampires being eternal beings full of magic and otherworldly powers being bogged down by mundane and trivial problem like roommates forgetting to do the dishes and not getting into nightclubs.The quality and charm of the movie then comes from its style. The comedy is served brilliantly by the sets and costumes and camera work. It feels cheap and homemade, that is precisely the point, and it gives the film a freshness and authenticity. There are many clever tricks when there is magic or supernatural elements involved. The movie did not need to have these special effects, but it does and it elevates the movie. The jokes being paper thin, you need
something more to keep you engaged past the movies introductory scenes.It feels part thesis-film part inside joke between friends. It is very reminiscent of the Belgian gem Man Bites Dog but with better production value and with a reverence to vampire movies. I also just loved watching it for the wonderful accents all the actors have.
The film is funny; the film is quirky. It is unabashedly Kiwi.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Exceptional Surprise,"I'm not a huge fan of mockumentaries. They've been so overdone. Ditto vampire films.

I wasn't expecting to, but I found myself recommending it to everyone who would listen. Now it's your turn.If you enjoy Eddie Izzard monologues, then imagine one come to life. In this film you'll get to see how vampires do the vacuuming, how vampires eat chips and why vampires put newspaper down when entertaining a guest.All the cast look like they are having great fun, and I loved Rhys Darby as a very responsible werewolf, making sure all the members of his pack are wearing stretchy pants on the night of the full moon.Deducting one point for lack of originality, but other than that I can't fault this.

Ridiculously funny in a nonsense way.,"The movie is written, directed and acted by Jemaine Clement and Take Waititi. They are both very talented and Taika Waititi is one of my favourite directors, all the movies directed by him have his unique childlike feature which is fun to watch and uplifting. This movie is no different, the plot is kind of nonsense but in a cute way. The movie doesn't have a deep meaning to reflect upon, you could simply lay back and enjoy the movie. Its mockumentary style makes the vampires so relatable as if they were real and were your neighbour next door. This should attribute to the amazing actors, especially Taika Waititi, making vampires so believable. When he is interviewed in the movie, he acts awkwardly just like a normal person, who isn't used to the spotlight. The characters are all goofy and they act stupidly but you won't get annoyed. Some comedies try too hard to make you laugh and end up the character are being ridiculously stupid and unlikeable, but this isn't the case, their character's goofiness is so believable that you find their stupidity quite adorable. So, if you are having a bad day or you wanted to take your mind off of something, this is the right movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Funny Vampire passtime,"Maybe you are like me and you keep stumbling upon random mentions of this movie. It keeps showing up in recommendations for various genres, be it vampire stuff, mocumentaries but most often as an example of the qualities of Taika Waititi. I feel like, for what it is, the movie is a bit overhyped. Yes it is funny and I laughed out a couple times, though I don't really feel like it is all that original or groundbreaking. The ideas and themes being satirized had been made fun of in the past, and there are plenty of other mocumentaries that feel fairly similar. That is not to say What We Do in the Shadows is bad. Not at all. They take an idea and execute it very well. The format works, the jokes are funny. Really funny comedies had become a scarcity in recent years I feel so if you want to have a laugh and like Vampire stuff this is a good option. Alternatively if you want an unscarry movie for Haloween this is also good. Mind, there is some blood, perhaps a jumpsacare or two though the intent is never to be scary.

"Refreshing, Brilliant","The conceit itself, vampires sharing a house in a reality show -- wow! -- original. And the issues vampire roommates might experience were expertly conceived. This is comedic art at its best. The subtle effects help to create a creepy unreal reality. Each vampire stands alone in their character development -- standouts, each one. This movie was well written, directed, and acted. The set design while antique, in line with what one might expect of a vampire's lair, but that's what makes it great. Juxtaposing it with the pop culture phenomenon of reality TV creates absurd comedy greatness. This movie breathed life into the genre, creating an unexpected angle. Some of the lines are comedy gold, especially Vladislavs sandwich analogy. This is a movie I brand thoroughly charismatic.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cult classic!,"Discovered this film because I loved Flight of The Conchords, and for the past 9 years I've watched it so many times I can't count! Brilliant dry comedy, utterly original. Utilizing the mockumentary platform, with vampires/werewolves, they still managed to make a completely original story with memorable and relatable characters. This film is the springboard for my love of anything with Jermaine Clement, Taika Waititi, and Rhys Darby. While not the same, their impact is similar to Monty Python. This film has inspired not just the show, but so much more fandom interaction, memes, and derivative fiction.

#52,"This film chronicles the lives of four vampires-Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr-who share a flat, blending the mundane with the absurd. As a documentary crew captures their every move, we witness their daily routines, wild antics, and roommate responsibilities, along with their interactions with the outside world, Among these is the transformation of their latest victim, Nick, into a vampire, whom they guide through his new existence while preparing for the Unholy Masquerade. Overall, due to its dry but hilarious humor, witty references to vampire pop culture, and a dynamic and synergistic cast this film was good and even though I'm not as high on it as the majority, I had a good time and found it quite funny and enjoyable, It's essentially The Office with vampires-what's not to like?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Destined for cult status.,"What We Do In The Shadows, a horror 'mockumentary' that follows a group of vampire flatmates in New Zealand as they go about their night-to-night activities, both ghoulish and mundane, does for vampires what Spinal Tap did for Heavy Metal bands: it puts its eccentric characters at the centre of some extremely outré situations, yet still shows them as real people that the viewer can identify with and care about. As with Rob Reiner's celebrated 'rockumentary', the wonderfully realised collection of likable characters, the delightfully droll sense of humour and plenty of highly quotable dialogue ensure that the film is destined for cult status.The cast are uniformly excellent, their deadpan delivery of some very silly dialogue making for some seriously funny moments (although my favourite character, Petyr, an 8000-year-old Nosferatu-style vampire, managed to make me laugh without uttering a word, his confused expressions enough to tickle my funny-bone). Writer/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi keep the pace brisk enough and the action varied enough to make certain that their central joke never wears thin, the silliness including a female familiar who is fed up with cleaning up blood and providing virgins, a newbie vampire who brags about his newfound status, a human who is welcomed into the group, a pack of irascible werewolves, and an annual masquerade party where the vamps get to let off some steam.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quirky but Overwhelming,"What We Do in the Shadows offers a unique take on the vampire genre with its mockumentary style and comedic spin. There are definitely some strong points in the film, but it doesn't always hit the mark.One of the standout aspects of the film is its originality. The concept of blending the mundane aspects of vampire life with a mockumentary format is fresh and inventive, providing a humorous look at the supernatural. The performances are another highlight, with the cast delivering their lines with comedic timing that keeps the film engaging. The distinct personalities of the vampire characters bring a lot of charm and humor to the screen.However, despite these positives, the film struggles with a few significant issues. The humor, while creative, can sometimes feel like it's trying too hard. The constant stream of jokes and gags, though inventive, can become overwhelming and lose their impact over time. The film's cynicism, while intended to be funny, can come across as excessive and somewhat grating.Additionally, What We Do in the Shadows feels a bit stretched in terms of length. The novelty of the concept wears off as the film progresses, leading to a sense that it could have benefited from tighter editing and a more concise narrative. The repetitive nature of the jokes and situations starts to drag, making the film feel longer than it needs to be.In summary, while What We Do in the Shadows is undeniably unique and boasts some solid performances, it can be overwhelming with its constant barrage of humor and a bit long-winded. The film's attempt to balance originality with comedy results in a mixed experience that, while entertaining in parts, struggles to maintain its charm throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I survived the night,"I love comedies in general and parodies in particular, but I'm not a big fan of vampires movies. But what about the parody of a vampires movie? I chose to watch 'What We Do in the Shadows', mainly because the film is written and directed by Taika Waititi - one of the hottest names on the movie market today, the author of 'Jojo Rabbit' - here alongside Jemaine Clement. The two also play two of the roles within the vampire quartet who spend a portion of eternity in a haunted house in the city of Wellington of our days. In fact better said the Wellington of our nights, because the active life of the vampires begins, as we all know, at nightfall, when they can go out without fear to lure and hunt their victims and meet with others creatures of darkness, for example with werewolves. I am not sorry about the time invested, I survived in one piece and with no bites the experience, and also without becoming a vampire or a fan of vampire movies.The format used by the filmmakers is that of a parody of documentary films, a format sometimes called 'mockumentary'. A film crew (whose protection is provided by contract) is sent to film kind of a 'reality show' that presents 'around the clock' the after-death adventures of the New Zealand's vampire inhabitants. As in any movie or TV show of the genre, there are alternated live footage (most filmed at night, some even in the dark) with biographical notes and off-action comments of the vampire protagonists. The formula, once understood by the spectators, allows for the continuous unfolding of jokes and orgy drunkenness with blood, of the comic and horror sequences, sometimes interleaved, other times combined. A considerable dose of ketchup and other red liquids finds plenty usage throughout the film.The schema works very well. The effect I think depends on the viewers' adherence to the parodied genre and the familiarity with the comic characters transferred into the vampire space. I believe that fans of the genre will find many familiar references, and for them the jokes will more easily reach their targets. Viewers who know the team of actors and directors will find familiar characters in new situations. For the less initiated viewers - myself among them - the result is partial. I smiled pretty much all the time and laughed moderately at many moments, but I didn't roll on the floor with laughs, as at the most successful comedies. Something in the style with which Taika Waititi addresses elements of popular culture is also felt in this film. He does not avoid the kitsch, I can even say that he is looking for it, but under his guidance parody loses any nuances of vulgarity. Unlike in 'Jojo Rabbit', in 'What We Do in the Shadows' fun is more important than the message. And that's OK. A recent news item names the New Zealand director as the author of a future series in the 'Star Wars' cycle. Now I have become curious!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good, but never reaches its full potential","There's a filthy, lived in authenticity to the afterlives of the vampires who serve as the subjects of What We Do in the Shadows, the New Zealand comedy-horror mockumentary from writers-directors Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement. If you're at all familiar with these names then you've had your ear to the ground of the irreverent indie comedy circuit of the past decade. Clement is one half of the popular HBO musical- comedy duo Flight of the Conchords and Waititi has enjoyed critical success with his films Boy and Eagle VS Shark, the latter of which Clement co-starred in. Their unique comedic voices seem like a perfect fit to bring a strange project like What We Do in the Shadows to a niche audience but breaking through to the mainstream may prove difficult.What We Do in the Shadows introduces its simple premise at the start: a documentary crew has been granted access to film the lives of four New Zealand-based vampires in the months leading up to the annual Unholy Masquerade Ball. Waititi stars as the group's defacto leader, the delightful dandy, Viago. He shares a house with Vladislav (Clement) – a centuries old count in the vein of Dracula, Deacon – a relatively young vampire and self-described ""wild card"" of the group, and Petry – an 8,000 year old abomination that pays homage to Nosferatu's Count Orlok with his grotesque appearance and preference to hiss and growl rather than deliver dead-pan observations on his night-to-night lifestyle. Viago, Vlad, and Deacon are fun to hang out with, especially when there's a squabble over chores (dishes gone unwashed for five years), but it's Petyr who steals every scene simply by sitting there looking hideous and out of place.A monkey wrench is thrown into the gears when a potential victim, Nick (played by Cori Gonzalez-Macuer), is instead turned vampire by Petyr and moves in with the group. There's a general dislike for the newcomer by our undead heroes and the film uses that as its principle plot thread. But there's much more to What We Do in the Shadows including a subplot about Deacon's female servant who longs for eternal life, Viago's long lost love of his youth, Vladislav's cuckolding at the hands of his greatest nemesis referred to only as ""The Beast"" and the added confusion of Nick's best friend Stu, a human the entire gang likes a whole lot more than Nick. Throw into this a rival group of werewolves and the Undead Masquerade Ball we've been teased and you'd think, ""this sounds like one hell of a movie!"" That's what I thought going in, but there are myriad issues with the whole of What We Do in the Shadows.The numerous subplots in this film tend to unfold in a linear fashion which immediately made me wish I was watching a television series based on this very movie where self-contained episodes could explore these interesting ideas more thoroughly. That the entire cast of characters is so interesting actually works against the overall plot of the film which ultimately becomes less interesting and unsatisfying just for taking us away from what we want to see in an effort to usher the film along. In short, I want to get to know more of these characters and the movie just won't allow it.Of course, the biggest issue with What We Do in the Shadows has more to do with unfulfilled promise. There are some incredible sight gags (vampires fighting in mid-flight, over the top gore that recalls Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and a lot of hilarious make-up and character designs), but most of the traditional setup and punchline jokes fall flat. There aren't any groaners here but I didn't find myself belly laughing at a single joke in this film and, for a comedy, that's disappointing. Often times I find myself nodding and thinking, ""Oh, I can see why that's funny,"" but that doesn't really count as being legitimately funny; there are more echoes of comedy in What We Do in the Shadows than actual comedy.Still, with its imaginative visuals and fascinating characters, What We Do in the Shadows is certainly worth visiting, if only to see it firsthand and wonder what might have been. I'm not accusing anyone involved with this film of incompetence or lack of ability; just the opposite, in fact. What We Do in the Shadows is a hair under 90 minutes long, the perfect length for your standard comedy. But there's nothing standard about this film and it may have benefited from padding its run- time so as to more fully flesh out these characters and the world they inhabit. Better yet, as mentioned before, I'd have loved to watch this film unfold over several 20-minute episodes on cable. There's no use being angry at Clement and Waiti for the missed potential of What We Do in the Shadows. After all, they're only human.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Good Fun,"Though gouts of blood shoot from necks at times, this ""mockumentary"" is hilarious. The premise is that a documentary is being made on vampires and a group of flatmates agree gingerly to be the subjects of the film. Gingerly because there is always that pull to dine on humans and the filmmakers will be following them closely. It doesn't take long before the vampire roomies start bickering and nitpicking. They preen in front of the camera, trying to one-up each other as supreme vampire. They stalk their prey, sometimes very ineptly, competing for attention and time and again, making boastful statements that are merely wishful thinking.Jemaine Clement co-directs & stars with Taika Waititi. Clement uses the same sensibilities as he evinced in TVs ""Flight of the Conchords"". His character, though, is full of studly bravado, which hides an underlying insecurity that he works hard to keep from you. Waititi plays it gently and slightly effeminate, a foppish gentleman concerned with clothing & hair. Jonathon Brugh is the third roomie, a thin-skinned guy always taking offense and grating on others. The fourth is somewhat shy & retiring, as you'll discover yourselves.The vampire jokes come hot & heavy throughout the film. If you've seen some of the scores of vampire movies from the past, you'll delight in getting the inside jokes. However, you don't have to be an expert on bloodsuckers to enjoy watching this movie because it's bloody good fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Improv was just not that great. needed a stronger script,"they say that ""More than 120 hours of footage was shot, most of which were improvisation from the leads."" And improv sometimes works, but it usually works best when actors are working from a strong script and when the story has at least some structure.this movie had a great idea behind it and had a lot of potential. it was actually a pretty genius idea, and to be fair there were some really hilarious scenes too. But I just felt like the movie needed stronger direction. a lot of the jokes fall flat because they feel like they either run for too long or they are too awkward and they just didn't know when to cut.I would have loved to see a different edit from those 120 hours of footage actually. (maybe there were funnier moments that got cut because the jokes left in the movie ran for too long) Or I wish they had focused a little more on making the jokes stronger rather than what we got. So, to me this was a great idea, but not as great of an execution of the idea.If you like vampires this is a good movie full of inside jokes on the genre. they definitely did the research on vampire lore",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best comedies of the decade,"Taika Waititi is a comedic genius. Credit also goes to Jermaine Clement as he co-stars, co-writes, and co-directs this film with his New Zealand buddy. This is quite simply one of the funniest movies in some time. They find the perfect balance between comedy and horror against a hilarious vampire backdrop. The problem with most modern comedies is that they aren't consistently funny throughout their runtime. Shadows bucks this trend by keeping the sharp jokes firing until the credits roll. You can really see Waititi honing his craft on this brilliant mockumentary.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Oh, and they're also vampires.Filmed by a documentary crew, our nocturnal friends go through their nightly routines. Their personalities are quite different, which makes them more interesting. Vladislav is the Dracula-type (Think: Vlad The Impaler), looking and sounding very Transylvanian. Viago is more of a gentle sort, not wanting to cause problems. He was a ""dandy"" when he was alive. Deacon is the more ""cool"", ""hip"" bloodsucker. If Keith Moon had become a vampire, this is what he would be! He knits his own sweaters as well.

Not hilarious but very likable.,"Before setting out to see a preview of this film I glanced at the host of enthusiastic reviews on this site and then noticed that most of them were 'reviewed' by folks who had reviewed nothing else. This made me suspicious and I felt that the film would be a sad and silly mess. Not so! The movie is nowhere near as funny as suggested or intended but the look of it is stunning. set design and costume stars should win awards, almost ever scene looks fantastic with decrepit, stained interiors, literally dripping with blood and crazy costumes that help maintain the right feel for what is essentially a vampire flat share. The mockumentary format works well initially and there are quite brilliant sequences as each creature gives his back story and this is illustrated with a fantastic array of old prints, paintings and vampiric illustrations. However as the film progresses, the format shows its limitations and things become just a little static. The introduction of werewolf creatures is helpful and provide the best exterior sequences and I just wish I liked the whole thing more. A lot of love and care and enthusiasm has clearly gone into this but it didn't quite seem to have enough edge. For all the projectile blood vomiting and killing this remained a nice film about vampiric creatures managing to live as best they can. Maybe thats enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The 2nd vampire mockumentary,"I certainly don't intend to bash or talk too negatively about ""What we do in the Shadows"", but to all those die-hard fans who claim that it's a super-original, refreshing and inventive horror comedy I would just like to state clear that the exact same idea and concept had already been done before, namely in the sadly unknown but definitely worthwhile Belgian sleeper hit ""Vampires"" (Vincent Lanoo – 2010). In that film, which was basically a spoof/homage towards the legendary Belgian cult classic ""Man Bites Dog"", a TV crew gets the assignment of following around a family of vampires and shoot a documentary about their lives, habits and routines. ""What we do in the Shadows"" is identical, in fact, except that the action takes place in New Zealand instead of Belgium and that the vampires are not related to each other but house mates that originate from different historic eras. Viago is nearly 320 years old, Deacon almost 200 and Vladislav over 800. They share a little student flat in the center of Wellington and encounter daily issues, like whose turn is it for doing the dishes or who spilled human blood all over the floor. Oh, there's also an 8000-year-old Nosferatu look-alike named Petyr living in the attic! Most of the comic situations are related to the gigantic generational differences between them, especially when they reluctantly ""welcome"" the brand new vampire Nick in their midst. Nick doesn't really bother to keep his vampirism secret, but he does introduce the rest of them to interesting new technologies (like sunset videos on You Tube) and provides them access to hipster nightclubs. The humor in ""What we do in the Shadows"" is subdued and dry. Very, very dry In fact, the film works best as a pitch-black satire of the recent trend of ""polished"" vampire movie franchises and TV-series like the ""Twilight Saga"" or ""True Blood"". The vampires here are not stylish or attractive – quite the contrary - and there's absolutely nothing sensual about being bitten in the neck; especially when the victim's artery paints the entire room blood red. Definitely not all gags or puns are equally successful, but some ideas are extremely inventive and even downright brilliant, notably the nightly confrontation with the werewolf pack and all sequences involving Petyr. Recommended, but – please – make an effort to also check out the aforementioned Belgian pathfinder flick ""Vampires"".",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great movie, very funny - worth a watch","What We Do In The Shadows, is what you expect from Co-Creater of 'Flight of the Conchords', Jermaine Clement (Vladislav) and Co-Writer/Director Taiki Waititi (Viago) who also wrote and directed some of 'Flight of the Conchords' also. This movie is truly hilarious, a unique humour that needs to be watched. It is about a group of vampires who live together in Wellington, New Zealand, who have a documentary crew follow them around showing us the inner workings of the lives of vampires, unlike Interview with a Vampire (which i reviewed last month) it is hilarious. The Mockumentary shows the conflict and relationship between the Vampires, who range in age dramatically, and humans in the 21st century.These vampire flatmates are trying to overcome those everyday struggles of being immortal, and feasting on human blood. The age old problem of no matter how much suncream you may think could work, sunlight is a bit of an issue. The movie features them living life both as vampires and flatmates, trying to get into nightclubs, keeping up with the chore wheel and getting along all the time.The comedic execution in they movie is fantastic, with movies like this they can either way, but the cast did it so well. It honestly had me laughing throughout. If you have ever seen anything that is a mockumentary i.e The US Office, you will appreciate this movie a lot, i highly recommend it.Check out the rest of my reviews on http://russellviews.blogspot.co.uk",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The video document of the life of the vampires.,"A documentary style horror comedy based on the short film of the same name by the same directors. I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.Definitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.Quite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a cliché, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept. So I still recommend it because it is worth a watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Genius comedy, the best in the last century in fact!","Comedy is subjective and while this subtle silly style of humour may seem absurd to many I don't think I'm alone in thinking this is the funniest and most enjoyable comedy movie that has been released in such a long time.All the actors do such a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life in such a small scale setting and budget, you can clearly tell they have an immense passion for the project and had tremendous fun creating this masterpiece.There's a creative synergy of genres here not seen since the likes of Shaun of the Dead. A true horror comedy for fans of both genres.I've personally watched this movie about 15 times and will likely watch it another 15 again. Outrageously funny, subtle endearing heartfelt comedy. You'd be missing out if you let the one slip you by. Can confidently say this is the best thing that Taika Waititi ever put out.Two tv shows have subsequently been produced and released to popular acclaim and they are both absolutely fantastic fun.Truly an underated comedy gem which is a must-watch for those that appreciate subtle, nuanced and niche humour that is inoffensive and unappreciated by the masses.

"Improvising vignettes amuse at times, seem awkward at others.","I suppose that if you were not expecting much this film might amuse at times. If you are a horror movies fan, this is meant to be a comedy, maybe a dark comedy, but certainly not a horror movie. What it turns out to be is some Kiwi actors improvising vignettes about what some old -time vampires might experience in modern days. There is really no plot but the film makers are good at following the characters as any documentary should, waiting for the story to unfold itself. Unfortunately, it never really does. What it delivers is some one-liners, lots of fake looking gore and stiff wire work. At times the actors appear uncomfortable in their roles and possible funny moments are lost as the actors appear to not know what to do with a scenario, trip over each others lines, or give us awkward face mugging at the camera.I see from the reviews that many New Zealanders like the film, and that is fine. They should support their film industry. However, New Zealand is responsible for Peter Jackson, so we know that they are much more capable than this type of amateur production.",,Anonymous,Horror
A fun Halloween film,"I remember when this movie came out and everyone was raving about it. Since then, I had completely forgotten about it unit today, when an email from HBO recommended it as part of their Halloween offering. Those memories of everyone saying how great it was and the fact that it is a Taika Waititi project made me eager to watch it.To be completely honest with you, I'm a little disappointed. That is probably due to my expectations, but nonetheless, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.
First of all, is it funny? At times, sure. I wasn't howling with laughter at every joke but certainly, some of them landed. By far, the best and funniest thing about this entire film is the setting. Having four vampires of varying ages living together as flatmates is rather funny on its own. Unfortunately, I felt that that side was explored very little. Instead, the movie tries to introduce new characters and find comedy in their reactions to this whole ordeal. I would've been completely fine with watching the four main characters living their lives as vampire flatmates for the entire 86 minutes that this film runs for. They were by far the best and funniest characters in the film.As it is Halloween, I probably ended up enjoying this film more than I would've, say in July. And as a Halloween film, it works great. Obviously, there are vampires in it, but there are also werewolves and zombies, be it in very minor roles. The werewolves were in fact one the best parts of this movie.The mockumentary style and mostly funny jokes make this film a worthwhile watch. And of course, as with all comedies, you might end up enjoying this far more than I did, depending on your sense of humour. For me though, this was nothing more than a fun Halloween movie that made laugh a good few times.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Hilarious Journey with What We Do in the Shadows,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" offers a comedic experience that is both hilarious and refreshing. Throughout the film, I found myself thoroughly entertained by its wit and charm. It stands as a prime example of situational comedy at its finest, particularly in its exploration of vampires attempting to navigate modern life while sharing a household.The premise itself-vampires cohabiting and trying to adapt to the mundane aspects of contemporary society-naturally lends itself to absurdity and humor. Yet, what elevates the comedy to another level is the unique blend of each character's outdated beliefs and habits from their respective centuries. From their antiquated mannerisms to their peculiar obsessions, each vampire brings a different flavor of backwardness to the table, resulting in a delightful clash of old-world sensibilities with present-day realities.The brilliance of the film lies in its ability to present these absurd situations in a way that feels remarkably ordinary. Despite the fantastical nature of its premise, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" grounds its humor in a relatable and human context. The struggles of its characters, whether it be grappling with technology or adapting to social norms, resonate with viewers on a universal level. It's this balance between the extraordinary and the mundane that makes the comedy so effective and enjoyable.Furthermore, the film's mockumentary format adds another layer of humor by allowing the characters to directly address the audience and share their perspectives. This narrative device not only provides insight into the vampires' peculiarities but also invites viewers to become part of the joke, blurring the line between fiction and reality.Overall, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a comedic gem that masterfully combines supernatural elements with everyday humor. Its clever writing, stellar performances, and innovative approach to the mockumentary genre make it a standout film in the comedy genre. I highly recommend it to anyone in search of a good laugh and hope to discover more films of a similar vein in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shadows and Fog,"Four twenty-first century New Zealand vampires are interviewed by a documentary crew in this horror mockumentary written, directed by and starring Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. Much of the film was reportedly improvised with over 100 hours of footage shot. As such, the film is highly uneven with some sequences dragging; the ""swear-wolves"" in particular are far less interesting than the vampire protagonists. Most of the film clicks into place nicely though, and while scattered gags misfire, there are far more hits than misses. At the film's funniest, two police officers visit the vampires' den (dilapidated house) and (without checking) accept that a bloodied corpse on a dirty floor is a drunk friend who has passed out, instructing the vampires to at least place a pillow under his head! Clement also has a great deadpan moment as he casually announces that he must have hit a main artery after his attempt to drain a woman's blood turns messy. Humour aside, the film is thoughtfully assembled with archive footage gloriously spliced into the mix, as well as some faux newspaper headlines. There is also much to like in how comically anachronistic the vampires (wearing period costumes for the most part) are, using Skype to stay in contact and repeatedly failing to get into local nightclubs since they need to be ""invited in"". There are also some fun references to 'The Lost Boys' and vampire lore in general, including vampires' ability to hypnotise and get people to look at them, which for our not-so-skilled nosferatus involves physically knocking on their doors!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"For What You Expect, It Is Totally Unfunny. ♦ 0%","I love the team behind this film for having made me laugh with their quirky ideas in TV shows and other films. Flight of the Conchords' two-season TV show was immensely enjoyable. But, in here, all I could see was first person conversations that are everything but funny.Narrating their life and death stories are four wannabe vampires who take pride in their ages and useless powers. While one would expect the film to advance to a laugh ride, it goes nowhere. They occupy a dull mansion and invite virgin friends of friends to victimize them; how convenient! Now I am all yes for not having a proper storyline, but there is no humor in even the farthest corners of the dialogs. I may have chuckled once or twice, but they were due to slapstick, which also starts to decline after the first twenty minutes.The makers fail to understand that a promising premise cannot single-handedly drive a good show; it's got to have traction. There is nothing much else to talk about this film that is basically a bad and cringe-worthy execution.BOTTOM LINE: If it is streaks of laughter that you are expecting to do while watching this indie satire show, then I'll suggest you better wait till the time they start selling the DVDs for free, if that ever happens.

Fantastic in the moment.,"So i've been a kiwi for a long time now, since I was born. And I somehow hadn't seen what we do in the shadows until a few days ago. I am very familiar with Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement so I knew what to expect, I got exactly what I was expecting and that's not a bad thing.What we do in the shadows is so clever and so funny. I think the fantastic performances hold this movie together. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Jonny Brugh give some of my favourite comedic performances ever. All of the line delivery is phenomenal, the physical comedy works brilliantly as well.Most of the gags work for me, but unfortunately a couple of fantastic gags were overused a bit. The gag with the police officers not noticing what's directly in front of them was hilarious the first time, but by the third time it didn't really land. The gag about characters pointing out the documentary crew was also very funny the first couple times but was also used a little too often for my taste.The cinematography and editing were used to great comedic effect and made for some historical gags, documentary style really helped with this. What we do in the shadows is one of my favourite mockumentary, but I don't think I'll be watching it all that often. It's fun in the moment but it's not challenging in any way. I really enjoyed my experience but it doesn't give much to think about when the film is over. I still recommend that you watch it.

An instant classic from Jemaine Clement & Taika Waititi,"At the time of its release, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" didn't exactly set the world on fire. While it raked in a respectable two million dollars at the box office in its native New Zealand, the rest of the world unfortunately didn't show the same level of enthusiasm. Eight years later, the movie is probably as popular as it ever has been, thanks to the successful American television adaptation.Like the subsequent TV series, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" uses a mockumentary format. In this case, the premise is that a documentary crew was given access to follow a group of vampires in the months leading up to the Unholy Masquerade (basically a shindig for the undead that takes place every few years). The film chronicles the daily lives of the vampires as they share a flat in Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand.The setup is simple but part of the movie's appeal is how it marries mundane real world conflicts with the supernatural. The opening scene with the flatmates arguing about chores is a prime example and sets the film's tone right away. As you might expect, the script is a bit light on narrative but there are indeed distinct character arcs that play out over the course of the film.The cast is nicely assembled, though not exactly star-studded. American audiences already had some familiarity with Jemaine Clement & Rhys Darby due to ""Flight of the Conchords"" but the rest of the cast (even Taika Waititi) were pretty much unknown. That actually works well for a mockumentary because it lends a sense of authenticity. In any case, from top to bottom, this cast delivers the goods.Production-wise, I'm frankly amazed that the movie had a budget of only $1.6 million. Granted, it's shot documentary-style but you can hardly make anything for that kind of money these days. So, my hat's off to Clement & Waititi for the quality behind the production (and the direction). I also have to say that using Norma Tanega's ""You're Dead"" as the music for the opening credits was an inspired choice.In the end, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is among the very best mockumentaries around. If you appreciate the work of Christopher Guest (""This is Spinal Tap"", ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""A Mighty Wind"", etc...) then I feel confident in saying that this will be right up your alley. Horror buffs ought to get a kick out of it as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
campy vampires.,"Written, directed, AND starring the team of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. That's sometimes a warning sign, but not in this case! The life of modern day vampires. A mockumentary, where the vamps are all flatmates, dealing with the small, everyday issues that come up, like who isn't doing their chores. In new zealand. It's pretty funny! A lot of situational humor; they go to a disco. They pick a fight with a rival gang of guys who claim to be werewolves. But are opposed to swearing. Unlike the vamps.... they swear throughout the film. The human teaches the 800 year old vamps how to use the internet. Fun, but pretty dry. Lots of vomiting. Running gag where the human assistant begs to become a vamp, but when they don't bite her, she claims male chauvanism. When the neighbors complain, it's constable minogue that shows up. Funny stuff.

A Decent Comedy If Just A Little Repetitive,"Pros:
1. The comedy, when it lands, is of laugh-out-loud quality: ""I think of it like this: if you were going to eat a sandwich, you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.""
2. The set and costume design are fantastic and really help to seal the vampiric gothic feel.
3. The gore and practical effects look really good and are proof that a big budget isn't necessary to pull that kind of thing off.
4. Taika Waititi (Viago), Jemaine Clement (Vladislav), and Jonny Brugh (Deacon) give great comedic performances.
5. Jemaine Clement, Jonny Brugh, and Taika Waititi have tremendous chemistry with each other, and it is unequivocally the engine behind the film.
6. The score not only matches the gothic theme of the movie, but it also helps to breathe a little life into the film to prevent it from becoming stale.Cons:
1. At times, the comedy feels a little forced and inappropriate.

Stylish indie film eschews plot in favor of plotlessness,"This is a great looking film, with typically sharp Wellington VFX and sumptuous, gritty goth set design, the film is obviously an attraction for local New Zealand (and Wellington) viewers, in the sense that it shows its cast in familiar locations for partying Wellingtonians, and the camera is focused on Wellington actors Waititi and Clement for about 90 percent of the screen time.What We Do in the Shadows is also a mixed genre film, something the film industry tends to reject, but can be done brilliantly with indie film, and frankly, the film never feels cheap or compromised, often using a kind of there-in-the-moment live camera feel, and improvised lines throughout.However, this film has limitations, and its ultimately a bit of a disappointment. The movie shows the lives of four overdressed vampires, intimately sharing their crazy lives and tribulations etc, but there's really no plot, and certainly nothing resembling a satisfying ending sequence.Clearly, there's plot points that a proper story development could pick out as suitable material for a third act here, for instance, when an archaic Nosferatu-lookalike vampire downstairs gets attacked by vampire hunters, but the event just passes as 'part of the story', as are plot threads about gang friction between vampires and werewolves, or some bathetic humor about Clements ex-girlfriend being a torment of some sort. Basically, this is a film where the characters are defined, then the acting is improvised; as a result the audience gives its time, but after a stylish opening, gets no substantial ending in return.""Shadows"" is basically a series of comedy sketches about flatting life for teens, and I would rather see some comedy with a bit of scope or depth - Waititi comes across on screen as clean cut, fruity and lightweight, but never hilarious. I get the feeling he was more focused on the quality of his images, and the character dynamics than the actual gags, much less the story. Oh well.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Is this supposed to be funny?,"So I reluctantly decided to watch this film, that had oh such good ratings from critics and audiences alike. What did I see?Well, level of production inferior to some of YouTube videos nowadays, for starters. Everything looks dirt-cheap with laughable effects and poor camera work. I read that the budget was 1.6 million dollars, yet it looks 1.59 million dollars cheaper.But it's not just about the looks, right? It's a comedy, after all, it's the writing that matters! Well unfortunately the jokes here are pure sh*t mostly. It's all dirt-cheap puns about how werewolves act like dogs, so they smell and run after sticks. Or how these guys are vampires, so they can't wear silver necklases as it burns, and they bite people. Oh wow, my belly just hurts so much from all the laughter. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, which doesn't really help anything.The only reasons this was not a 1/10 are that were like 2 moderately amusing gags, and the whole thing lasts less than an hour and a half, so while it is a tedious bore, it's not as long as it could've been. I heard about this movie after its director and writer Taika Waititi (or whatever) was praised for ""bringing his charm and wit"" to Thor Ragnarok, which I'm yet to watch.

It follows a flat-sharing pack of modern Wellington vampires (inc Waititi, Clement, Johnny Brugh & Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) as they hilariously navigate city life, bicker over chores, cruise for victims (who they bloodily devour) & get into spats with a similar local pack of werewolves. Under-stated & dry it is VERY funny - and a great glimpse at the genius that was to come from Waititi.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's kind of alright,"Like all mockumentaries, it kind of works, but isn't really funny enough to be a proper comedy. The tone is great and the archness of a fly-on-the-wall documentary is well re-created, but this is no David Brent and The Office work of next level meta-filmmaking.

Won't survive the light of day,"The mockumentary has not really had a good recent workout, due to the Fear of Looking Shallow. Why mock, when we can celebrate? In this case, what is apparently being mocked doesn't even exist. But this vampire flatmates genre flick certainly has the dial turned up to.. well not quite 11 but pretty high.What is fresh here is the humorous eye that laughs at the fallacies of the Hollywood vampire myth as well as the bro culture that the film is actually about. I loved the flatmates helping each other dress up for a night out because ""they can't use mirrors, so don't know what they look like"". They can only hang out in certain clubs, due to having to be invited in.Probably the peak of the humour involves the werewolves being a dumb Iron John self help group - ""Werewolves don't swear!"" - who seem to be in continual crises. Even the pathos about death is more or less pitch perfect.This has the strength to be a cult, but if it shames the torrent of vampire crap and angst hangers-on (yes Being Human, I'm looking at you) that gets churned out at a truly scary rate - so much the better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A different kind of vampire movie,"This is a great mockumentary, especially if you like Taika Waititi's brand of humor.

A Vampire tale you will not soon forget,"Some people love documentaries, some people despise them, myself I'm somewhat in the middle, of course the subject has to interest me somewhat for me to even take a look at. Mockumentaries on the other hand I love (when done well) When it comes to mockumentaries, anything and everything goes, there are no real rules, as long as it's somewhat believable, interesting and makes us laugh usually a mockumentary is well received. Give anything some interesting characters and a reality storyline and it's usually enough to make us want to watch. I personally had never heard of ""What we do in the shadows"" until a friend asked me my thoughts, after watching the trailer I had the film in no time ready to watch. Viago, Deacon, Petyr and Vladislav are four housemates who rent a property in New Zealand, they have lived together for a very long time and know all there is to know about each other, the guys have one thing in common; they are all vampires and each of them is between 100 and 300 years old, never aging from the time they were originally turned. The film follows three of the group as they go about their daily business from their eating habits to their cleaning habits even introducing us at one point to their enemies. Along the way they meet Nick who is turned and decide they need to show him their world and how to survive it on a day to day basis. What we do in the shadows is a laugh a minute, literally. Line after line of jokes, wit and humour never end. Being a mockumentary film the character development is quite strong, you do actually end up feeling sorry and getting involved in each of their lives and the journey they undertake. I personally thought the characters were fantastic, each had their quirks and quips which made them stand out for their own reasons. Starring Jemaine Clement (Eagle Vs Shark, Flight of the Conchords) as Vladislav. Taika Waititi (Eagle vs Shark, Boy) as Viago. Jonathan Brugh (How to meet girls from a distance) as Deacon. Ben Fransham (30 Days of Night, The Ferryman) as Petyr and Cori Gonzalez-Macuer (Eagle vs Shark) as Nick. The guys were brilliant, funny and captivating, never taking themselves too seriously but seriously enough to engage you in their mishaps and adventures. The film is based around a short film made by the same people in 2006, being a mockumentary the camera work is pretty much hand held camera work, but it works well in its style and you never feel you're missing anything. The directors, writers and actors who all worked together have done an outstanding job in making some good fun lighthearted entertainment. Not really one for the younger kids and the teens won't really get all the hidden jokes throughout but I think mums and dads who have a slightly warped sense of humour will love it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Vampires, ""the new guy"", sharing a flat and coming to terms with change.","I love how everyone, not only the main characters, are so naive and clumsy. It's the same with Flight of the Conchords (the TV-show). People blindly accept almost everything being said to them, and even in extreme situations they react with confusion or awkwardness. I think this is what makes the Clement's comedy work, but it required that the audience is willing to accept these unrealistic responses to the crazy scenarios.The movie plays around with tropes from the vampire setting, and puts it up against the ""living together""-situation which was also used in Flight of the Conchords. This combination is really odd, but they make it work. The storyline is something like: ""A new, young guy becomes part of the group, which leads to complications"" - but that's all these guys need to make a funny movie.If anything, the movie could have had a bit more on the line for these characters, if only for the potential for more comedy. There is also a (kind of) serious moment where one character reflects on immortality, and it worked well enough that the movie could have had more of this without losing its comedic charm.Oh, and Stu seems like a great guy,",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I love their quirky NZ sense of humour; and despite not really liking their earlier collaboration (Eagle vs Shark, 2007), I thought this would be worth seeing.The cast is superb and the performances exceptional, from Taika Waititi's bossy vampire to Stu Rutherford's subtle discomfort.

This essential Kiwi comedy delivers a jaunty juxtaposition of.deadpan, macho-yet-camp vampires from various historical eras against ordinary scenes of Wellington, New Zealand. Filmed in a mock-umentary style, it explores contemporary dilemmas such as 'How do vampires handle housework?' and 'Can centuries-old people still be ""cool""?'. As with many great comedies, the jokes are sharp and the fight scenes are hilariously surprising.

Hilarious.,"I've never seen Flight of the Conchords but I was familiar with their brand of deadpan irony. What We Do In The Shadows is class-A irony as we follow a band of vampires integrate themselves into contemporary New Zealand. It adapts the mockumentary style of This Is Spinal Tap, one that now feels like it belongs on TV with The Office and Modern Family, but it breaks the bounds of the small screen with supernatural moments and entertaining wire tricks. The backbone is the humour, the way it approaches these dark things in such a blase way with its endearing network of characters. Sometimes it does get a little too silly or a payoff is predictable, but it's coming so thick and fast that it's briskly redeemed. It's the eye for storytelling and eventual thoughtful heart, where it discusses life, love and death, that boost it above being a typical midnight comedy. One of the funniest and most rewarding films of the year that shows how vampires aren't finished yet.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amusing vampire comedy,"After hearing so many good reports about this movie - and remembering that New Zealand has made some really funny offbeat comedies (like the early works of Peter Jackson) - I decided to give it a look. And for the most part, I am glad I gave it a chance. It is indeed very amusing at times. I think that the reason the movie is humorous is that it has a very warm viewpoint towards the characters. Yes, some of the acting is a little rough, but these characters come across as HUMAN despite being vampires. They have needs, they have weaknesses, and other attributes that we in the audience can identify with. You'll like them despite their blood sucking. Speaking of blood sucking, the gore and the special effects are quite good for what had to have been a really low budget.If there is a weakness to this movie, it is in the story department. I realize the movie is a mockumentary following the characters in a day by day format (or make that night by night!), but for the longest time the movie is pretty episodic. After a while, you'll wish for some plot to come in to challenge the characters and add in some real drama. This lack of plot I believe holds the movie back from being great. But there's still enough here to make for a very enjoyable viewing.",,Anonymous,Horror
What We Do in the Shadows,"What is missing from a lot of comedies these days is visual comedy. The YouTube channel ""Every Frame A Painting"" did a video on Edgar Wright perfectly explaining this, and using this as a reason why Edgar Wright is the smartest comedy director currently out there. Basically, thanks in no small part to Judd Apatow, most of the comedies of the past 10 years have basically been mostly comedic improv on screen, and even if it is scripted that is an accurate description of what it feels like. And even when they do improv the actors aren't skilled enough to portray the unique, hilarious characters in films such as ""Best in Show"" and ""This is Spinal Tap"". This is where ""What We Do in the Shadows"" comes in.This film combines some hilarious visual comedy elements similar to Edgar Wright, while also including the mockumentary improv style of Christopher Guest, and while filmmakers Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clements don't quite reach the heights of those two directors, they craft an original, very funny comedy.The film gets right into it. For the first 6 minutes basically everything is a joke, and it's pretty hilarious, but I was immediately skeptical about how long they could go with this premise while still being funny. The answer is: surprisingly long, even if it begins to feel one note towards the end of the film.For those unfamiliar with the premise, there is a group of vampires that meet in a flat in New Zealand, hang out, go to clubs, and casually live their lives as vampires.The film is basically filled with clever moments playing into vampire lore, and hilarious lines (that I will not spoil). The film is It's also surprisingly heartfelt. It's actually about the value of friendship, and finding people who accept who you are.There isn't really much more to say. It's funny and clever and by the end of the film they've pretty much milked all that they could out of the premise and then some. It's definitely one of the better comedies I've seen recently. Hilarious cast of characters, great performances, and surprisingly great visual effects, mostly done practically.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Werewolves not Swearwolves,"This was something I stumbled across almost by accident and is one of the funniest films I have seen for years.The documentary style combines with absurd, macabre humour and brilliant comic acting performances to produce what I suspect will become a cult classic along the lines of Withnail & I and Spinal Tap.The story of a small group of vampires 'flatting' in the Wellington area of New Zealand, their back histories spoken to camera, and the lead up to the Unholy Masquerade result in some truly hilarious set- pieces and complications such as who is responsible for doing the dishes and how best to be 'invited' into the hottest nightclubs in the city on a night out.A couple of the cast members are known through their performances in 'The Flight of the Concords' but others were, to me at least, unknowns and all turn in masterful performances without exception.The music score is integral to the movie and used in a similar way to, say Pulp Fiction, in setting the scenes and adding polish. There are lines of dialogue that will become, if they're not already, classics to those in the know.This really is a laugh out loud, ludicrous movie. Hugely original and, I suspect, the result of a lot of hard work edited down to a marvellous feast of black comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

What We Do In The Shadows highlights the quirky comedic wit of Taika Waititi.,"A man who has rocketed to mainstream fame with 'Thor: Ragnarok', however I find his previous lesser known work to be more enthralling and creatively unique. A faux documentary of a small group of vampires who share a house together. We view their nightly lives but also welcoming a new younger member to the vampiric clan. Have you ever wondered what vampires get up to except sleeping in coffins and drinking the blood of a virgin? Well, this film explores that in the best way possible: comedically. There's nothing funny about a vampire...but a vampire residing in New Zealand? That's a whole different story. It's impossible not to admire the type of eccentric humour that is put into Waititi's films. Quick, sharp and full of wit, the dialogue remains intelligent throughout without having to resort to slapstick. Burst veins causing blood to spray, bat fights, werewolf clans and even the hierarchal structure of master and familiar. Traditional vampiric routines with a hint of edgy fun. Also liked the reference to other vampire films like 'The Lost Boys' and the horrifically terrible 'Twilight'. Did I laugh all the way through? No. Is it as funny as everyone claims it to be? Definitely not. Though the creativity in every scene makes the flick scarily entertaining. Waititi, Clement and Brugh have fang-tastic on screen chemistry. The costume design was authentic, heck even the visual effects were pretty decent considering the low budget. A nice short runtime results in a consistent pace that moves along rapidly. I would've liked to have seen more of a plot offered to keep me enthralled, but I appreciate the direction Waititi and Clement took. A fun intriguing look into the life of a vampire with plenty of comedic wit, albeit slightly overrated. Atleast I laughed at this, shows that I have more life than a vampire!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Vidiot Reviews...,"What We Do in the ShadowsThe hardest part of rooming with another vampire is deciding who gets to sleep in the larger coffin.Luckily, the sleeping arrangements in this comedy have already been decided.On the promise they won't be drained of plasma, a documentary film-crew is permitted to capture the night-to-night activities of a group of vampires (Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh, Ben Fransham) sharing a flat in New Zealand.In the shadow of this year's masquerade ball, the roommates must not only contend with the death of their oldest roomy, but also the arrival of a novice vampire and his human friend.A hysterical take on the found-footage genre, this Kiwi contribution perfectly captures the idiosyncratic drawbacks and benefits to being undead - and having roommates.With a clever script connecting the gags seamlessly, this morbid mockumentary has cult classic potential.Ironically, blood-sucking roommates aren't as inclined to vacuum as one would assume.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

My only complaint is that it's slightly too long to keep the humour level high, it probably could have been trimmed by 10 minutes to make the whole thing tighter.

The characters are essentially just hyper-clichéd stereotypes, such as the German pedantic vampire with a penchant for organizing his friends' lives, or the sex crazed vampire master with a craving for torture. Yet, despite being such stereotypes, each character is quite believable—in part achieved through the great (and hilarious) performances.The movie exudes a sense of play and joy.

Fun and fangs,"""The Unholy Masquerade"" is a secret cult event, full of vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures that takes place in New Zealand. Only a few days before that, some vampires open the gates of their home for a documentary crew to follow their lives. Viago (Taika Waititi), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Petyr (Ben Fransham) and Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) are those vampires, and we shall see how they struggle with issues like being flatmates, doing the house chores and cope with modern day lifestyle; all of this is an overwhelming, funny and bloody adventure. Jemaine Clement is a well-known comedian from New Zealand, co-creator of ""Flight of the Concords"" (2007-2009), and also known as the villain ""Boris the Animal"" in the film ""Men in Black 3"" (Barry Sonnenfeld, 2012). He and Taika Waititi, seen as Ryan Reynolds pal in ""Green Lantern"" (Martin Campbell, 2011) direct this amazing and funny mockumentary. It is a fresh take on vampires, werewolves and else, who are out of time and out of place, misfits that are actually more human than those seen on more ""serious"" incarnations. However, there is a possible hiccup here, and it is its that New Zealand scent, that mysterious something the country and culture still has. Once you get immersed into it, there is no way back, you love it. That happens with the humor as well, and I recommend you to watch this and then have your word about it.

"Entertaining, even with some dry humour","The movie tells the daily lifeerrunlife of flatmate vampires Viago, Vladislav, Deacon and Petyr in New Zealand. Viago is the 16th century vampire, aristocratic and bossy often times. Vladislav is the medieval vampire, a noble vampire but also the most ruthless killer of them. Deacon is the youngest changed vampire from the World War II era, often acting out living like a bum in the flat. The last of them, Petyr, is the oldest of them, aging about 8000 years old. They live their everyday lives n the flat, still influenced by the cultures from their own times. The trio Viago, Vladislav and Deacon sometimes go out to the town and hang out. Deacon has a human familiar Jackie who does most of the blood cleaning related housework in the flat. She also lure in victims for the vampires. Deacon has promised vampirehood to Jackie but hasn't turned her yet. One night Jackie brings a couple Nick and Josephine as victims. Nick gets his blood drained by Petyr but he also turns him into a vampire. And then there were four. Nick brings in new cultural color to the group. Soon He brings his friend Stu, an IT guy, to the group. Stu introduces the modern information technology to the group and becomes a good friend to them. For this, and because he's Nick's best friend, the group form a pact not to eat Stu.Besides inviting Stu into the group, Nick is quite irresponsible of his newly gained vampirehood. He has been carelessly telling just about anybody that he's a vampire, even showing some of his abilities to complete human strangers. One day, a vampire hunter comes to the flat's basement, Petyr's lair. Petyr easily kills the hunter but he dies of sunlight. The group blames Nick for this and banishes him from the flat. Alas, the night for the Unholy Masquerade comes. The masquerade is the once a year night where New Zealand's undead community comes and mingles together. Vladislav doesn't go for knowing his nemesis is the event's guest of honor. Viago and Deacon go there and find that Jackie has been turned by Nick. They also bring Stu there, still human. Soon the masquerade guests find out that Stu is human and they get eager to eat him. The group manages to get Stu out safely but on their way home they meet their nemesis werewolf pack who are transforming since it's a full moon night. They eventually attack Stu and mangle his body. But it turns out that the attack turns Stu into a werewolf and that make the vampires and the werewolfs to be friends.The story is quite nice in overall. Focusing on the age old human fascination about the pseudo-immortal undead of vampires, the movie presents a very light mood about what used to be a strictly horror plot base. It nicely imagines the daily, or should I say nightly, consequences of a vampire's life of staying alive in the modern world. This is done by incorporating contemporary culture and customs such as flat sharing, hang outs, and the social internet critically into the story as plot defining elements, even though weaker ones.But the story also did justice to connect older vampire movies and the general myths about vampires by staying true to the main attributes of the vampires. Minus the garlic thing, this movie incorporates plot defining myths about the vampiric abilities, blood drinking, 'let me in' catch, silver, and the crucifix effect.What's good is that the movie doesn't add any more imbalanced super powers to the vampires. No offense to all of you Twilight Saga fanatics, but for me a vampire based story is already maximum without having to have superhero powers. When I see vampire movies, I really want to see vampires, not blood sucking X-Men wannabes. For that, I think that this movie, and Only Lovers Left Alive (2013), are great example of vampire movies that aren't predominantly horror but still also have the frightening side of vampires.Though they often feel dry, the humor nicely incorporates the vampire myths into it. I kind of like how they put in the silver, the 'let me in' catch and the hypnosis into the story. A funny surprise even comes in a post-credits scene for this. Yet again I feel that although most of the jokes are interesting, they don't really crack big laughs from me.For me the acting overall is not very good. I see a lot of overacting here and there by the three main characters, and 'under-acting' by the rest of the cast. But then again, I think that this movie's real interesting point is not the acting or the comedy, but instead the story and how the story mixes everyday modern life with the vampire condition.For me What We do In the Shadows (2014) feels like it deserves a humble 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. It's mild and very entertaining. After the wave of Twilight Saga, I think this movie can put back the older vampire myths into the general understanding consensus.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hilarious With Lot's Of Great Gimmicks,"What We Do In The Shadows is a downright hilarious Kiwi mockumentary horror-comedy about 4 vampires- Deacon, Vlad, Viago & Peter- who are flatting together after having immigrated to New Zealand.The life of a Kiwi Vampire consists of getting invited into bars, feasting on locals (preferably virgins), taking on human slaves (familiars) to do your bidding, going to masquerade balls (with other vampires, witches & zombies), and- of course- getting into street fights with the local gang of werewolves.Deacon is sort of the unofficial leader of the group. He keeps everyone in line and drags everyone out to different events. His still pangs for the love of his life- Katharine- whom he came to New Zealand for, only to find she was taken and happy. Seeing how happy she was, he decided not to turn her and let her live her life. She's now 90, but he still digs her.Viago- played by director Taika Waititi- is the youngest of the four. A rebel of sorts. He has a familiar named Jackie who does everything for the guys. She expects to be turned as repayment for her loyalty- but Viago keeps putting it off.Vlad- played by director Jemaine Clement- is the most infamous of the group. Renown in legend for his torturous ways (which he has since grown out of). His ex-girlfriend- The Beast- is his nemesis.Peter is the oldest of the group. They can't control him, so they keep him locked in a room in the basement. Unlike the others- who have retained their human images- Peter is rocking the traditional Nosferatu look. He enjoys turning people. He even turned Viago.At one point, the guys get Jackie to round them up some virgins for a dinner party: ""I think we virgin drink blood because...it sounds cool."" - Viago ""If you were going to enjoy a sandwich.You will just enjoy it more if you know no one has f*cked it."" - VladThe loyal servant that she is, Jackie lures her childhood sweetheart Nick, and an old school chum, over for a ""dinner party"" at the den.But before the guys can feast on Nick, he manages to escape- only to be caught by Peter, who turns him.Newly turned Nick keeps pissing everyone off, as he won't stop flying around the neighbours and telling everybody he's a vampire.While out doing this, he accidentally reveals himself to a vampire hunter- who follows them home and kills Peter (before being slain himself).For this transgression, Nick gets banished from the den...but his best human friend Stu is still allowed to stick around, because all the guys like him (and have collectively agreed not to kill him).More trouble arises when Nick brings Stu to the annual Vampire, Witch & Zombie masquerade ball. All the other attendees can sense his humanness and want to feast on him. Forcing the group of guys to flee.On their way home, they happen upon a local pack of PC werewolves who are trying to chain themselves to trees before they turn during the full moon. However, a full scale battle breaks out, during which the werewolves seize Stu from the guys.The werewolves don't eat Stu though. They turn him- out of spite for the vampire counterparts. But Stu acts as a conciliatory force, and bridges the gap between the werewolves and vampires- rendering them friends in the end (even if there is still some tension there).It's great to see the Kiwi's keeping their mockumentary tradition- established by Peter Jackson with Forgotten Silver- alive. This film is absolutely hilarious. It's chock full of clever gimmicks, great special effects (on a budget) and just the right amount of gore (nothing too over the top). There are some great quotes in there too (like noted above).What We Do In The Shadows premiered at TIFF last year and deservingly took home the Midnight Madness prize (as the fan favourite Midnight Madness screening). If you are looking for a relatively new horror-comedy to check out this Halloween season...definitely go this route...it comes highly recommended.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Bat fight!""","I almost passed this sly gem by since vampires haven't been interesting since ""Twilight"" ruined the genre for adults and drained the life out of the genre. Still, having read good things about WWDITS, I gave it a chance and discovered a terrific mockumentary of the travails of being undead in this day and age. This is the worthy successor to Roman Polanski's ""Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967), the only vampire spoof that ever really worked...until now.Certainly the mockumentary is by now a cliché of its own, with ""Spinal Tap"" still winner and champion. WWDITS doesn't claim to challenge that epic, instead, it takes a charming and old-fashioned approach to simply having a ""protected"" film crew (they all wear crucifixes) follow the daily/nightly routine of four undead and watch them interact, as well as give solo interviews. Viago, Deacon, Vladislav, and Peytr have lived (sort of) through the ages, yet can't quite get the ability to function in a world that has passed them by. Each is trapped in the era in which they died and were transformed. Watching them forced to take on a fifth member of the clan, who started as dinner, is where the real fun starts. Nick, the new guy, is annoying and not dealing well with his transition. His comeuppance is that his human friend, Stu, becomes beloved of the other vampires. They like him better than Nick, which brings its own tension to the table. Jokes are thrown at the viewer fast and furious. Not all of them work, but most do. Very well done sets, costumes, and well placed special effects do wonderful work supporting some stellar performances here. Of note is Taika Waititi as Viago, looking like the picture of Hammer vampire elegance. Also, Jemaine Clement as Vladislav, who brings Dracula realness to the party. These two actors, known best for ""Flight of the Conchords"" wrote and directed this fast-moving slapstick look at the ultimate misfits.Not only are all the well known tropes about vampires trotted out and skewered, but affectionate nods to other cinematic bloodsuckers are generously provided. Most notable is the ball/party sequence near the end, which is a real tribute to Polanski, even though they don't have the gorgeous late Sharon Tate to work with. Bloody, funny, silly (the Procession of Shame gets the prize here), and worth a look if you think the Undead don't have problems. It's your turn to do the dishes.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A sign of great things to come ... flawed but funny,"I'm late to this party, and seeing it for the first time in 2019 it's easy to see the seeds of what led Taika Waititito get the Marvel gig (and execute it so brilliantly). Amongst all (sub) genres, comedy-horror is one of the hardest to get right; the film needs to be both a proper comedy and also a proper horror movie to really work, and take both genres at face-value. Shaun Of The Dead executes this near flawlessly; What We Do In The Shadows does well, but not quite enough for me. The documentary format - whilst a good joke - means it leans more on the comedy, and hence isn't really horror enough. The horror elements play almost as Hammer at its worst, which may or may not be intentional, but distracts from the nuanced performances. Some of the gags are brilliant - the verbal comedy, the physical, the nods to other films and especially the good natured, self aware fun with the rules and tropes of vampirism. Occasionally it hints towards bigger themes - homophobia, for instance. That would be a good fit; vampire stories are almost always about sex or sexuality in some way. The 'coming out' scene is inspired; the scenes of bullying in the street both funny and moving. But the theme never quite takes the theme far enough; it feels like one of a bunch of ideas thrown at the wall until something sticks. The film lacks an ultimate emotional punch for which it strives, and I'm left with the feeling that the newly-launching spin-off TV series might be the best format for this. It's good, of course, and has much re-watch value and quotability ... but the director had better ahead of him.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Biting comedy,"A clever 'mockumentary' that follows the travails of four vampires sharing a house in modern Wellington NZ, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" tags many of the tropes associated with the vampire myth as the foursome struggle to get along and get enough to drink. The film is largely a 'big in-joke' and aficionados of the genre will recognise each of bloodsuckers from movies/books but even if vampires are not your cup of blood, it is still pretty funny. Some of the jokes and sight-gags work better than others but the best parts are brilliant: especially the interactions with the vampires' immortal enemies, the werewolves. Be forewarned: at times the movie is a bit crude (even the werewolves are swear-wolves at times) and gruesome (four guys who drink blood sharing a house, what do you think the kitchen looks like?). Best line: Vlad, on using the legendary sexuality of the vampire to attract prey ""I am the bait and the trap.""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Vampire mocumentary that is less funny than intended. Spinal Tap this is not!,"From the team behind the hugely successful Flight of the Conchords and the fabulous indie hit, Eagle Vs Shark, What We Do in the Shadows is a comedy horror mockumentary with 'hilarious' stamped all the way through it.Except it isn't. Hilarious, that is.Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi write, direct, produce and perform in this spoof documentary about a group of vampire flatmates trying to deal with life in modern times and each other's annoying traits. Being immortal and hundreds of years old does not iron out the problems of who takes care of which chores in any given week. Nor, it appears, does being several centuries old help one iota when it comes to deciding what to wear to the nightclub.There is plenty to like on display: the costumes are fabulously camp, there are references aplenty to the great vampires of film and literature, the sets are fun and there are one or two lovely, practical effects that splatter blood, but nothing too horrific or likely to raise the pulse.There are even a couple of surprising, and very welcome digital effects thrown in. What We Do in the Shadows feels cheap and it's a surprise when the budget allows for something extra.But it isn't enough. The performances are adequate but it all feels a little too much like college kids playing at drama. Forget pastiche, this is weak parody and there is little skill in it here. Clement, as Vladislav, is amusingly gauche in his 'god's gift to women' act, but Waititi, as Viago, appears to have bought his performance, or at least his grin, from Danny John-Jules' Red Dwarf jumble sale. In terms of performances, the greatest joy comes from the deadpan, detachment of Stu (Stuart Rutherford) and Ben Fransham's Petyr, the bastard son of Nosferatu, whose dialogue would probably fit on the back of his fangs.Alas, there is a distinct lack of strong female roles on display here, with the women reduced to comedy fodder bit parts. When they appear, they are amusing, but perhaps What We Do in the Shadows could have benefited from a matriarchal touch.For years Christopher Guest has delighted audiences with mockumentaries like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and the peerless This is Spinal Tap, and my guess is this this is what Clement and Waititi were aiming for. The trouble is, where Guest played it straight, they work too damn hard at eking out laughs at every turn. Heck, this is nowhere near as funny as Anvil: The Story of Anvil, and that wasn't even a spoof!Whilst not a flop by any means, What We Do in the Shadows was clearly far more amusing to make than it was to watch and the final, post-credit, line is sadly prophetic, and not for the reason they intend.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Comedy of 2015,"Even though I really dislike the fount footage genre, What We Do in the Shadows proves there are still a few useful ideas yet to be discovered in the subgenre. The movie has been praised as one of the best comedies of the year by many critics, and it certainly lives up to that title. Shadows is a breath of fresh air in the comedy/horror department. Though I can certainly see some people having a problem with the deadpan humor, a lot of the comedy comes from the cultural differences from the extremely old vampires (some dating back to the Medieval Times) as they struggle to keep up with current times.Basically the movie will mostly likely be a bust for you if you are someone who doesn't find the general idea of a bunch of vampires struggling to fit into today's society funny. But it totally worked for me and I loved how they were stuck in the past (decor, clothing style, appliances, etc) and needed a new member to bring them up to speed. But that new member unfortunately is the weakest point of Shadows, Nick is by far the least interesting character and/or aspect of the movie. He is the one character who is there to advance the story so he's more or less necessary, which is bittersweet.But outside of that complaint, Shadows is a blast and one of the years best so far. The writers/actors really utilize the flying aspect the vampires possess and create some solid humor with it. They poke fun at just about every single vampire trope you can think of, not having a shadow, virgins, flying, vampire hunters, and many more. Not to mention the numerous jokes about todays current vampire movies, there are a few but they're pretty funny!So if you are someone (like me) who is sick of todays growing trend of vulgar and gross-out comedies, What We Do in the Shadows is just what we've been waiting for!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hasn't done the bloody dishes for five years,"What We Do in the Shadows is a hilarious mockumentary that gains ""full access"" to a secret New Zealand society who gather for the ""The Unholy Masquerade"". At the film's outset, we meet Viago, a fastidious vampire who introduces his fellow flatmates to discuss the challenges of their shared ""living"" arrangements. Among their issues is the fact that Deacon hasn't done the bloody dishes for five years. Much of the film's humour is understated and deals with the more mundane aspects of vampire life. Although there is little in the way of plot, the documentary format serves as ample basis for the many satirical gags that pay homage to almost every theme in the vampire genre (Klaus Ming March 2015).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

What if Dracula had a sitcom?,"First off, an impossibility! If vampires do not cast reflections on mirrors, then a camera, that works with mirrored images, cannot capture a vampire in its natural habitat. Secondly, where would four vampires get good rental references from to rent that mansion in what appears to be Wellington?Ignoring the above holes in this unlikely documentary style comedy, the laughs are very few and very far between. Situational comedy works because one can see themselves in certain situations, but nobody can see themselves trying to be invited into a nightclub! They should have had those strip club promoters teying to entice them into the dodgy confines of a stank nudie place!The Nosferatu-esque closet-dwelling bloodsucker was wasted in its non-verbal role, and the blood hunting was played down so much that it was non existent in the second half of the film. The comedy may have been black, but it missed many marks.They special effects were kept to a minimum, and made their appearance all the more entertaining. The appearance of the Welligton Paranormal police duo was surprising and fun, but underused in my opinion.The continuous and monotonous talking into camera wore off its appeal very quickly, and the bickering fights between the co-inhabitants of the rental were bland for the most part.A good idea that may have been much more comedic in more experienced hands, but a great effort for Flight of the Conchords star: Germaine, and Thor-director Taika!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

We drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.,"Released in 2014, this comedy horror film is fly-on-the-wall mockumentary following the exploits of 4 modern day vampires living together as flatmates in the New Zealand town of Wellington. It was released fairly 'under the radar' but went on to receive lots of world-wide praise for how original and funny it is.Brief Summary:
Four vampires living in New Zealand going about their day-to-day life.Detailed Summary:
Viago, Deacon, Vladislav and Petyr are vampiric housemates who live together in New Zealand. They live fairly normal and mundane lives, doing chores, paying rent, and occasionally going out to nightclubs. One night, one of their meals is not killed properly and is turned into a vampire too. Nick, a modern twenty-something year old, is irresponsible of his new vampiric powers and goes as far as inviting his human friend into the arrangement, a bit of a no-no in the world of the undead. As events develop the vampire friends have to deal with their life while working with the new circumstances that have arisen.Film Stuff:
Directed, written, and starring Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi this 2014 film is more a labour of love and art, rather than a piece of work that was meant to be a blockbuster smash. Made with a budget of around $1.6 million this 86 minute film went on to gross $7 million at the global box office, so it's not necessarily just a bit of a laugh, some serious work went into this to make it a success. The concept of the film was developed using a short film in 2005 (""What we do in the Shadows: Interviews with some Vampires"") as a litmus test. Music in this film comes from Plan 9, with Russian rock band Leningrad providing a song for the trailer and the end credits. The success of the film led to various spin-off TV series; in New Zealand ""Wellington Paranormal"", and TV series with the films title in the USA and UK. With some excellent, low-budget effects, fun make-up and costumes this is film really has a unique look and feel.Cast:
At the top of the billing are Jemaine Clement and Taiki Waititi as Vladislav ""The Poker"" (based on Gary Oldman's performance in ""Bram Stokers Dracula"", and Viago ""The Dandy"" (based on Louis de Pointe du Lac from ""Interview with a Vampire"" - both are hilarious in their respective roles. They really lead the cast well and drive the film forward smartly. The bad boy of the group is Deacon (Jonny Brugh) who plays a great role as the ex-Nazi vampire experiment (based on David from ""The Lost Boys""). Ben Fransham plays the dark horse of the group, Petyr (based on Count Orlok from ""Nosferatu""), a character that is hundred of years old and easily the old man of the group and therefor the least human of the group. Nick and Stu (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stu Rutherford) are the newcomers to the nest and do well (Nick being reminiscent of Edward from ""Twilight""). Rhys Darby pops up leading a pack of Werewolves, he is good light relief to the seriousness of the Vampire chronicles. There are also plenty of other great performances in the film from other Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and even the living humans too.Wrap-up
I enjoyed this original mockumentary film and had a good laugh throughout. It is not a lengthy film and combined with some good editing this film never feels like it is dragging. There is a fun look and feel to the film which I really enjoyed. The effects were wobbly and shaky and worked well - lots of fake blood plenty of high wire flying. At times, the humour is laugh out loud ridiculous, while other times it is absolutely sterile deadpan; both of which suit the film really well. The film does not take itself too seriously at all and provides some good nostalgia to fans of vampire and supernatural films. Expect to see references to ""Nosferatu"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Twilight"", ""Dracula"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Blade"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and so many more horror and supernatural staples of film. I read a review describing this film as the ""Spinal Tap"" of the vampire documentary films and that is quite an apt description. It is ""The Office"" meets ""Flight of the Conchords"" meets ""Being Human"" and most importantly, it is a damn fine film.Go into this with no expectations and you will be delights. It is probably not a family film despite its 15-rating due to the graphic nature of some of the horror - even though it is hilarious. Fresh, funny, strange but entertaining, this film is sure to be cult film for many years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Hilarious, Delightful 90 Minutes,","What We Do in the Shadows is a terrific movie with a very well written plot and a tremendous comedic cast. It is a ridiculously fun, original comedy film as we follow a group of vampires in a documentary style, getting to see what a regular week is like for them. It does this mockumentary take in a way that is fresh and not in any way repetitive or similar to other ones, we feel like these vampires are really people, while also being in hysterics.My only genuine complaint about this movie is that it was too short. Running at just under ninety minutes, I was a little underwhelmed at how abruptly it finished, I felt it could have gone further, more could have happened.The cast is absolutely phenomenal, with everyone having an effortless comedic presence, great chemistry and owning their roles individually. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Jonathan Brugh shine in their respective roles, and the back and forth between them is so good that it is hard to tell what bits are improvised and what are scripted.Pure hilarity from beginning to end. A complete riot, What We do in the Shadows is great fun, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.Follows a group of vampires living in the same household, coping with their mundane day to day lives.Best Performance: Jemaine Clement",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

"One joke, but a funny one","What We Do in the Shadows is a mockumentary, made exactly in the style of all those reality-TV documentaries that fill the day-time television. The ones that follow the lives of ordinary people, are filled with people talking on couches or in cars, don't really contain anything of substance and are just pointless projects to blow money on. Except that in this case we follow a household of vampires living in New Zealand. Oh, they still argue about dishes and cleaning, but they also have conversations about laying down newspapers before drinking from someone because it's such a pain to get blood out of the cushions, and lots more.And to be completely honest, that's about it. That's the one joke the film has. But it's a really funny one. All the different vampire clichés are examined and mocked through our main characters from the young rascal of the group, Deacon, who's only 183 years old, to good old Petyr, who's over 8000 years old and lives in a stone coffin in the basement. The film also contains some other mythological creatures and shamelessly makes fun of them as well.To be fair, the one joke starts to grow a bit stale towards the end. I think that the film makers purposefully wanted to end the film without anything too major happening, because that's how all those ""real"" documentaries end, but it also means that there's not much of a story arc in the film. But, I was still chuckling at the joke even in the very end, so it didn't outlive its welcome. But it was a near thing.Still, the film is very much worth a watch if this is your kind of humour, which you should be able to surmise from what I've told you. If the idea is amusing to you, you're going to enjoy this film a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I think if it was promoted in the US it would have done quite well, seems it did OK in Aussie's corner of the world.I saw someone in the reviews say this movie doesn't have a plot.

And the amazing thing is that it doesn't feel like some one is trying to hard to be funny. Its a very well balanced firework of subtle gags. It captures you from the start.

This restores my hopes for the vampire genre.,"This movie is perfect. If you enjoy horror and the macabre, but are also tired of the weird pop- culture argument between the Gothic vs sparkly vampires, then you will really enjoy this. It takes the mockumentary genre to a different extreme where vampires room together in the real world and try to make connections and friends just as we all do. It shows the daily struggle of four vampire friends who have found themselves rooming in a flat together and their daily activities. They also have the familiar werewolf enemies, done in their own amazing mocking way. The best part is that, although this movie is clearly a comedy mocking the vampire movies which have come before, it doesn't lack story, and still pays particular attention to the makeup and effects. It reminds me of Shaun of the Dead in that way.Recommended for any fan of vampires, comedies, and fringe-movies.This one really thinks outside the coffin.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clever vampire parody,"Ever wonder how vampires always manage to look so spiffy and dapper in their appearance and attire even though they can't see themselves in a mirror? This and many similarly pressing ghoul-related questions are addressed in ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" a macabre mockumentary about four roommates (Ben Fransham, Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh), sharing a home in New Zealand, who just happen to be bloodsucking creatures-of-the-night. Eventually, they're joined by Nick (Cori-Gonzalez Maceur), an unsuspecting victim who comes over for ""dinner"" one night, then pals around with them after his transformation, and Stu (Stu Rutherford), Nick's human friend whose genuine likability keeps the foursome from turning him into one of them.Written and directed by Clement and Waititi, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a fitfully amusing parody of all the conceits and tropes of a genre that has become a mainstay of popular culture in recent years - and that's putting it mildly. Some of those works have even been satirical in nature, but ""Shadows"" ups the ante by setting its spoofery in the context of one of those slice-of-life documentaries so dear to the hearts of reality-TV aficionados everywhere.Like ""The Addams Family"" and ""The Munsters,"" ""Shadows"" derives much of its humor from the domestication of our own bogeymen and fears, as well as the incongruity of a bunch of centuries-old (in one case, millenia-old) undead creatures living and relating in the modern world. Yet, while the humor is decidedly dark in nature - there is no stinting on graphic bloodletting being performed on innocent victims - it's also very clever, even though the movie does hit a point of diminishing returns after awhile, perhaps inevitably, given its somewhat self-restricting one-joke premise.Ultimately, though, it's an original and fun celebration of male camaraderie and bonding - even in its most outlandish form.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A good film, even if it wasn't for me","O New Zealand is an underappreciated country when it comes to comedic gems. Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi (who is now one of the hottest directors in Hollywood) are both excellent at what they do, inventing absurd vehicles for their unorthodox comedies. I can appreciate this film for more than the laughs it gave me (my mum was laughing pretty much constantly), and I can see that, even if I personally didn't find it hilarious, that it does have merits. Vampires are an ideal subject for satire (particularly given the oversaturation of the genre at the start of the decade), and every aspect is lampooned at some point in the film. A storyline is not totally present per se, but the mockumentary format does its bit to merit the film.

Accomplished vampire mockumentary,"Version I saw: Grimm Up North festival screeningActors: 6/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Peter Jackson started two strings of Kiwi film: huge blockbusters, usually starring Americans, and micro-budget films, especially comedy or horror or both. What We Do In the Shadows, directed by Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords fame) and Taika Waititi, is one of the latter.I am a fan of Flight of the Conchords, the musical comedy duo, so it is fortunate from my perspective that the emphasis is very much on comedy rather than horror. Taking extraordinary things and putting them in a mundane context is a standard comedic method, and mockumentary is a style that harks right back to This Is Spinal Tap, so there is precedent here.Possibly too much precedent: some jokes I found to have been done before in other vampire comedies such as Dracula: Dead and Loving It and the more humorous parts of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Still, there was plenty of originality to keep me entertained. Clement & Waititi's last film together, Eagle Vs. Shark, was a bit too 'quirky' for my taste, but What We Do had more than enough to laugh at as far as I am concerned.Each of the 5 central vampires gets their own sub-plot, which is wrapped up comfortably in a display of admirable screen writing balance, and there are some special effects tricks that are even more impressive for the way they slip by practically unnoticed. The downbeat nature of the film, deriving comedy from stripping away the atmosphere and style to expose the ridiculousness underlying it, is very much in Jemaine Clement's wheel-house, and he even gets a bit of musical fun in, although it is a far cry from Flight of the Conchords' witty parodies and catchy tunes.All in all, I laughed out loud plenty of times, and what more can you ask of a comedy?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Quirky and dry, but still enjoyable","When I heard this film described as a ""horror-comedy"", I expected something in the vein of ""Shaun of the Dead"" or possibly the ""Scream"" franchise. What I got instead was this odd little mockumentary about vampires going about their daily (nightly?) lives while trying to sustain their existence surreptitiously. The film does suffer from some uneven pacing issues as well as dry humor that may not appeal to everyone, but I found the film ultimately enjoyable despite the fact that there may have been New Zealand-specific jokes and/or references lost on me. If you enjoy vampires, mockumentaries, and/or quirky independent films, go ahead and give this film a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Ideal Mockumentary,"If you enjoy mockumentaries such as The Office and Parks & Rec, this is the perfect mockumentary for you. This is a documentary parody about vampires! Done by a couple of the guys from The Flight Of The Conchords hit comedy show on HBO, this documentary style film is the awkward satire you love.

Classic NZ humour,"While I wasn't laughing at every joke in this film, it is a fantastically written mockumentary focuses around the lives of 4 vampires roommates ranging drastically in age trying to live in a modern world that is constantly changing and presenting new challenges that come in the forms of boastful new blood-brothers, wannabe vampires, vengeful exes, attempts to befriend reluctant humans, and tension with a local pack of werewolves trying to restrain their savagery.Only negatives is a few instances of stilted acting here and there and some jokes that just fall short.

Heard about this film and decided to watch it. So funny!,"Taika Waititi is great in the movie and has yet to make a film that I won't watch.
I absolutely love the premise of this film; just a bunch of vampires living in a flat together.
Stu was a great side character and I read that Stu is an actually IT on the set of the movie that didn't realize that his screen time was going to be in the final cut, which makes his character all the better.
I feel bad for Peter though, he didn't have to go out like that.

Better lovestory than Twilight,"This film is pretty great. Although it starts out fairly slow, the performances and comedy we're great.

"A polarising movie... to me, just awful","I think this is a movie people will either absolutely love or absolutely hate. To me, unfortunately, it was the latter.The concept seems to be ""a day in the life of a few suburban vampires in Wellington, New Zealand"". It was kind of fun to see places I know on the movie screen, but that wore off pretty quickly. It's shot in the style of a bad B grade movie, which is really what it is... maybe it's C grade. The camera work probably came out just how they wanted it, in the style of one light on top of a camera. Visually it's not a great movie.The movie lacks a number of things... a plot, interesting characters, and interesting things happening.

Funny as hell.,"This movie is pretty funny, which is the main thing that its got going for it. I greatly enjoyed it. If you are planning to watch it, don't forget to stay around until the very end to see the end-credits scene.The rest of this review is going to be broken up into parts so that you can see where I stand on each element of it.Effects - The effects were pretty bad for the most part, though I did think that the flying looked decent. There is a scene with werewolves, and the costumes are terrible. However, the smart decision to keep them out-of-focus and in the dark for as long as possible was made and it didn't take away from the scene to much when the camera focused long enough to show the audience the embarrassing suits.Cinematography - This movie gets a bit of a pass as its style is that of a mockumentary. There are a few scenes where the cameraman moves a bit faster than he should to get lots of different angles. You could say that there are more than one cameramen (which there are) but they would've been visible in the other shots. It took me out of the movie a bit since the only way to achieve the effect they got is by having the cameraman move around between takes to film a scene in real time from multiple angles. If the cameramen were a bit more visible, the documentary-style presentation would've been a bit more believable. Ignoring that, its actually shot and put together very well (ignoring the bad CGI).Audio - There are some bits where characters are cleaning their shirts and you can hear the sound of something brushing a mike, implying that the vampires have mikes. The audio quality is pretty good throughout the whole movie, but where is seems to be coming form is a bit inconsistent. At no point can you see mikes on the characters, and there's never any mention of them. Its a bit odd. Not the worst thing ever, but it kinda bugged me.Comedy - Comedy is a bit subjective. Everyone finds different things funny. I though that this was a funny movie. I liked the situations, I thought the punchlines were well-delivered. Overall I was laughing throughout the whole thing.The Plot - There is a plot. Its not the greatest plot, sure, but it is coherent. Its a bit loose and simple, but it works well in a movie heavily reliant on gags. The plot is mostly just the life of a few characters over what seems to be the course of about a year. Its funny and entertaining and isn't trying to be something that its not.The Characters - Not all the characters have as much development as they could've had in this short movie, but the performances are good and they all play off of each other making the jokes work.This was not my favorite movie of all time, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it. This is a movie worth watching. Though its short, you're sure to enjoy the time it takes to watch - provided that this is the type of humor you enjoy. If not, I don't know what to tell you.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time,"I usually don't write reviews on IMDb, but I made an exception this time to prevent people from making the mistake I did by watching this piece of crap. Don't trust the high ratings. Don't be fooled by praising reviews. This is a horrible movie. You won't laugh a single time in this ""comedy"" if you have at least some sense of humour. This is as bad as it only can be - boring, long, badly filmed, badly acted - and it doesn't even fall into ""so bad it's good"" category. Just a steaming pile of horse manure. Totally overrated. Don't waste your time. Move along. Watch something good instead. Mostly the ratings here are reflecting the quality of a movie. This one doesn't.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
My All-time Favourite Vampire Movie,"Have you ever felt like an underdog, as if you live in the city, but no one knows who you are or how you live your life? Big city dwellers revel in their anonymity. That's what allows Viago, Deacon and Vlad to lead their arboreal lives, entertaining each other and hunting the next meal at a nightclub.The attention to detail is evident in the script and storytelling. As far as cinematography is concerned, you wouldn't be able to tell that this is a 2014 movie -- it seems at least a decade older. Most of the outdoor shots are in the dark, so there's a cooped-up feel to the movie. That's probably how the tech-oblivious 400 year old protagonists feel, too, sheltered in the shadows, concealing their secrets behind closed doors. It's a lonely life, a boring existence. That is, until rowdy but NZ-civil werewolves come a-howlin'.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's a Clever Concept Executed Smartly and Packaged Wonderfully,"When I heard that there's another movie about vampires, it won't catch my interest anymore, until this! It's so smart, the plot and storyline are simple but clever, it makes you want to know more about the characters and their lives (wait, they're undead, so it's supposedly 'deaths'). Each character gives more life to the story, their relationship is lovely. It actually portrays the basic basic things in life, but because it's another world, it becomes interesting. However, also thumbs up to the execution and packaging of the idea, it won't be as interesting if it's not done well. The documentary style, the dialogue, the whole of it is just nice to be followed. I can see how this will be easily a popular series if it's invested better. Seriously, it's so clever. You'd want to watch more!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hilarious Mockumentary,"I tend to gravitate toward the Zucker/Zucker mindset when it comes to comedy — as a kid raised on ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"", there's nothing better than a series of sight and sound gags that have more to do with a randomly placed guffaw than sly plot pushing. So the dry comedy subgenre doesn't usually do it for me, unless we're talking ""Arrested Development"" or anything Christopher Guest related — then I'll completely zone out and bathe in the wonder of the straight-faced one-liner delivery. Because in some ways, a well- crafted, deliciously complicated scenario akin to something you'd find in a particularly good episode of ""The Office"" can be just as potent as a quick belly laugh a la ""Scary Movie"".Mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows"" has much more in common with ""Best in Show"" than it does with ""Young Frankenstein"", its lightly sarcastic demeanor interlacing with the fixtures of the macabre with comedic radiance. Such results would hardly be a possibility without Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame), who co-direct and co-write with such witty adeptness that the broad premise of the film never feels broad because the tones and textures of the movie itself convince and thoroughly delight.The ""We"" in the title refers to a group of vampires being followed around by a camera crew. Occupying the same bungalow (or to be more scientific, den) for years, we are introduced to Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), and Petyr (Ben Fransham). Viago, aged 379, is the ""father"" of the house, demanding his roommates attend group meetings to discuss things like the kitchen sink problem (no one has washed the dishes for five years), while he, in the meantime, mopes around about his long-lost love; Vladislav, at 800, used to be a hypnotic sexual demon in the same vein as Dracula, but has since lost his magic touch; Deacon is the young, wild one of the group (he's a spry 183) who first got his immortal kicks as a Nazi vampire, while the ancient Petyr (8,000) intimidates everyone as the household's Nosferatu. We also meet Jackie (Jackie Van Beek), the group's human servant who hopes her handiwork will lead to her turning, and Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer), a twenty-something who was supposed to be a meal but ends up becoming a member of the household after Petyr inadvertently transforms him.I can write as much as I want about ""What We Do in the Shadows"", but never will I be able to capture the rhythm, the attitude, the genius of its humor. The ensemble is made up of skilled comedic performers, and the writing is endlessly clever (we can start with the vampirical hatred of the local werewolf pack or the annual get-together the undead throw to celebrate their undeadness, for starters). I found myself as quick to laugh as I was ready to sit in awe regarding the successful audacity of everyone involved. No one, no one, would decide that the best subjects of a mockumentary would be a group of self-serious vampires, and yet here we have one, a hilarious gem, no less, as sharp as the wooden stakes the focuses of the film so greatly fear. Clement and Waititi have outdone themselves. A find.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just a brilliant documentary-comedy.,"f you like Flight of the Conchords then you'll love What We Do in the Shadows. It's a parody documentary that follows the lives of a group of vampires living in Wellington, New Zealand. They each get to tell their story, including their illustrious backgrounds, hitting the city streets, trying to get in to nightclubs, who should do the dishes and confrontations with Wolves. Every character has different background, from Ben Fransham's Nosferatu and Jemaine Clement's goth, to Twilight-esque Deacon and newcomer (and general conflict maker) Nick. This is funny, even when it's not trying to be. Dryer than your everyday comedy, but never decreasing in momentum. FotC's regular Rhys Darby is an absolute scene stealer. A comedy following the lives of the werewolves should be next on their list.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deadpan hilarity!,"After Housebound we get a second horror movie from New Zealand: What We Do in the Shadows. I must say, after seeing Tracks, The Rover, Charlie's Country, 52 Tuesdays and Predestination (and, to a lesser extent, These Final Hours and Underground: The Julian Assange Story), the Aussie's really began to amaze me. It took them long enough: the brilliant Mary and Max is a 2009 feature (no I didn't forget Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, which I found quite dull). At the same time the Aussie's make a comeback, New-Zealand starts to throw off its Peter Jackson-shackles and brought Jane Campion back on stage: Top of the Lake blew me away. And now Housebound and What We Do in the Shadows are some of the best horror movies of 2014! If you like the deadpan humor of Flight of the Conchords (and Jemaine Clement) and you're sick of Hollywood vampirism, then this film is definitely worth the watch. Probably the most dry take on bloodsuckers ever seen on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This Disembowels Twilight Series And Leaves It Bleeding For Dead!,"Pure genius is rare and that's what this film is. The concept is pretty freaky and every damn indie film maker in this internet age should feel jealous of the people behind this mockumentary for not coming up with as original and as hilarious satire. I think this film has its rightful place in the annuls of good vampire fiction and is far better than any of that pretentious teenage vampire drama that youngsters found so enticing about a year or two back. Who says vampire fiction is over? Jaimine and Taika who are the writers, directors and play two of the main characters of the movie show us that vampire fiction can be reinvented in ways you probably can't imagine. What We Do In The Shadows simply expands this genre in a funny and modern way and sorry Mel Brooks, these lads from New Zealand have done it better than Dracula: Dead and Loving it. Quite surely, this is a time where more dreams can come true than before. I am glad that this film got crowdfunded so that it could get wider screenings in US but a lot of the world would probably still miss it. However, I will recommend it to those I know and would hope for a possible sequel. This is cult movie gold. You have made a fan today.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hilarious Mockumentary on the New Zealand Undead Scene,"Who doesn't live a good mockumentary? Plenty of people, I suppose, but I'm not here on their behalf and I enjoy them. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS comes from Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement and is presented as a sort of undead version of MTV's ""The Real World"". A team of documentarians, wearing crucifixes and given the solemn promise that none of them would be eaten, enters the New Zealand flat of four vampires to give perspective on their day-to-day lives, culminating in an annual gathering of the local undead chapters (including witches and zombies) to celebrate the Unholy Masquerade. As the film opens, we are introduced to its subjects: Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and Petyr (Ben Fransham) a group of friendly vampires whose lives span multiple centuries. We join them as they handle chore distribution, engage in the local Wellington nightlife, feed on the unsuspecting populace, and harass the local werewolves. They appear to have a pretty good handle on things until one of their intended meals escapes and returns months later to reveal that, thanks to an overzealous Petyr, he's been turned into a vampire. Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) forms an uneasy friendship with the flatmates, primarily because his human friend Stu (Stu Rutherford) is a pretty cool guy, but he's having a hard time grasping the subtleties of being undead and his boisterous nature brings a world of trouble for this group of bloodsuckers who are just trying to live peaceful lives as ancient vampires in a modern world.Personally, I found this movie to be loads of fun and have enormous replay value. I've seen it a few times now and I laugh just as hard each time. I'll admit, I get some extra enjoyment from the film because a few of my friends are in to vampire LARPing (live-action roleplay) and I can't help but think of them every time. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS has fun with all of the classic vampire clichés we've come to expect since the time of Dracula. We've grown so accustomed to vampires (in movies, anyhow) being cool, sexy, and flawless but this movie gives us a much more flawed, realistic approach. Why should vampirism automatically make someone supernaturally cool? Viago is a nineteenth-century dandy with an effeminate nature and a frustration over how his flatmates can't be bothered to lay towels down when draining their victims on his furniture. With the exception of Petyr (a traditional Nosferatu living in the basement), Vlad is the eldest vampire and obviously based more on the Dracula lore. He once prided himself on his shape-shifting abilities but he's been out of practice since a humiliating defeat at the hands of his arch-nemesis long ago. And then Deacon, while not as old as Vlad or (I believe) as young as Viago, seems to the have the more modern sensibilities. He's an unabashed slob, failing to complete his chores and often shoveling them off onto his poor familiar Jackie (Jackie van Beek) while dragging her along with promises of immortality.From everything I've seen and read from behind the scenes, most of WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS was improvised by the cast with a skeletal script just to give the story some structure. As much as I enjoy the films of Judd Apatow and his circle, compare them to what was accomplished here. This film is riotously funny from the opening moments with Viago's alarm going off at 6PM with hardly a moment over the entire 90 minutes that let's up the pace. And it was mostly accomplished on-set, in front of the cameras, with the cast riffing off one another. I love that. I love that the effects are cheap but charmingly so. When these guys fly, it's clumsy. Not necessarily because the characters can't control their flight but because the actors are lifted on wires and it's hard to control and they roll with it. Viago and Deacon get into a heated argument in the flat meeting at the beginning of the movie and launch into the air to get in each other's faces; just watch how sloppy Viago's landing is when he returns to his seat. It's little bits like that that give me added enjoyment. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies of 2015 and I wish it had gotten more attention so we could ensure these guys return for more of their off-kilter brand of humor. Big recommend from me.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best mockumentary in years,"For years, Christopher Guest (""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Best in Show"") was the creator and sole proprietor of mockumentaries, but New Zealanders Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (""Flight of the Concords"") have left their mark on the genre with ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" a feature-length version of their 2005 short film that centers of three vampires who live in Wellington as flatmates.Viago (Waititi), Deacon (Jonny Brugh) and Vladislav (Clement) are all vampires born various centuries ago who found their way to an old house in New Zealand where they live with the Nosferatu-esque vampire Petyr (Ben Fransham) in the basement. They deal with typical roommate issues like who isn't pulling their weight cleaning blood off the dishes and helping each other figure out what to wear to the bars at night because they can't see themselves in a mirror.This down-to-earth, contemporary portrayal of vampires makes ""Shadows"" one of the better and most original riffs on a sub-genre that over the last 10 years has been sucked dry, pun intended. The characters are just dudes who happen to like frilly Gothic shirts and need blood to survive, and life can be as awkward for them as it is for humans, just in (very) different ways.This conceit really drives the success of the film and provides a focus for the actors' improvisation. Waititi, Brugh and Clement all create distinctive characters whose personalities extend beyond their vampire characteristics. They are all somehow relatable despite being larger than life and totally peculiar.The story deals in both real-world realms like Wellington nightclubs and imagined ones such as the secret subcultures of vampires and other classical creatures, including werewolves. Simultaneously, it caters to fans of these sub-genres and to fans of contemporary comedy. It's a smooth blend that works surprisingly well, though the plot isn't nearly as compelling as waiting for whatever clever bit might come next.Equally well-incorporated are the use of practical and visual effects. Waititi and Clement employ both judiciously and effectively and it earns the film its horror stripes alongside the more immediately apparent comedic ones.""Shadows"" does dip into silly B-movie habits that it shouldn't feel compelled to resort to, but the wit, talent and clever dialogue keeps it elevated from similar low- budget horror comedy efforts.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Each one has a very unique personality and there are some instant classic quotes such as the werewolves and not swearwolves scene and the spaghetti scene. The lead vampire does an amazing job as the lead and you can't forget about stu. Parts of it very dark comedy and the excessive gore causes a mix of disgust and comedy. It is a truly unique movie that may be polarizing but if quirky comedy is your thing, then you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good vampire mockumentary,"I had not read any reviews on this film beforehand, and started off wondering what on Earth I had put on. After 10 minutes I was loving the sense of humour and style of jokes.Definitely a great mockumentary for old school horror fans as long as you know beforehand not to take this film seriously. The acting is intentionally cheesy, and works well. Some of the situations these ""vampires"" end up in are truly hilarious.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! // instagram: moviesmaniax,"Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! New Zealand has made it again with my last year's favorite Housebound and now What We Do In The Shadows is my new favorite and best horror/comedy film of 2015!! Not only all the characters here are absolutely hilarious but the mockumentary concept of this film is just brilliant. Think the mixed of Behind The Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon and a bit of Cabin In The Woods and you will get this vampire twisted-genre film that pokes fun at several vampire references and will make you laugh like crazy from start till finish. There are some SCARY make-up and jump scares here but overall the film is more of a comedy so don't go in expecting any of that kind like Housebound as well as the GORES. While the plot may not seem to be fully developed enough but as long as it can crack you up all the way through with several laugh-out-loud moments, plus making fun of the genre you love, that's just all it takes for me for a successful horror/comedy film>>A<<",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Perfect Film,"I won't belabor it. Others have traced the plot.SImply, this film perfectly fulfills its premises and accomplishes brilliantly what has seemed, over the years, to have become impossible: a loving send-up of the vampire/horror genre with invention, wit, and intelligence with genuine, creative novelty.Performances are lovely and as an ensemble piece the actors seamlessly present a fictive world and community that are both drearily contemporary and timeless. I would go out of my way to see any of the three lead actors in other roles. They are wonderful.The screenplay is hilariously clever. Cinematography and editing keep to the mock-documentary premise while aping horror conventions and at times providing genuinely creepy touches. Set design is smartly tawdry and special effects judiciously convey a professional gloss while remaining aligned to the low-end, indy feel of the work.Every element of the film is in place. In its own way, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" a comedic masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh Dear,"Do you like to get drunk?Do you like to leave a mess?Do you like brainless humour?Do you have low expectation from life?If so, then this is the movie for you.It takes a basic concept of having a group of 'vampires' living together like student flatmates. And that's about it.From that you can pretty much guess what sort of interactions and dialogue will occur. Take half of that away because this really doesn't go anywhere.Perhaps the budget was low and so getting funding was easy.It is a shame because this could have been good.

An Interview With A Vampire,"Documentaries are a difficult format because they will always, always be criticized, in some format or way someone will find fault with them. That's why it's always better and more fun to make a mockumentary, and this is where we find What We Do In The Shadows, a spoof documentary about a set of vampires in New Zeland who are flat sharing, so I suppose the reel question is will this have me howling From Dusk Till Dawn or will it just feature Lost Boys?It's an obvious statement to make but vampires have been around a LONG time in cinema, and we have seen many different interpretations of them from Nosferuatu, to the Bram Stoker's Dracula and now modern age of Twilight. They are probably the 3 hall marks of Vampire films, but there are so many more; 30 Days Of Night, Underworld, Daybrakers and Blade are just a few of the movies that people quickly forget that still have vampires as a main feature, and in the past if we are honest with ourselves all we have ever really seen is spoof films of other Vampire movies, The Fearless Vampire Hunters and Darcula Dead And Loving It are two that leap instantly to mind, but that's where What We Do In The Shadows is strongest, because it's not a spoof of another movie, it is it's own film that makes jokes about vampires as a whole and not just one plot strand.The principle of having a film crew follow vampires around is funny all on it's own but once you start mixing in well thought out characters, jokes that have pace and a story that develops perfectly you get a movie which all on its own can stand up and be counted as classic. The movie is written and directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement.Jemaine is one half of The Flight Of The Concords and Taika is a man who wrote many of the episodes for them as well as chunks of The Inbetweeners. I think that sort of inner madness and logic that is clear in The Flight Of The Concords TV show spills over into What We Do In The Shadows, there are so many off beat unpredictable moments that you can't help but laugh at them all.It's true I could pull out sections of the film and highlight them as funny but what would be the point in that? However I will give you a small measure of how clever the film is, there is a sequence in which the trio are preparing to go out on the town, however because they have no reflections they have to sketch each other so they can see what outfits work and don't. It's that sort of clever overlooked humour which is imbedded into What We Do In The Shadows.What We Do In The Shadows is a witty, clever, funny comedy which is far superior to most of the main stream trash we have to suffer in cinemas.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
New Zealand Strikes Back,"What We Do In The Shadows is quite a funny, amusing film at times, which plays on the typical vampire films and stereotypes. It's probably the only good, true modern day vampire film around, which makes it vastly superior to any other vampire comedy around. However, What We Do In The Shadows does suffer from some relatively tedious parts, mainly the beginning, which seems to drag on and on without giving us much to work with.Though a very great film, What We Do In The Shadows isn't quite as perfect as I was led to believe. Whilst humorous and witty, the film doesn't live up to the hype and expectations, mainly due to what I can only account for as time fillers and empty jokes.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious,"Low budget comedy gold, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The different personalities of all the flatmates drive some fantastic situation comedy. Basically these guys are all stunted at a maturity level somewhere in their 20's and they are vampires, and the jokes just play with that. ""The Beast"" is a running joke with a great payoff, won't spoil it but it was unexpected for me. This is the kind of movie where the low budget works in its favor, buckets of obviously fake blood and stiff costumes just make everything funnier. Definitely recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There is a bit of awkward humour like The Office so if u like that then u will probably enjoy this. Keep in mind it's not serious- it's about vampire flatmates being followed by cameras to see their day to day life. I think the less someone knows about this film the better it is.On a side note, I wish people would stop attacking others for liking films they don't in their reviews.

Both horrendously grotesque and brilliantly hilarious!,"'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A mockumentary about four centuries-old vampires, living in a flat together and trying to adapt to modern life (in New Zealand). It was written and directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of 'FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS' fame). Waititi and Clement also star in the movie; along with Jonathan Brugh, Ben Fransham, Cori Gonzalez- Macuer, Stu Rutherford and Rhys Darby. It's both horrendously grotesque and brilliantly hilarious!Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Brugh) and Petyr (Fransham) are four vampires, who have been around for centuries, that all share a flat together; in Wellington. They've decided to allow a film crew to film them, for a documentary, and have promised not to kill any of them. They go out clubbing at night, to hunt down humans for food (and party), and stay in their flat during the day (to avoid the deadly sunlight). Viago narrates the documentary and explains how the four vampires have attempted to adapt to modern life.The movie is a very dark comedy; the vampires do kill innocent humans (for food) and make others be their slaves (while promising to turn them into vampires, one day). It's gory and pretty true to most vampire mythology. I was really impressed with how the filmmakers were able to do this, while still making an extremely funny movie (it's hilarious)! The mockumentary format is perfect for delivering the jokes with; and the acting and directing are brilliant. I look forward to seeing more from Waititi and Clement, in the future.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/vvaTQ0fcFUQ",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brilliant, hilarious, original comedy","Brilliant, hilarious, original comedy.A documentary team films the lives of a group of vampires for a few months. The vampires share a house in Wellington, New Zealand. Turns out vampires have their own domestic problems too...Incredibly original, and very funny. Co-written and co-directed by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Concords fame, it features understated humour, sharp dialogue and clever skits, similar to Flight of the Concords.While the budget was obviously fairly low, the cheapish production values don't detract from the quality of the movie. If anything, they enhance the movie, as the directors can't rely on fancy CGI but instead have to rely on clever plot and dialogue. It also makes the movie feel much more ""real"".Solid performances all round from a cast whose only known names are Jemaine Clement and Rhys Darby (also of Flight of the Concords fame.

A Very Funny Movie,"This movie is a 'scream' from start to finish. I would compare it to The Office but with vampires, werewolves and zombies. It has a very clever script and all the actors do a great job at being straight- faced. I laughed out loud on many occasions because of its really well done gags on the vampire genre. This is a little gem and will be picked up by many. I hate vampire movies but this is a breath of fresh air from writers/directors Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi. I think Hollywood will be calling on them because this is comic genius at work. Without doubt the best movie, for me, that New Zealand has produced.

"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is like a great amusement park ride that you'll want to relive again and again!","Great comedy can come from the most unlikely of places, both in terms of location and subject matter. How about vampires? Are they funny? They can be. They've been fodder for many big-screen comedies over the years. How about a vampire comedy from, oh say, New Zealand? Believe it or not, that's the combination you get in ""What We Do in the Shadows"" (NR, 1:26) – and, as the movie's poster makes clear, it is hilarious!This is a mockumentary about four vampires living together in the suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand. They've invited a film crew (promising not to eat them) into their house to document the vampires' daily lives (actually, nightly lives) and their preparations for the annual Unholy Masquerade ball. The vampires have a variety of backgrounds and personalities. The one who addresses the camera most is Viago (Taika Waititi, who also co-wrote and co-directed the film). He was ""a bit of a dandy"" before he became a vampire three centuries ago and now basically acts as the group's housemother, calling a meeting to discuss chores, for example. Vladislav (Jemaine Clement, the other half of the film's writing-directing team) is the ladies vamp of the group and, back in the day, was much feared for his habit of ""poking people"" (a winking homage to the real-life Vlad the Impaler, who was the inspiration for the legendary Dracula character). The group's youngest member is Deacon (Jonathan Brugh). He's less than two centuries old and he's the most impetuous of the four. Oh, and he used to be a Nazi. The fourth blood sucker is 8,000 year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham). He's the oldest of the group (looking like the vampire in the classic silent film ""Nosferatu"") – and he's also the crankiest. He usually just stays in his closet.Most nights, the three youngsters of the group go out to clubs looking for victims (and sometimes harassing the local werewolves), but sometimes they have a dinner party – a phrase that takes on a whole new meaning in this case. Deacon has a human servant named Jackie (Jackie Van Beek) who helps out the housemates by doing everything from cleaning up blood that has been spilled in their house, to helping them get new victims. Deacon has promised Jackie that, after a certain period of service, he'll make her a vampire. One day Jackie brings a couple old acquaintances, named Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) and Katherine (Ethel Robinson) to the house for one of those dinner parties. After playing it cool for a while, and then briefly toying with their guests, they attack. They suck Katherine's blood, but Petyr gets a hold of Nick and turns him into a vampire. Nick ends up moving in to the house. The guys teach him about being a vampire (important things like – don't tell everyone that you're a vampire!) and he helps them get up to date on modern technology (including cell phones, the internet and Skype). Nick starts bringing his best friend, Stu (Stuart Rutherford) around to the house. That's usually a big no-no amongst the children of the night, but Stu takes it all in stride, and they all really like him, so they decide that it's cool. But that's not the end of the story. This situation comes to a head (along with a long-standing feud between Vlad and a rival vampire whom he calls ""The Beast"") at The Unholy Masquerade. All that, along with a few zombies and other ""predeceased"" creatures thrown into the mix (not to mention a pivotal encounter with that pack of werewolves) and the movie has an ending that is to die for.A lot of the comedy in ""What We Do in the Shadows"" comes from the juxtaposition of the vampires' politeness and their brutality, as well as the matter-of-fact way that they talk about their lifestyle and nefarious nocturnal activities. A good example would be Jackie driving in her car, casually discussing the merits of eternal life as a vampire, or Nick talking about the ups and downs of being a vampire and ending with ""It sucks."" Whether the comedy makes you laugh out loud or you simply find it quietly amusing is a matter of individual personality, but most people seem to agree that, no matter how you define it, this movie is very funny – and very clever. It goes to show that filmmakers don't need millions of dollars, big-name stars and an elaborate story to make a quality film. A great concept, properly fleshed out (no pun intended) and a few creative and talented actors will do. This movie is like a great amusement park ride. It's scary, fun and unique – and as soon as the ride is over, you want to get right back in line and enjoy it all over again. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely fun and enjoyable vampire effort,"Asked to follow a group of vampires, a group of filmmakers seeing how they live together in a small flat capture their attempt to train a new recruit into their ranks at the house who turns their lives upside down as they try to survive in the modern-day age.This one was a rather enjoyable and incredibly funny horror comedy. One of the better elements here is the fact that this one manages to be a rather enjoyable and hilarious satire on reality shows with how this one presents the main group here. The fact that they're still decidedly old-school style vampires of the classical mold, with the aristocratic and debonair types still obsessed with the style from their death- year which conflicts wildly with the way they live as the more modern society with these issues. Their struggles to come to grips with those issues, finally forcing a human friend to help them out with the jump into the new technological age and how they're able to get the different societies able to come to terms with the modern-day world which is all sorts of hilarious. That greatly compliments the other strong aspects of this one in the fact that there's a lot of really great laughs at the expense of the group as there's a lot of fun to be had poking fun at vampire culture with the odd-couple dynamic at play with all of the humorous work here. There's the fact that all the different ways for them to fly around the apartment building dealing with their human-like squabbling, their constant ability of using their powers to perform menial everyday tasks and making sure the camera crew captures them at the middle of their inherent goofiness all making for an utterly uproarious time with the sight-gags and visual humor becoming such a fun time in this one. It still doesn't forget it's about vampires, as there's quite a bit here regarding their rather obvious powers bringing the attacks on the humans they find out in the clubs, the different encounters with the bullies and the big encounter in the society dance which is fun with all the different creatures coming together into a really enjoyable time which is all the more fun with the action-packed sequence afterward of the gang encounters werewolves in the woods. There's really only one part of this that it tends to peter out a tad with the finale that doesn't really make much sense in just wrapping up with an anti-climatic sense of conclusion which builds to a rather satisfying sense of action but just ends up finishing because it ran out of time and needed to finish rather than let them play out as expected. It's all that holds this one back.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Rock n' Roll Mockumentary with Vampires !!!!,"This mockumentary has got Spinal Tap written all over it and in a good way. The film shows us the lifestyle of a few vampires who share a flat and it shows us how they lead their nocturnal lives and how they survive. The characters are all very sweet and likable, even though kill and drink human blood to survive. The film and the directors love these characters and that love permeates through the film in each scene. The vampires come off as naive, adorable and sometimes arrogant (like rockstars) individuals who struggle to cope with changing times of the dynamic human society. The film also has enough blood and gore for the fans who like their vampire films to be gruesome.The acting from all parties involved is brilliant. The direction and screenplay is good. The film has the typical dry, quirky British humour (although it is from New Zealand) that I like and it is a thousand times better than most loud,raunchy American comedies that get released nowadays.

I love vampires and I love vampire movies so it was easy to see them poking fun at other films like Nosferatu, Interview with the vampire, and of course The lost boys. This film is definitely in the spirit of such films as Shaun of the dead and Dylan Dog but these guys picked up on what seems to be a new style of filming; the documentary type style.I thought it worked really great for this film and even made it funnier. The three main actors were fantastic and perfect for their parts, Stuart was a bit of a side character and I thought maybe the actor playing him was too old. It seemed weird the young kid they turned into a vampire would be friends with him. Also I thought the actor that played the young kid was a little bland at times. Not as present and into the roles as the others were.My main complaint is I wasn't too crazy about the set.

Brilliant!,"This mockumentary about four vampires sharing a house in Wellington, NZ is one of the funniest films I've seen in years. 
At first I was skeptical. When I read the storyline it sounded dreadful; unoriginal, too similar to ""Being Human"", so I put off watching it. Then, after a couple of friends recommended it, I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. It was hilarious, and the dialogue and delivery is spot on. It captures the documentary ""look"" perfectly too.

Pretty darn good The Office meets Vampires,"I think it's all there in the title. Lots of people are going way overboard with overwhelmed appreciation, most likely they didn't expect this to be any good really and got surprised, so this is definitely not a masterpiece but it's really very solid throughout.I've heard the criticism ""lack of plot"". This is clearly one of the strong points, if anything, of the film. There's lots of content, but not much story at all, so the film does superbly well at pace, and one thing it definitely nails which was tough was not being boring about an hour in. Lots of films are funny as a narrative written down on paper, and lots of fun during the first half an hour, but then becomes immensely silly and untenable as a full length film. This doesn't do that. At all. At no point does one feel he just 'gets it' and wants to move on to something else, it keeps it funny and interesting til the end.Humor wise, it's actually pretty funny. It avoids being the graphic horror kind, you can actually laugh if you don't like horror at all so it's not being self-indulgent or a generic homer (or a cultural homer, people completely uninitiated to Oceanic/kiwi culture, who just speak English, can get it just fine).The characters are good, and pretty darn well acted out. You'd really think the actors were East-European, but none of that.Funniest scene for me was the cops under the spell inspecting the premises.One last thing: in many specific places, with particular quotes or in general as a global metaphor, the film does well, subtly, at recognizing and establishing this world of vampires and werewolves etc...isn't all that different from the world of us humans in many respects.7.5 or sympathy 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The actual story line almost gets in the way of the comedy, like it should be a show rather than a film that needed a start middle and end,There's some great moments in this film, heard rumours of a spin of with the werewolves, who were great, Murray from flight of the Concords - same character, but a werewolf.

The funniest film I've seen in a long time,"To anyone who believes the both the mockumentary and vampire genres have been done to death and have nothing else to offer need look no further than What We Do in the Shadows, the blood-sucking comedy from Kiwi duo Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Concords) and Taika Waititi (Eagle Vs. Shark (2007)). While lampooning the recent Twlight- inspired vampire craze has been done already with the dreadful Vampires Suck (2010), What We Do... manages to be both hilarious and endlessly creative with its take on the genre, managing to deliver some genuine (and surprising) scares along the way.Uber-tidy vampire Viago (Waititi) resides in his decaying mansion with his fellow fang-bearers, Vladislav (Clement), a torture-and- seduction type who was dubbed Vlad the Poker in his heyday, the slobbish Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) who is deluded about his own physical attractiveness, and Nosferatu-lookalike Petyr (Ben Fransham), an 8000-year old who doesn't take too kindly at being awoken from his coffin. They bicker about washing the dishes, go to clubs but can't get in without the bouncers extending them an invitation, and occasionally exchange insults with the local pack of werewolves, led by the polite Anton (Rhys Darby), who reminds his fellow wolves that they're ""werewolves, not swearwolves!"" Their routine life is shaken by the freshly-turned Nick (Cori Gonzalez- Macuer) and his human friend Stu (Stu Rutherford).Some scenes border on genius - the set-piece involving a terrified and still-human Nick being led to believe he's eating maggots (""I stole that from The Lost Boys,"") and chased around the dark and endless mansion by the teleporting and shape-shifting trio achieves more excitement and frights than any full-blooded horror can hope to muster. It mocks and homages the genre, answering questions such as what would vampires search for on the internet? Virgins and sun- rises, obviously. As the blabbermouth Nick inadvertently sets a vampire hunter on their trails and the lovable Stu shows the housemates the delights of modern technology, the film becomes a sweet portrayal of friendship and learning to embrace, or in this case, tolerate diversity. The funniest film I've seen in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not my kind of movie...at all.,"Very bad B movie.One of the most egregious examples of over-rating here on IMDB, with a 7.6. A prime example of how untrustworthy public rating spaces are.There are no aspects of this film that deserve anything near that rating. Nothing is good. The cinematography, lighting, sound, editing. All chaotic and amateur. Hair & makeup, wardrobe. All dirty, messy, and ugly. The script, the acting. Silly. Stupid, really.Yes, I know. It's a mockumetary. It's supposed to look raw, rough, unrefined. But it needs to have something redeeeming. This has nothing. It's not funny. It's not smart. It's not original. I have not seen boring and annoying simultaneously done so well in, well, maybe forever.The whole film feels dirty and sloppy. Icky. The characters all yucky. Annoying. Disgusting, really. There is no real humor. No plot. Just slapstick, and weak character celebration. It's not nice to look at, and it's not nice to listen to.If you are a drug addict, and will laugh at anything, and don't take showers, you may be able to tolerate this insult to film, entertainment, and intelligence.Otherwise, you'll probably bail on this cheap ugly random mess sooner or later.

Vampires Suck!,"What We Do In The Shadows (2014) -I only pursued this film until the end in order to discuss it with my nephew, who loves it, otherwise I would have turned it off after half an hour. It's not really my sense of humour at all, but I could appreciate what they were trying to do. I just felt that I've seen similar done better.The clueless police were quite funny, but didn't have enough screen time. It might have been funnier to show it from their perspective all the way through. Their return journeys to the house to see what all the trouble was and a lot of ""Why is it always you three?"".I did feel sorry for the guy who played Stuart too, apparently he only turned up to do some IT stuff and got roped in for a lot more, which you could see, but not in a bad way, his part was actually quite amusing.But it was actually so bad and unfunny in general that my mother went to the kitchen to do the dishes, which she never does voluntarily, so perhaps it is a generational thing and we are too old to appreciate it.I personally think that you have to have a really good subject matter to do a mockumentary and perhaps vampires just wasn't the right thing this time. It could have played on more of the things we know about the creatures from previous films, books and TV series too. The focus seemed to be more about them being inept rather than them being vampires with a lot of life experiences.I wonder if the series that followed was more refined and might have a wider appeal, but I probably won't bother to find out and I'm going to stop listening to my nephew and his film suggestions.339.02/1000.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

New Zealand's comedy masterpiece,"Co-written by Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi, this is one of the better comedies I've seen; or at least the best mockumentary I've seen. What is the biggest achievement for this film, though, is probably that it isn't far off Tongan Ninja when it comes to how funny it is.It's all bloody ridiculous (in a very literal sense, and yes, I did use this joke in my tweet last night). The fact that they're vampires with a lust for blood in New Zealand symbolises exactly what is ridiculous about the film, as it's a very nonchalant atmosphere in a little overshadowed country (what overshadows it? Tonga), and they're there as blood sucking vampires trying not to get their sofas messy when they feed on their prey and having flat meetings and such.It's like if Flight of the Conchords was set in a vampire mansion in Wellington — and who doesn't want that? I know I want much more of it, because it is bloody funny. From the ghost cup to the beast and to the reason behind drinking virgin blood, it's full of gags, while its nonchalant (yes, I'm using that word again) humour comes to life when blood explodes everywhere and ol' Viago's (Taika Waititi) getting all distressed about it. I mean, I don't know why I even tried to review this film. It's just really, really stupid; but it's really, really great at the same time. See, that's all I needed to say.Well, I guess I'll say more. The writing and the concepts aren't the only things good about the film. Everything else is also bloody brilliant. The casting, for one, is perfect. Jermaine Clement is about as funny as he usually is, and he along with Jonathan Burgh and Cori Gonzales-Macuer symbolise that unbothered approach the film takes – but horrifically sadistic at the same time — blood and guts are always a nice addition, of course. The documentary style also works well for it, as if it was any other way I don't think it would work.In conclusion, What We Do In the Shadows is an odd film, but a very funny, very well written and probably very memorable film, and one of the best comedies I've seen. Although it might not be quite as quotable as the glorious Tongan Ninja, and the feeling when someone is being preyed on by vampires and you're in hysterics does get a little weird, if there's anything New Zealand should be proud of, it is this.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Just like Twilight (only joking... thankfully),"A film about vampires. My first thought – oh... another one – great. Add the fact that it's a 'mockumentary' i.e. a spoof documentary filmed in a 'fly-on-the-wall' kind of fashion. My first thought – oh, another one – great.Yes, there is truly nothing original about 'What We Do in the Shadows' – a spoof documentary, charting the lives of four ancient vampires, currently flat-sharing in modern day New Zealand. Perhaps the generally lack of originality was what made me watch it with such low expectations. In any case... I was more than pleasantly surprised.It was actually really good. In short... it was funny. It takes a lot for a 'comedy' film to actually make me laugh and this one pulled it off. Yes, there's absolutely nothing 'idea-wise' that we haven't seen before, but with a sharp, satirical script, that doesn't matter. It's just such a daft, fun film that anyone who has a love of the horror/vampire genre will definitely enjoy it. You do need to know a little bit in general about vampire films. Naturally, there are more than a few jokes based on the general Dracula legend that might go over your head if you haven't seen the film or read the book.Yes, most of the vampires are pretty stereotypical (for undead blood-suckers) and you should recognise their 'types' among the genre. But, as I say, it's simply the comedy that saves this film from potentially being just mediocre.If you enjoy your horror/vampire yarns, relax your brain and put this one. It really is simply amusing.

Each vampire takes on a popular stereotype of the vampire (like Pete the oldest of the group who looks like Nestratu), but mostly they all fell under Eastern European Archetype.The movie mocked the day to day life of these old country style vampires attempting to live in the modern world, going out to parties, trying to find ladies (mostly to kill). The simpleness of their lives was absolutely hysterical.It's been a long time since I've seen the classic style of the vampire on the big screen. Though it was done for laughs if you're a horror purist you'll get a kick out of watching these guys be stylish when you can't see yourself in the mirror, or the day to day task being of a modern day familiar.And I hear it was a Kickstarter founded film.

A very good vampire found footage film,"WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a fake documentary or mockumentary documenting the lives of three actual (in the movie universe, that is) vampires. It is a horror comedy which derives much of its humor from the clash between traditional ideas about vampires as a beings which, albeit thoroughly evil, are far superior to humans in many respects, and a ""reality checked"" version which shows them to be susceptible to many mundane challenges of modern life familiar to any old human being.The basic idea has been covered before, such as in DRACULA AND SON (1976) with the great Christopher Lee, but the treatment here is fresh and entertaining. The acting and the cinematography are good, the special effects are understated but convincing, and the story, eventually also incorporating werewolves, maintains audience interest.There are genuinely funny scenes, but the movie does not shy away from true horror, either, which to me is the mark of a good horror comedy. Kiddified treatments of archetypal horror characters, such as most blatantly seen in THE MUMMY (1999) franchise, do not really deserve the ""horror"" label, in my opinion.The trivia section states that 125 hours of footage was compiled which consisted mostly of improvised dialogue. I have noticed that often, where it becomes evident that the dialogue in a found footage movie is probably improvised, it is marked by banality and aimlessness. That 125 hours had to be cut down to about 1.5 hours to make a movie with good dialogue out of improvisations tells me that improvisation is not a short cut, and where it is treated as such, it shows and is bound to hurt the movie.There are not very many vampire found footage movies I am aware of, mainly just LIVING AMONG US (2018), THE MONSTER PROJECT(2017), THE BLACK WATER VAMPIRE (2014), and AFFLICTED (2013).

It works as a superb spoof of vampire movies (with running gags of ""Twilight"", ""Dracula"", ""Nosferatu"") as well as a standalone comedy. And werewolves are both superbly funny.

Not So Dark Shadows,"If you are a fan of ""Flight of the Conchords' then you will love this movie currently on Netflix. Written and directed by Jemaine Clement (the larger looming but no less adorable half of the 'Conchords') and Taika Waititi (who breathed new life into the 'Thor' franchise directing 'Thor: Ragnarok'), this film combines our seemingly immortal fascination with vampire lore with the deft and unprepossessing comic sensibilities of New Zealand, all packaged in the satirical style of a mockumentary. Karen O'Leary and Mike Minogue stand out as the affable and mildly paternalistic police constables. Rhys Darby (Murray, the band manager from 'Conchords') is hilarious as the leader of a wolf pack that is more wolf support group. The movie spun off two television series; 'Wellington Paranormal' in New Zealand and an American version of 'Shadows' . Both equally as funny.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fabulous Movie...,This is a great Vampire movie...I can't stand the genre and this movie is brilliant...make sense of that!? It's a comedy documentary seemingly low budget until the special effects kick in unexpectedly. I've watched it loads of times and wish I'd have thought of it. A masterpiece and a showcase of real talent. Thank you for making it. 11/10,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Felt like it was 200 minutes,"Okay, so there are funny moments.This is a British style comedy shot in New Zealand, so the humor is very British.But why did it feel like the 86 minutes of the run time were so damn long?So the reason is that the whole thing seems so dumb, there weren't any kind of attempts of world building, nothing made too much sense, it's like part of the joke is the fact that it's all nonsense which works in something like The Office, but not here.I was watching it with my wife and we both ended up asking each other ""How much more is there left in the run time?""So it's pretty dry, pretty on the nose, even if shot soft of well.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Such Fun!,"'What We Do in the Shadows' is one of the most original films to have come out recently. Its a terrific Mockumentary/Horror-Comedy, that left me in splits. Its beautifully innovative & amazingly entertaining.'What We Do in the Shadows' Synopsis: Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav are vampires who are finding that modern life has them struggling with the mundane - like paying rent, keeping up with the chore wheel, trying to get into nightclubs, and overcoming flatmate conflicts.'What We Do in the Shadows' takes Indie Cinema ahead, with pride. This is a film that needs to be watched & enjoyed. For its innovation & sincerity, this critical darling deserves some real respect. I had ball & also had my share of envy, as such an ingenious Script is rare to find.Taika Waititi & Jemaine Clement's Screenplay is first-class. Its an extremely well-done Screenplay, that is high on novelty & laughs. Watching Vampires go at it with Werewolves, has never been so much fun! Waititi & Clement's Direction, on the other-hand, feels realistic. Cinematography & Editing are perfect.Performance-Wise: Waititi & Clement are brilliant actors too! They enact the vampires with a heart, with such zeal & effortlessness, its hard not to be awed by them. Jonathan Brugh is first-rate. Ben Fransham is superb. Others lend great support.On the whole, 'What We Do in the Shadows' is not to be missed! Its daringly original & crazily entertaining! Two Big Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

All about Stu.,"'What We Do In The Shadows (2014)' is pretty much the best 'mockumentary' I've seen, especially in terms of its 'documentary' aesthetic. From the subtle camera-light illuminating the characters to the expert use of story-telling stock-photos to a brilliant black-and-white 'recreation', this film feels like a 'real' documentary right the way through. This is contrary to most movies of the kind, which usually lose their way in the second act or break the illusion with impossible shots that should reveal the camera-men but don't. It's also the main reason, I feel, why the experience works so well. Everything just feels so 'real' and the satire is certainly on-point. The piece pokes fun at all types of vampire and their tropes, using its five core bloodsuckers to take specific aim at archetypes seen within 'Nosfetstu (1922)', 'Dracula (1931)', 'Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)', 'Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)' and 'Twilight (2008)'. Of course, it also jabs at various clichés from across the myriad of movies that make use of the wider vampire mythos. On top of all this, it pokes fun at both typical 'flat-mate' youth-culture and documentaries at large, so it has quite a lot to sink its teeth into. Thankfully, it hits a deep vein. It's remarkably funny on numerous occasions. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', its satire is more than clever enough to be appreciated. It paints a believable portrait of modern-day vampires in a way that works even if you haven't seen a horror movie before - though, obviously the experience is infinitely enhanced if you have. It's performances are actually quite subtle; they're remarkably restrained and wonderfully wholistic considering that they consist of mainly improvised material. The same can be said of the entire affair, I suppose, as it tells a cohesive, if ever-so-slightly 'skit'-based story. The special-effects are also remarkably good. They're consistently convincing and incredibly imaginative. On the whole, this is a very entertaining feature with a unique central conceit that's executed in a charming and suitably low-key way. It's smart, funny and generally likeable. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dracula: Kiwi Comedy Style,"Vampires, like most Gothic horror monsters have gotten a very infamous reputation. A reputation which has lasted over a millennia. They have been pegged as evil, blood-thirsty villains; soiling the innocence of all who become victim to their blood-lust. What's worse is within the last two decades their standing has changed to much more humiliating status; that of the romantic lead. Yes, we can all agree Twilight (2008) was a blight on the world but you can't deny the YA series' made an impact. Plus there were the better received True Blood (2008-2014) and Vampire Diaries (2009-now) which, for better or for worse, reformed Dracula's personal image. Between misanthropic movie monster and hunky boyfriend of the undead, is there maybe a better, more sympathetic portrayal out there for the besieged blood- sucker?What We Do in the Shadows involves the semi-normal life of four vampires who have made New Zealand their new home. In-between feedings, Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Brough) and Petyr (Fransham) have to deal with the common trials of being flatmates. Such trials include dividing up the chores via chore wheel, juggling their active social lives and avoiding run- ins with vampire slayers, local werewolves and a mysterious creature known only as ""The Beast"". Their biggest obstacle is modernizing to the 21st century, a task that is helped by new friends who tip the balance of their creepy, decrepit home.Co-written by half of Flight of the Conchords and given a mockumentary style, What We Do in the Shadows is the funniest movie you're likely to see this year. It's bolstered by goofy, self-deprecating performances and cheap yet seamless special-effects. Special mention should be given to Waititi's fussy performance as an Interview with a Vampire (1994) knock-off with an Eastern European accent. He becomes the center and voice of reason amid a growing group of rowdy undead friends and despite having the straight-man role, his nit-picking most often had me at medium giggle. The belly laughs however came from Clements's Vlad, designed to look like Dracula circa 1992. His one-liners showed a depth of skill when it comes to improvisation which hasn't seen a screen near me since Flight of the Conchords (2007-2009) ended its run on HBO. As far as mockumentary, What We Do in the Shadows matches This is Spinal Tap (1984) and Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) chuckle by chuckle, perhaps more so.Along with being incredibly rich territory for situation-comedy, What We Do in the Shadows brings up some grounded if unconsidered questions about living with eternity. We all get older so we naturally struggle to keep up with the ""next big thing,"" so what happens when a three-hundred-year-old man attempts to enter Wellington's most popular club dressed like an 18th century dandy? What happens the first time they use a cellphone or a computer? These aren't the chiseled, pristine vampires of Twilight; no these guys can't even use a mirror and are forced to draw each other to conceive what they look like. There's no way these guys have the sensibilities to make it in today's world. At least not without a lot of help and hilarity.As with all movies that adapt the mockumentary format, there are some drawbacks. There's some pretty cheap production design here and due to the subject matter most scenes are shot at night (duh!). This kind of budget is not helped by a flat aspect ratio and single-setup, point-and-shoot-type camera work. Thankfully there are enough consistently funny gags that keep the film light on its feet even if the supposed documentary crew are not.What We Do in the Shadows may not help vampires reclaim the staple horror movie villain image we grew up with and took for granted. I personally yearn for Nosferatu to jump out of the shadows and give the floozies of True Blood a run for their money. I suppose all things must go through reinvention and renewal. Modernizing overall is a positive force is it not? If for no other reason than we get fun little experiments like this Kiwi comedy classic.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Didn't hold my attention.,"When I started watching this movie, I thought I was gonna be in for some good dark comedy, or at least entertainment. I was wrong. I only got 30 minutes into it and I thought it was almost over, it just drags on and on. We get it. They're vampires so they have ""kooky"" and ""quirky"" antics. You can't just repeat the same type of cheap jokes over and over and call it a story line. And you know, maybe the rest of the movie is incredible. But that doesn't matter because the first 30 minutes are a waste of my time, so I'm not gonna keep watching. I know comedy is subjective and people have different humor styles, but just because something is shot ""documentary style"" doesn't make it funny. Oh because The Office did it, so that filming style is automatically a ""laugh riot"". Please.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genuinely funny and creative,"If you're wondering whether to watch it or not, you should definitely watch it.I usually don't watch horror movies, but this movie being classified horror-comedy, and most importantly being a waititi movie, I decided to watch it. And just 10-15 minutes into the movie, I was hooked up. The casting, acting, cinematography were perfect, and most importantly the dialogues were super funny, and I found them to be uniquely creative. The mockumentary style editing and cutting between scenes is very cleverly done, and I heard waititi and the crew took almost 14 months (waititi mentioned it in some interview but I'm not entirely sure whether its 14) to edit the movie.There may be some scenes showing a lot of blood, but they are also made hilarious. Do not watch this for its plot, the plot is not super twisty or anything. But overall the movies is enjoyable, and you should 100% watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Each character brings, to the table, their unique traits and adds, throughout the film, a bevy of hilarious jokes. The use of horror monster ""rules"" from genre lore fits with the comedy incredibly well, and that is a testament to the film's writing. The use of the mockumentary format beautifully provides a connection between the characters and the viewer.

The podcast, HDTGM, is about bad movies that shouldn't ever have been made and how they actually did. Sorry went a little off topic, this movie is extremely clever and funny. It is mockumentary following a group of vampires that live together in a small flat. Jemaine Clement, Jonny Brugh, and Taika Waititi play vampires and Rhys Darby plays a werewolf and they all are so good.

Waste of time. Not even 4% of Borat.,"This movie is in the same league as 'Death of Stalin'. Interesting premise, seems fun on the outset but absolutely poor a product.There were only a couple of jokes that worked for me. I liked the scene where the cops come to investigate. But that's it. Rest of the movie was resting to be funny but none of it ever landed. It's a poor try of doing something like Borat. But a big failure as it ultimately doesn't seem to deliver even 4% of what Borat does. I admire TW's films but this is hands down his weakest. His expressions were good though, but I guess NZ's aren't naturally good at acting in films. None of the other actors stood out imo and were forgotten soon after.This was a real waste of my time. Idk why it has such high ratings. But I guess I understood why it isn't much popular now.

Crazy Unique.,"What We Do In The Shadows is one of the best films to be released in 2015. Although there has only been two or three good films this year, I believe, even by the end of the year this will stand tall. This film has caused a stir in our zombie crazed society. Not since Twilight has a vampire film been so popular. (The only difference is Twilight sucked hard)Like 'District 9' it's filmed as a documentary or, more appropriately, mockumentary. The best part of this film is it makes the most of this style. Unlike 'District 9' which was pretty inconsistent with this highly controversial style.While it's not ""One of the flat-out funniest films in ages!"" it does have some really hilarious moments. That is 'What We Do In The Shadows' greatest strength and most crippling downfall. The film is only memorable in it's moments. Not as a whole. It feels like a cluster of great skits that have been thrown into a feature length film. Sure this approach works with television shows such as 'Saturday Night Live', but not really as a movie.That aside this is a really fun film. As I explained earlier, the moments make this film what it is. From Werewolves swearing then quickly retorting by saying, ""We are Werewolves, not Swearwolves."" to vampires fighting on the ceiling. It's chalk full of memorable (and quotable) scenes and lines. While it may not have the hilarious one liners that films like 'Anchorman' possess, it does a great job of being new.It embraces all of the Vampire ""stereotypes"" and puts them to funny use. We see some burnt to a crisp when exposed to daylight, fights between two as bats, and a handful of great lines remarking on their age. It brings Vampires into the modern world with such grace and reality it feels utterly real. This is in large part due to it's documentary style. We see camera men slaughtered by creatures and all forefront characters getting face time via interviews.With such a small film like this, usually the special effects are sub par. And for the most part you give them leeway for the budget they are working with. This is not the case with 'What We Do In The Shadows'. The effects have a Chris Nolan feel to them. Opting to go practical or CG. And it works so incredibly well. There is no point in the film were one will be taken out by an awful effect. 'What We Do In The Shadows' transcends the average film with it's great cast and extremely witty humor and blazes it's path to being an instant classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An Absolute Classic,"I first watched this film because my sister had mentioned it. I honestly did not have a clue what to expect, but my god, i am so glad i watched it. This film is absolutely brilliant and the comedic genius behind the film is just so incredible. This film is a 'mock- umentary' which follows the life of 4 vampires and how they get along in their flatting situation. Vladislav, one of the main characters is perfectly portrayed by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords, The BFG), all of his lines are expressed in such a tone that you cant help but fall in love with his wit and personality. Viago, portrayed by Taika Waititi (dir. Thor:Ragnarok), is again, expressed and acted in such a way that the comedic brilliance of the entire script just flows.This ingenious movie is one of my favorites and i 100% would recommend to anyone who has a good sense of humour, however, if you do not 'get' this movie, then I feel as though you may be reading in to it too much. Just watch and enjoy the film at face value and don't try and search for a deeper meaning, otherwise you will end up with nothing, apart from struggle.This film is marvelous and i do not understand how it is not more well known, this film needs to be boosted, for it is an incredible movie with undeniably brilliant scripting and characters.Please watch this movie as i can guarantee you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Kiwi bloodsuckers,"The premise of four flatmates in New Zealand who are 21st Century vampires is probably the nadir of 'plausible' but a likeable cast, scalpel sharp script and a healthy respect for what is being lampooned somehow conspire to make this work brilliantly. New Zealand cinema has always punched above it's weight as evidenced by Deathgasm, Once Were Warriors, Stickmen and (early) Peter Jackson: Bad Taste, Braindead, Meet the Feebles etc. The success of the so-called 'Mockumentary' genre seems to rest entirely upon a familiarity with the target genre that often dwarfs that of it's most lauded exponents e.g. Spinal Tap. The only precedent I can cite from What We Do in the Shadows is maybe, Man Bites Dog from 1992 where a camera crew are invited to follow a Belgian serial killer around for the purposes of a documentary. That sounds grim, but the makers of What We Do in the Shadows clearly understand that getting shot in the head for the contents of your purse and having your blood drained by a fictitious predeceased predator are poles apart when it comes to taste.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Works better as a show,"This just didn´t land with me the way I thought it would. The idea here is incredible and it laid the foundations to a show I really enjoy, but this was a bit to all over the place as a movie. I think that's the biggest weakness of this movie to me, it feels like a sketch comedy show more than a movie, so yes, the series formula works better for the premise.A documentary crew is invited into a vampire den to observe them In modern times.I really like the acting here, especially from Tika Waititi as Viago. The comedy lands well here and the deadpan is strong in this movie. It is one of those situational comedies that work so well because the cast care so little. The character Stu is the best example, not really caring about what is going on around him and that is so funny. The humour is overall really solid, a strong comedy with only a few misses.This is a fun take on the vampire trope. Put them in modern time, teach them what the internet is, it´s funny and a really good idea. The fish out of water these guys can feel like is the essence of the comedy and it works so well.There isn't really a story here sadly. It is just events happening for the characters and different ideas thrown around without much coherency to it. It´s a shame, having something to connect the movie more would have worked better but I guess that would remove the authenticity of a camera crew just filming what's going on, still it removes the overall sense of point to the movie. It is a collection of smaller stories that lends itself more to a TV show than a movie. It´s a sketch comedy collection in vampire theme, and I think this lends itself overall better to the TV show of the same name. This concept works better in that enclosed space.While I had fun and loved the characters, the movie had a hard time making me care about its overall premise since it´s just stuff happening. I had a hard time really getting myself engaged with it and that's a shame, since I liked what was going on here.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Four vampires, raging from 8000 to a mere 183 years old, house share in Wellington, New Zealand and this comical mockumentary follows their hilarious night time exploits. We also get werewolves and zombies thrown into the melting pot, as well as a human character called Stu.

instant classic,"I don't remember laughing as hard at a film in years as I did at What We Do In The Shadows the other night. It's pure comedic bliss from front to back, and makes the often tedious chore of making an audience laugh seem effortless. It's part horror comedy, part mockumentary with a dash of buddy camaraderie and and depth of wit and character all it's own, thanks to New Zealand filmmaker Taika Watiti, who is fast becoming one of my favorite new voices in the independent field. A master at finding the humour in little moments and dry subtlety, his cameras spend a couple hours documenting pratfalls, squabbles and zany encounters with quartet of vampires living in Wellington, New Zealand, each one simultaneously a different caricature of bloodsuckers from previous lore, as well as a completely unique, hilarious individual. Jermaine Clement is the closest thing you'll find to a household name amongst the cast as Vladislav, a Dracula esque, baroque vamp. Jonny Brugh is Viago, the musically inclined, Ann Rice incarnation, and Ben Fransham, plays Peter, a spooky eight thousand year old Nosferatu clone. It's Watiti himself who steals the show though, as Deacon, a dandy of a Germanic royal who gets all the best lines and relishes them with adorable deadpan delivery every chance he gets. The film comes nowhere near the classification of horror, and in fact these four resemble a bumbling, lovable frat house, their vampiric nature treated lightly as they cavort about their everyday life like rambunctious nocturnal teddy bears. They navigate household chores, nightlife, inter species relations (there's a few priceless encounters with a rival pack of werewolves), pesky humans, and have a ball the whole time through. What makes the film so special is the goldmine of comic skill and talent that both director and cast have tapped into. The relationships are unforced, full of idiosyncratic nonsense and always feel utterly organic. For a group of undead fellows, they truly are the life of the party. The documentary style never feels intrusive or irritating, seamlessly taking refuge behind the forceful and side splitting antics which take center stage for the entire film. Comedy is the hardest genre to produce fruitful results in, with horror a close second. What it takes to make you laugh can often be a rare gift, wielded by few and far between, those writers, directors and actors who have that elusive midas touch on our funnybones, combining just the right elements of script, improv and intuition to get us laughing ourselves silly.

One of my absolute favourites!,"I have watched this movie at least 10 times since my friends first introduced me too it, and it still hasn't gotten old! If you love weird funny movies you need to give this a watch.I loved the mockumentary style and I felt like it really added to the kind of humour the movie has, the characters were perfect, and there wasn't a scene where I didn't laugh at least once. Taika Waititi is BRILLIANT!I would say I'm recommending it to all of my friends, but I've already shown it to pretty much everyone I can think of!

Funny movie...Funnier if you get the jokes,"I'm not really a fan of documentary / mockumentary-like movies, it makes me sleep. At first I thought that it's another lame movie about vampires but then, just at the opening scenes, I got myself chuckling already. As I was watching it, it built me an interest on how vampires could live in this modern-day world, and this movie really fed my curious imagination. The jokes are really planted well on every line and the punchlines are really hilarious, and the best part is that each actor was able to carry his in- movie character. This is not a comedy movie of obvious physical pranks or any lame stupid lines of jokes. When you watch this movie, you're gonna laugh really good. But it's funnier if you had a wider opened-mind and you get the jokes right. Really worth watching with family and friends!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Vampires, not tramp-ires","In search of the final nail in the coffin of the sordid cultural relevance of Edward and Bella? Look no further than the supremely delightful What We Do in the Shadows. Here, newbie vampire Nick drunkenly parades himself through the streets of Wellington, braying ""I AM TWILIGHT"" as a pick up line, only to be greeted with blank looks of vague derision. It's pristine satire - gently but insistently raucous, and playing more off of Nick's incredulous 'Isn't this cool anymore' expression than the gag itself. And the best bit? It's only one of a nearly nonstop smorgasbord of sneakily clever, deliciously quotable gags the film offers.If Shaun of the Dead's 'rom-zom-com' infused the zombie horror genre with a much- needed surge of frantic humour and schlubby humanity, What We Do in the Shadows blends vampires, who have already been subjected to oodles of daft action and risible romance, with The Office's mockumentary deadpan and a thoroughly New Zealand 'no bullsh*t' ethos, to similarly sterling effect. Co-director/stars Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi may thrive in 'chortle-funny' rather than the deep belly-laugh kind, but the chortles come so incessantly and raucously, they provide just as much of an ab workout. When you finally acclimatize to the spry wordplay, (""we are werewolves, not swear-wolves!""), lovingly integrated pokes at other vampire lore (including the bad etiquette of attending a vampire costume ball dressed as Blade, despite the fact that apparently ""Vampires love Wesley Snipes!""), and faux-historical interludes (apparently Naziism was just as controversial within vampire circles), you think you might find rest. But it's only moments before you're blindsided again by interludes involving a pair of impossibly stupid police officers, or laughs as unobtrusive as a cutaway to Waititi playing a mournful trumpet. The film is nonstop, evidencing a breezy, cheerful humour that is too earnest not to love.It helps that Waititi and Clement wear their hearts on their sleeves, with an uncanny ability to tease out the silliness in vampire lore while still committing to the emotion at the heart of it. There's an undercurrent of deep, anachronistic loneliness imbued in the film's leading trio of bloodsuckers, which somehow makes their interludes of squabbling over the (five years) overdue dishes, or forlornly learning how to use Facebook all the funnier in their sweetness. Similarly, in this realm of immortal horror monsters, death comes fast, furious, and with unapologetic bluntness, and the cheerful interjections of staggering bloodiness that sprinkle throughout the film (sometimes quite inconveniently getting all over the furniture), or omnipresent threat of the documentary crew getting devoured, keep the fun appropriately gruesome throughout. In terms of cohesiveness, there's no question that the film is unapologetically episodic, like a prolonged sitcom episode or beefed up SNL sketch, but Waititi and Clement keep things nimble enough to keep the joke from wearing thin, before calling it quits with a chipper non-climax that's so nonchalant, it's only retroactively that it feels like it delivers the loose resolution you'd hope for. And, honestly, material this hilarious earns all of the clumsy non-sequiturs it can muster.Still, the film's ruthless silliness and sweetness consolidate into the perfect cocktail (presumably a blood-tini) in the hands of the effortlessly funny cast. As the ageless, effete dandy and tentative moral compass of the group, Waititi himself is massively adorable, pairing bug-eyed cheeriness with a cartoon Dr. Strangelove accent to tremendous effect. Similarly, Clement commits his post-Concords star power perfectly towards the enormous presence of his larger-than-life, crestfallenly ineffectual Vlad the Impaler. Jonny Brugh's scene-chewing rock star arrogance is all the funnier once paired with the clueless boorishness of Cori Gonzalez-Macuer or the indignantly neurotic Jackie van Beek as scene partners. Finally, Stuart Rutherford redefines the potential of the comedic deadpan as impossibly unflappably software analyst (and very human) Stu,* while Rhys Darby (don't call him Murray) is as reliably hilarious as ever, cameoing as an exasperated werewolf.Thoroughly sweet, disarmingly sad, cheerfully bloody, and infectiously watchable, What We Do in the Shadows proves one of a preciously slim caste of horror spoofs with genuine wings. While it's inevitably prime material to be gobbled up by Flight of the Conchords converts, it's also accessibly goofy enough to stand alone as one of the most unobtrusively funny sleeper hit comedies of the past several years. Just be cautious not to falsely publicize the film amidst the lingering forces of Twihards, or risk incurring Clement and Waititi intoning that these are vampires, not tramp-ires. Zing.-9/10*Also, did you realize ""Don't eat Stu!"" was a pun? Because I didn't until long after the credits rolled. What a delightful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fangtastically Hysterical!,"What we do in the Shadows is a film i heard about a while ago, I saw the trailer and knew it had a great deal of potential but was a film that I knew had to be seen to decide whether I could truly see it as a great comedy. Going into the film it is best to know as little as possible because it is such a surprise and such a pleasure to watch that nothing can be spoiled.The plot follows a group of vampires who share a flat and have a documentary crew follow them around as they try to adjust to everyday life despite being undead creatures of the night. The premise is one that we have seen, the oddball or group of oddballs are taken from one scenario to the other and have to adjust to a different lifestyle, but to tackle this in a mockumentary format with mythical creatures we have all heard of before is something completely new and it works better than most recent comedies have. There are some truly side-splitting scenes that had me laughing out loud. There is something genuinely hysterical about seeing these vampires do household chores and attempt to get into nightclubs which really makes me want to see more comedy like this. I found the circle of shame particarly funny.There are also a fair few twists and turns along the way, we get zombies and werewolves.. and these twists turn this from an ordinary mockumentary into something very special indeed. There are scenes where the comedy may run dry or it will go on for a little too long, but in the end this film pays off and it is nothing short of fun and is incredibly enjoyable. Some people may not ""get"" the style of comedy used which is fine, but for me it was original and the funniest film for a while. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're wondering what vampires get up to when you're sleeping.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The humor ranges from crass, bloody and black to simple puns, hysterical visuals and the very odd and very awkward situation. The acting is spot on and inventive.

Dry dark but definitely funny,"REVIEW - WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWSWhilst watching BBC2 the other evening I turned over to a program that was half way through but I instantly found the day dark humour funny and watched until the end. After searching for the title of the program I found it to be a US program made from the original film of the same name made in New Zealand.Sitting watching the film again the dry dark humour appealed.Basically a TV documentary crew are documenting the life of a group of vampires who live together and their lives, loves, victims and friends.Gets pretty surreal at times with the vampires trying to live in modern day social, like trying to get ready to go out on the town.Personally I just loved the whole idea and found this very original film to be a scream and am now watching the TV series.Bloody in places (they are vampires) swearing but definitely dry, dark and funny.Rating 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement prove to us that New Zealand makes great movies,"New Zealand makes a great movie...again. So far, I've only found 2 bad New Zealand movies. I think it's time we start making bad movies, New Zealand! But then again, we've made some terrible TV shows, so I guess that makes up for it...but anyway! This is a great mockumentary film that provides and guarantees great laugh-out-loud moments that will probably make you burst out on your couch laughing. This film is so good, it can be accepted as a Hollywood film set in New Zealand. This movie is great, and it is very hard not to like it. I'll keep this review short, however I will still describe a bit about how great this gem of a movie is, but I will also discuss about the flaws in the film. Let's get started on my review now, shall we?Taika Waiti has made some great movies provided, especially ones more for New Zealand viewers. However, he right now delivers a vampire comedy/mockumentary...that's set in New Zealand. It sounds bad, but believe me, it's not. This film is about three vampires called Viago, Deacon and Vladislav who are all hundreds of years old, trying to cope in real life as a normal figure. Unfortunately, that doesn't work when they're bloodsucking vampires with a thirst of blood! A documentary film crew makes a documentary about their life and how they live and adapt as vampires in the outside world and learn to cope with humans, werewolves, a wannabe vampire and paying their rent! That sounds like a great movie, doesn't it? Because, well, if it doesn't sound good, then I recommend you don't go watch it, because this is a more love-it-or-you-hate-it movie. Here's why.Although this is a great film, and I really, REALLY like it, werewolf fans may be a bit offended, because sometimes the werewolves are teased and made fun of in parts of the movie. That can be easily ignored, but still, it may offend sensitive viewers that are fans of werewolf movies. I, myself, do prefer werewolves than vampires, but the jokes didn't really bug me that much, so I'm pretty sure you'd be able to cope with them if I could. Although this didn't do great at the box office, it did go great on the review side, which is probably why they are now making a What We Do In The Shadows 2. Let's hope they don't insult werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows 2, am I right, werewolf fans?Also, let's talk about the violence in this film. This film is quite gory for a comedy. Even if most of the gory violence is done in an over the top comical matter, it may disgust some people that are eating popcorn in the film. I have seen way gorier, but if you go watching this, planning a film with barely any gore (like most New Zealand films) then you will most likely be disappointed, because this film is quite gory. But do take in mind that the violence is hilarious, too! The bit when the vampires mess up and hit the jugular is hilariously bloody, and it's a good laugh, that even if it's the goriest part in the film, it's really, really funny. If you can cope with a ton of blood spraying everywhere, I think you'll be fine and will enjoy the movie as much as I did.Okay, so I guess the review wasn't as short as I was planning, but it's still good enough to be called a review (I hope). I hope you now know whether this is your kind of movie or not, because it's definitely my kind of movie. It's fine if it's not your type, but even if it isn't, you may enjoy it anyway if you can cope with a bit of blood. This proves that New Zealand makes great films, and I do have to say, I was surprised that the rating on IMDb was lower than 8/10. Overall, I'd rate this a 8.3/10, and it also definitely deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250! 8.3/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampire movie meets reality TV Docucomedy,"First reaction after watching ""What we do in the shadows"" was: I have to watch it again and share it with everyone I know! With Low expectations prior to watching on a recommendation from a co-worker this film was an awesome surprise. Has been one of my favorites from the past few years. The idea for the film being about Vampires who live among us and them being filmed for a documentary was brilliant. The diary sessions aren't over done and really add to the characters. The comedy never lets up and allot is missed on the first watch. No worries though, You'll definitely watch it again and again.

So good it should be on TV,"Take the mockumentary comedy The Office put it in 80ies cult flatmate sitcom The Young Ones, add some Bad Taste splatter and dash it with all the troubles of vampires' lives that you have not thought about and you get the character driven movie What We Do in the Shadows. From the awkward, but sympathetic 1700-century vampire Viago, to the desperately misplaced non-dead computer geek Stu that befriends the vampires, the characters all in their own way suck you into the world of old fashioned vampires in a modern New Zealand. The characters are so cleverly created and acted out that one and a half hour is far from enough time.

"Very good! Light humor, ironic and shameless, hahah!","One of the sub-genres of horror, it is the mixture of horror and comedy in certain degrees, popularly called as Terrir. This type of film usually doesn't have a terrifying feeling, but rather a lighter feeling.Directed by Taika Waititi ( Jojo Rabbit or Thor: Ragnarok ) and his friend Jemaine Clement, the work has that satirical, ironic humor and often embarrassing others, especially for having its footage made as a ""Documentary"", in the Found Footage style.In addition to the comedy, mainly around the stigmas related to vampire culture, the film also has its more ""dramatic"" moments, showing the history of each of the vampires and talking about the importance of accepting differences.Being Taika in his prime, the film passes a smarter comedy, with a more ironic humor, mocking several human ideas related to vampires.

Better than I expected.,"While this is a low budget film, the actors are talented, several are well regarded stand-ups, and their talent shows. The improvised filming format played to their strengths, and the film plays really well as a mockumentary. While I wasn't falling on the floor laughing, I found the movie to be funny, enjoyable and well worth watching. The main actors are current well known artists, in New Zealand, and they have a fresh but polished approach. The special effects were surprisingly well done. The situations they end up in are pretty creative, and the writers know their vampire lore. There are a number of these tongue in cheek monster movies that have been produced in recent years, and this movie rates among the better ones.

The jokes were so brilliant and hilarious. However, what really makes this one stand out from all other comedy movies is its consistency. Normally, when a movie is a pure comedy filled entirely with jokes, some of those wouldn't be as funny as the other ones throughout that film. Yet, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" was so consistent and didn't miss any joke in the whole film. What made the jokes even funnier was the delivery by the actors. The cast was just amazing. They were so hilarious each one of them on their own and altogether; you could see how good the chemistry between them is! Additionally, the idea of the film, a mockumentary about Vampires, also helped in elevating the comedy of the movie as there was a lot of room for creative and new jokes.How realistic the film seems leaves me wondering, could all this be real?!Score:8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The best comedy of 2014,"""I go for a look which I call dead but delicious.""Just when you thought there couldn't be another fresh spin out of the overplayed vampire genre, there comes along a small New Zealand mockumentary that manages to feel original and hilarious at the same time. A parody of vampire movies isn't simple to make, just ask the directors of Vampire Sucks, but in What We Do in the Shadows Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi manage to direct a funny and engaging film about vampires. Clement and Waititi are known for the TV series Flight of the Conchords which Clement has starred in and helped create, while Waititi has directed a couple of episodes. These New Zealand directors also write and star in this film which was mostly improvised (they had over 120 hours of footage which was later edited to under 85 minutes). This is perhaps one of the funniest mockumentaries I've seen since Borat and many have compared it to This is Spinal Tap (but I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't seen it yet). It is very witty and it plays around many of the vampire genre conventions, but it does so with a fantastic sense of humor giving each one of the vampires a distinct personality. It also centers on the day to day domestic life these vampires lead as they live together in a flat and are given specific chores in the home. So in a way it almost plays out as a sort of spoof of The Real World as well considering they have arguments about someone not doing the dishes, or are always giving each other advice as to what to wear for the night, or even making sure they clean up the mess they leave behind from their victims. It's about friendship and learning to live with each other. I was a huge fan of Only Lovers Left Alive which was another engaging vampire film that took a unique spin on the genre, but this is much lighter and is played entirely for laughs. I had a great time and laughed throughout the film.One of the best things about this vampire mockumentary is that they decided to have these four vampires living together in a flat despite being completely different from each other and coming from different backgrounds. There is Viago (Taika Waititi) who is over 300 years old and who came to New Zealand to pursue a love interest, Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) who was once a powerful vampire from the Middle Ages who lost most of his powers to someone he calls the Beast, Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) who is the youngest of the group and who refuses to wash the dishes saying that vampires shouldn't have to, and then there is Petyr (Ben Fransham), a vampire over 8000 years old that looks like Nosferatu. The film centers on these vampires following their every day routines while they are being filmed by a documentary crew. There are several instances where they talk to the camera explaining who they are. While we follow these characters they run in to some other creatures like werewolves, zombies, and even witches, which makes for some funny scenes with quotable lines. Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stuart Rutherford also play supporting roles in this film but I don't want to get into too much detail because it is more fun if you simply enjoy the wackiness of everything unfolding before the screen.Mockumentaries and vampire films aren't perhaps something most audiences would be interested in considering they have been overdone in recent years, but the combination of these two genres make for a very entertaining and funny movie. What could've very easily been a one punch joke and lost most of its steam during the first 10 minutes ends up stretching out very well and the jokes continue to feel fresh and inventive. In other hands this could've simply worked as a short film, but Waititi and Clement manage to keep the humor coming throughout the entire 80 minutes. It is a perfectly executed film with many memorable scenes. There is even a scene that seems to be parodying the hall way scene in Inception so there are a lot of different funny things going on in this movie which mostly involve parodying vampire genre conventions.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
If the show Being Human were on MTV,"-What We Do In The Shadows (2015) movie review: -What We Do In The Shadows is a comedy in the shape of a documentary about three friends, Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav, who are struggling through everyday life, because they are vampires.-A comedy that is about a documentary crew following vampires doing average vampire things, but completely seriously as if it were real? Yeah I'm all about that.-The story was great, and the fact that nothing is treated like it is a new thing for the audience was so smart. Things just happen and move on casually, like freak sunlight accidents.-The pace was mostly good, but I did feel like it had a slow wrap-up.-The acting was great. I don't know any of the actors, but they all did a convincingly good job.-The characters were really likable and funny, but also serious. Like introducing themselves as 600 years old, but being completely chill about it. Or having fights by flying.-I did not really care much for the music, but it was fittingly weird.-So more about this film that I just loved was that it was set in a world where everything that would be a big deal to anybody is just casual and treated so for the cameras in the film. They go to a party with zombies or make fun of werewolves. Or have trouble getting dressed because they can't see themselves in mirrors.-The films effects are also realistic and surprisingly not cheesy.-It does not have a rating, but I would say it would be a heavy PG-13 or light R. There's 2 F-words and some other mild language. There is some violence, but some of it is blurred. There is some suggestive material also, but either blurred or just not shown.-What We Do In The Shadows is a great example of how to make a satirical comedy so entertaining and original. It is like if the show Being Human were on MTV. Best way I can think to describe it. And that said, What We Do In The Shadows is totally worth checking out!

One of the best horror comedies of the modern era,"With the series finale of the show coming later today, I decided to finally watch the movie of the same name that inspired the series. After watching it, I can say that What We Do in the Shadows (2014) is one of the best horror comedy movies I've seen in my life.Positives for What We Do in the Shadows (2014):
I have to give props to both Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement for crafting such a brilliant horror comedy because this was amazing. The way how they do the comedy with the vampire lore is some of the smartest and funniest stuff I've seen in any comedy movie period. The leading vampire performances with Taika Waititi as Viago von Dorna Schmarten Scheden Heimburg, Jemaine Clement as Vladislav the Poker, Jonathan Brugh as Deacon Brucke and Ben Fransham as Petyr are all top-tier comedy gold. There are so many moments where I was smiling at the comedy and I don't say that about a lot of modern comedy movies. And finally, the movie has a great pace to where it keeps up the energy throughout the short runtime.Overall, I had a blast with this movie and I understand why this led to the show on FX because it is such a smart and brilliantly executed story with excellent comedy from start to finish and I am on cloud 9 with this stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was wrong this film is amazing and very funny,"Back when this came out I gave it a miss because it sounded dumb but few years later I realised it got a bit of a cult following so checked the trailer again I got put off than I watched the amazing Thor Ragnarok and found out it was directed by the same guy and so 2019 I finally got round to watching it and boy was I wrong, the film blew me away I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about it and yet start to end I was hooked and laughed throughout the movie the jokes were wow and did not get old and though the plot was weak the movie made up for it with great characters excellent humour and a tremendous final",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
They're just some wild and craaaazy guys,"Armed with crosses, a documentary crew follows the lives of three bachelor roommates in What We Do in the Shadows.Viago, Deacon and Vladislav are just normal guys trying to enjoy life, you know: going to the club, bringing ladies home, dealing with roommate issues and of course, staying out of the sunlight. Oh yeah, did we mention What We Do in the Shadows is a vampire movie? Before you stop listening at 'vampire' – you really should hear this film out! Mockumentary styled What We Do in the Shadows is a perfect combination of dry observational humor, a smart screenplay and an original idea. The plot of the film is following the lives of these three wild and crazy guys but it is the way writers Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi approach the movie that distinguishes itself as exceptionally hilarious.Having caught my attention awhile back when I first heard of the film – I knew it was a must watch for me when What We Do in the Shadows became slated for US distribution. What We Do in the Shadows is too funny for its own good. You know when something funny happens and then you go to explain it and the joke falls flat? That's what happens if you try to describe What We Do in the Shadows – it's one of those films that needs to be experienced to be appreciated completely. Everything about it should be foolishly absurd to the point of being off-putting – but somehow everything about it works.The jokes are constant and refreshingly smart, with not a crude joke in sight. The awareness of the genre and satire of classical vampire culture and society in general is top notch. The star of the film was easily the character portrayed by Taika Waititi –without whom the film probably would have been a bit too dry. If you like The Office and similarly irreverent humor, then What We Do in the Shadows is probably for you.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the REVIEWS of recent releases!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
HILARIOUS and fun!,"What I love most about this movie is how free and easygoing it is, in my opinion. It's funny, but the jokes don't barrel you over repeatedly, they give you enough time to have your laugh over one joke before going to the next. There's a fair amount of drama and action, but its important to the plot, and builds up interesting tension before the climax. Everything in this movie is very well strung together, beautifully acted out, and I fell in love with most all of the characters before the movie even came to the halfway point. The ONLY negative side I could ever give to this movie was that it felt so short, and I was left wishing it could last just a little longer, even if the movie already is 90 minutes. But they added in everything they could, it was all that was needed to impress and I can heartily say that anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out on a lot of fun.Movie warnings: It contains gore, mild/moderate horror themes, sexual innuendos, blurred-out nudity, violence, and plenty of cursing, so this movie is probably not for children. The jokes will fly over their heads and the visuals will scare them. But teenagers and adults will love this movie; I recommend watching it in a group so you can have a barrel of laughs with all your friends, because it is just too good to watch alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
EXTREMELY dry humor but funny movie.,"Different from the tv show but just as funny. The humor is dry as a bone but it works. All the characters were funny, Total deadpan comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious,Best comedy I've seen in a long time. Love the cast. Would love to see a sequel. This is by far one of my favorite comedies 😁,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious,"Taika Waititi shines as a young director (now becoming world famous) and one of the main actors along with Jemain Clement (Flight of the Conchords) in this fantastic farce. They show how to create something memorable on a very low budget. Destined to be a cult classic, it certainly is one of my all-time favorites.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious,"This film is actually hilarious, while it has sort of slipped past the main spotlight due to its indie-nature and lack of advertising (As most mockumentaries tend to do). Regardless this film is hilariously funny and is a fresh comedy, which is quite nice after all the drivel people like Adam Sandler produce.The three lead vampires in this film were absolutely fantastic, I loved all three of the main characters and their interactions with Stu. I felt myself giggling at almost every scene, while there is one point in the middle of the film it feels like the jokes are getting a bit old and repetitive but it quickly bounces back with more fresh humour.Some people say that the mockumentary format does not work I believe that the mockumentary cinematography style of this film adds to the originality and flare of this film, which makes it even more interesting.I thoroughly recommend this film as it is one of the most original and funny comedy films I have seen since the Grand Budapest Hotel.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best vampire movie ever,Best comedy of 21st century for sure. Almost all the jokes landed so well and it was hillarious. I love Waititi's humour and can't wait for Jojo Rabbit.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Robot Chicken + Borat+ The Office= Dead But Delicious!,"I didn't know what to think going into this movie. I had gone in completely blind. Never read a review or even saw a trailer before watching this movie. I was dying 5 minutes into this film.I love films like this that just have fun, and we seriously need more films in this fashion. It reminded me of Borat throughout the entire movie, it just had a very similar tone and feel to it. But it also felt like the kind of segment you would find in Robot Chicken. Combine that with humor styles from The Office, and you have one hell of a funny mockumentary.Don't go into this movie expecting a plot, it is not that kind of film, and it's not suppose to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Funny but extremely gory...,"I have been constant promos for the show adaptation and I finally decided to watch the original movie. I did not regret it one bit. Mockumentaries have always been my kryptonite, but this is totally different. I rarely watch anything horror, but this is mostly just gore. If vampires are in your movie, expect blood everywhere. I watched the movie on TV so I'm not sure if bits are cut. Highly recommend this hilarious but gory rollercoaster.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Vampires meet documentary,"What a refreshing film! What we do in the shadows is one of the most original films in the last several years, I enjoyed everything about this movie, the characters were funny, the story is gripping, and the overall idea is just spectacular! This is one of those films that you don't have to give much thought to, you can just sit back and enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pure hilarity!,"A mocumentary about vampire roommates who just want to fit in the modern world and have a, sort of, normal life. Plain and simply, a hilarious movie executed to perfection. The characters are incredible, the actors are amazing, the editing makes it seem like it is a real life documentary and the script is one of the funniest I have ever seen! The laughs just keep coming with this one. It throws all the vampire cliches in the 21th century, lampooning all of the troupes people came to expect from vampire movies. Just an amazing piece of comedy and film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Seriously Silly, Entertainingly Undead","I think that to say too much about this film would ruin it; it just needs to be watched. Though it's far from perfect, its roughness is just part of the charm.The cast is strong, handling the (from what I've heard) loads of ad-libs well, and the direction as a 'documentary', while a convention I feel is overly used, was definitely the way to go for What We Do In The Shadows.One final note: this movie's not for everybody. If you want a gore-fest or an action film, look elsewhere, but if you like to laugh at absurdity (think Monty Python, The Ruttles) it more than fits the bill. Just wish it'd seen a wider release.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated and more should see this movie,An amazing movie in the indie style. It plays homage to traditional comedy as well as traditional horror. Each cast member exceeded Expectation for a glorious romp through the lives of vampires in modern society,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody Hilarious!,"This film has been done in a mockumentary format as it attempts to demystify vampires. These vampires are not mysterious, luxurious and dripping with sexiness. They have real emotions, weaknesses and quirks. It's got the low budget feel to it - the hand held camera, the poor lighting, the rundown sets - but the special effects are really well done. That makes the whole thing look pretty realistic. And it is packed with some pretty unexpected laughs. The film had me grinning the entire time and also had lots of laugh out loud moments, and I am not someone who is easily amused. It's not just the jokes that are funny, but maybe you will notice some weird detail in the background that will make you crack up. It doesn't really have a story, it's more like a journey of getting to know a few vampires like never before. I know for sure that this is going in my comedy staple collection.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Amusing, wry satire","Great movie! It's clever, wry satire of modern life's foibles and challenges through the experiences of a bunch of slightly goofy vampires. Taika Waititi is an adorably batty genius, a great writer and actor. I love the deadpan tone and bursts of outright silliness in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hilarious Throughout,"This completely subverted my expectations. After getting tastes of Taika Waititi's sense of humour sprinkled throughout Thor Ragnarok and JoJo Rabbit, this to me feels like the definitive Taika film and it's absolutely hilarious. The deadpan humour, relatable gags and performances themselves just blend to form a great comedy. The runtime could be a little tighter in my opinion as there is no intent, it's kind of just aimlessly wandering from joke after joke. Regardless it's near enough hilarious throughout if you enjoy this kind of humour.",,Anonymous,Horror
A refreshing comedy,"This film is shot in a documentary style, on the lives of a group of Vampires in Wellington, New Zealand.I got recommended by a friend to watch ""What We Do in the Shadows"", and I am glad to have watched it! A fake documentary is not new, but one on lives of vampires is certainly new. It is really fun to watch. I love the accents of the vampires! The whole plot is hilarious, especially the fact that they are portrayed as humans. It's like they are actually nothing to be scared about, because they still have to take part in flatmate meetings and wish the dirty dishes! Stu the human is very funny as well, because he is so wooden despite being in such a bizarre situation. Nick the new vampire is quite annoying, but that is of course part of the story.",,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Darn Cooooool.,This is a killERRR flick. This is a killERRR flick. This is a killERRR flick.,,Anonymous,Horror
Cringe,"The movie isn't funny at all. The acting and ""jokes"" are cringey as hell. The movie tried too hard to be funny. Taika Waititi is a horrible actor and has an inflated sense of self worth. He things he's far funnier than he actually is. I can't believe people actually greenlit anything he made. Dude is a hack. One of the worst people to every find success. Completely undeserved.",,Anonymous,Horror
A great mock documentary film consisting of vampires and their lifestyle.,"Did you ever wanted to be a vampire? Had fantasies of sucking the crap out of beautiful women with your sharp and pointy canines? What their lifestyle could be and all that stuff? Then you came to the right movie to watch, so sit back and enjoy this silly-fest of a movie. With an excellent prod. design, quirky sense of humour and artful rendition of the life of vampires, this movie could be the most funniest movie/documentary about vampires of all time. Throw your preconceived notions of vampires, brainwashed into your head by Twilight-like movies, into mental dustbin and just comprehend this movie. 1 star removed for killing a beautiful woman who just wanted to get her degree and travel round the world.",,Anonymous,Horror
What we bring to life in illusions,"Yes, this is Spinal Tap with vampires and will prove to be as iconic. Yes, it turns familiar vampire lore into day-to-day shenanigans between four vampire bachelors who share a flat, fun from start to finish. We're far from the lofty stage of Hammer, thank goodness.But it could have as easily gone wrong as right; we could have easily felt the crass hand of someone trying to manufacture to specifications. Deliberately designed spoofs and oddities fall short every year. And they get it so right here in matters of placing us.Our entry is that a documentary crew is supposedly filming what we see, following a few days in their life, but that's just a way for us to be placed in ""real life"", we never really bother with them, nor question the camera. Invisibly submerged.The next gamble was the actors, they got this right too. Vampire lore provides no shortage of hijinks to milk and turn upside down. The real difficulty is fleshing characters who will experience them. Mel Brooks always goes too far the other way. We get here fearsome creatures of the night slash cunning teenagers delighting in mischief slash naive outsiders of the modern world, so we have a foot in three worlds. (in Borat we had one)But the most vital aspect for me - and one I always note in comments - is in the background all around them, the kind of life evoked as playground. We don't have some silly plot significance that we're called to immerse ourselves in, in fact there's no plot here and just situations that come and go. A sense of unconstrained playing around with the fabrics and contexts of illusion, making it up as you go along, not bogged down by anything, now trying to score in a club, now encountering werewolves in a park.Unfettered by narrative and significance, it leaves us free to see it for what it truly is; a few lovable buffoons playing around Wellington with a camera crew tagging along, and this is the actual film as it took shape. We get to see the reality of everyday normalcy around town as an open space to run around in. And no doubt for me this springs from a New Zealand world these people know.So, submersion into world, characters caught in fiction about fiction, and larger view of the surge of life that gives rise to the fiction as free and easy wandering into it. This is good stuff right here folks. Having parsed this, your next stop is Trash Humpers, even more abstractly about wandering.(There's a notion that good cinema will be somber and weigh on our souls with dilemmas of importance. I'd say no such silliness should be allowed into your life; leave that to the potatoheads in film festivals. Isn't cinema nothing more than being able to freely make use of appearances? In Taoism this is called taking each thing as its own measure. We might also venture this view. When life sorts itself out finally, when we've stopped making somber films about the persecution of people because we've stopped persecuting people, we'll be free to run around like New Zealanders making a film.)",,Anonymous,Horror
