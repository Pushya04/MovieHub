"Great fun in the vein of ""Indiana Jones""...","""The Mummy"" is an adventurous yarn in the vein of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a lot of fun, very charming, and never tries to be more than what it is. What is it? An entertaining summer flick which is not only worth seeing, but perhaps even owning. It's one of those fun movies you can return to over and over again and never grow tired of doing so.It's hardly a remake of the Universal classic of the same name. It's merely a new way to tell the story with the same basic idea - a murderous mummy is brought back from the dead. This time we have a hero and heroine who must stop him before he takes over the world, or something along the line of world domination.The hero is Rick (Brendan Fraser), a thief thriving off the very basics out in Egypt circa 1930. Arrested and to be hanged, he is saved by the heroine (Rachel Weisz), who believes he may hold the key to helping them find an ancient Egyptian kingdom buried under the sand, if I recall correctly (though it has been a while since I've seen this). Little does she know what lurks beneath the sand near that old kingdom is none other than the remains of a man who was caught cheating on the king's wife years ago and mummified.Now, after unearthing the remains of the kingdom, the expedition led by our heroes come upon an ancient ""Book of the Dead,"" which, when read from, brings the ancient mummy back to life. Now he is out to kill, regenerate and bring back his old lover - pretty neat, huh?I own ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy,"" a great movie spoofing the classic film. ""The Mummy"" isn't exactly a spoof but it's very tongue-in-cheek. It knows it isn't an Oscar-winner, it knows it stands nothing against the older film, and so it goes for pulp thrills. I actually believe that this film is a bit classy in execution - compared to many other entertainments floating around nowadays it stands as one of the only films to return to the roots of the pure adventure films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) so successfully did.Brendan Fraser is a perfect choice for the lead star. Calm, but with ironic and sarcastic humor; cool, but a strong lead. I wondered what it would have been like if they had casted an actor in his role who would have taken it all more seriously. I bet the results would have been disastrous. Fraser knows that this is all good fun, and he's having a good time playing his role with comedy. Every once and a while you can catch a wink at the screen that lets us know that he knows what he's doing.2001 brought a sequel to ""The Mummy"" named, of all things, ""The Mummy Returns."" I found it just as fun as this film though some critics begged to differ. Summer 2002 brought yet another ""Mummy"" film, this one a prequel called ""The Scorpion King"" - it was a following of a co-star of the first sequel. The Mummy was not in it at all. It was a horrible film that wasn't near as fun as this one. So I recommend you see ""The Mummy"" as soon as humanly possible. After that, see ""The Mummy Returns.""Either way, you simply can't go wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not much Horror, Just a Good Movie","Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frazer) leads the beautiful Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) to Hamunaptra (The City of the Dead) where reading from a book brings Imhotep (Pharaoh Seti I's High Priest) back to life.Once revived Imhotep has only one purpose in this world, to bring his love 'Anck Su Namun' back from the dead to join him, and will kill anyone who gets in his way.Although based on a Horror Theme, there is little horror on show here, but there are plenty of Great Action Moments, some brilliant visuals and some good humour.The dialogue is well written and punchy, this combined with some great characters bring the story to life and it turns out to be a terrific Film that is more Action/Comedy than Horror.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Adventurous Fun!,"Certainly this Universal remake is more in the vain of Indiana Jones rather than the original Mummy.  It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!,"This was one of the ""low-brain-but-so-damn-entertaining""- type of films. ""The Mummy"" was an action packed adventure flick with great humor and nice special effects (The Mummy itself could have been better though). I enjoyed every moment with this one. There was no boring parts and Brendan Fraser makes a great performance as the Indiana Jones wannabe (HEH! JOKE!!). Lot of big time effects nice action, very funny jokes and nice GROOVE!!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of my all time favorite movies,"First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but most of the low ratings I am seeing are criticizing ""The Mummy"" because of it's ""weak plot"" or someone even said that this movie could have been written by the person's dog!Does anyone realize that there is different movie genres? If you go to see ""The Mummy"" and expect to see ""The Departed"", ""The Godfather"", or ""Shawshank Redemption"" then yes, of course you will be disappointed. This is not a drama, it's an action/adventure movie!Everyone has commented on the fun of this movie, that is what this movie is all about! Personally, I think the story is very good, and interesting. There is a lot to like here: it has elements of action, adventure, comedy, fantasy, mythology, horror, and tells a pretty well made tale (seriously, how many movies manage to pull all of these things off? And pull them off well!). And, it manages to do all of this in style, with amazing special effects and action sequences. No, it's not perfect (what movie is?) but this movie kills most movies in the same genre! I have never seen a movie that can contain so many different elements while still being coherent. This movie is a technical marvel is many aspects!Rachel Weisz is great and looks beautiful as well playing as Evelyn. Yes, she is something like a ""typical damsel in distress"", but she brings humor, intelligence, and a strong will to the part. It's hard to integrate so many qualities into a believable character, but she does it well.Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell: After seeing him in so many goofy movies, playing an equally goofy character, I thought he was always going to be cast in lame movies such as ""Encino Man"" and ""Monkeybones"". He was the reason why I had doubts I would like the movie because I could not picture him being more than a one-dimensional actor (able to pull goofy-charismatic off only). Not only does he act the part with stride, but he nails every aspect of his character: He is cool, yet has humor and he really surprised me with how much depth he can add to a role that really doesn't need it! Rick O'Connell wields his dual guns with flair, and I will never doubt Fraser again! I just hope they keep him utilized more and more like this. I was really impressed with him most because he surpassed all expectations!Everyone else did their parts extremely well, they always stay in character, and add to the elements of the story.This movie has a lot to offer, and lots of different ways to get your interest, especially if the Ancient Egyptian mythology fascinates you. This movie does have elements of horror: it will most likely scare younger kids more than adults, but putting yourself in the characters places you would be quite afraid.Imhotep is very scary, mostly because of all the different abilities he possesses, as well as forms he can take.I could not recommend this movie enough, especially if you have a HDTV and have the High Definition version, you will be blown away! Just don't expect a character driven drama, you're not looking for that with this either!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very likable horror adventure.,"The Mummy is a fun and likable horror adventure, that doesn't take itself too seriously. True, there are a few discrepancies in the script, it is a tad overlong and Kevin J.Connor's Beni mayn't be to everyone's tastes, but it is a solid film of its genre. The visuals are absolutely stunning, every scene with the Egyptian desert is enough to take your breath away, and the costumes are very nice too. The music by the one and only Jerry Goldsmith is a very creepy and atmospheric score, and just goes to show what a talented composer Goldsmith was. I will admit some of it is quite scary, and that is an understatement, I do confess being scared of the film when I saw it for the first time when I was 9(I'm 17 now), and there are some scenes that still scare me now. It is no wonder because Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep was a masterstroke, very, very frightening at times, especially when the Mummy disguises himself on the ship, and takes off his cloak to claim his first victim. The other performances are fine, with a dashing Brendan Fraser and a stunningly beautiful Rschel Weisz. John Hannah, if you forgive his accent, was on the whole fine. Overall, a fun and likable horror adventure, flawed yes, but guaranteed to give you entertainment and perhaps nightmares. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun adventure film,"Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.Especially tantalizing is the strictly painted-on attire of Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namum; what a stunning visual; but it completely upstages her performance. I have heard people talking about it. Some have mistakenly guessed her top was a mesh costume of some sort; not true, it is entirely - and only - paint.But Velazquez isn't the only thing to turn heads in the film, Rachel Weisz is appropriately attractive, though not as startling; her character is as solid and believable as she is lovely.The newcomer, Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, set quite a few female hearts aflutter; in our party, at least. The internet was lit-up searching for more photos of this guy.At first, I didn't particularly care for Brendan Fraser as the primary character (he's too well kept and cutesy for a rugged guy-type for me), be he grows on you. He seems to be developing into a versatile actor who will be around for a long time. His work here is good too.The special effects were the real star of the film, and they were visually rewarding and complimented the story in the right way in the right places. How Arnold Vosloo dealt with those in his role as the mummy Imhotep should be acknowledged. He must have had to imagine quite a bit of what he was interacting with to pull it off, and he does so with great style and substance for this type of role. He was nothing short of excellent.In fact, most of the remaining characters were well chosen. Jonathan Hyde and Kevin J. O'Connor added to the film in important ways, too. Together, everyone painted an enjoyable film, delivering exactly what it promised; fun, action, and adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Actual quote - ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""","This version of The Mummy (one of the several titles within film lore that seems to have been made and remade for decades) is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a modern adaptation of an old horror classic, especially given the types of films that are released these days. The action and special effects of the 1932 classic have been massively increased, and the new film turns more to shocking special effects, often cheesy comic relief, and sparkling scenery, away from the slow, creeping tension of the original. As a result, we get a fast moving feature that places a lot of emphasis on its special effects and it's good-looking stars. Thankfully, the movie knows when to laugh at itself, but it trips because it doesn't know when to stop.The film starts roughly 3000 years in the past, with the Egyptian priest Imhotep being put to a rather vicious death for getting a little too friendly with the Pharaoh's mistress. Naturally, he is mummified alive, sealed in a coffin with a lot of flesh-eating beetles (the sounds of which make up some of the creepiest stuff in the whole movie), only to be accidentally resurrected by a lot of bounty hunters a few millennia later. This is where the cast comes in, Rick (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah).Rick is the hero of the movie, the guy who has been there and done it all and just wants to get his money and get out. He's kind of like a cross between the single-mindedness of Han Solo, the bad one-liners of James Bond, and the adventure experience of Indiana Jones, except that he comes across more as a muddy conglomeration of characters like those rather than an original character of his own. He goes through his part upset by the fact that other people seem to be constantly be holding him back from some faraway goal, the importance of which they can probably never be expected to understand.Evelyn is there mainly with scientific interest (until she meets the hottie hero and romance is added to her To Do list) and her brother Jonathan is there for pure financial gain, as is the movie's director and crew and production team. There is also a tagalong character named Beni who I can only satisfactorily describe as a greedy rat, someone you would expect to meet on the wet streets of New York in the 1940s or something. He is a constant double-crosser who never has anyone's but his own best interest in mind, and so naturally ends up working for the resurrected Imhotep. His weird eye-makeup and pathetically whiny little voice make him a perfect candidate for the throwaway antagonist, who Rick tries vainly to save in a climactic scene near the end of the film.The interesting thing about the plot comes up when you consider when exactly Imhotep became the bad guy. Really, all he did was fall in love with the wrong girl, and then when he was brought back to life, obviously he wanted to bring her back, too. One of the first things that I learned in film studies is that the audience should know as soon as possible whether they are meant to like or dislike a character, because first impressions are difficult to overcome. With that in mind then, when exactly was it that he went from the poor love-struck protagonist from the first act of the film to the monstrous antagonist during the rest of the movie?My best theory is that first and foremost, he's killing people to bring himself and his love back to life. Granted, more killing would not justify the death of himself or of his loved one, Anck Su Namun, but considering the fact that all he did was fall in love and also considering the way that he was put to death, his reaction upon achieving life once more becomes a little more understandable. Second, what exactly does a resurrected protagonist look like? I must admit that there is something a little too daunting about trying to come up with a likable mummy, but Imhotep is certainly a man who has seen more than his share of suffering.The special effects are hugely impressive despite the fact that they are obviously special effects (the art of invisibility was not achieved very well here). When Imhotep is slowly regenerating, there are scenes showing his body and face that are impressive in their spectacle, but not impressive in not looking animated. As a whole, The Mummy is exactly what you might expect it to be, except that it was released amidst so much excitement and hype that it really should have taken itself more seriously and been more of a thinking film. It would have, under those circumstances, been immensely more respectable and might have joined its predecessor as a movie classic. It is a successful update of the Mummy theme (which has become almost a genre in itself), but there is a lot of fluff in the film that simply doesn't belong.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still great in 2022,"Just wanted to say - this movie still holds up in 2022. Even though this is coming from a 90's baby, with nostalgia and memories from our childhood in mind, this is still such a great
movie.Acting is good, wonderful cast. Both protagonists and antagonists really made you feel specifically about them, sowing no doubt in your mind who is who. But, it does feature some tropes from the era - the music, the ""let's stand still and look at people being devoured"" , the over the top action sequences and Michael Bay style explosions, and many more .But, would definitely recommend this movie to anybody up for a good couple of flashbacks and a generally good watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good simple entertainment.,"At the time of its release, both the public and critics were screaming and shouting that this movie for being to much of an Indiana Jones wannabe. Now that this storm has settled down, I hope that more people will be able to take this movie for what it is; pure simple entertainment.This is certainly a movie that entertains. It's clean and simple and makes no attempt in putting in any realism or much originality for that matter.It's obvious that Stephen Sommers, just like with his other movie ""Van Helsing"", was attempting to revive the old adventure genre from the '30's/'40's. And just as with ""Van Helsing"" was the case, it doesn't do this very successfully. Modern movie-making and '30's/'40's adventurous storytelling just don't go together well anymore. The movie is perhaps more of a spoof than an homage at times. And although I certainly enjoy and admire Stephen Sommers attempts, I just don't think these sort of movies will ever make a large impact, or revive the genre from the old days. But I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more simple big blockbuster movies from Stephen Sommers in the future.The movie is loosely and I mean very loosely based on the 1932 ""The Mummy"", starring Boris Karloff in the title role. The movie mostly chooses its own approach and simply uses the concept of the mummy for an overblown entertaining movie with a simple story.But entertaining this movie surely is. The movie is filled with fun characters, lots of over-the-top action and a perfectly adventurous feeling all over it, due to the movie its settings and traveling elements.The characters are perhaps the foremost reason why the movie works out so entertaining. All of the characters are extremely simple and stereotypical but that works really well for such a movie like this one, that obviously doesn't take itself too serious. On top of that the movie is also really well cast. It was the movie that introduced the world to Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, though his career never really got off the ground. Brendan Fraser shows how well he can handle the comical sequences but he also is convincing as the action hero of the movie, mainly because he has the right looks for it. Rachel Weisz plays a more light and naive kind of role and it actually is hard to believe that she is mostly playing now more demanding roles in movies such as ""Constant Gardener"" and ""The Fountain"". John Hannah is perfect as the more comical sidekick of the movie and also Arnold Vosloo impresses as the villainous mummy. Also the supporting roles of the movie are very entertaining, such as the stereotypical cowboy-type Americans and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, who also provides some comical notes. The characters are also made more entertaining by some fine and fun written dialog.But there isn't much else to the script really. The movie purely is an excuses to show off some new special effects and let the mummy cause all kind of mayhem across Egypt. Yes, its incredibly simple but perhaps also all the more entertaining because of that.The sequences with the movie definitely are the highlights of the movie, as he unleashes all the biblical plagues across Egypt. The special effects are convincingly looking for the mummy and his neat tricks, though it's definitely true that by todays standards the effects are all quite slightly below average.The settings of the movie are nice, though some are obviously fake, and they help to give the movie its adventurous feeling. The movie obviously had an high budget and it shows in its action sequences and special effects. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is also fine and truly uplifts the movie. Jerry Goldsmith has made a couple of epic scores for some not so epic movies.Good simple quality entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Modern Classic!,"This movie is meant to be a classic.  It is so ingenious and good that makes you watch it over and over again!I actually watched this movie 6 times in the theaters, and then I bought the video and I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie.It is about an Egyptian high priest Imhotep, who was caught having an affair with the Pharaoh mistress and consequently was punished with death and a curse.  Then many centuries later, adventurer Rick O'Conell discovers him with Evy, and archeologist, Jonathan, her greed brother, and a group of Americans seeking for fame an glory.This movie is great, the cast is so good, I never heard of any of them before this movie, except for Brendan Fraser who was in the super famous ""George of the Jungle"" movie.  Anyways the performances are vey convincing, Brendan Fraser is great as handsome hero, Rachel Weisz is great as Evy, a clumsy but very intelligent egyptologist, John Hannah delivers the humor in this movie as Jonathan, the good-for-nothing guy who only cares about money, I have to mention Oded Fehr too, he was pretty good as the mysterious and attractive Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Mejais who is in charge to put the mummy back in his grave, and how can I forget the Mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo, who was, without any doubt, the best one in this movie. His performance is so good as the evil and sexy high priest Imhotep, he doesn't make you hate him, he makes you feel sorry for him!  That is what I call ""acting skills"".The plot is good, it's not a cheezy-horror flick or something like that, and the dialogues are awesome too :) Let's not forget the direction, Stephen Sommers does a great job.  And special mention to the music, by Jerry Goldsmith, it was one of the best parts of this movie.You get a lot of ""candy eye"" in this movie, for guys and girls, for guys you get Rachel Weisz and in the beginning of the movie you see the Venezuelan top-model Patricia Velazques as the unfaithful Anck-su-namun; and for girls you get Brendan Fraser, Oded Fehr and of course Arnold Vosloo.Anyways I highly recommend this movie, THIS IS A MUST-SEE. ***** out of *****",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Silly Fun,"Citizen Kane it ain't, but if you're looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn't replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let's face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff's Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo's Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady's perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.Brendan Fraser looks good, has a fabulous voice, and a whole boatload of goofy charm.  Hey!  Call me shallow, but that's pretty much all I'm looking for in a screen idol.  John Hannah was acceptable, if not inspired, as the wastrel brother.  Rachel Weisz is gorgeous, and acquits herself well in the role of ""Heroine in an Adventure Film;""  i.e., she screams and gets rescued a lot.OK, I lie.  The modern ""Heroine in an Adventure Film"" is SPUNKY, screams, and gets rescued a lot.And as to Oded Fehr, who plays the mysterious desert guardian of the mummy's tomb (a role traditionally assayed by Welsh character actors) -- I and the rest of the ladies in my party indicated, through a series of incoherent grunts and some unattractive drooling, a strong desire to see much, much more of him.  And we mean that both literally and figuratively.  Powers that be, please take note.A couple of small caveats:  the bug quotient in this film is much higher than I usually tolerate.  It puts you right off your Milk Duds.  And where in the hell did those camels come from?So if you're in a mood for brainless entertainment, I recommend that you set your intellect on stun, rush to the nearest cineplex, buy the large popcorn (WITH butter), and settle in for a couple of hours of colorful, loud, over-the-top fun.Catmommie",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This movie will blow your mind by its action, romance, adventure and music score. I loved The Mummy because it's one of those roller coaster rides were you just jump on and never let go. The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 mummy which starred Boris Karloff who played imhotep. The Mummy is about an expedition of treasure seeking explorers in the Sahara desert in 1925. They stumble upon an ancient tomb, the hunters without knowing set loose a 3,000 year-old inheritance of terror, which is personified in the vengeful reincarnation of an Egyptian priest who had been sentenced to an infinity as one of the living dead.

"Bit Overlong, But Still The Word Is 'Fun'","It seems like a long time ago when this came out, but I remember it being the first DVD I had ever bought sight unseen, meaning I had never seen the film in the theater. I was pleased. I got what I had hoped for: a fun, special-effects extravaganza.In fact, if you read a number of reviews, you see the word ""fun"" more than anything. That best describes this film.This was an Indiana Jones-Jason And The Argonauts combination adventure story. It's cartoon-like in nature with an absurd swashbuckling hero, outlandish action scenes and the occult theology that filmmakers love so much. (The Mummy has God-like powers, even producing Old Testament plagues.)However, the film isn't all good news. It's too long by about 10-15 minutes and there is simply too much action and too much noise. The film needs more lulls.Brendan Fraser is pretty good as the Indiana Jones figure and Rachel Weisz, a new face at the time, makes a solid impression in her debut.

Rachel Weisz and John Hannah also appears in parts, though the movie is best when Rick starts getting his guns off!!

It's not horror you know - it's just real good family fun.,"The Mummy is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also co-writes the screenplay with John L. Balderston. It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).It's true to say that ""Indiana Jones"" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post ""Indiana Jones"", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. ""The Mummy"" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's ""Indiana Jones"" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Change of Setting!,"There's no doubt the movie business can be an unpredictable affair at times. In 1998 Stephen Sommers wrote and directed a disaster/monster feature with fairly rich comic undertones to it. It was called Deep Rising and it tanked (despite this writer liking it) fairly spectacularly, though it has gone on over the years to achieve a degree of cult status.Now for some writer.directors that commercial failure may have represented the kiss of death. But in this case, not for Stephen Sommers. A year later Universal Pictures almost doubled his budget from Deep Rising and let him go and make what was almost the same sort of film again. Go figure. At any rate their intuition proved to be correct. Sommers remake of The Mummy, turning it from a horror film into a tongue-in-cheek action adventure proved this time to be a commercial master stroke and franchise starter. Sommers and Universal had an international hit on their hands.What changed? Superficially heaps, but intrinsically, not a great deal. Both films deal with monsters, The Mummy less mysteriously. The obvious differences are the settings. Deep Rising is water-bound; largely set on a disaster-afflicted cruise liner amidst a storm tossed ocean. Being set in the burning sands of the Eygptian desert (with Morocco substituting), The Mummy does appear worlds apart.But really Sommers just cleverly tinkers with his Deep Rising template, refines a few odds and ends and voila! ... finds out he has a hit on his hands.The Mummy ramps up the humour quotient and eases back a little on the gore/horror elements of Deep Rising. Kevin J. O'Connor moves from being a comic side kick in DR to being a comic villain in TM. John Hannah, comfortably fits into the comical shoes of Jonathan Carnahan, the new bumbling side kick. Arguably the main reason for the The Mummy's success lies in the lead pairing of Brendon Fraser and Rachel Weisz. They have real onscreen chemistry and Weisz, as airy, but also feisty and smart librarian Evelyn Carnahan, proves she has the comedic talents to match those, we already knew of Fraser. Unlike Deep Rising, where the leads didn't meet up till the second half, Sommers wisely ensures this time that Fraser and Weisz team up early in the film, so we can all more fully enjoy those rom-com sparks flying.About the only character actually keeping a straight face and playing an orthodox but very convincing villain, is South African stage actor Arnold Vosloo who is Imhotep, The Mummy, aided in his role with some well executed CGI. effects.The Mummy is fast-paced from beginning to end, provides plenty of thrills, spills and laughs along the way, along with more than a touch of romance. It's lot of fun, quite charming and never pretentious. But ultimately, it reminded me of the fine movie lines that exist between hits and misses.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fun, fun, fun","Okay, before I begin the review proper, I must warn you that I'm probably going to be using the word 'fun' a lot to describe 'The Mummy.' Because that's all it is – fun. A lot of people liken it to the Indiana Jones movies and I can see where they're coming from. Then again, an equally high proportion of the audience detests how the two movies are likened to each other. No, I'm certainly not saying that The Mummy is anywhere near as good as the Jones trilogy (notice how I'm leaving out the Crystal Skull out of that statement!), but it is similar.The Mummy is one of those 'family fun' kind of movies – an adventure which should most likely be screened on a Saturday afternoon for everyone to cheer along to. Brendan Fraser takes the lead and is at his best when he's acting big and dumb, but, in doing so, he's also completely lovable and easy to root for. Rachel Weisz is his 'love interest' and, apart from being able to read/speak the ancient texts, doesn't do that much for the portrayal of women in cinema, as she spends much of her time in need of rescue (you'll have to watch the sequel if you want to see her kicking some a$$!). John Hannah is her on-screen brother and he's the main 'comic relief' of the film – a part which sometimes goes horribly wrong if it's handled incorrectly. However, fortunately, despite being the coward of the bunch, he's funny enough not to be annoying (and even fires a gun or two near the end if you watch closely).So, our blundering trio of heroes only go and wake up an ancient mummy when they're raiding a tomb in Egypt. And he's not happy. Not only does he want to 'borrow' the bodily parts of those who woke him up, but he also wants to take over the world – typical, huh? The creature itself is actually CGI for the most part. I guess they couldn't get an actor who was decomposing to play the part. However, when he's fully formed, he's played by Arnold Vosloo, who does the job to act menacing (even when he doesn't say a word of English).So, expect gun fights, undead creatures chasing our heroes, the odd car chase and pretty much everything else you'd come to find in a PG action/adventure movie. Yes, nothing here is that new, but when something's handled correctly that doesn't matter. It's still a fun a film that should please everyone. Basically, there are two ways of watching The Mummy – you can either nitpick the whole thing and pull it apart, or you can simply gloss over any of the plot holes and simply enjoy it from what it is – the filmic equivalent of Brendan Fraser himself – big, dumb, silly fun, fun, fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The quintessential late 90s popcorn movie,"Sometimes even movies we enjoy can fall out of our mental queue over the years and become forgotten. And so it was with 'The Mummy' until I spied it in the grab bag of has-beens and never-weres that is the Walmart BluRay bargain bin.Like 'Independence Day' and 'The Mask of Zorro', 'The Mummy' is a prime example of the best popcorn entertainment of the late 90s. Featuring just the right blend of action, humor and romance, and refreshingly agenda-free, it's the perfect lazy day escape.As an additional note, the copy I bought was the ""Ultimate Edition"" BluRay. The special features are anything but, however the picture and sound quality are absolutely first rate.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great fun!,"Brendan Fraser may well have established himself as the John Wayne of his day with his thrilling performance here.No one can take the place of the Duke of course,but Fraser approached his character with just the right amount of swagger,wit,and charm.This take on an often told story has all the charm of the old Saturday matinee's of years gone by,and all the thrills of the Raiders of the Lost Ark series.Excellent casting,with standout performances from everyone, particularly Arnold Vosloo,Fraser,and Oded Fehr.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A poor man's Indiana Jones - but still endlessly entertaining,"The Mummy is a great summer adventure for nonstop thrills and kicks. It has a lot of humour; memorable comedic performances (Brendan Fraser), fantastic settings and surprisingly striking CGI for 1999. There is little technically wrong with this film other than that is clearly borrows heavily from the King of action-adventure, Indiana Jones.What begins as a treasure hunt in the City of the Dead soon turns into a plot that essentially goes like this, as described by Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world."" The good thing is, there is a lot more to it than that, and unlike Indiana Jones, the male hero is not alone in his mission nor does he get all the credit for it. He is joined by the damsel in distress herself Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) who all want a piece of the treasure in the dead city.While the dialogue is typically sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, it is not desperately punchy. It is probably on par with the Indiana Jones trilogy in terms of cheesy lines. But Brendan Fraser delivers these in a way that is so fitting that it does not really matter, to be honest. Fraser truly gets to shine and show us that is indeed best when it comes to comedy.This isn't Citizen Kane, but it's NOT 'brainless' summer fun either. It's just a very good adventure story even if it lacks originality.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As bad as it gets,"I am frustrated. Frustrated that more movies like this will come out of Hollywood and reap in tons of money. It just makes me sad. The basic answer on a negative critique on ""The Mummy"" seems to be: ""Hey, what did you expect? It's a fun movie."" It's not. It's bad filmmaking at it's worst. It's not entertaining - and I was looking for shallow entertainment. It's not funny - the jokes are lame and the scenes that should've been serious are jokes too (which are also lame). The script doesn't even try to present a coherent or consistent plot - it's just a series of badly written, acted and directed scenes, held together by plot holes. Three days before I've seen ""The Mummy"", I started reading William Goldman's ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"" and I think it gives a really good overview of the inner workings of the American film industry. However, ""The Mummy"" told me more about Hollywood filmmaking (and the power of marketing and the average moviegoer) than this wonderful book - and it makes me sad.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A paradigmatic horror show guaranteed to keep audiences amazed and breathless.,"From beneath the depths of Hell, the ultimate symbol of evil is about to be reborn.  Beyond mortality, beyond death, this creature of the undead will rise.  Darkness will fall for all of eternity...and this plague will forever swallow this planet Earth...About two thousand years ago, in the land of Ancient Egypt, a well-respected high priest known as Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) has been a very naughty man. His one-stand with the Pharaoh's mistress may very well cost him his life. After the Pharaoh discovers this illicit, forbidden love affair, Imhotep and the mistress murder the heartless Pharaoh without second thoughts.  As payback though, Imhotep is to suffer the gravest consequences...Imhotep is eventually sentenced to die a most horrifying death.  The Pharaoh's guards have buried him alive inside a tomb, complete with ravaging scarabs and all.  What's even worse is that the guards have placed a disturbing curse upon the buried soul.   Whoever opens the tomb of this ancient evil will awaken the curse that has lied dormant for thousands of ears.  All shall suffer eternal damnation, as the Mummy will release its unstoppable powers upon the lands and onto the cities.   His reign of terror will spread...For twenty centuries, this soul has rested in peace...  Jumping forward to 1925, a bunch of foolish archaeologists, driven by profit and ignoring all admonishments, have decided to open the tomb of the wretched Mummy.  Well, that decision was foolish...  Now, the armies of the dead will inhabit the Earth and evil will take over...  Only Colonel Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his brave team of courageous souls can prvent the Mummy's plans to rule the planet.  Along with an alluring librarian and inspiring archaeologist (Rachel Weisz), her timid brother (John Hannah), and an even more craven sidekick, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), O'Connell and his company of wisecracking Smart Alec folks are mankind's last hope.  This though, happens to be another incident where the good guys are at the wrong place at the right time.  Heaven have mercy on these souls...  Will faith spare human lives, or can the world kiss hope goodbye?THE MUMMY is so much better than I originally anticipated.  The special effects alone will blow you away!  It is unbelievable how the Mummy is able to transform himself from a rotting, disintegrating corpse to a fully developed supernatural being, and even to a raging sandstorm.  Also, those creepy crawly scarabs scare the daylights out of me!  The scarabs literally crawl under people's skins!   Impressive production values, capturing and recreating the ruins of Hamunaptra at its full glory, serve as another highlight for THE MUMMY.Sure, there are also the monstrous zombies, the nightmarish flying locusts, and the fallen skies.  Yes, there is also the requisite damsel-in-distress (and love interest) who captures Imhotep's heart.  The venomous super-villain who must eat the flesh of others in order to survive is a plus as well.  However, director Stephen Sommers (DEEP RISING) transcends beyond cliché material.  He brings to the audience original ideas with a refreshingly cool tone.  He makes sure that there is style within the special effects.  The eye-popping FX in general will keep crowds contented, and then some.It is tough to keep a straight face when watching this movie, but you have to praise Sommers and the cast for letting you have so much fun.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed ridiculous as for some of the sequences.  One scene that had me chuckling throughout was when all the slaves were synchronically chanting ""Imhotep!""  Kevin J. O'Connor finds himself having some of the best one-liners as he may eventually switch allegiances and serve a different master.  Yes, the humor is somewhat gratuitous, granted.  However, in all sincerity, the humor is needed to lighten the film's dark tone.The acting is more second rate.  Arnold Vosloo made a terrific villain and Rachel Weisz lights up the screen with her gorgeous presence.  Fraser and O'Connor are great also.  The rest of the cast is kind of listless though. In spite of that, THE MUMMY is a spectacular spectacle laced with show-stopping special effects and genuine chills.  The music, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith is pulse pounding and excellent.  The orchestration is wonderful during this film's every thread of suspense.Overall, THE MUMMY is one of the best blockbusters of 1999.  Nonstop thrills and surprises galore highlight this enthusiastic, fun-filled entertainment. THE MUMMY has lots of fun and excitement.  The only flaw that prevents this film from being a full fledged four star movie is its occasional lapses in credibility and coherence.  At times, this film is extremely ludicrous, but who cares, its fanatically fun to watch.  Genre fans, take note.Remember, you cannot keep the dead buried forever...RATING: ***1/2 out of ****.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not my cup of tea!,"To be honest, this film is not my cup of tea, but I recognize that it does have some excellent features. Brendan Foster and Rachel Weisz make a great partnership and go a long way in setting the pace and maintaining it at top speed.Also, they somehow or other are able to link together a whole series of scenes composed of farcical nonsense.  And in the labyrinth of passageways where the scenes take place I find myself at a complete loss in understanding just where they are inside the pyramid.  But that does not matter.  There are far more exciting and terrifying things to worry about e.g. the bloodless mummies resurrected and in a fit of rage attack our heroes with wild abandon and the scarab beetles that can enter beneath the skin and burrow around the human body. There is danger at every corner.  The special effects are so well done.  Swords flash in every direction and legs,arms and heads of the mummies are sent flying from their scare-crow figures.  Our hero and heroine escape death by a split second time and time again like the characters in the Saturday afternoon serials. Anything can be done to excess and I feel the fight with the mummies is rather long and a trifle repetitive.  I wonder sometimes if special effects are ousting the actors in cinema today.  This is a mammoth production.  It must have cost a fortune to make. The most exciting episodes for me are the escapes through the corridors with the counterbalanced blocks of stone closing the escape routes. I admire the charismatic Brendan Fraser (so good in George of the Jungle). He handles these crazy parts so well. His co-star Rachel Weisz plays an archeological librarian who unbelievably does translations of Egytian hieroglyphs while on the run. What a gal! In a word, this film is a mad mixture of movie magic.  Kids will love it to the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Fairly Entertaining in a Campy, Goofy Way","This is a fairly entertaining film that seems geared toward giving a fun time and some laughs. It does a pretty good job at creating a campy, goofy adventure tale similar in some ways to Indiana Jones, but it's less serious and more lame. I found it somewhat fun to watch, but at the same time, it just barely stays out of the realm of complete boredom, venturing every once and a while to the very edge of that precipice without quite tumbling in. Thus, it basically does the job, but it's not really that funny, is usually too silly to be really fun, and is hardly the best Brendan Fraser movie. Seeing it once was fine, but I would not bother watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Solid entertainment. The remake starring Cruise is so bad....,"I first saw this in a theater in 1999. Revisted it recently with my kids on a DVD. I am writing the review of this as i was totally upset by the boring n lame Tom cruise's remake. Many compared this film to Indiana Jones n other treasure hunt films. Whatever the similarities, this film is pure fun. It is one of the best movies -- in terms of sheer entertainment. The pacing is good n the visuals top notch considering the era. It has monsters, thrills, humor and daring close calls. The opening sequences of Ancient Egypt are breathtaking as are the shots of new century Cairo. The special effects has fast paced skeletons, sandstorms, beetle hordes, fiery hail bombardments and hungry locusts/tiny monsters. Ther is little to think but plenty to enjoy in this movie. Director Sommer filmed the action in carefully composed widescreen shots, where it's always perfectly clear what's going on. If you're looking for some mindless fun with zero story, romance, good effects n monster fun then you'll probably like this film. The sequel was a decent film. The third starring Jet Li was a total letdown.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Favorite Fraser Franchise,"Director Stephen Sommers' version of the horror classic, The Mummy (1932), has been one of Universal's most successful franchises. It's also because of this that got Stephen Sommers famous. It also made a slew of other celebrities famous as well. And although it does not play like an Indiana Jones film, it pays homage to archaeologists and the magic within old architecture. Not mention this film made two more sequels.Starring in this film is Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy called Imhotep. This is the first film that I witnessed Arnold Vosloo and then later on I realized he also played in two other sequels of Sam Raimi's Darkman (1990) series, which I thought he played really well. Brendan Fraser is not one of my top favorite actors but I do like the way he works in these kinds of films. I enjoyed his performance in Looney Tunes: Back In Action (2003), but I liked him even more in this film. The character of Fraser, Rick O'Connell has serious personality but in a goofy fashion. The rest of the characters in this film act the same way. Rachel Weisz's character, Evelyn can be klutzy at times and so is her nitwit brother Jonathan played by John Hannah.The goofiness is what's good about this movie. The actors know their characters are silly and that makes it funny to watch. The stupidest person of all in this film is Jonathan. Truly, he does not know what he's doing and in the end, he's never satisfied; shows you how grateful he is to be alive (after all he's been through). What also works great is the dialog. So much of it is serious but in such an indirect way that it doesn't come off as serious. I guess this was the idea of Sommers' mummy film. He wanted the audience to enjoy it with some decent action and funny one liners,...and it worked.The Mummy has a mix of multiple genres because how the screenplay is set up. Arnold Vosloo can play a pretty scary mummy; little kids will be terrified by him. The whole undead idea is the horror aspect. As for the silliness, that's the comedy aspect. The action is great in this film too. Most of it using firearms but it does involve an interesting flight sequence and the finale is really fun to watch. Seeing O'Connell fight off a slew of undead Egyptian guards. Bring it on! Or as O'Connell said sarcastically, ""This just keeps getting better and better"". Because 1999 was the time where special effects were really starting to get high- tech, this movie has some really nice visuals. Also the music is great which Jerry Goldsmith composed. I enjoyed this film very much and it really has a good reputation although less than half of critics liked it.Besides having a villain with the same name, this mummy movie is nothing like the original classic from 1932. What makes it different is Stephen Sommers' direction of abandoning the slow droning tone and mostly replacing it with comedy, action and some shades of horror.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great adventure movie...,"Well, there is no doubt about it, the 1999 action adventure movie ""The Mummy"" from writers Stephen Sommers, Lloyd Fonvielle and Kevin Jarre is a classic movie. And it is one that I have returned to a couple of times throughout the years.And so it was again here in 2022, as I opted to sit down and watch the trilogy again. And yeah, the 1999 movie ""The Mummy"" does have that level of contents to the storyline, that it can support multiple viewings without growing old.The storyline is one of high adventure, action, romance and a pinch of comedy. And it works wonderfully, because the movie doesn't have a single dull moment for the 124 minutes that it runs for. So thumbs up to director Stephen Sommers for that accomplishment.The acting performances in ""The Mummy"" are good, and they definitely had a great cast ensemble for the movie, with the likes of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr and Erick Avari on the cast list, to name but the most familiar of faces. The actors and actresses in the movie put on good performances and brought their characters to life on the screen in a great manner.And the character gallery in ""The Mummy"" was good as well, because the characters are relatable and likeable. And I have to say that Beni Gabor (played by Kevin J. O'Connor) is one of the most memorable of villain sidekicks ever seen in a movie.The special effects in ""The Mummy"" actually still hold up for the most parts, even now 23 years later. And the special effects and CGI definitely adds a lot of flavor to ""The Mummy"".If you enjoy Egyptian history, culture and fast-paced adventure movies, then you definitely should sit down to watch the 1999 movie ""The Mummy"". It is well worth the time spent.My rating of ""The Mummy"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film was great.There were no dull spots in this movie. There was no stop to the action and also, some of the scenes were really scary even for an adult like myself.This film reminded me of the awesome Indiana Jones movies from the 1980's.

But it was surpassed a couple of years later by the best film of 2001-The Mummy Returns!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Mummy for Dummies,"In Joseph Boggs' book The Art of Watching Films, Boggs suggests that we should consider the level of ambition of a film in evaluating that film. That is, we shouldn't criticize Sleepless in Seattle for not being Schindler's List. Sleepless in Seattle set out to be a sweet romantic comedy and achieved that goal quite nicely. Stephen Sommers' The Mummy appears to have been spawned with a fairly low level of ambition in mind. The good news(?) is that the director achieved his goal. About the only saving grace of this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.The Mummy is loosely based on the Boris Karloff classic from years gone by. Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, a soldier of fortune, who knows the way to a famous lost city in Egypt. Rachel Wiesz plays Evelyn, a librarian and would-be archaeologist who joins forces with O'Connell and a few other cliches to find the city and uncover hidden treasures. In trying to uncover the treasure they unleash a curse (guess who) and yotta yotta yotta . . .One of the few bright spots in the film is John Hannah in a supporting role as Evelyn's brother. Hannah's previous films include Four Weddings and a Funeral and Sliding Doors. His part is more slapstick sidekick here but he carries it off quite nicely. There are some excellent special effects, but I am frankly more than a little weary of films that put special effects where the plot is supposed to be. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do okay in their roles, but their roles are really not worth much effort.In the end, The Mummy looks like the offspring of a misbegotten marriage between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ghostbusters. Unfortunately, it's not as funny as the latter, nor as exciting as the former, and ends up being a ""C minus"" grade B film. There are a few scenes that make it inadvisable for kids under thirteen. The rest of the scenes make the film inadvisable for anyone with an IQ greater than that of the average four year-old. Next time out writer-director Sommers would do well to set his sights just a little bit higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Lot of Sand,"Wow, 250 people have commented on this movie already. What can I say to add to their many comments. I guess first of all, ""Who is this mummy, and why has he been granted so much power?"" For a guy who is a common adulterer, how has he accumulated enough points to get to be such a big shot. Why does he look like a masking tape version of the morphing creature in Terminator II. Why are there cowboys in this movie? Why does Brendan Fraser look like George of the Jungle after being in prison for two years. How does he keep coming back after being hit with a stick in the kidneys. Why does everyone know where the mummy is and where that gold book is. How do they commute from Cairo back and forth to the secret city (is that the one with the Casino out front)? Ooh! The secret city. What a secret. Why didn't someone dig this stuff up about 200 years ago. Oh, that's right, there was a map, wasn't there, but the cowboys have the map too. Where did they get that. There must be two maps. Then. of course, there is the mummy's mouth. Do you remember anything about mummy's having large mouths. Why does everyone who isn't alive have a large mouth? Why did they put the princess's body parts in the jars. What would have happened if someone had just blown away a couple of those jars. Where did that guy get the job guarding the secret city, and why is he so lousy at it? Why are those bugs there? What do they eat when they're just waiting around for tourists to show up at the secret city. How do you kill the dead--and do you really want to? Who is the mummy scared of--is it those same guys that came up and got the bad guys in ""Ghost?"" Why does Brendan Frazier get a couple of years in prison for killing about 600 Egyptians. I don't know--I have to say that if I watched this and never asked myself any questions, it's just silly enough to entertain--my son liked it and I respect his sense of joy. There are certainly a lot of things jumping out and hands touching shoulders during tense scenes. I know this whole thing is tongue in cheek and is supposed to mimic the 1940's B movies, but with a little more imagination it could have done this and been a pretty cool movie!

Raiders of the Lost Mummy,"Since its beginnings, Universal's Mummy franchise, like the resurrected corpse in this one, has often found vitality in sucking the life force from other films. The 1932 ""Mummy"" starring Boris Karloff did so by reusing the plot and many of the details from the 1931 ""Dracula."" The 1940s Kharis series adopted the aesthetics of serials and B-picture adventures. Distributed by Universal, Hammer studios reworked these prior Mummy movies in its pastiche of 1959. The latest version of 2017 tried to imitate comic-book superhero movies. And, this ""Mummy"" of 1999 went full circle by borrowing, as plenty of others have pointed out, from the Indian Jones franchise, which in turn the Kharis series in particular has been credited as an influence on, along with other classic adventure films. Parts of the prior Universal mummy movies are also reworked here, though, and the 1999 version put a new twist on things with CGI--well before the 2017 Dark Universe debacle did likewise.Besides adopting and reworking the most popular aspects of Ancient Egyptian history and myth--the Book of the Dead, a hidden Valley of the Kings, the curse of King Tut's tomb and Old Testament stories of Jewish slaves and plagues--the basic story here is taken from the earlier ""Mummies,"" with treasure hunters searching for a lost Ancient Egyptian tomb, unleashing a curse, and the Mummy seeking a living female vessel to restore life to his ancient forbidden love, a princess. This Mummy has the same name as Karloff's, taken from the historical pyramid architect, Imhotep, and both characters don't like to be touched, which they explain is ""a silly Eastern superstition."" There's an Egyptologist curator who secretly guards against the discovery of the tomb like in ""The Mummy's Hand"" (1940), including by partially destroying evidence of its location--pottery in the original and a map here. The cutting off the tongue business, I think, is from the 1959 Hammer version. And there's an ancient flashback scene, which is placed at the beginning here, which isn't as interesting as the self-reflexive pool visions in the 1932 film, which two Kharis pictures later cannibalized.The 1932 ""Mummy,"" which is otherwise the best of the bunch, suffers from creaky sound, deathly-slow pacing and stiff acting. This ""Mummy"" solves that problem by adopting the mix of action and comic relief from the Indiana Jones movies. Beyond that, it also replaces ""Bugs, I hate bugs"" for Indiana's fear of snakes; the assortment of booby traps and secret passages; and the Biblical-level revenge upon those who trespass. At the least, taking the Indian Jones formula and infusing its classic monster story with CGI alleviates any problems with dullness, movement and pacing. As a horror film, however, the repetitive gaping mouth thing is more yawn-inducing than frightening. It could've done without the silly cat business, too.Despite its flaws, one can only wish that Universal's recent attempts at launching the Dark Universe, with its superhero action-movie antics in ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and the 2017 ""Mummy,"" had someone as competent as Stephen Sommers at the helm.

Only for the special effects,"I didn't like any piece of this movie that wasn't added by computers. Seriously, the acting was bad, the plot was corny and overall I found myself laughing at some of the supposedly serious moments. The special effects were fantastic, though!  I mean, I won't tell you what they involve, but they are amazing!  I was absolutely amazed by some of the things they did.  Special effects usually can do two things: add to the story (Forrest Gump), subtract from the story.  In this movie, however, they are the story.  There is no other reason to watch this movie, in my mind. The only neat part of the movie that wasn't a special effect was in the last scene of the movie, something sparkles, adding a nice little smile to the end of the movie.  Other than that, I think my dog could have written this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a classic!,"The Mummy (1999) The Mummy (1999) is an action adventure movie directed by Stephen Sommers. Even though The Mummy follows a typical plot like many other action adventure movies, it has something different that appeals to audiences. Based on Egyptian myth, this movie portrays walking mummies, unstoppable Egyptian curses, and mysterious Egypt's historical sites with wonderful computer graphics and sophisticated special effects. The movie begins in ancient Egypt. When high priest called Imhotep (Amold Vosloo) killed pharaoh Seti the first because of his relationship with the pharaoh's mistress. When the pharaoh's bodyguard caught Imhotep, they mummified him alive with a desperate curse and buried him under the city of the dead. 3000 years later in 1923, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), who works at Cairo library as a librarian, is interested in an ancient Egyptian magical book of resurrection. To find the book, she hires Rick (Brenden Fraser), who is an American soldier, and they take a trip together through the Sahara desert. At the end of the trip, they finally find and read the book. They don't know what will happen after reading the book. They just release Imhotep from the cruel curse. In the movie, almost every action scene, such as gunfights and chase scenes, are filmed using computer graphics and special effects. It is because Imhotep is a perfect source of computer graphic and special effects since he is an undead mummy and has supernatural abilities. It's truly amazing that Imhotep completes his body as he eats men alive and makes gigantic sand storm in the middle of the desert. Moreover, the mysterious Egyptian historical site, where the action scenes are filmed, makes The Mummy even more thrilling. There are many kinds of deadly traps in the set, such as falling ceiling, pressurized acid, and man eating beetles, so audience can enjoy the thrill of near misses. The director of The Mummy effectively combined Egyptian myth with computer graphics and special effects. That's why he can successfully create the strongest mummy in the movie and he was able to make this movie special compared to other movies. This movie will please anyone who is sick of watching ordinary action movies.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Raiders of the lost sarcophagus.,"Of all of Univeral's classic monster movies, I find those featuring 'The Mummy' the least enjoyable, largely because a shuffling corpse wrapped from head to toe in bandages moves so slowly (how hard can it be to keep a few steps ahead?). Thankfully, Stephen Sommers' 1999 mummy movie is less creaky old horror, and more blockbuster action and adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones, with a supernatural creature that possesses incredible powers.Brendan Fraser plays ex-legionnaire Rick O'Connell, who leads brother and sister archaeologists Evelyn and Jonathan Carnahan (Rachel Weisz and John Hannah) to Hamunaptra, the ancient Egyptian city of the dead, where they accidentally awaken evil in the form of high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), who seeks to revive his long-lost love using Evelyn as a sacrifice.Sommers keeps things moving along at a rollicking pace, with plenty of entertaining action set-pieces. The cast is excellent, with Fraser making for a dashing hero, Weisz gorgeous as his eventual love interest, Hannah providing comic relief, and Vosloo making for a fine villain when Imhotep finally regenerates.Unfortunately, the film does rely rather too heavily on CGI effects that haven't aged very well: what was cutting edge in 1999 doesn't look great by today's standards, with the mummy in particular appearing laughable rather than scary. I'm sure the same could be said of some of the special effects in Raiders, but old-school techniques have a certain charm about them, whereas ropey digital trickery doesn't -- it just looks like something out of a bad SyFy movie.Thankfully, Sommers ensures that there's more than enough good stuff in the film to make up for the unconvincing decay badly mapped onto Vosloo's face, the rubbish swarms of scarab beetles, and the naff sandstorms. It would be nice to think that Fraser may get back in shape some day soon and return for another mummy movie, especially now that computer effects have vastly improved -- it couldn't do any worse than the recent Tom Cruise turkey (or be any worse than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, for that matter).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Last Great Adventure Film,"Don't get me wrong, we have had lots of great movies since '99, but I really feel that this is the last one where it was just 10 for 10 great. And it was a great way to end the 90's, which I still believe to be one of the best movie decades; we knew how to make great movies and we knew how to make great trailers for those great movies--not just rapidly flashing scenes with drums and clashing and building violins, but REAL trailers edited to perfection with great music.""The Mummy"" just packs it all; from Adventure to Horror to Fantasy to Drama to Comedy, and in my humble opinion, it succeeds superbly in all five genres. It is just such a FUN movie! The sites (and sights), the sound design, the CGI (while I won't say it's perfect), and, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of a score which can take Alan Silvestri's for ""The Mummy Returns"" to the cleaners any day of the week.While ""The Mummy"" was a blockbuster, it is sadly one of those unappreciated movies. Shortly after its release is when movies began to take a turn for the worse and become darker, and for what ever crackbutt reason, darker is what the American Audience wants. Audiences just want movies where everyone dies (a lot of the time including the hero(es)), the music is heavily synthesized, and the plot is simplistic.""The Mummy"" is an epic adventure from beginning to end. And I can only hope that our movies return to this movie-type some day soon. While I do like ""The Mummy Returns"", it was a little too silly for me. And ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""? No comment. The first one just captures the fun-ness that movies are SUPPOSED to be; a movie that grabs you out of your world so you almost feel as if you're IN the movie (he said, at the risk of sounding either cheezy or loony), very much in the tradition of ""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel.It's just truly a classic, and will hopefully remain so long enough to see a day when it is appreciated again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"My Favorite Movie, Shamelessly","Amidst all my favorite movie dramas and Shakespearean plays, somehow, an entertainment-driving blockbuster from 1999 became my favorite movie. I could watch it a thousand times over (which, I garuntee you, I have) and still not tire of it.A sit-back-and-enjoy-the-ride kind of film, don't do the mindless thing as other reviewers here have and compare it to THE GODFATHER or GONE WITH THE WIND. As I've had to remind several people--IT'S MADE TO BE ENJOYED!Definitely comparable to the INDIANA JONES movies (yet exceeding them immensely), I'd recommend it to anyone who loves action, adventure, humor, romance, and/or Ancient Egypt!

Quatermain is back!,"Hey yo, a genre thought dead has returned to the kind of glory it had when Indiana Jones and Quatermain were big - the fantasy adventure genre!Glory of course is a relative term - this movie is all in all just plain silly and has no emotionally deep moment at all - but the film does not fail to entertain in its own very simple approach: Mummy bad, kill mummy!When I was a kid, I liked movies like this. As an adult who still does have fun watching the occasional James Bond movie, I think the Mummy is too much of everything: Too many too simple cliches, too many too one-dimensional characters and too many too foreseeable slapstick gags. Indiana Jones is still in a league of its own, and the Mummy may have been a huge surprise success in theaters, but will be forgotten very quickly.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
great mummy movie,"OK, hands down this movie is just awesome...Probably the best mummy movie.Brendan Fraser as the gung-ho Rick O'Connel is really funny and one of the characters that just makes this movie so great. John Hannah as Jonothan is good comic relief. one of my favourite seens with jonothan is when he is pretending to be one of the mindless followers of Imhotep.basically Rachel Weisz' character wakes up a mummy, Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo (who i must say did quite a convincing job and i enjoyed his performance) and Imhotep sets plagues onto the land of Egypt and wants to resurrect his lost love.some people may find this movie has some scary parts in it, but its also a lighthearted movie in having comedy in it as well. you could say this is a horromedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining viewing for anyone looking for pure entertainment,"In Ancient Egypt the Pharaoh Seti I is murdered by his mistress, Anck-su-Namun, and her lover, Imhotep. For his part in the crime Imhotep is sentenced to be ""mummified alive"". (It is not explained exactly how this is carried out, but as the vital organs were always removed as a necessary initial step in the mummification process, keeping the subject alive throughout must have been quite tricky).Fast-forward to the 1920s. Rick O'Connell, an American serving with the French Foreign Legion, and Evelyn Carnahan, a half-British half-Egyptian librarian and expert Egyptologist, are on a quest to find the lost city of Hamunaptra. (Rick appears to be serving with the Legion in Egypt itself, even though in the 1920s the country was under British rule. The nearest French troops would have been in Syria). Unfortunately, they inadvertently disturb the corpse of Imhotep, which proves to be a mistake. Apparently, reanimating someone who has been mummified alive can have all sorts of dire consequences for the world, such as unleashing the Ten Plagues of Egypt. Rick and Evelyn, together with her inept and cowardly brother Jonathan, have to try and undo the harm they have unwittingly caused. In this task they have the assistance of the Medji, a tribe of desert nomads descended from the bodyguards of the murdered Pharaoh, who have for three millennia acted as the guardians of the lost city.As one might guess from the above synopsis, this is not a serious or realistic film. It is an adventure story with supernatural elements in the tradition of Rider Haggard's ""She"", and obviously influenced by Spielberg's Indiana Jones films, themselves influenced by the old Saturday morning serials. It was to be followed two years later by a sequel, ""The Mummy Returns"", which charts the adventures of Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan ten years later. (By 1935 Rick and Evelyn are married and have a young son, Alex).The earlier film's main claim to fame is that it made a big international star of the lovely Rachel Weisz. Prior to 1999, apart from the moderately good but unremarkable American thriller ""Chain Reaction"", she was best-known as the star of British art-house movies. ""The Mummy"" established her as a Hollywood name. Perhaps this change in her status influenced the way she appears in the two films. In ""The Mummy"" Evelyn is portrayed as intelligent but rather dowdy, hiding her good looks behind thick spectacles, and clumsy. (In one memorable scene she manages to demolish an entire library). Given that ten years are supposed to pass between ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", she should by the time of the later film have matured into a respectable matron in her late thirties. Instead, she is played as a sexy vamp, especially in her duel with Patricia Velazquez, and actually looks younger rather than ten years older. British art-house actresses might look dowdy, but not Hollywood superstars.""The Mummy"" is perhaps overlong and the pace sometimes flags, especially during the first half. (""The Mummy Returns"", which has an even more incredible and convoluted plot, manages to keep the interest rather better). There is, of course, nothing of any deep significance about it, but it does make for entertaining viewing for anyone in the mood for pure entertainment. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun and campy adventure film,"The Mummy, directed by Stephen Sommers, and starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, is a fun, now almost classic adventure film. This film heavily lays on the Indiana Jones style - with traps, treasure, tomb raiding and a good wallop of humour to go along with it. All of these things make for an overall enjoyable film, all things considered. The film follows Fraser as Rick O'Connell, roguish mercenary for hire, as he works with an expedition from an Egyptian museum. The expedition unleashes an ancient evil, that they then must survive, as a reanimated mummy seeks to achieve invulnerability and control Egypt!To start, I think this film is quite fun. Suitably hammy performances abound, with both Fraser and Weisz, as well as supporting actor John Hannah, bringing the camp. The premise of this movie is suitably campy - with mummies, ghosts and flesh eating scarabs abounding. Even so, these elements bring a level of enjoyment that is well suited to this type of film. The Mummy has become a good example of a camp film that is still quite a fun experience.To be sure, this film has its downsides. The CGI and animation have not aged well, showing the weakness of this type of visual presentation. Practical effects would have added some longevity to this film, and potentially brought it forward as a cult classic. There are some particularly eye rolling films that were horrifying to see in the 90's, but have not kept that particular feeling alive, to the detriment of the film. The acting in the film, while campy, can also be a bit cringey, especially from the Mummy itself, and many of the supporting characters. Some more believability, or going the other way, skilled camp, would have added some charm. Some side characters (notably the British pilot) are shallow and add absolutely nothing to the film.These all detract from what could have been a classic of cult cinema. Big box at its release, this film is none-the-less blowing its way into the background of film history, and while it is still fun, it is certainly not overly memorable. A film I enjoy watching, but with some issues.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most non-stop action horror experience that you won't want to miss!,"Before I begin my opinion on this flick, I would like to say that I never watched the original but I heard that lots of people love it and despised the sequels that preceded it. So, when I rented this on a VHS copy from a library, I thought, ""This may not be so bad."" and watched it to see if it would catch my very interest. To my surprise, it did and I was really enthralled by it. Sure, it isn't a masterpiece, but for what it is, I really enjoy it. So, why am I giving this a 9/10? Well, before I can get to the redeeming qualities, I would like to point out that this movie lacked some character curve with resulted in all of the characters completely undeveloped.Flaw aside, everything turned out brilliant. The story may not be the same plot from the original, but it has a nice ""Indiana Jones in Egypt"" concept and it works perfectly here and it has some gripping action sequences helped by some great special effects from the Industrial Light & Magic company.The direction from Stephen Sommers is great and did a decent job at creating a mood of suspense and atmosphere. The acting is also great. Brendan Fraser is great as Rick O Connell and his chemistry with Evelyn, not to mention their romance, was well thought out. Oded Fehr, and several cast members like John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor did great with their roles, but Arnold Vosloo steals the show for portraying the terrifying Imotep brilliant due to his dark and scary presence. The strongest aspects, however, goes to it's brilliant cinematography, it's Egyptian and atmospheric music score from the late Jerry Goldsmith and it's beautiful Egyptian scenery that gives the movie both scope and an epic sweep.Overall, The Mummy isn't a masterpiece, but it's definitely an example of a movie that is worth-watching to those who still love it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Wanna-be Indiana Jones, but not....","I admit, my expectations for this movie weren't all that high. It still sunk beneath them. The creators of this movie seemed like they wanted to fill the Indiana Jones-less void with this special effects driven movie. It doesn't come close to the cinematic masterpieces of the Indy movies. The movie is so cliched, it's sickening. There are some honestly funny moments. Brendan Fraser delivers his constant one-liners with great, if not predictable, timing. He was the best part of the movie (other than the special effects, of course). He was a delightful distraction from the hokieness that is this movie. I'll admit there were a few suspenseful moments, and some of the action scenes were great, but overall ""The Mummy"" lacks in any real cinematic quality.

A Keeper,"Its what a film of this kind should be about but it was well into the first hour I realised it was a comedy! The scene in the library where all the shelves fall like a stack of dominoes was priceless-amazing what trouble they go to just for a few minutes of nonsense. You had what might be called the serious entry into the story-the events of ancient Egypt where they buried people alive and went in for extreme punishments for stuff like adultery. I enjoyed watching the bugs thrown into the coffin where the adulterer had been wrapped up as a mummy and this is one of the cornerstones of horror-burying alive. The special effects were a case of no expense spared for a movie which was not ruined by foul language when there would have been cause for it with all that mayhem.

The effects are great, but then aren't they always in such cgi-tastic movies?Here in the UK, the Indiana Jones trilogy was screened about a month previous, and with the memory of those still fresh in my mind (I hadn't seen them for a good while) this didn't match up in the action/comedy adventure category.Still - it's worth a watch if you want something light.

Popcorn fun-- 1999's version of 'Indiana Jones',"If you're looking for a deep, insightful drama into the rich history of Egypt then look elsewhere because this is not for you. If you just want to see a film full of fun, adventure and a dash of romance all set in an exotic location then 'The Mummy' is the answer.The story is set in 1924 Egypt where our hero is gregarious American Rick O'Connell, who is hired to take geeky English archaeologist Evey Carnahan and her wimpy brother Jonathan to a hidden tomb where they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a wrathful mummy who is intent on destroying the world. As the trio struggle to send Imhotep back to his grave, they are joined by Ardeth Bey, a member of the sacred Madjai entrusted to ensure the mummy never escapes.In much the same thread of a Nineties version of 'Indiana Jones', 'The Mummy' is has the usual formula of brave heroes and treacherous or cowardly antagonists. Brendan Fraser is very likable as the wise-cracking, reluctant hero O'Connell; I admit I despaired of him after seeing 'George of the Jungle' but he redeemed himself here showing he is capable of delivering comedy without the stupid faces and making a twit of himself. Rachel Weisz's Evey walked a careful line between being a bookish English woman without delving into being stereotypical view of the English. And John Hannah was hilarious as Jonathan with Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay providing the females of the audience with something nice to look at! But it is Kevin O'Connor as the traitorous Beni who steals the limelight with some of the best lines of the film.'The Mummy' is a typical example of a Hollywood action film, full of thrills, humour, stunts and a scare or two. It's a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, especially on a cold night when you want to imagine yourself in a sunnier climate. Great fun!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Already a classic, or even cult, representative of adventure film genre","When I was a teen, I used to see it a couple of times on TV. The movie had certainly made an impression on me, and wasn't the type I would forget about, meaning that the picture's atmosphere made by sound, visual effects, actors, and so further, was indeed authentic.And now rewatching it as an adult with a package of thousands of movies experience from various decades, I may certainly say, that the impression this movie made long time ago was totally justified.Indeed awesome sound effects, no surprise the film was nominated for Oscar in this category. Visual effects are of a good quality for it's time (however, not impressive). The story is also has nothing impressive behind it, nevertheless it surely can't be called boring.But the main merit of the movie are no doubt the characters. Each character, even the most minor one whose part takes only a few minutes of pictures time, has a bright personal features and is memorable.Occasional situational jokes are one of the main reasons for this, they are the both the causes of a smile on your face and of the characters' personality exposition.Brendan Fraser was a perfect choice for the main character; his acting just perfectly fits throughout the whole picture. His comic part was not of the irritating kind of simply making funny faces, and at the thrilling and action moments he also did his best.He deserves all of the credit, and the film definitely wouldn't be itself without him.Hence, if you are a fun of adventure films (especially with an easy comic features) you are no doubt recommended to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Throwback to Formula Action Flicks,"This film was back in theatres recently for an anniversary showing. I remember when I originally saw it in 1999 when it opened, and enjoyed the tone and period setting. I'm sure it was more than a subtle nod by the filmmakers to the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. I also remember the CGI effects being a selling point. Indeed there are some effects shots that were probably breakthrough for the time. Watching it again in 2024, I felt it did not age as well over time as I thought it would.A big hit when it was originally released, this was one the first roles for Brendan Fraser as an action hero. However, he didn't quite have the acting range that others might possess for such a role. For instance, Rachel Weisz, her character was quite plucky and more engaging. Same for the comic spoil Kevin J O'Connor. His facial expressions made the audience smile almost everytime he was on screen. The other main character, played by John Hannah, had a somewhat thin role as Weisz's sister. All in all, there are dozens of characters in this tale of old pharaohs and curses. But yet it was easy to keep track of who's who and what is going on.So on the one hand, you have a fun adventure film packed with action and effects, but on the other hand you have a relatively thin story that keeps the plot uncomplicated. You would almost think that this film was more geared for kids, but there is quite a bit violence, with a pretty hefty body count, albeit bloodless. That probably was the one element of this film that I had forgotten that didn't seem to age well for me. Fraser and the other groups seeking buried treasure in the desert are constantly slaughtering dozens of other people, of course with no reprisal.How would this film do if released today? The effects for the most part were passable. The pacing and constant action kept the film engaging. For me, I was impressed with the sound mix, with a strong music bed provided by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith. One thing that might have been uncommon back in the 90s was the way the main characters were introduced. The script adroitly introduces them amidst an action scene, helping to define their characters by the circumstances. Only later in the first act do we get a more formal introduction to them.Ultimately, this film gives off the same old movie vibe like the Indy Jones franchise. A simple story with obvious good guys and bad guys, romance, and lots of physical interaction.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic adventure,"The Mummy is a classic that does not get the respect it deserves. It is the epicenter of the adventure drama comparable to that of Indiana Jones. Brendan Fraser in his prime is a dream and as much as I'd like to say that this is a ""find the treasure get the girl"" film, our lead actress is so independent in her drive. Jonathan is fun, there is a lot of friendly banter and the plot revolving around the mummy is well done. The temple is like Indiana Jones with just the right amount of fantasy vs. ancient Egypt. I is pretty surface level but a classic nonetheless. Gotta see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
THE MUMMY (DIDIER BECU),"Well, we're living in an age in where old movies are remade with a bigger budget and somewhere that can work but most of the times it's just an excuse for having some special effects and really, from the moment they are too many it gets started to bore you a bit not? Some things are excellent like those crazy scarabees (insects that crawl under the skin) but other scenes are just a bit over the top (the scene in where the mummy evokes a dusttornado). The crazy thing is that this movie balances between good adventure (the Indiana Jonesstyle) and drowning into special effects (the Phantom Menace) plus the acting is really beneath every standard (Brendan Fraser just sucks and Rachel Weisz...well I am not even going to start searching for words, just bad) but all by all a movie you can watch as it is just too professionally made to let you fall asleep.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Looks like a two hours demo of Tomb Raider mixed with Prince of Persiah,"I don't understand all those good reviews. The Mummy is nothing but a poor Indiana Jones-like movie with bad story, poor acting, and awful videogame aesthetic. There is nothing in this movie that has not alteady been seen.

Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Haemunaptra,"This does borrow heavily from the Indiana Jones formula but the characters are not only likeable but memorable and the one liners are by far the best I've heard in years. Rick, Benney, Johnathan and even the chick Evelyn are all a scream and pleasure to watch follow this one through. It is hugely toungue in cheek, I believe that this is what is effecting alot of opinion around here, everyone, it does not take it's self anywhere near seriously. ""Kill the bad guy, rescue the damsel in distress, save the world"" that sums it up perfectly. The action is a delight, the interactions of everybody, it is one huge pleasure feast, they have left behind all the corny fright stuff of the classics and made this a special effects and humour driven rollercoaster.The add for the sequel looks like they may have left behind what was best about this one, it seems to be more serious and paced action stuff but so did the add for this original. This is one of the greatest adventure flicks ever made, do yourself a favour and see it. 10/10 for its perfection.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
B-Movie script + A-Movie FX = GREAT MOVIE!,"""The Mummy"" is great! Sommers took bits and pieces from all the classic monster movies (and some bits from more recent films,) mixed it in with a dash of Indiana Jones and turned out a movie that is just plain FUN. It's not a groundbreaking movie and it won't unseat ""Citizen Kane,"" but it sure as heck unseats 90% of the monster movies Hollywood has ever turned out. It's been so long since Universal did something of this caliber that I wanted to cheer throughout the movie. Fraser was great as O'Connell, a hero that felt more like Han Solo than anything else, and really proved his diversity as a actor. Likewise, Rachel Weiz had an incredibly cute ""bookish"" quality about her that made her absolutely PERFECT. She's that small-town librarian that doesn't realize how desirable she is and, while her and Fraser's story runs very predictably, since this is basically a resurrection of the classic monster movie, you shouldn't have a problem with it.  Go in, don't be afraid to laugh, don't be afraid to scream, just be prepared for a thrill ride that is well worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"The Mummy's Appeal, Unraveled","No, it's not Raiders of the Lost Ark, and no way, Boris Karloff is not to be found anywhere, but high adventure and winking good humor await in the swirling sands of an Egyptian desert in The Mummy.Brendan Fraser is American adventurer ""Rick O'Connell,"" a two- pistoled, high booted dude who knows where something big is buried.Rachel Weisz is ""Evelyn,"" a 1920s British Egyptologist who strikes a treasure hunting deal with Rick and promptly starts building some serious romantic chemistry with him in the classic push-pull, I despise you, I must have you vein.The buried 'something big' is the property of ""Imhotep,"" Arnold Vosloo's long dead (but not really) high priest of ancient Egyptian myth and magic. Imhotep is more of a plague, pox, locust, scorpion, sandstorm type of guy, someone for whom the kittenish tete-a-tetes between Rick and Evelyn hold no charm.Oded Fehr and John Hannah come on screen in strong supporting performances to help Rick and Evelyn avoid Imhotep's wrath.The entirety of the film has an old-timey Saturday matinée feel to it, and although it doesn't rise to the level of a blockbuster summer feature, you could describe it to a novice as perhaps the best B movie of cinema's modern era.Much of the film's core appeal goes back to the spirited acting Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz supply, and to their significant chemistry together. Although romance must take a back seat to danger in an archaeology adventure flick, it bears noting that their chemistry as a couple is decidedly more compelling than the Indy and Marian pairing in ""Raiders."" As Raiders is the superior film, that is saying an awful lot about The Mummy's likability quotient, which is high.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good family film.,"In this film, placed in the twenties, an American with a mysterious past will help a British librarian in love with Ancient Egypt to explore an Egyptian ruin, but they end up waking up a mummy that threaten to destroy the world. Few people know that this film is the remake of a classic horror film of 1932, with Boris Karloff in the role of the mummy. The film is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also wrote the script along with Lloyd Fonvielle. It has the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo.The mummies and their curses are part of movie horror paraphernalia since the dawn of cinema, but were eventually pushed aside for decades. This film, though not of terror but of adventure, made a redemption of these elements and brought again the mummies to the cinema. And there are hundreds of them. The film is excellent, it's very fun, has no dead moments and makes an intelligent use of the mysteries of Egyptian civilization to thicken the suspense in the plot, that is lightened by several moments of humor. The performance of the cast was also very good and the soundtrack, although not particularly surprising or memorable, do very well her role. The special effects and makeup deserves a special positive mention, as well as computerization and digital resources, because they knew perfectly how to enrich the film without dominating the attentions.This film is funny, smart without becoming inaccessible to the general public, and has suspense and some strong scenes, without being too strong for kids. So, it's a great family film, suitable for almost all ages and to see in almost any situation.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Action Humor And Horror,"The Mummy can be best summarized in the way Brendan Fraser's character does near the end of the film, ""rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy and save the world"". This movie is like no other mummy film made before, setting aside the classic horror construct for an action and humor packed romp(which only on occasion feels a little too silly) in the mold of Indiana Jones. Brendan Fraser is the right sort of charming action-hero for the role and the rest of the cast from Rachel Weisz down to John Hannah, Kevin O'Connor and even the more minor characters all add some amusement or appeal to the movie. However, while it's mainly tongue in cheek and doesn't take itself too seriously the movie still has its moments of horror which also work well and provides the perfect balance to the film.The Mummy is an energetic ride that combines many different elements for a movie that can simply be described simply as fun entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True cinematic entertainment!,"The Mummy is without a doubt absolutely everything that embodies the term 'Hollywood'What we have here is a slick, fast paced, funny and action packed film full of mystique and wonder.To start with the film looks amazingly lush with it's golden hue running throughout. Everything is spot on from the lighting to the sets right down to the last dusty detail. The CGI may not be as high resolution as today's standards but it still looks absolutely tremendous and really suits the tone of the film.The plot is a pretty obvious homage to the Indiana Jones series but it not once falls foul of plagiarism and instead takes the idea and expands on it so much as to make it truly it's own film. Fraser is great as the Indy type adventurer and paired with the stunning Rachel Weiss the pair have a great on screen chemistry that's nicely bounced off of John Hannah and Omid Djalili's comic characters.Writer/director Steven Somers manages to give the characters some genuinely snappy and funny dialogue and the action comes in boatloads but is never gruesome, gratuitous or falls back on gore which is actually a very hard thing to do especially in these days of de- sensitivity when everything has to be harsher.I simply can't praise this film enough, it's just pure cinematic entertainment full of thrills, spills, romance and visuals. It's strange that The Mummy actually comes off as a much better film of the genre than Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull since the latter series basically created the genre.One of the rare treats to come from a director and team who really believe in what they are doing, and it shows!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nostalgic Adventure That Stands the Test of Time,"I recently revisited The Mummy (1999) in theaters to celebrate its 25th anniversary. It had been years since I last watched it; as a child, it was frequently on TV, but my tastes were different back then. I was curious to see if the film had aged well, and to my delight, it has. The Mummy remains an enjoyable adventure film, the kind that isn't made much these days-simple, linear, yet thoroughly entertaining.The performances, while a bit overacted, still hold up well, adding to the film's charm. The special effects are impressive, especially considering it was made in 1999, and they contribute significantly to the film's enduring appeal. Watching it again as an adult, I found that the movie captures a certain sense of adventure that feels nostalgic yet timeless. The Mummy is a testament to a bygone era of filmmaking, and it's just as fun now as it was then.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An action-packed Mummy-fest with comedy undertones,"I must have seen The Mummy at least half a dozen times, but it loses none of its magic. Probably the best thing about The Mummy are the stunning visual effects. From The City of Thebes to Imhotep's face, the visuals are terrific. Another particuarly interesting thing about The Mummy that sets it apart from other samey films is the fact that the producers have done their homework. All the facts about Ancient Egypt are correct,and this made me enjoy it even more. The actors are fabulous, especially Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah. Most of my friends have seen it, who all thought it was ""Fab!"", and my dad was finally convinced to buy the DVD earlier this month,and it is probably one of the best titles to purchase on DVD. I now conclude that The Mummy is a must see for all film buffs, comedy fans,and people who just want a decent movie to watch. I have only one complaint, and that is;please make more Mummy sequels other than The Mummy Returns!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

As this flick cannot be rated as I would truly like to rate it, it's definitely well deserved to sit around the 6.5 to 7 out of 10 mark respectably. To finish off this review I think its fair to say Brendan Frazier, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah get the job done.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I wasn't looking for horror (that's not my favorite genre) but it kept me glued to my seat. It's got Egypt, it's got action, it's got adventure, some funnies, and lots of Indiana Jones-styled thrills. And while Brendan Fraser may not have been my first choice for the main role, I think he succeeded. Still, many of my friends and acquaintances couldn't stand this film because of him, but this is one of my favorite underrated films. This and its sequel.

A Surprisingly Decent Reboot / Remake,"An American (Brendan Fraser) serving in the French Foreign Legion on an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra accidentally awakens a mummy.To call this a remake of the 1932 film is a bit of a stretch. Some bare bones elements are the same, but where the original was a horror film, this is really an action-adventure film with some horror elements thrown in. What is most fascinating is the long list of hands it went through: Wes Craven, Joe Dante, Clive Barker, George Romero, Mick Garris... one can only imagine how different people would have tackled the film.What we end up with is really more of an Indiana Jones vs. the Undead sort of story. And while it may not be the most intellectual film, and some of the CGI is clearly rushed, it is a fun flick. It should come as no surprise that they've made three sequels (and already planning a 2017 reboot).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Mummy is the best movie epic action nonstop ride!,"The Mummy (1999) is my favorite true nonstop action epic movie!!! Filled with dazzling visual effects, top-notch talent and superb storytelling. It was the second movie i went to see in the theaters in 1999 with my mom as a kid. I was just a teen than I have enjoyed this movie a lot. The first movie in 1999 I went to see in theaters was The Matrix (1999) with also my mom and I have enjoyed both of this movie. Every time I am watching it, I still enjoy it! I had no idea it was a remake of 1932 film The Mummy. I never watched movies from 1938. There were spawned 2 sequels and one prequel/spin-off film. I love and I like both of the sequels on their own way and I hate the prequel/spin-off film. ""The Mummy"" (1999) was one of the finest Fantasy action adventures of all time. For the Mummy, achieving that level of serio-comic entertainment was unprecedented, and I still do not think it has been duplicated. All the witty dialogue, near perfect script, Dr. Bey... This was a very adult movie, but also for children too, and therefore accessible at different levels. The comments by Ebert, and co. were silly at best, as we have an example of critics turning up their nose at a great film, just to be 'in', be smiled upon by the academy, etc. It was therefore a poor review, a poor appraisal by the twain: this time you should not have used them.I am keep hearing that this movie is getting a reboot now with Tom Cruise in it but why? Why rebooting this movie? It is stupid! The reboot will fail, even with Tom Cruise in it and It will be rated PG-13 and It want be so good like this movie is. ""The Mummy"" is more Fantasy than Sci-Fi, and really perhaps should be classified as Fantasy Drama. Nonetheless, the rebooting of ""The Mummy"" by Stephen Sommers in 1999 would top, or near top, any list in which it is appropriately placed. ... And that ridiculous quote by Ebert & Co,, that this movie was ""the son of... the son of ... Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is sheer nonsense. This is to imply it is derivative. In a broad sense, all movies are 'derivative', and indeed so was Raiders. It does have a great amount of CGI effects, Yet there were real stages, too, I have learned: such as at Dracula's 'Ball': This was held in some Medieval Church, if I recollect accurately. I thought that the effects were good, though the viewer is perhaps surfeited with them. (...) Nonetheless, though bothering me initially, when I came to 'understand' this film, I look past it now. How much money do you want the producers and the studio to have to spend...? I thought was in perfect harmony with the plot, being grandly that of Good vs. Evil.This film, and unlike his ""The Mummy"" of a few years prior, is not 'immediately accessible' and does take repeated viewings to enjoy. This due to the plot's complexity, to appreciate the humor, and to appreciate the acting. Stephen Sommers did well with this movie but did very poorly with the GI Joe movie.I think people take ""The Mummy"" remake too seriously. It has great special effects that hold up pretty well, charming performances (especially Brendon Frasier, who I'm surprised didn't become a HUGE star after that kind of leading man performance/success. I mean he was pretty much was the Christ Pratt of that era and should have had the type of career upgrade Pratt is getting now. The dialogue is hilarious and very entertaining. I mean we're not talking a classic Oscar winning film here, but an irresistibly fun blockbuster that holds up well 16 years later.So the actors in this movie were good and the story including the directors were great. Everybody in this movie did a great job. This is one of the best movies ever made. It doesn't get much better than Brendan Fraser battling a 3,000 year old mummy. The action and the Special effects CGI are great. Brendan Fraser did a terrific job playing Rick' O'Connell a Legionnaire adventurer who served in the French Foreign Legion turned out a deserter and later a prisoner, he did outstanding acting performance as a bad ass action hero on the screen! Rachel Weisz as Evie Carnahan did an outstanding and a perfect job as a shy but intelligent Egyptologist. Arnold Vosloo as High Priest Imhotep and the Mummy was fantastic, he is such an underrated actor. Gosh he was even so good in Hard Target (1993) my favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme/John Woo movie. Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor a former soldier in the French Foreign Legion was just awesome and I loved his performance in the film. Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay the leader of Medjai was incredible outstanding. This movie is what it is a perfect Adventure movie a like Indiana Jones but a bit too underrated, that shouldn't have been.Deep in the Egyptian desert, a handful of people searching for a long-lost treasure have just unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy of terror. I am giving this 10/10 for been entertaining summer blockbuster action/adventure/fantasy movie!

"Well, thanks to The Mummy, the 1999 summer movie season officially arrived with a bang.","The Mummy is your typical special effects movie. It's got good looking stars, great special effects, a plot that is there to move the special effects along, and you leave the movie feeling a little bit dumber than when you went in.The movie opens 3000+ years in the past. The Egyptian priest Imhotep is put to death in the most inhumane way possible. But for some reason, if a person is put to death in this way, if for some reason he manages to come back to life, at any point in the future, he'll have the powers of a God. So why even give him that chance? Why not kill him in a little bit nicer way and not give him the chance to come back as a God? That's what I was thinking. So anyway, as you may have guessed, in 1925 a group of treasure hunters and archeologists stumble upon the tomb of the priest, and manage to bring him back to life. He then reigns terror upon the people and brings with him the 10 plagues. But with the help of a cat and a book Brendan Fraser and his crew manage to save the world, and get some treasure at the same time.The one thing to remember when going to see this is that there is a lot more comedy involved that you may expect. It almost seemed at times that they wanted to do a parody of Indiana Jones films. So while it wasn't really scary, it did have a lot of humor. And like I said before, plot isn't really the reason to go see this movie. I went because of the special effects and the scenery. What I really thought of this movie was that it was a low-rent Indiana Jones film. Indy has better acting and a better story and a little more adventure. This one had pretty faces, some adventure, and good special effects. I for one am a fan of Brendan Fraser, even if other people aren't. Absent George of the Jungle and Encino Man, all of his films have been pretty good, no matter what anyone says. And he plays his character well here too. He does subtle humor very well. The leading lady, Rachel Weisz was attractive in a strange sort of way. Something is wrong with her face, I just couldn't figure out what. And the rest of the cast did their stock parts well. You knew pretty early on in the film who was there to die and who was going to live.The special effects were good as well. The problem with special effects these days is that we've pretty much seen them all. The trick is making them a little different. A movie like The Matrix takes special effects to a new level. In The Mummy, they use sand as their little difference. I don't recall seeing a movie use sand as their special effect before, and this one pulled it off well. The creature effects were pretty good, but reminded me of the Evil Dead movies at times. What I did like were the sets that were used. I thought they looked pretty cool. The opening scene looked amazing, even though they were using CGI to create it. The only real problem I had with the movie was that it slowed down in a lot of places. They would rev up the engines for a few minutes, and then slow it down. I realize that special effects movies are expensive, so they can't have these huge effects all the time, but it is possible to keep the energy level up without using effects, and I wish they had done that a little more.So overall The Mummy was entertaining if slow at times. The special effects were good and a little different that normal. The faces are pretty and the scenery is cool, so if you're looking for a movie that won't make you think and will deliver a good time, this is one to see.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Popcorn movie! Fantastic Fun!,"The mummy (1999) is the return of the Egyptian terror theme renewed and updated to the 90's.The story is good, compelling and exciting like an Indiana Jones movie while having some fun and humor into it.The egyptian theme has been thoroughly researched by director Stephen Sommers: -the name Imhotep is truely egyptian (not invented) as it relates to the famous Imhotep, architect of thee stepped pyramid of Saqqara.-Secondly, the egyptian reading and speaking are also correct. -the statues of Horus and Anubis correspond to the egyptian style (not like in Stargate where the eye of horus symbol is displayed but named ""eye of ra"")The actors are excellent with a slight ""British humor"" style which is definitely refreshing in an American movie.Finally the special effects are mind-blowing with a superb opening shot in the ancient city of Thebes.

Great fun for the whole family,"The Mummy is an action-adventure film in the vein of classics such as Raiders of The Last Ark and The Goonies. It is a movie filled with moments scary enough to make your skin crawl, but in equal amounts moments that JUST make your heart warm. The chemistry between the cast is amazing, especially between the hunky leading actor Brendan Fraser and the ever beautiful Rachel Weisz, who both give an outstanding performance that carries the movie forward as an adventure film with a lot of heart for the whole family.The pacing of the movie is great, in no small part thanks to director Stephen Sommers, who is also in charge of the screenplay. You really feel like you are along for the adventure, as opposed to just observing it from a distance, as you witness the two leading characters, played by Fraser and Weisz respectively, go from disliking each-other to by the end of the movie being smitten with each-other, brought together by the difficulties faced during the resurrected mummy Imhotep's relentless pursuit to destroy them.All in all it is a movie you JUST have to see if you're an adventure film enthusiast, which if you aren't, what are you doing? I must warn though to take into consideration the emotional maturity of your youngling when watching this movie with your family, as there are some scenes that might scare young children. But in good company that can handle the flick, it is surely a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well wrap me up!,"OK, everyone knows the drill: in ancient Egypt, high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was buried alive for trying to resurrect a princess, and 3,000 years later, some brainless explorers accidentally resurrect Imhotep, who has an axe to grind. An interesting aspect here is the usage of the ancient Egyptian language. In a way, it seems a little silly casting Brendan Fraser as hero Rick O'Connell, given that he previously starred in movies like ""Encino Man"" and ""Airheads"". But he does some good work with the role. Rachel Weisz, as Evelyn Carnahan, doesn't exactly overshadow him, but has her own role in everything. John Hannah, as Evelyn's goofy brother Jonathan, is mostly there for comic relief. Oded Fehr, as Ardeth Bey, starts out looking like a bad guy, but turns out to be a good guy. All in all, corny but fun.One more thing. Is the Bernard Fox here the same Bernard Fox who played Dr. Bombay on ""Bewitched""?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Messy but watchable,"Brendan Fraser fever is still going, even post-Oscars. Made me realise I'd never seen The Mummy in full before.It's fine? Starts and finishes with its two best action set pieces at least. Some of the humour works, but some of the movie's attempts to be funny are kind of terrible. The pacing felt weird, especially in the film's second act, where scenes don't really seem to flow together all that well. I'm glad mainstream movies seem to have moved on from characters like Beni Gabor.But the leads are good, and I think these special effects are pretty good by late 1990s standards. It's a watchable movie that borrows a lot from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a decent amount from Army of Darkness, but ends up being not nearly as good as either.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun pharaoh tale,"This has been shown by UK ITV so many times over the years that apparently similarly with the many other regular viewers it has become one of my comfort films to see repeatedly. A night with Die Hard, Where Eagles Dare, The Guns Of Navorone, Stargate, Time Machine and The Mummy all on TV would be a night of terrible clashes.Starting in 1290 BC in Egypt with a ""very naughty"" priest mummified alive it moves on to AD 1923 with a wise cracking male American archaeologist meeting up with a dotty female British one and her lily-livered brother to go on a jovial quest for an ancient tomb. Together with a jovial rival digging party they manage to unleash the forces of Darkness by awakening the less than jovial Mummy to bring plague and death. I hope Evie was happy with all the carnage her impetuous reading of the incantation from the Book brought down on thousands of hapless heads. The varied mayhem ensuing meted on the just and the unjust is sometimes horrific sometimes slapstick – probably kids today think the heartlessly graphic imagery laughable, but me, I'm easily horrified. However ultimately, it's a fast and fun adventure yarn for kids and adults alike with an interesting plot but with plot holes as gaping as Imhotep's gob, taken relentlessly and with panache to a noisy conclusion. The gags fall thick and fast too; it was Brendan Fraser's finest film and although Rachel Weisz has done better things they really made a charming screwball couple – without them sparking it would have been a completely different film. And I wouldn't have seen it so often either. If Arnold Vosloo lives to be 2000 years old he will probably never top his characterisation of the ancient baddie in here. So with some gruesome cgi cartoonery moments not for the squeamish but also with plenty of solid nonsense entertainment for the hardened majority there's something in here for nearly every mortal.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More Action than Previous Mummy Films,"While serving in the French Foreign Legion, an American by the name of ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendan Fraser) manages to survive a ferocious battle at the site of the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra which had been lost under the sands of the desert for thousands of years. While there he discovers a box which contains a key of some sort. But rather than stay there and investigate any further he becomes extremely uneasy about the place and leaves the city as soon as possible. A few years later the key is stolen from him but as luck would have it the new owner, ""Evelyn Carnahan"" (Rachel Weisz) comes to him while he is in prison and asks him to lead her and a small party to this lost city. Since he is about to be hanged he readily agrees if she can convince the warden, ""Gad Hassan"" (Omid Djalili) to free him. Although she manages to do just that they soon find that they aren't the only ones looking to find Hamunaptra. Neither do they realize the evil presence that awaits them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film which was nominated for several awards, most notably in the categories of best sound and visual effects. Additionally, it was also nominated for a Saturn Award for ""Best Fantasy Film"". To that point, I should mention that--unlike most ""Mummy films"" produced previously--this particular movie contains quite a bit more action than the others which diminishes the overall horror aspect to a great degree. Even so, I found this to be an enjoyable movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow,"I love this movie! It is funny, but not ridiculuous. It is amusing and exciting. The colours are fantastic and the action is breath-taking. I've seen it five times in the cinema. The actors are excellent, they really identify with their characters. What I really hate, is ""The Mummy Returns"". It is just ridiculuous and nothing else. And I'm not alone. Everybody who has seen ""The Mummy"" and liked it, despises the second part. You have to watch ""The Mummy"" a few times to discover all the gags and hidden elements. And it's worth seeing them.

Junkfood on screen,"Where are the times when directors were directors, cutters were cutters and screenwriters knew how to create a plot? The ILM creation of the main characters were surprisingly weak, for example the movements of the ""hero"" seemed incredibly mechanic. On the other hand I was positively impressed by the smooth playing of the rotten actor giving the mummy such a powerful and juicy appearance. A moldy movie for decomposing brains.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terror-ific film,I really enjoyed this film;It was brilliant and quite funny.I found it really jumpy and scary in places.It was better than I expected.The film had no bad points. I recommend you go see it. My rating is 9/10.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Looks to me like you're on the wrong side of the MOVIE!,"It was one of the first films I saw in Germany. I have seen this movie about 3 times as a kid but loved it every time.Now that I'm an adult and have a clue, I see what a pretty Lama movie is not that bad or anything. It's just a big budget movie the special effects are better in an animated movie comma many 90s troops are present in there but unfortunately not the most intelligent, the forces as well as the laws of nature in this movie are so inconsistent and the casting is not really fitting point so none of that Actors are bad, they make an effort and so on, but I do not know what's missing there.Since the film is sometimes really cheesy a cheesy actor like Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Lundgren might be better suited or a dirty actor like Bruce Campbell, Kurt Russell, or Gerard Butler.
I would honestly leave the rest like that because then it would be balanced or overtake the cast and change only a few characters otherwise I like how ironic the movie is because there are a few things that are obviously only in there because they should look cool and in the movie That's at least addressed anyway, I have a problem with humor.
The beginning of the movie is like chewing gum the jokes are absolutely not funny the character of Evelyn's brother is absolutely superfluous and so not entertaining that he just annoyed and the middle of the movie is a bit repetitive.Making a good movie is difficult to make a remake, so taking a movie with a great concept and just packing it into another genre is a very smart idea and I would say they did that partially, you can not do it cheap Variant of Indiana Jones designate it looks more like a movie version of ""Relic Hunters"".
However, I have always wondered why Tab always had such a stupid curse that made him transfer money, but what do I know? I've always wondered why the Arabs can not be our main characters because they're pretty entertaining, but what do I know?All in all found. I thought the movie is alright not good not bad but quite enjoyable there are some things I liked it there are a few things I do not understand but I have not taken the urge to answer these questions.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable in a campy way,"The Mummy is an enjoyable movie that somehow has the nostalgic atmosphere of the movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The supporting actors are charming and funny (especially Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser). This movie is not perfect; it has several plot holes, isn't very historically or artistically accurate, and the ""horror"" scenes are more laughable than scary. However, it's not supposed to be taken very seriously anyways, more to be watched for some Indiana Jones-like pretenseless fun, preferably with some friends while drinking from a mug of hot chocolate. Really the only big thing I have to say against it is that the marketing made the film look more serious or horror-like than it really was.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Death is only the beginning!!!,"Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) obtains a map of the ancient city of Hamunaptra from Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) whom has landed himself in prison. He shows the map to his sister Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) a librarian whom is also an authority on Egyptian History. When Evelyn learns that Rick knows the way to the ancient city she pays a considerable sum for his freedom and the three of them make their way to the ancient city. Unfortunately for them, a rival group have also arrived at the ancient city (in search of the treasure), but even more unfortunately for everyone else their combined meddling has awoken a Mummy that has been dead for over 3000 years. The Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) intends to use Evelyn as a sacrifice to bring his dead lover back to life...The Mummy is a fairly goofy, tongue-in-cheek type adventure film and that is perhaps one of its greatest strengths. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is actually one of its selling points - the cast look like they're having fun here and that does translate well on screen.I think where this film may run into problems with some people is if you start drawing comparisons to other films - when looking at it is does remind one slightly of Indiana Jones (it's easy to see elements of both Raiders of the lost ark and The Last Crusade). The problem is that it is weaker than both these films because it doesn't have the same tension to it - director Sommers seems to use goofball charm and humour to get by. Don't get me wrong it's fun to watch and quite enjoyable, but it doesn't offer the same type of tension or suspense that you get from an Indiana Jones film and naturally suffers by comparison.The cast are all on good form with Brendan Fraser making a good hero; he's not quite Harrison Ford, but he does a good job. Rachel Weisz is excellent as well and whilst she's clearly intelligent for the most part I did like the way that she had occasional ditzy moments and also liked that she was afforded some vulnerability (the scene where she was drunk is a good example). John Hannah was fun to watch as a minor comic relief character (kind of like Sallah in Raiders of the lost ark). Vosloo was very good as the antagonist, but in some ways the goofy nature of the film held him back and he wasn't as terrifying as he perhaps could have been.In some ways The Mummy is both unremarkable and unmemorable (particularly when compared to the earlier Indiana Jones films), but it does have some charm to it, some laughs and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is also a big plus. It's good for a one time watch, but if you want to watch a really good adventure film focusing on archaeological digging the you really owe to yourself to watch Raiders of the lost ark which is an absolute classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst remake of all time (and that's saying something)...,"My only problem with the critical loathing of the Mummy (1999) is that I am convinced that they did not dismember it enough. Therefore, I feel obligated to do such as is my duty as a movie lover. I really don't want to. But somebody's gotta, SO...here goes.One comment that has stuck with me that I heard in the audience the night I went to see this wretched piece of celluloid is someone saying ""This is like Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Which it IS--minus the good parts. One would think with a budget of $80 million that they could afford to a)hire some better actors or b) write a better script. The humor, more often than not, is limp, the characterization is non-existent, all that CGI-animated sand could not hope to begin to plug the frequent plot holes, and I'm convinced that they used Boris Karloff's actual corpse in the initial scenes of the mummy being unearthed to save some money.The film's main problem is that it cannot decide what it wants to be: action/adventure, comedy, or horror. So, by way of idiotic compromise, it tries being all three and, naturally, winds up failing miserably. The elements of the three genres mentioned above are not interchangable and I very much resent the filmmakers acting like they were. Then there's the business of the plagues of Egypt and the Book of the Dead. Excuse me, but the plagues are from Exodus, not Egyptian mythology, and, as anybody who watched the original 1932 classic upon which this is VERY loosely based, the Egyptians didn't use BOOKS. They used papyrus scrolls! And could somebody please explain to me why, if people have been looking for this city for their entire lives without finding it, it took our thoroughly brain-dead cast something like half a day to?Probably the worst crime that this film committed was the evisceration of the character of Imhotep. Karloff portrayed him as a love-lost monster, equal parts sympathetic and repellant. Here, he's not even a blip on the radar screen, character-wise. All we mostly see is this dessicated corpse who, for some non-sensical reason, is afraid of cats (must have watched ""Pet Semetary"" too many times), can turn himself in a living sandstorm (which I think makes for a nice metaphor for the filmmakers; both are full of hot air), and has the most idiotic on-screen death ever captured on film. Karloff must be spinning in his grave.Remakes, more often than not, are experiments in re-animation. While the occasional few do wind up being as good or better than the original, most such remakes are failures. Why? Because the ones doing the makeover don't understand what made the film work the first time...and don't care to. That, perhaps more than anything, is why I hate this version of the Mummy. Some things are better off dead.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
11 for mummy,"An English librarian called Evelyn Carnahan becomes interested in starting an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra.

Unfortunately for everyone, this group ends up unleashing a curse which been laid on the dead High Priest Imhotep.

"Extravagant and sprawling romp through some fairly familiar, but involving, territory which encompasses upstanding protagonists; end of the world plots and slight romances.","The Mummy will begin in that old fashioned, mythical manner in that an off screen narrator verbally informs us of a legacy of events which prelude the body of the film; the tone that of an old storyteller, even fable-like in its sounding as the oral informing us of a time gone by and actions which happened is put across. It's an opening slice of narration that might just as well as seen its scripture begin with the line: ""Once upon a time, long ago, there was a great warrior....."" Stephen Sommers' film will go on to flit manically from tone to tone and from content to content; a harmless, teen-aged orientated throwaway action flick one minute, a rather hardened and somewhat full on horror piece venturing into territory you just do not initially entrust it will go anywhere near, the next. His film is a romping, old fashioned escapade through adventurous territory and old fashioned mythical sensibilities; a film with a foot in the science fiction, what with its content linked to characters able to bring people back from the dead and flesh eating monsters that do not exist; horror and post-Indiana Jones action adventure.The aforementioned story of the opening loosely goes on to describe a forbidden romance set in an alternate ancient Egypt between the then Pheroh of that time's partner and one of his entrusted high priests named Imhotep (Vosloo), something that leads to her arranged death and the sentencing of the priest plus his aides to live mummification, a process loosely described by one of the leads a little later on as something not particularly pleasant if we weren't already familiar with such things - although, it does beg the question as to whether it's even possible to actually be alive during said process for anything beyond that of about two seconds.Fast-forward from ancient Egypt to the same nation in the 1920s and enter the lead, an American mercenary named Rick O'Connell (Fraser); a brave man, a man with the ability to take control of a hostile situation as he leads a band of men against some aggressors at a protected burial site; to use an array of weaponry with consummate ease and who additionally sports an array of meal insignia on his tunic suggesting experience and expertise within this field – he is the ultimate warrior of the age, a modern-day action man eventually going up against the cursed; blood thirsty values and mindsets of that of the ancient. Also in Egypt, and not so far away, is Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz); an educated English woman working in a library whom outlines her credentials and skills to her employer purely for out benefit when he challenges her. She's a little pit perky; a tad goofy because of the mess she makes at her workplace and the manner in which she makes it, at one point having to balance precariously on a ladder.Her laid back and often amusing brother, named Jonathan (Hannah), then brings into her possession an artifact which could spell some serious archaeological ramifications. Following the obtaining of an imprisoned O'Connell, given he is vital to where it is the artifact will lead them, the trio set off for the deeper; sandier and more barren spots of Egypt to uncover greater truths about the trinket it turned out Jonathan stole from O'Connell, a trinket which is more broadly linked to that of the opening ancient Egypt-set story. What will come to form between Evelyn and Rick is a lightly played but fun enough romance beginning with O'Connell dismissing the moment he kissed her from behind his barred jail window as something which ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" because he was ""about to be hung"".On the journey with them, but in opposing camps, are some greedy American treasure hunters whom enjoy their gunfights along with their own English academic, who's sexist, and led overall by the weaselly, one-time buddy of Rick's named Beni (O'Connor). The two troupés rolling along dusty; desert terrains to orchestral bursts of orchestral music, MacGuffin in hand, as the sun beats down and the treasure lies out there somewhere, is quite good fun at the best of its times; although Rick's ongoing and somewhat inexplicable feud with Beni is hardly the stuff of Blondie and Tuco. One thing leads onto another, the eventual resurrecting of Imhotep spelling disaster for the rest of everyone as he wrecks his revenge on the world he still sees as the one that forbade his genuine love for another. The film engineers into a race against time against the seemingly indestructible villain, the moment he's got all his bits and pieces together to complete the resurrection ritual the moment spelling disaster for all.Sommers' film is good fun in the long run. It is the sort of film that has its characters crack jokes and break one-liners in the face of an apocalypse, and in light of people formulating angry views on characters constantly outrunning explosions or things that they ought not be able to in films of this ilk, actually has a scene in which it sticks around to see what happens to the poor bastard unable to get away from the proverbial danger: the result is less than pleasant. The film is not without flaw, but it's difficult to get too angry over a piece as self-aware as The Mummy is of the old fashioned, spirited romp that it is. Look at the scene in which the protagonist even identifies his quest as one in which rescuing the damsel in distress; defeating the villain and saving the world must be achieved so as to attain parity, labelling it ""the usual"". With a well-sewn romance manoeuvred into the film and a great deal of threat persistently looming over proceedings; The Mummy is a decent, enjoyable little B-movie adventure which above most other things, is at least refreshingly honest.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Truly classic, Action Packed, and Perfect CGI. I enjoyed it so much.","The Last Great Adventure Film
Don't get me wrong, we have had lots of great movies since '99, but I really feel that this is the last one where it was just 10 for 10 great. And it was a great way to end the 90's, which I still believe to be one of the best movie decades; we knew how to make great movies and we knew how to make great trailers for those great movies--not just rapidly flashing scenes with drums and clashing and building violins, but REAL trailers edited to perfection with great music.""The Mummy"" just packs it all; from Adventure to Horror to Fantasy to Drama to Comedy, and in my humble opinion, it succeeds superbly in all five genres. It is just such a FUN movie! The sites (and sights), the sound design, the CGI (while I won't say it's perfect), and, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of a score which can take Alan Silvestri's for ""The Mummy Returns"" to the cleaners any day of the week.While ""The Mummy"" was a blockbuster, it is sadly one of those unappreciated movies. Shortly after its release is when movies began to take a turn for the worse and become darker, and for what ever crackbutt reason, darker is what the American Audience wants. Audiences just want movies where everyone dies (a lot of the time including the hero(es)), the music is heavily synthesized, and the plot is simplistic.""The Mummy"" is an epic adventure from beginning to end. And I can only hope that our movies return to this movie-type some day soon. While I do like ""The Mummy Returns"", it was a little too silly for me. And ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""? No comment. The first one just captures the fun-ness that movies are SUPPOSED to be; a movie that grabs you out of your world so you almost feel as if you're IN the movie (he said, at the risk of sounding either cheezy or loony), very much in the tradition of ""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel.It's just truly a classic, and will hopefully remain so long enough to see a day when it is appreciated again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Wait, what? That makes no sen... ooooh... preeetty...""","Before I begin this, you should know that I don't care for Indiana Jones either. I caught(not by choice) one of the old ones, and I could not tell you which of them it was. Uh... it had spiders... oh, and a scene in a plane that I believe inspired the lyrics of at least the chorus of a song by Aqua, the short-lived Danish pop phenomenon. So, on to this pile... at this point, the flicks Sommers was... putting, let's go with that... out were still intolerable(of what I've seen by him, only G.I. Joe did not physically hurt me to sit through). He needs to stay far away(I'd be willing to sign a petition to enforce that, can we get a court to issue a powerful restraining order, maybe?) from classic horror films, because, as should be no secret to anyone who's seen him do a pathetic attempt at it, *he lacks even the most basic level of understanding of the genre*. Is *anyone* scared by anything in any of these? He can't build suspense or tension, and he refuses to commit to any creature enough to make it menacing. I haven't watched the original, from 1932 and starring Boris Karloff, but I am certain it is superior to this. Frankly, this is idiotic. It is not funny, it is not entertaining, and it is not engaging. Every single character is obnoxious(a couple are offensive Middle Eastern stereotypes, as well), and what few personality traits they do have are all wildly unappealing. Are we supposed to care about these people? I can imagine their own families not wanting anything to do with them. The effects(and yes, they are fairly well-done(meanwhile, this was made when The Matrix was, so it could have been better) though there are too many of them, and it ceases to be dramatic) are *clearly* the focus here, evidenced partially by the fact that these morons literally *stand in place to gawk at them when in imminent danger*, destroying a lot of the sense of potential peril. Why are the monsters all so utterly inept? Yes, yes... it's a cinematic convention that they have to suck when attacking the leads, however, these seem *completely* useless. In general, this is extremely over the top. The score is another example of that. Evelyn falls for Rick, for no other reasons than that he's there, he's Caucasian and he's not related to her by blood. The action is not all that exciting. That's not a mummy, anyway; it's a decomposing body that has risen from the dead... anybody who knows their supernatural lore will tell you immediately that that's a *zombie*. Seriously, if they thought the old bandage look was silly, then why did they make a movie of the monster at all? This is not entirely devoid of interesting bits. And Oded Fehr, arguably the strongest charismatic screen presence, was certainly cool to see again. He was the best part of this for me. There is mild and occasionally disturbing violence, and brief partial nudity in this. The DVD contains two commentary tracks(one with the director and editor, and one with Fraser) that aren't half bad, a handful of short things that show you the different elements of the visual effects, three storyboard to final film comparisons, a few deleted scenes, a photo montage and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Stephen and/or adventure. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Silly , Dumb And Only Slightly Entertaining","I remember seeing the trailers for his film several weeks before it was released at the cinema in 1999 and was under the impression it was going to be a breath taking horror film , but when it hit the cinemas and the critics described it as an Indiana Jones type adventure I felt robbed of somethingOn its own merits THE MUMMY is entertaining enough , there's lot of action , a few rare scary bits but far too much humour which threatens to sink the film . I guess this is down to the producers trying to attract a younger audience and boost their profits but this all leads to a silly film . And I got the distinct impression that he script was written around the FX . For example there's a special effects packed meteor shower but there's no explanation for it , it adds nothing to plot and is never referred to again even though it kills a lot of people . Obviously the scene was written to show off some CGITHE MUMMY does sometimes have its better parts , mainly when it tries to get back to being a horror film but I often found myself wishing I was watching an often rumoured Clive Barker version of THE MUMMYAs a footnote I couldn't help noticing that THE MUMMY starts with a flash back to several thousand years ago and is followed by a big battle with combatants falling from a great height .

Great film a real classic of the future,"I have looked at all the comments of this film the good and the bad, and there are over 700 of them.It was the best film of the year, fantastic special effect by John Berton and ILM, great direction and stunt work, and all the actors gave they're charactors credability, expecially Kevin j O'Conner and Arnold Vosloo, they were very good at being the baddies. Brendon Frasier as the hero brought the quality of an action man to the film, as did Oded Frer, and  Rachel was the best choice for a heroine,the right mix of brains and dissiness.

What you see is what you get.,"This is a good adventure film by it's self but doesn't compare with the Indiana Jones trilogy. The Egyptian props and set designs were superb and probably even more impressive than the real thing. The pace of the story, although well thought out, was hectic to especially cater for young/short attention spans and barely left time to create atmosphere or character depth. Brendan Fraser was surprisingly good in the lead role but we will have to wait a couple of decades to see if he compares to Harrison Ford. The role written for Rachel Weisz was not pc but I suppose nothing was in the 1920's. The fight scene with the mummies towards the end seemed reminiscent of the skeleton battle in 'Jason and the Argonauts, but with more humor.

The Hands-Down Worst Film of the 1990's,"""The Mummy"" is the worst film of the 1990's... PERIOD.  I have never witnessed a more vile waste of talent and money than this absolutely hideous piece of crap.  The previews made it appear creepy and supernatural, but as the lights dimmed and the movie began, I realized things were taking a turn for the worst. I actually dragged friends along with me because I thought the film would be a prime slice of big-budget Hollywood horror.  Yet the film is so tongue-in-cheek and played for laughs that it completely alienated me as a viewer.The special effects are decent, but the 1930's version was damn creepier with a budget of probably 1/100th what this one cost. The story of ""The Mummy"" is gothic: it deals with undying love and revenge. These two ideas that are callously thrown aside for as many silly action sequences as they can squeeze in.  The acting is too damn campy, which began to annoy me, say, fifteen minutes into the movie.  The racial stereotypes are downright insulting, while usually solid actors Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, and Rachel Weisz are completely wasted.The best thing that happened in this movie is when the credits went on at the end.  And boy, did I have apologizing to do to my friends.Now I don't like dissecting films at all; I usually take them as pieces of pure entertainment.  But this one-- BY GOD-- almost made me lose all hope in Hollywood's ability to thrill an audience.  Universal Pictures, you should be ashamed of yourselves. And there's talk of a sequel....

An Adventure Through the Sands of Time,"The Mummy is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends romance, adventure, mythology, and enough mummy action to make you reconsider your life choices-in the best way possible. Released in 1999 when I was just an eight-year-old, this film left an indelible mark on me. And not just because I briefly contemplated becoming an archaeologist with dreams of resurrecting mummies and saving the world. No, this movie is a treasure trove of delights that has aged like a fine, dusty bottle of Egyptian wine.The Mummy had me hooked from the get-go. It kicks off like a Disney movie, with a voiceover narration delivering a classic tale, but spiced up for kids seeking a bit more thrill. Murder, mystic lore, and impressive body paint-all within the first five minutes. It's like a toddler's horror bedtime story set in Egypt, a land of mystery and ancient wonders.Our hero, Rick O'Connell, a rugged adventurer with a penchant for unbuttoned shirts and leather holsters, teams up with the brainy yet beguiling librarian, Evelyn Carnahan. Together, they embark on a quest to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, where untold treasures and inscriptions await. The chemistry between these two is enough to make a Sphinx blush, and every stolen glance leaves you clamoring for more. And when the action kicks in, it's a symphony of choreographed chaos that's both thrilling and side-splittingly funny. Picture a boat, a brawl, and a bullet-dodging librarian. It's action-comedy at its finest.Let's not forget Ardeth Bay, the Medjai warrior who's so good-looking, it should be illegal. His presence on screen is like a burst of sunshine in the Egyptian desert.And don't even get me started on Jonathan Carnahan, the lovable fool of the story. His comedic antics and witty narration of the plagues add humor that's all too often missing in modern adventure tales. Jonathan reminds us that battling ancient cursed mummies is always better with a dose of wit and charm.And speaking of mummies, Imhotep is a villain for the ages. He's a resurrected priest with a penchant for love, murder, underground rituals, and bug-induced torment-a perfect recipe for a fairy tale villain with a dark twist. His quest to reunite with his lost love, Princess Anck-su-namun, echoes the haunting tale of the original 1932 Mummy.However, the 1999 Mummy isn't flawless, with scarabs with unclear dining habits and books that conveniently reveal their secrets. While it lacks modern blockbuster slickness, its heart, charm, wit, and audacity are captivating. It hails from a different era of filmmaking, offering swashbuckling, romance, and bug-infested treasure hunts. Despite aging effects, it delivers thrilling and humorous action sequences that withstand the test of time, like sandstorms and bug infestations. The mummy's attack on an airplane remains a jaw-dropping spectacle that still holds up today.The Mummy is a beacon of adventure that defies time and trends. It's a reminder that sometimes, a movie's magic lies not in its perfection, but in its ability to capture your imagination and whisk you away on a rollicking, sand-filled escapade. Timing is everything with a movie like this, and for me, it struck at the perfect moment in my childhood, leaving me forever obsessed with romance, adventure, and the occasional mummy resurrection.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"a basic special effects movie, yet highly entertaining.","At first sight, this movie seems like yet another special-effects blockbuster based on an old story a la Independence Day or Godzilla, but unlike those, it seems to make up for it's uncreative ideas with pure edge of your seat thrills.  It features way too many john woo-esque gunfights (which is a very good thing) and periodic spurts of humor (the moment where brendan fraser holds up the cat for Im-Ho-Tep comes to mind), which separates it from other CG effects guidebooks. Although it may not have the legacy of The Phantom Menace or the intricate storyline of the Matrix, the Mummy was still enjoyable",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A great fun adventure, With laughs and action.","It's not much to discuss but it can be explained in a few words. Fun: Yes. Scary: No. brilliant film: You could say yes. The Mummy offers a whole lot of shooting and plenty of nice laughs. It's the type you could watch with friends or family. A great big adventure, and an excellent blend of Ancient tomb's with a hilarious discovery team. ( the cast)The acting was spot on. Brendan Fraser is one that stood out, his witty lines and his eager to shoot things is constant in The Mummy, he's powerful and funny. Without him the movie may not been so brilliant. Read the plot and you know that it's going to be 1 or 2 hours of fun and adventure. Arnold Vosloo does excellent in playing his role. He had the right look and was determined which made his character very believable. The majority of the cast offered laughs.A great idea. The world need's a movie like this; a fun ride with nice action and clever wit. The special effects were too superior, there were some nice tricks (partically the one in the desert) The tomb's and the mummy's look very ancient yet very real. It's been a decade and it is still as funny and as fun. A whole lot of shooting too. Go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad,"The Mummy was a good action movie that left you wanting more...and less. Yes, it was a fun movie. Yes, the action was good. Yes, the special effects were cool. But, it borrowed too heavily from other movies and you've seen the same plot before. There is absolutely nothing original about this movie. It borrows, okay, steals from Indiana Jones, Stargate, Jason and the Argonauts, etc. Yes, the plot is completely predicable. You know who is going to live and die at the end of the movie after 30 minutes. But! It is a hell of a ride and is very enjoyable for what it is.

How could this only average 7.0?,"I watched it for about the 5th time the other day, and it gets better with each viewing! I remember watching it in the theater when it first came out, and I thought ""what a ridiculous movie!"". I would have rated it 4 or 5 at the time.

Great tongue-in-cheek fun,"If you're expecting an intelligent piece of film-making, don't watch ""The Mummy"". If you're looking for a smartly directed film classic, please look away. If you want your deserts to have that sweeping epic feel, return to ""Lawrence of Arabia"". If you want an amusing, action/adventure flick then look no further.""The Mummy"" does exactly what it sets out to do - entertain. It's written firmly to be a mass-audience block-buster-brain-dead fare, but it's done a lot better than drivel like ""Mission: Impossible II"" or ""Armageddon"". Importantly it doesn't try to be all clever and smart - the movie is played for laughs. It's not an all out comedy but there's a knowing-wink to the movie as Brendan Fraser quips his way through the movie, assisted by Evie (Rachel Weisz) and her incompetent brother Jonathan (John Hannah). The titular Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) has some good on screen presence and, while not menacing, does have an aura of power to him.A movie like this contains a heavy dose of action and they're generally well executed. The SFX mostly live up to the job, baring a few ropey moments (most noticeably the scarab swarms), and the viewer is generally kept into the action without ever being confused. There's no directorial innovation or trickery - Sommers sticks squarely to the well known tactics and it pays off.""The Mummy"" has a very Indiana-Jones feel to it, not least because Fraser's character is also an exploring man caught up in archaeology. All he needs is a whip - though he substitutes with a dual-John-Wooesque-two-pistols trick. The humour is what helps the movie along because if it *were* to take itself seriously, it would fall to pieces. As it is you're left with some great fun, your brain switched off, and a couple of hours passed away. For it's genre it's recommended - 7/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A cult classic,"This movie is living proof a fun action packed movie with silly FX can stand the trial of time. I think this movie mixes perfectly lots of genres, suspense, thriller, some horror, lots of action, some romance and comedy.

Rick is the tough guy with a soft heart, Evelyn the brains of the operation, Jonathan the funny guy, Imhotep the baddie who only wants his girlfriend back. Some people complain about historic inaccuracies, well... if you want to have an ancient egyptian masterclass, go to the History Channel, this movie's purpose is to entertain, not educate.It's still perfect for a Sunday afternoon with all the family (well, not little kids, it may be a bit too much for them).",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Take That, Boris Karloff","Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz save the world from the undead in this special effects extravaganza.Though reputedly based on the 1932 Universal Pictures classic of the same name that starred Boris Karloff, this movie shares almost nothing in common with the original except for the fact that it features, well, a mummy. Actually, this is much better than the original. It doesn't attempt to be remotely scary, opting instead for a goofy, wise-cracking tone reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies. Of course, it's nowhere near as good as those -- it's not as light on its feet and it's burdened by a hefty load of not very impressive digital effects.

I am a big fan of films that have that great viewing combination of buried treasure and the chase to be the one who finds it first. Add to that adventure film combination a little fun, romance and of course some evil villains and with a good musical score you have all the necessary ingredients to have a big winner at the box office.I enjoyed The Mummy immensely and will most likely catch another run of the film at least a few more times, so get on your camel, wear a bit of sun tan lotion and make sure you have sufficient liquids to survive in the desert and sit back and enjoy this fun adventure.I give it a strong 8 out of 10 IMDB rating.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The only good thing about this rash of remakes (IMHO...Imho-Tep!) is that they focus attention on the originals.  If the ""new"" Mummy hadn't been made we might not have the""old"" Mummy on DVD.

A fun adventure,"This is my review on the first installment of the mummy movies. I remember seeing this when I was younger and just absolutely loving it. As I grew though I figured out that it was not as great as i once thought.This movie is about a man (fraser) who is on death row when he is saved by a lady looking for the city of the dead ""hamunatra"". Fraser says he knows where to find it as hes been there previously. So the women saves him from a certain death sentence so he promised to show her the way. Once there they discover an ancient tomb accompanied by an ancient book. Little to their knowledge the tomb and the book have a curse that they will unknowingly unleash upon the world.This movie is not for everybody. If you are a hardcore movie buff such as myself then you probably wont enjoy it. I enjoy it so much because i grew up with it. The story line is pretty basic and the acting is above average. Im not usually a big fan of fraser but I feel he did an alright job here. This movie is filled with action and thrilling moments. If you have kids this is a great one for them.Overall I say its worth a watch. It is a fun adventure to sit along and go for the ride. Though it is predictable and somewhat cliché I still find it quite enjoyable. If this seems like the movie for you watch it if not best bet is probably don't waste your time.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining,"This is an entertaining adventure movie with some horror elements shoved in there--but think how good it could have been, how much better it could have been if done as a serious horror movie.  Get rid of Brendan Fraser shouting at the mummy and don't emphasize the CGI effects, and it could have been much better.  From what I've heard, Clive Barker was originally asked to take part in this film, the screenwriting to be specific.  That would have been great.  But I can imagine it wouldn't have made as much money, and we all know that's what matters to the corporations.  7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I Am Not a Brendan Frazier Fan!,"This movie was most entertaining and had great art direction and special effects. My problem with it is that it went more for camp than horror; this is not a very scary film. We marvel at the effects and ""look"" of The Mummy, but scared or horrified I was not. See Christopher Lee's The Mummy from 1959 for fright. Also, Brendan Frazier I am not a fan of. He has no subtlety or nuance whatsoever and is like a living cartoon. And that adds to the lack of real terror. I do wish there was more on ancient Egypt; the first scenes dealt with the betryal of Pharoah by his high priest Imhotep - and the art direction and ""look"", as said, were marvelous. Maybe more in a Part II, if ever? And please, more horror and less camp.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The remake of the 1932 movie is a really good demonstration of properly remaking a movie.,"You don't have to see the original movie to enjoy this and while black and white cinema works for the bandages in the earlier movie, the color works splendidly for the deserted landscapes in the 99 movie. The action scenes are a lot of fun with and without special effects and the Mummy known as Imhotep is a truly menacing creature with body movements similar to the T-1000 in its relentlessness. The comedy in between works, too and so do the characters looking for the lost city for treasure before awakening the Mummy through the book of the dead. I will say some of the pacing is a little slow here and there and the blue liquid doesn't blend with anything in the climax. Otherwise, this is a worthy remake.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The second is pure and simple cinematic grave-robbering, only not directed by GUS VAN SANT. No new ideas, no new experiences, good visual effects wasted in pathetic storyline and tedious characters. If it's a horror movie, it is not frightenning. If it's a adventure movie, it's not exciting. If it's a comedy, it's not funny. If it's dramatic, well, it is pathetic.

This is because I knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously like Indiana Jones with that said it is a blast that also throws you curves I didn't expect. It kept me guessing and intrigued. A film that does it's job very well with a mixture of horror and comedy and a sense of adventure that feels very Indiana Jones-ish.

If it was meant to be a comedy, it failed. If it was meant to be action, it failed. If it was meant to be good at all and worth watching, it also failed.The plotline was cliche and amateurly predictable, and too little happened. It seemed as though the filmmaker was relying on the action bits and the graphics to keep the audience happy, rather than making a film with an enjoyable plot line. I had to drag myself through this film. The fact that the film apparently does not take itself seriously does not excuse the absence of a plotline or anything watchable in it.The film is just a few actors milling around, held together by the presence of once mouldy corpse and the odd punch in the face. There isn't enough of anything to make it hold together convincingly.To conclude, don't bother. I was annoyed I spent the time watching it instead of sleeping - not even worth watching once. This is the kind of film I can imagine will be re-watched in sixty years time and the world will wonder what on earth people were thinking when they made this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Hell Of A Fun Ride,"The plot holes might be too glaring to go unnoticed but there's also no denying that The Mummy is one hell of a fun ride. Hilarious, swiftly paced, incredibly entertaining & highly enjoyable, the best thing about this amusing flick is that it's very much aware of its limits, nicely plays to its strengths & never tries to sell itself as something it is not.A loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name, the story of The Mummy is set in Egypt & follows an English librarian who enlists the help of an American adventurer to carry out an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra, only to accidentally unleash an ancient curse which had been laid on a dead High Priest, thus awakening him & dooming the fate of all mankind.Written & directed by Stephen Sommers, the premise has an adventurous tone & is shot in a very light-hearted manner. The visual effects are stunning for its time, performances are fair enough although sluggish on few occasions, editing is slick, music is a big plus & the whole picture is wonderfully humoured from start to finish. Now one can find a lot to complain about but it is at least never boring.On an overall scale, The Mummy may not qualify as a great example of its genre(s) but this adventurous tale of a dig gone wrong nevertheless serves its purpose well by delivering a solid, cheerful entertainment that viewers of all ages can sit back & enjoy. Promising an amazing fun ride that's not meant to be taken seriously, The Mummy is definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Never Convincing or Emotional, but with great effects. **1/2 out of ****","""The Mummy"" is a clone of the ""Indiana Jones"" series that blends adventure with plot twists and first rate suspense. While ""The Mummy"" does accomplish a thing or two with a neat computer animated ""mummy,"" it just doesn't quite work. It's like the old saying goes that it is one thing to respect something, and it is another to like it. I do respect the filmmakers who were hard at work making this production, but something about it was almost repetitive and never truly convincing.There is a story here, it often is unfocused and drifts off from a real point of view, but there is a story nonetheless. It follows the adventures of two brothers, a librarian, several researchers who seemingly have no recollection of consequences that evolve from their mistakes, and a couple other side characters that have no purpose in the film but to become a human victim of a non-human creature who will pick his prey one by one when they are separated from the rest of the clan.  See the formula we are up against; how can we care about the characters when we have already seen these so many more times before hand.The director is Stephen Sommers, who obviously prefers to introduce his characters, then start right off with the plot. We know this because his last film, ""Deep Rising,"" also did the same with its story. I don't think this method quite works. It brings forth many unneeded characters, who in turn we know they will be killed in the order where the whimsy ones go first, then the side character whom we do not know their names; the typical horror film formal. ""The Mummy"" is definitely an improvement over the last movie he directed, but again, just isn't persuasive enough to actually be recommended by myself.The setup takes too long for Sommers to setup. The narrator explains most of the ritualistic events to us at the beginning rather than show us, which makes it very hard to understand. The characters are well developed, while every one of them was obvious in their motives immediately. There are plenty that die, few that live, and a whole lot of boredom in the first twenty minutes while they are introduced.   And lets not forget the overwhelming, vast and good-looking desert in which much of film is shot in. The atmosphere is another great element in this movie, which is eerie and spooky, but never actually terror provoking.Brendon Frasier was a good goof in ""George of the Jungle,"" ""Blast From The Past,"" and several other comedies he has been in the last few years. However ""The Mummy"" is supposed to be scary, suspenseful, and shocking, not comic. This is yet another example of an actor with humorous potential putting it to use when he is supposed to be quite serious. Frasier doesn't even come close with hitting the mark here, mimicking Harrison Fords sense of humor from ""Indiana Jones,"" he just does not have what it takes to be a serious actor.""The Mummy's"" mummy was horrific in the most dastardly of ways. It was gruesome, scary and head tuning. I just wish that he looked like a mummy. For by the time this movie is over, the only mummy left to do the killing is a muscular actor in full flesh. Can't they even live up to the title?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of my favorite movies of all time,"The Mummy is an absolute classic and one of my favorite movies of all time, deserving a perfect 10 out of 10! This film expertly blends humor, adventure, and a touch of horror, making it a thrilling ride from start to finish.From the moment the movie begins, you're drawn into a captivating world filled with ancient mysteries and supernatural threats. The storyline is engaging and cleverly crafted, taking us on a journey to uncover the secrets of the long-buried Imhotep. The balance of action and comedy is masterfully executed, with laugh-out-loud moments that never detract from the film's suspenseful atmosphere.The character development is another standout aspect of The Mummy. Brendan Fraser shines as Rick O'Connell, bringing charm and wit to the role. His chemistry with Rachel Weisz's character, Evelyn, adds depth to their relationship and provides a delightful dynamic throughout the film. The supporting cast, including John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor, also deliver memorable performances that enhance the overall experience.One of the highlights of the film is its fantastic villain, Imhotep, portrayed brilliantly by Arnold Vosloo. His presence is both menacing and intriguing, making him one of the most memorable antagonists in cinematic history. The backstory of his tragic love and desire for power adds layers to his character, making him more than just a typical monster.Visually, The Mummy is stunning, with impressive special effects that bring the ancient Egyptian setting to life. The action sequences are exhilarating, with thrilling chases, breathtaking set pieces, and nail-biting confrontations with mummies and other supernatural creatures. The film's pacing is spot-on, keeping audiences engaged and entertained throughout its runtime.In conclusion, The Mummy is a perfect blend of humor, action, and adventure that remains a timeless classic. Its witty dialogue, engaging storyline, and memorable characters make it a must-watch for anyone who loves a good escapade. I wholeheartedly give it a 10 out of 10! This film is an unforgettable journey that never fails to entertain, and it holds a special place in my heart as one of the best movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Mummy is a great movie, enough said.","The Mummy may not seem like a movie worthy of a 7/10 rating but that's only because viewers don't take the time to look at the movie with an open mind. The Mummy was an action movie that involved not only comedy but also a sense of adventure. This movie deserves more applause than it originally received. The Mummy didn't necessarily have the best plot or even the greatest acting, but a movie cannot be judged on those two characteristics alone. A movie should be judged on what you take away from it. What I took away from this movie was that it was funny, exciting, and original. That is enough in my opinion to qualify The Mummy as a great movie. Even if you've seen the movie once or twice try to watch it again and see what you take away from the movie, then judge it as you see fit.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good, not great","Though the special effects were quite good, the plot was quite marginal (even for a film that wasn't believable in the first place).One television critic described Brendan Fraser as the next Harrison Ford.

Running fast and moving backwards...,"This remake in name only of the 1932 Karloff movie of the same name is one of those blockbusters churned out by the studios each summer: slick, glossy, high-concept, and loaded with special effects which dispense with the need for any A-list stars. It demands nothing of the viewer other than the ability to follow the simplest of plots  ""What's the plan?"" asks rummy pilot Winston of our hero O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) at one point. ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world,"" replies O'Connell, and you can almost hear some secretary buzzing her faceless studio exec boss each September and reminding him it's time to get rolling on another of those 'save the damsel, kill the bad guy, save the world' flicks the kids like so much. The studios have created something of a rod for their own backs, however; each year, they have to outdo the previous year's product, which means ever greater effects  at the expense, of course, of such luxuries as plot and characterisation. That's not to say The Mummy is a bad film  it's not. It does exactly what it sets out to do which isn't to create a work of any artistic or creative merit but to provide the multiplex crowd with a visceral experience that they will tell their friends is 'cool' and 'awesome'. The film succeeds impressively at this. They will tell their friends it 'rocks', and then forget all about it after they see the next one off the production line. In 1984 Kyle Reese told Sarah Connor: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."" Fifteen years later Ardeth Bay tells Rick O'Connell: ""This creature is a bringer of death. He will never eat, he will never sleep, he will never stop."" That's how far we've come.See what a lifetime of watching movies does to you? It turns you into a cynic. You begin to learn too much about the films you see, in a sense, so that it takes more than a few explosions and special effects to impress you. The trick is to switch off sometimes, to just let the whole experience roll over you like a gigantic noisy tidal wave that demands nothing of you other than to be swept away by its magnitude.This one stars Brendan Fraser, a strange leading man; he hasn't been out of work for fifteen years, and in that time he has starred in a string of critical and/or commercial successes and yet his name refuses to become a truly major one in the industry. It's as if he's cursed. He plays former legionnaire Rick O'Connell in this one, languishing in an Egyptian jail until he is saved from hanging by Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), the world's sexiest librarian, in order that he can help her and her cowardly brother (John Hannah) to find the hidden city of Hamunaptra, where a unimaginable evil waits to be unleashed upon the world. Of course, unleashed it is, and we are subsequently treated to a succession of CGI effects that, six years on, range from mildly impressive to distinctly dodgy as our heroes dash from one predicament to another. It's all good mindless fun at first, A Raiders of the Lost Ark for a new generation, but with more emphasis on violence and gunplay and SFX. O'Connell is no smarter than Indiana Jones was, he's just a reactive hero who leaves all the thinking to the pretty Weisz, who is agreeably cute as the naïve and gullible Evelyn. Unfortunately, the constant fleeing from an assortment of perils that make up the whole of the second half of this movie grows increasingly tiresome after a while. I started growing impatient for the ending rather than worrying over the fate of Rick and Evelyn.All in all this is a fairly harmless film, an insignificant way to spend a couple of hours if you're going to watch this on the big screen. If you're going to watch this on TV, you're going to inevitably focus more on the acting and characterisation, the plot and continuity (which is truly atrocious at times) and the editing. Don't. Turn off that analytical part of your mind and watch with your eyes only. If you do that you're sure to have a lot of fun",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But, anyway, with that out of the way I also think I did myself a favour because I had gotten my expectations of the film so low, that when it turned out to be quite enjoyable,quick and funny I was so pleasantly surprised it made go right out and see the sequel, which too beat my expectations.

An absolute adventure classic,"Stephen Sommer's The Mummy is a rip roaring adventure flick of the very best kind. It's got that timeless dime store novel vibe and is there for the main purpose of entertaining the bejesus out of us for two hours of popcorn movie bliss. I'll no doubt get so hate for it, but I enjoy it more than any Indiana Jones flick out there. It's just too much fun, peppered with sassy humor whenever it stops for breath. Rachel Weisz seemed like a pretty grounded choice to play Evelyn, the flighty archaeologist who discovers an artifact leading to the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra, where supernatural forces lie in wait. Brendan Fraser in his pretty boy heyday plays Rick O Connell, the dashing soldier of fortune who tags leads their pack with riches in mind. Little do they know, the cursed ghost of High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) haunts the remains and has nasty plans for anyone that crosses his vision. Vosloo's dark charisma makes for a wicked antagonist with just the right notes of sympathy, and they really have fun with the special effects, as he turns the forces of nature against out heroes in fantastical scenes that rival Arwen bringing that river to life. The cast is full of hidden treasure character actors including John Hannah as Evelyn's cheapskate brother, Jonathan Hyde as a snooty historian with probably the funniest line in the film, Kevin J. O Connor as Rick's sniveling war buddy, Oded Fehr as the leader of a mysterious band of warriors, Erick Avari as Asa museum curator, Patricia Velasquez as Imhotep's foxy lost love and Bernard Fox in a chortlong, scene stealing turn as a drunken war pilot. Despite having elements of horror, the tone is persistently light, and flies along with terrific humor, swashbuckling and a sense of old world entertainment that can't be beat. A comfort movie for me, must have for any collection and a classic in the stable of 90's films.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still great in 2017,"Amazingly a lot of action, adventure and some fun in it!From beginning to end, The Mummy is very simple, and not one second of it is incomprehensible to a young audience member. The pacing is great; the buildup to the resurrection is actually a great success, and the adventures that ensue are horrifying, hilarious, and adventurous. Brendan Frasier gives a very nice performance as Rick O'Connell, and Rachael Weisz is just as good as Evey. For what he's given, Arnold Vosloo is very menacing as Imhotep, and Oded Fehr's character could have used more screen time to allow us to appreciate him more -- though plenty of that is in the second. The action flows, and is shot very well. The special effects are really good, and I don't think there has ever been a cooler-looking mummy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is decent enough to warrant a buy, though not nearly as sweeping as it could have been, it's still a decent collection of music",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A punk rock version of the 1932 movie of the same name,"The Mummy stars Brendan Fraser, and Rachel Weisz. The film is set in 1925 and involves a group of archeologists who are hunting for the lost ancient city of Hamunaptra. However the group accidently awakens an ancient mummy who begins wreaking havoc in order to find his long lost girlfriend. This movie is loosely adapted from the 1932 movie and it has nothing to do with the Mummy starring Tom Cruise. I'm not going to talk about the Mummy with Tom Cruise because that's another review for another day. But this version of the Mummy will always be better than previous one we got, but I never saw the original let alone heard of it so I can't really compare the two. But this Mummy feels like it was a passion project from director Stephen Sommers. And while the jokes feel like they were just made up on the spot or maybe it tries too hard to be Indiana Jones, it is entertaining. Before the Uncharted games were released this is what Uncharted would've looked liked. And somewhere deep in my brain led me to believe that Stephen Sommers directed his own Uncharted movie which he made a sequel later. And a couple of years later someone from Naughty Dog watched the Mummy and decided to the movie into a video game franchise. And Brendan Fraser was also the inspiration of Nathan Drake, who brings humor to the movie. And occasionally it feels like he's trying way too hard to be romantic or portray Indiana Jones, you can't hate on the person. This movie came out in 1999, and for a time the special effects team did an amazing job creating the Mummy and all the other special effects involved. But when you watch it now, it feels outdated compared to the special effects we have today, but its still entertaining no matter how awful you think it seems. So in the end, The Mummy is a solid adventure movie that lacks humor and romance, but it makes up for its special effects that I would like to think would make Boris Karloff proud.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crappy movie,"This must have been the worst film I've ever had the displeasure to see. Lousy acting (e.g. the scene were Evelyn was drunk should be shown to every acting student as an example of how it should *not* be done) and a lousy plot (that mummy sure makes some stupid mistakes in the heat of the fight). The director messed up the mix of humour and adventure. It must be that the humour was aimed at 12-year old boys, 'cause I was sometimes ashamed to watch their wooden efforts. And I could go on like this for more than 20 lines. The only positive thing about the movie was the beautiful and scantily clad Patricia Velasquez as the pharaoh's mistress (Hey,  I'm a red-blooded male; I have my weak points too).I gave it a 1/10 (and that would have been a 0 if the voting system here allowed it)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Interesting If Flawed Remake That's Marginally Better Than The Original,"It's taken me 13 years to watch this movie because, basically, I didn't like the original version! Of all the ""classic"" Universal horror movies, I thought 1932's ""The Mummy"" was the weakest. Aside from a great performance by Boris Karloff, it just wasn't that good. Universal knew how to make good horror movies, but what they so often did so right, they so totally failed at with ""The Mummy."" It wasn't exciting, it wasn't fun and it wasn't frightening. A horror movie, to be a horror movie, has to have at least one of those three things going for it. And, since remakes generally aren't as good as the original, I avoided this one like the plague until now. I'm pleasantly surprised, in that I actually thought this was marginally better than the 1932 version.What went wrong in 1932 did not go wrong in 1999. This movie was exciting - it was packed with action and had some great effects. This movie was fun - it had a tongue in cheek quality to it, and the performances (especially from leads Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) captured that tongue in cheek quality perfectly. And, at times at least, it was frightening. At least Imhotep was a ghastly, frightening being - not at all like the Imhotep of the original, who could have walked down the streets of Cairo with no one knowing who he was or thinking there was anything strange about him! So a lot of the problems were fixed, and made this pleasant watching.It was not, however, without problems. Essentially, it went a bit overboard. In particular, the last half hour - featuring all of Imhotep's mummified and dessicated but re-animated priests was a little bit ridiculous, and I have to confess that the point at which they appeared was the point at which my attention started to wander. The opening, which featured a helpful journey back to ancient Egypt and explained how Imhotep got into this position, was also perhaps a wee bit too long, but it didn't cause me to wander. Those mummified priests in the last half hour didn't work for me.When the last half hour of a movie causes you to lose a bit of interest - that's a problem. Overall, I enjoyed this, and I did think it marginally better than the original. For the 1932 version, I awarded a 5. Since this is - in my opinion - marginally better - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The ancient Egypt is portrays is an unimaginative fantasy written by people with no interest or knowledge of history for people with similar ignorance. Only the greedy plundering of the treasures by 1920s ersatz archeologists is halfway accurate.The ending is lifted from an old movie called Land of the Pharohs.This is not a remake, as it bears little similarity to the Boris Karloff classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertainment at its zenith,"I am watching this movie for the first time since I watched it in a theater 22 years ago, and I am nor sure if it's nostalgia, but it has aged incredibly well. Humor, action and thrills are put together in perfect harmony. The pace, the production value, editing, even the comedic and stunt timing of the actors is flawless. The actors all look great, and they are at the peak of their careers.It's classic Hollywood in every frame, perhaps it's the reason why it looked old fashioned, even when it came out at the end of the 90s. Now it's timeless. Everyone who worked in this film should be proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, solid and most importantly FUN entertainment","The Mummy is truly one of those movies that you can watch again and again. The plot is pretty flimsy however the writers are well aware of this and although the film does not generate into a full blown spoof there is vibe all the way through the film that everyones 'in on the joke'. The Mummy's charm lies in that although it is light-hearted you're never left in a situation where you wouldn't be rooting for the hero.Meanwhile Brendan Fraser puts in a great performance as Rick O'Connell and proves that he is guy who can handle the demands of stunt and effects heavy film. Rachel Weisz is good too as the clumsy librarian Evelyn. The real stars though are the supporting actors. John Hannah is absolutely hilarious as Evelyn's brother Jonathan and manages to steel every scene he's in with a brilliant one-liner, in fareness though Weisz and Fraser seem aware of this and have no trouble reinforcing each punch-line's impact. Oded Fehr is great too as a descendant of the Phaoroah's bodyguard he too has some great lines and like the others maintains a degree of sincerity without ever taking himself too seriously.The effects are great too and there are some cracking set-pieces most notably the one on the steam boat and the opening battle at Hamunaptra. In all the action scenes though there is an emphasis on making it fun and not too brutal, this I think gives the film a more wide ranging appeal - even if it is let down slightly by the inevitable romance between Evelyn and Rick which is not done quite as well as the rest of the film although it still has humorous moments.Overall? Well worth two hours of your time if you have or haven't seen it - 8 out of ten.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not quite Indiana Jones and the Lost  City in the Sand,"The Mummy is a bit like how Indiana Jones might have looked if Hammer had made it with a big budget. Of course, it has rather more humour than Hammer would muster but it is an American summer blockbuster. What is surprising for a summer hit is that it is coherent and has a plot, albeit a simple one.It is 4000BC and Egypt is mighty. A great pharaoh rules and beside him his concubine, whom none but the monarch may so much as touch. Ah! But envy, lust and greed conspire against the pharaoh and he discovers his beautiful concubine trying on the head priest for size. Oh but what's this? They love each other, they say. Tough, says the pharaoh. Oops, scratch one pharaoh. Then scratch one head priest and concubine at the hands of the vengeful bodyguards. But death is not enough for the head priest. He is cursed to be the living dead.Still here, okay, jump forward to 1929, take one ex-foreign legionnaire just in from the desert with a treasure map showing the way to an ancient Egyptian necropolis, add one fresh faced, pretty English archaeologist and her roguish brother, and send them all off to find the loot.Of course, other parties are interested in the booty and nobody knows that amongst the loot is the cursed tomb. Right next to the loot actually. So close in fact that it is mistaken for it and the silly lot open the head priest's sarcophagus. From here on in it is monsters, chases and, rather interestingly, plagues.The gradual regeneration of the mummy from rotting corpse to general bad character at large is a triumph of computer work - no plodding baddie wrapped in rotting bandages here, you know. Brendan Fraser's character is a bit thin but he performs well enough. Rachel Weisz is very good but then her character has a bit more, er, character. Okay, the idea is preposterous and the people only semi believable, but it is fun and has a plot. That, in the summer, is very rare indeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A fairly fun movie that doesn't know what it wants to be.,"The Mummy is a passable attempt at a rollicking fantasy adventure. However, the film could have been much more.  The acting is average, although Brendan Fraser does surprisingly well as the roguish hero.  The plot is straightforward, and the action keeps up throughout the film.  But there is something missing from this film.  Some of the action is quite gruesome, as if the filmmakers were taking a stab at true horror.  However, the scenes seem out of place with most of the rest of the film.  One never really gets any feeling of deep supernatural evil from the bad guys, so when they do horrible things it just seems like cheap thrills.  Yet the film is not really funny enough to match the standard set by Indiana Jones.  Overall, an enjoyable film, but destined for the dust bin of film history.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I think I missed the boat on this one,"I didn't see The Mummy when it first came out, and am catching up 25 years later. I don't know...it just wasn't for me. I felt like it was pretty repetitive, especially in the second half. The good guys find themselves in an impossible situation with dead bodies trying to kill them, and manage to just escape. The visual effects in this didn't seem much more advanced from Raiders of the Lost Ark almost 20 years earlier. I did like Rachel Weisz in this one. I'd be curious to know if this movie helped or hurt Egyptian tourism. I could see people being spooked to travel to Giza. I guess I saw it too late but it was meh for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another great adventure film!,"From Brendan Frasier's wisecracks to the climactic sword-fighting scene, The Mummy doesn't disappoint.

Eventually they find it, but also a centuries old mummy who proceeds to kill them off one by one.This is a truly epic movie, that never causes you to lose your attention.

The epitome of how to make a fun and unforgettable remake,"The Mummy was one of my favorite movies growing up when I was about 10-12 years old. I remember watching it a bunch of times since Fox would show it all the time and we had the DVD of it. Fast forward 15 years later and now I'm watching it for the first time again and it still gives me the same amazing feeling it did back then. This movie instilled the fascination of movies in me. The Mummy is one of the best examples of how you make a great remake while still keeping it fun. The CGI, although a bit dated, actually holds up and looks quite impressive. It's a wonderfully put together movie that's very cinematic and large in scale. The way the movie doesn't take itself seriously by using self aware humor and silliness is one of the best aspects about it. It has this lighthearted charm to it that makes it feel very human and alive. It's got exhilarating action adventure, suspenseful elements of horror, moments of romance and playful comedy - and on top of that - it's fun! I mean what more could you want from a movie?It does a great job at building its moments of horror and suspense. There's some genuinely creepy/scary moments throughout. Especially with the use of music and sound design/effects that helps elevate these moments. Tight writing and editing makes this a super fast-paced movie with exceptionally good pacing. I find it remarkable how it's an action adventure movie but also a comfort watch. It has this lighthearted, good-natured playful charm to it that's impossible not to love. The filming locations and set designs are fantastic.Brendan Fraser is amazing in this movie. One of his best roles - he owns it. The way he has this boyish charm about him while also being funny, badass and the leading hero at the same time is something I admire and find inspiring. This is the movie that made me fall in love with the guy. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as well. I had a massive crush on her the first time I watched this movie, and still do years later. She has a very charming, cute and innocent way about her character. The chemistry between Fraser and Weisz is fantastic. Every single character in this movie has personality and charisma. Each one has their own characteristics and qualities to them that set them apart from one another and make them memorable and human.The Mummy is the epitome of good ole' popcorn fun with a great cohesive story. An exciting adventure film that truly delivers an escape from the mundane day to day. A fantastic comfort movie that's a lot of fun. This is a must-watch! Highly highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dead on Arrival,"Horror and science fiction movies are among my guilty pleasures. So I was looking forward to a new version of ""The Mummy."" I was really disappointed.This movie does not frighten. It does not excite. It certainly does not entertain. Not only the special effects, but apparently the story as well, were created by a computer. The FX were were often awful because the computer graphics were so obvious. I am beginning to think that computer FX are an increasing problem because what looks great on a 20"" inch monitor looks truly fake on a 60' wide theater screen.Brendan Frasier reverted to his George of the Jungle personna, which was another disappointment.I could say more, but why waste more time? [Oh, yes, why do some theaters install splendid digital sound systems and then play them so loud that you could get nerve deafness? The real advantage of a digital system is that you can pick up all the sounds without cranking the volume up all the way.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Fun Adventure Movie,"'The Mummy' tells the story of a gaggle of differing characters in 1920's Egypt who, for varying reasons and each with their own agenda, travel to the ancient city of Hamunaptra. Once there, a series of events leads to the resurrection of an ancient high priest with astonishing powers.This is most definitely an adventure movie in the same vein as that of 'Indiana Jones'. It has some great action sequences, some fantastic humour, the characters are engaging and the potting is spot on. It keeps attention throughout whilst never dragging out for too long. The real strength of this movie is the neatly placed comedy and that, despite its fairly self-aware OTT subject matter, it delivers some genuine moments of shock. Definitely a rollicking ride for all the family; it will keep you very entertained no matter what age.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Poor Man's Indiana Jones? Not Quite.,"I used to think that this movie was a poor man's ""Indiana Jones"". After rewatching it, my opinion has changed (slightly). Though it has flaws, ""The Mummy"" is a highly entertaining and pretty funny movie. The humor is unique to the genre and one of the highlights of the film.I liked the characters quite a bit, though there were too many of them. Also, the power dynamics between those characters shifted often and without explanation, which I found confusing.The movie falls into cheesy territory more than once, but they lean into the it. The acting is clunky and the story jumps around conveniently, which is a little frustrating. All problems aside, Brendan Fraser is a delight to watch and so is Rachel Weisz. Imhotep is frightening, the bugs are terrifying and the visual effects are pretty solid for the late-90's. I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed ""The Mummy"".Best Character: Evelyn

Everything in this movie is fun and the acting from Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo are nothing short of extraordinary! Okay, I might have exaggerated a bit but still The Mummy is my favorite film of all time.After awakening a mummy (Arnold Vosloo) back from the dead, two strangers (Rick O'connell and Evelyn Carnahan) have to undone their mistake and stop the mummy from gaining power and killing humans.Now, people are saying this is like Indiana Jones and trust me that it isn't like Indiana Jones at all but instead it is replaced with something better than what Indiana Jones could have ever done! Note: This film is my most watched film of all time. I think I have watched this like 21 times and counting.Final thoughts: The fun in this movie is excruciating and thats quite a good thing. I really loved The Mummy returns and i consider that the best sequel after Terminator 2: Judgment Day",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"**1/2: Fun, but nothing remarkable","Admit it. The Mummy is one of the most derivative,predictable, and unoriginal movies around. It uses every old plot device and cliche from a hundred adventure movies, and stuffs them into two hours of special effects...but does it REALLY well. It's a lot of fun to watch, as long as you can get past that simple fact. There really isn't anything in this movie we haven't seen before, but we've probably never seen it done quite this well.It's very much in the spirit of the Indiana Jones movies (heck, Brendan Fraser really just plays Indy in a different job...and without a hat). I admire Brendan Fraser as an actor, and his performance is definitely one of the best things about The Mummy. The effects were nice too, but personally, I don't think digital effects have gotten to the point where you can make a fully CG character that doesn't look at least a little bit like a cartoon, so the effects didn't impress me all that much. Call me jaded. Besides, effects aren't the reason I go to see a movie. I want to be told an entertaining story. And The Mummy delivers on that point, for the most part.Overall, The Mummy is nothing new or particularly remarkable, but it's a pretty good way to spend an afternoon.

I wasted two hours watching one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.I approach movies two different ways.  One is two be entertained and enlightened, the second is to be only entertained.  For this movie I chose the latter.I was not entertained.To try and excuse a movies poor acting, plot, and story by saying we should watch movies to be entertained and nothing more, is weak.  How deaf do I have to be to miss hearing overused cliches.  How stupid do I have to be to excuse ideas stolen from: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and the Ten Commandments. And how blind do I have to be to miss poor special effects. Be assured people, the special effects were no better than in Raiders of the lost Ark.  However, millions of dollars weren't spent making that Nazis face melt.Why are the Yanks in this picture Cowboys?  Were Americans still taming the Wild West in 1920's.  Perhaps the vast open plains of the good ol' U.S. weren't satisfying enough.  Hey, if I think hard I seem to recall an old Saturday Morning Classic ""Roy Rogers and the Nile.""The gags in this movie were old, the jokes tired.  I laughed more at the people in the theatre who thought this junk was funny.Is there a formula machine in Hollywood that creates garbage like this. If so I have a wonerful tale about a benevolent Flower Pot salesman who travels back in time to steal Jesse James gun in an attempt to stop the first daylight bank robbery, that I'd like to give a try in such a machine.The only thing that stopped me from walking out were the two fat women sitting on the ends of the aisle blocking my path.When it comes down it people will be entertained by things they enjoy.

CGI overkill,"First off, I was never bored with this movie.  There's almost nonstop action and great special effects, but I can't recommend it.  The story is ooooollllllddddd.

The dialogue is pathetic; the acting--well, who cares about acting in a summer movie (by the way, it's lousy); and nonstop special effects.  That's the problem.  It's way too special effects heavy. You're constantly being bombarded with reanimated corpses, sand storms, locusts, flesh-eating beetles, etc. etc. etc.  It just wears you down after awhile.  At a few points I just prayed for the effects to stop and have a plot take over.  But then when people DID stop and talk the dialogue was so mindbogglingly awful, I prayed for the special effects!  So, if you don't mind a plot as old as the mummy itself, lousy acting and special effects bombarding you constantly, this is your movie.  Otherwise stay far, far away.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""The Mummy"" (1999) - A Thrilling Blend of Adventure, Horror, and Humor","""The Mummy,"" directed by Stephen Sommers, is a delightful rollercoaster of a film that combines action, adventure, horror, and humor in a way that harkens back to the classic Hollywood blockbusters of the past. Released in 1999, this modern reimagining of Universal's 1932 horror classic delivers thrills and excitement with a charming blend of Indiana Jones-style escapades and supernatural intrigue.The story follows Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), an American adventurer, who teams up with librarian and aspiring archaeologist Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her bumbling brother Jonathan (John Hannah) to uncover the secrets of Hamunaptra, the ancient City of the Dead. Unbeknownst to them, their discovery leads to the accidental resurrection of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a cursed high priest who unleashes a reign of terror in his quest to reunite with his long-lost love, Anck-su-Namun.Brendan Fraser shines as Rick O'Connell, delivering a charismatic and physically impressive performance that solidifies him as a classic action hero. Fraser perfectly balances the humor and heroism required for the role, making Rick both relatable and larger-than-life. Rachel Weisz brings intelligence and wit to Evelyn, whose curiosity and bravery make her more than just a damsel in distress. The chemistry between Fraser and Weisz adds an engaging dynamic to the film, and their banter provides some of its most entertaining moments.The supporting cast also excels, particularly John Hannah, whose comedic timing as Jonathan adds a light-hearted touch to the film. Arnold Vosloo's portrayal of Imhotep is both menacing and sympathetic, lending depth to a character who could have easily been a one-dimensional villain. His presence on screen is formidable, and the special effects used to bring Imhotep's cursed form to life were groundbreaking at the time.Visually, ""The Mummy"" is a feast for the eyes, with impressive set designs, sweeping desert landscapes, and thrilling action sequences. The CGI, while dated by today's standards, was cutting-edge for its time and still holds up reasonably well, particularly in the creation of Imhotep's various monstrous forms and the massive sandstorms he conjures.The film's score, composed by Jerry Goldsmith, complements the epic scale of the story, enhancing both the action and the more eerie, suspenseful moments. The blend of rousing orchestral themes and haunting motifs adds to the film's adventurous and supernatural atmosphere.""The Mummy"" stands out for its ability to mix genres seamlessly. It's an action-packed adventure that never takes itself too seriously, embracing its pulpy roots with a tongue-in-cheek sensibility that keeps the audience entertained from start to finish. The blend of horror elements-like the resurrected mummies and the various ancient curses-with light-hearted adventure ensures that the film appeals to a wide audience.However, the film isn't without its flaws. The pacing can be uneven at times, and some of the characters, particularly the supporting villains, feel underdeveloped. Additionally, the reliance on CGI means that some effects haven't aged as well as others, though this doesn't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.In conclusion, ""The Mummy"" is a highly entertaining film that successfully combines action, adventure, horror, and humor into a cohesive and enjoyable experience. Brendan Fraser's star-making performance, combined with memorable characters, thrilling set pieces, and a fun, adventurous spirit, makes ""The Mummy"" a beloved classic that continues to delight audiences more than two decades after its release.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not Raiders of the Lost Ark, but fun anyway","A pretty young Egyptologist and her ne'er-do-well brother are guided by young adventurer Brendan Fraser to the legendary City of the Dead, where she hopes to find an ancient book and her brother hopes to find treasure. When she reads a passage from the book, a cursed Mummy awakes and set out to recover his bodily fluids and his long-lost love and to take power over the world. How Fraser and friends foil his attempt makes for plenty of good comic-book action.This film had a lot more laughs than I expected. Even some of the action scenes included comic bits. The performances were good, and the special effects were pretty impressive, too. It's not an all-time classic, but it was much better than some newspaper reviews have said.

Good action movie,"This movie is a remake of the old classic ""The Mummy"" movie. But of course, they changed alot of things around. Which is good. Why bother with making a remake if you're just going to make it exactly like the old one? If you're gonna do a remake, why not do it with some style? And this is what this movie accomplishes. Instead of a horror movie, we are given an action/adventure movie, with much fitting comedic elements. But there are some creepy moments in the film, and I have to say I would be interested in seeing a horror movie based on this story. But for now, this will do.Brendan Fraser plays Rock O'Connell; a mercenary hired by some unknown group. After he gets chased away from the city of the dead, hamunaptra, by ghosts he is sent to jail when he arrives in Cairo, for trying to have ""a good time"". Enter: Jonathan (Brilliantly played by John Hannah) who just happens to steal a nifty little gadget from Rick's pocket while visiting the Cairo jail. He shows it to his sister, Evelyn, and she recognizes it to be of some importance. They manage to get Rick out of jail, and in return he has to lead them to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead.On their way to Hamunaptra they stumble upon another adventure and treasure seeking party, which is most unfortunate, because it is this reckless group that eventually let loose the title character: The Mummy. The Mummy's, or Imhotep's (that's his real name), mission is to destroy all living beings on earth, starting with those who let him loose. Now it's up to Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan to stop him before he can accomplish his goal.The story is good enough to keep the movie going, and it's not in the least confusing which means we'll get a semi-braindead action film without any hassle of lack of story or to much action. The movie is a perfect mix between plot and action sequences, and this is great thanks to the director Stephen Sommers. This movie is definetly worth a rent, or even a buy if you take a shine to it. And if you liked this movie, I also recommend the sequel: The Mummy Returns, which continues in the same style as this movie.8/10 - Perfect mix of storyline and action gives us a really, really good action/adventure movie with some really funny scenes thrown in here and there.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A brilliant parody of the action/horror genre,"Reading the most highly-rated comments for this film, I've seen many praising the action and the ""fun-factor"". But none have highlighted what for me takes this film to a higher level, which is the way that it adroitly and subtly sends up every mummy/horror/action film in the genre.It is a masterpiece: the progressing bullet-holes in the paddle-steamer's side, about to take Fraser's head off; the salute as the bi-plane sinks into the sand; the dismembered arm reaching for the sword at *just* the right moment. It is simply the most ingenious parody I have ever seen -- and it does it all with such grace that most viewers never even noticed.But for those who are aware of it, there are a few signposts to show that this parody is intentional. The one that stands out in my mind is the camp-fire that flickers every time someone mentions something otherworldly, until one of the characters remarks, ""That happens a lot around here, doesn't it?""This film is comic timing at its best. Rachel Weisz, Brendan Fraser and John Hannah are clearly having a ball, and who can blame them? This film has it all -- action, comedy, great lines and a hot librarian.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Why not just set it in the present, I wonder? Oh yeah, Indiana Jones.The best summary, I suppose, is given by the beefcake hero: ""Save the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""

"Good, but a ""rip off of style""","The film industry is running dry when it comes to style, technique, and stories.  ""The Mummy"" is a good film.  I personally found it quite entertaining (I'd say 7 out of 10 stars).  But I'm not making a comment on how entertaining the film was.The director, Stephen Sommers, borrowed the style for the film.  The Mummy starts out very original but as the film progresses it suddenly developed a mood, look, and feel that reminded me of something.  When I thought about it I realized what it was.  The script and directing style slowly turned into the same as Sam Raimi (Evil Dead I, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness).Suddenly the film shifts tracks from an intense horror film where you are on the end of your seat, waiting to get scared and fall in or out of you seat; to a horror film with slap sticky zombie mummies loosing limbs and doing Three Stooges style humor (Ala Evil Dead I & II and Army of Darkness).  At one point a mummy's hand gets chopped off and it crawls around and tries to kill the hero (Brendan Friser).  The film also has the ""magic books"" that raise the dead.  Now normally these characteristics slip into film and you can't say ""Hey that's like in..."" But this film is crammed full of Sam Raimi traits.  All the film needed was a chain saw wheedling Bruce Campbell-isc character and they would be in a position to be sued.Now I'm not saying that the film is not good, it is a very entertaining film.  What I am saying is the following:The film is a step up from Stephen Sommers' last film Deep Rising.If you are a Sam Raimi fan and would be offended by seeing his style of writing directing don't see the Mummy, or see it and complain to all your friends.If you are a Sam Raimi fan and would be pleased to see some one use his style see the film.If you have or are going to see the film, see Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness, or any other Sam Raimi film so you can see the similarities.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So when he fights the mummies with his bare hands, it is believable. Rachel Weisz as Evy is also a perfect match for him. She is equally funny, charming and smart. They both have amazing chemistry on screen.Now the actual Mummy, priest Imhotep played by Arnold Vosloo is a strong movie villain. He has scary, intimidating presence on screen and the director did a great job with his transformation and how it builds tension as we get close to the climax of the movie.Other supporting cast is equally amazing and add to the story. The music and background score is fantastic. The VFX are slightly outdated but don't distract from the movie experience.Overall, it's a complete package. This movie deserves to be remembered as one of the best of the 90s.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A classic!,"A classic movie, and possibly the best in the mummy genre! Brendan Fraser at his best. The movie can be cheesy at times but it's from the 90s, and the animation doesn't hold up, buts it's a great story! so don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
goofy fun,"Ok, so this isn't Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it is a fun movie.  Lots of action, plenty of jumps for the easily scared, nice graphics to ogle at and a (in my opinion) genuinely fun idea (even if it is amazingly close to a short story I wrote several years ago....but that's another rant).So, I liked this film.

The best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies.,"My Take: It's tons of fun and what else should it be?Summer movies have become too complicated over its last few years. But THE MUMMY brings back the old-fashioned action movie tradition. They have this belief that the old-school feel still works, and it really does. THE MUMMY may not be a totally perfect summer movie, but it's still darn good ""can't take your eyes of the screen"" entertainment, but the best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies. Whether it's adventure, thrills, horror, suspense and laughs, THE MUMMY makes all these formulas work and work together forming a delightful summer blockbuster that delivers entertainment that aren't just special effects.The opening sequence features, perhaps, one of the best and most convincing shot of an Egyptian civilization. It was such a convincing combination of model shots, matte effects and actual shots that its believable. It is perhaps one of the best recreation of ancient Egypt since, perhaps, the large-scale sets in Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in 1956, which we now know is only made in a studio. This one was actually more convincing, including shots of large pyramids and the crowds and chariots. This opening introduces the Pharaoh's head priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who has an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress. As punishment, he is to be mummified alive, having flesh-eating beetles feed on his flesh.This is then changed in to the usual formula of old-fashioned adventure flicks wherein they must find the ancient lost city, uncover its untold wealth and leads to the deadly curse. Then they add the explorers' curiosities which unlocks the deadly curse and unleashes the mummy Imhotep loose on earth. Let the good times roll!The action sequences get a bit silly (even with the spectacular effects) and the storyline borderline ridiculous, but that's just the point. THE MUMMY is a throwback to the good ol' action-adventures of yore, and frankly, there's not much of them to go around anymore. Brendan Fraser (as Indiana Jones-inspired Rick O'Connell) and Rachel Weisz (as the adorable intrepid Evelyn), and some adorable witty dialog manage to occupy as much screen-time as the action and suspense. The action sequences, of course, are terrific in their own way. The sight of a creatures' face suddenly rise above the sand is some show of terrific special effects (and to think seeing a sandstorm up close is amazing enough).Along with INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE MUMMY is perhaps one of the decades loudest, most exciting, most gimmicky summer action movie of its decade. Just like the other said film, I enjoyed the film more than just for its special-effects. This one has story, characters and a celebration of screen excitement (all good), a bunch of elements much needed, especially to today's summer flicks. THE MUMMY, perhaps, may be among the few special effects-bound movies were I don't criticize the special effects, which usually becomes the centerpiece in summer movies. This one has story to go along with it, and, boy, was it a good one.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Let's bury this movie.,"""The Mummy"" is horrible in every possible way. After seeing this, I stopped blaming people who say they lost faith in Hollywood.I've never seen such a mind-numbing, racist, overblown waste of time since ""Batman and Robin"". What do people like about these movies? They're fun? Is frying ants with a magnifying glass fun?In my short life, I've probabley seen about 300 movies with a spot of dialouge not unlike Brendan Frasers line ""Oh no, we're in trouble"", when faced with a huge disaster mere seconds away. I've found better pieces of acting in my stool sample.What a cliche ridden, poorly acted, one joke piece of garbage. This is the kind of movie that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" should feature. And their making a sequel? Who's staring? Corey Feldman?",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An utter blast!,"""The Mummy"" is an awesome action flick and one of my favorite movies. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. It has all the elements for a great, fun popcorn flick: humor (plenty of it!), action (plenty of that, too!), and special effects. It also has a touch of suspense and spookiness that makes it even more enjoyable. The acting overall was great, the one small downside being that Brendan Fraser spoke in a monotone part of the time, but that's just a minor nitpick. Everyone else was stellar. I especially loved Rachel Weisz in the drunken librarian scene.Two big highlights for me were the special effects and the score. The special effects I thought were quite impressive. Imhotep's step-by-step regeneration was well done, and the sandstorm definitely deserves a mention. I also liked the score, especially Imhotep's theme. The great music, I think, is one of the things that was sorely missed in the sequel.I have to mention just one thing about ""The Mummy"" that bugs me: a few errors regarding the ancient Egyptian information in the movie. The main one that always makes me cringe is when Evelyn is telling Rick about mummification and she informs him that ""...they took out the heart as well."" This is incorrect. The ancient Egyptians left the heart in the body, as they believed that it, not the brain, was the center of thought and emotion and that it would be needed for the body to be resurrected in the next world. (I'm sorry if someone's already brought that up; I didn't have time to read through all the comments!)Overall, I highly recommend ""The Mummy."" It's an extremely fun, fast-paced, entertaining movie! I give it 4 and a half out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Mummy Returns,"I saw 'The Mummy' on opening day, and it is a pretty cool movie. The beginning is pretty interesting, and Brendan Frasier's character provides the action.

Editing error,When Evelyn is in the Museum of Antiquities (library) in the beginning of the movie she drops the book when trying to reach across the isle to place it on the T shelf and the ladder becomes horizontal.

Brought back so many memories!,"This one brought back a plethora of childhood memories. The Mummy was one of those early movies that introduced me to the realm of Hollywood when I was a just a little kid.Not only that, but it also opened the door to a vast body of knowledge about Egypt and its culturally rich history. Needless to say, it sparked my interest and piqued my curiosity in Pharaohs, mummies, pyramids, among other things. I'm still fascinated by it to this day. And for that, I shall be forever thankful.Now coming back to the film, it's a fine popcorn entertainer that knows what it is and never tries to be something else and I admire it. There's a lot of action, bits and pieces of real drama, and, most importantly, a boatload of humour.While they are largely slapstick in nature and grow pretty ridiculous at times, they appear to function as they should; the comedy here in my opinion worked better than almost every other thing in this movie and yes that includes the story as well as the charming cast!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Failed in all categories but possibly special effects.,"If the movie is supposed to be anything near a horror movie, one can safely conclude that this adaption of the classical Mummy-plot has lost most of what made the old Boris Karloff-version its depth and pathos: While the ""old"" mummy was driven by the search of his long-lost love, the modern mummy´s only driving force seems to be a never explained lust for destructive power in a non-specific, dull way which reduced this mummy to yet another of these dimensionless ""evils"" typically found in your average second-rate film. Some would perhaps argue that this new Mummy-film is, in fact, more of a comedy/adventure-film than a horror film. This is, in one way, probably true but the film falls short even in those categories. The obvious resemblance to the Indiana Jones-films only reminded about how much better those films handled things in terms of plots, characters, action sequences and all other aspects, while at the same time underlining how little character of its own The Mummy actually possesses! The jokes were in generally not really funny, the adventurous parts not really exciting and - as stated above - the horror-parts not horrifying. The only reason to still watch the film would probably be to check the special effects like the sand storm, which I suggest be done in front of a video (giving the otherwise bored viewer a chance to skip the less fascinating scenes ...).",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Strangely interesting,"Much to my surprise, I liked this movie a lot, mostly because it wasn't a movie that gave me weeks of nightmares.

As for John Hannah, I know he's a great actor but if I met him on the road I'd have to avert my eyes for shame.

"Passable comedy, below par thriller","This film has a lot of nostalgic associations and thus many find it a lot less entertaining than they had thought- which is what I also think of the Mummy. It is a decent diversion and has some good funny moments but as a whole it isn't a very good film. The Mummy is pretty silly stuff. But that's okay when you consider that, beneath all the action/adventure and horror trappings, it's actually a comedy. Think of a big-budget, high profile effort in the vein of Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness with less camp and better special effects. The film never takes itself seriously, and neither should we. It's a good thing it is funny because, as a thriller, it's an underwhelming effort. I suppose there are times when The Mummy makes an attempt to get the adrenaline pumping, but it never tries too hard. In the end, it's the self-mocking aura that save this film from being a waste of two hours.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Mummy...Dig it!,"Let's face it, not too many people remember the 1932 film The Mummy very well. But its 1999 remake is an Egyptian thrill ride complete with explosions, flesh eating scarabs, Brendan Fraser, desert people, plagues, Rachel Weiez, and, of course, a cool mummy. The movie assumes you have an imagination (I do obviously) and is nothing but a fun time.Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, who will remind people of Indiana Jones, but more badass. Fraser portrays Rick as a wise-cracking American who is searching for treasure beneath the sands of an ancient Egyptian city. He is also escorting Evy (Weiez), a nerdy but pretty British librarian, and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), who, like Rick, is interested in striking gold. Trouble starts when Evy accidentally awakes Ihmotep (Arnold Vosloo), a former priest of a Pharoah that was mummified alive for murdering the said Pharaoh, after having an affair with his mistress (Patricia Velazquez). Things go from bad to worse when Rick's ""buddy"" Bennie (Kevin J O'Connor) sides with Ihmotep in exchange for gold. Joining the battle to kill the mummy is the leader of a desert people tribe (Oded Fehr) who warned the party in vain to leave the city or die.The film is not only a great action movie, but it can also be considered a comedy. Fraser and Hannah frequently crack out classic one liners such as Fraser's ""If I don't make it outta here, don't put me down for mummification"" and Hannah simply showing disgust when a group of Americans are seen having fun when the desert people attack. O'Connor is funny as the bumbling Benny, and Weiez simply works her magic on Fraser. These two have some great on screen chemistry. Fehr is awesome as a gun shooting desert guy. And while the mummy is a bit whiney, Vosloo does a good job with part anyway.An excellent film. A perfect 10, and I definitely recommend the film's sequels as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
7 on a scale of 10,"This movie easily warrants an 8 as a rating, but I only gave it a 7. The reason is simply because we have seen it all before. It is extremely similar to The Raiders of the Lost Ark series.The differences are that Harrison Ford was a much more likable, charismatic hero. The special effects, though dazzling, were actually overdone. The simplicity of the special effects in Raiders was part of what made it so enjoyable. Afterall, the movie takes place in the 1920's or 30's. It seems a little bit like putting ketchup on ice cream to me.All in all it was good and well worth seeing. There are too many problems with the plot to give it more than a 7 even if I hadn't seen ""it"" before. Let's see, 10 plagues.

"Other than fancy FX, this movie is pretty standard hack-and-slash","I am sure many people will enjoy this movie. If you are of the type who likes to see a simple action movie with cool effects and don't mind the occasional cliche scene, go see it, and enjoy. The special effects will knock you out.However, I am of the opinion that a movie should leave you with more than just a few humorous lines and special effects. A few years from now the special effects will look as pathetic to us as the CG in Toy Story does today. What will we think of this movie then?Stripped of its FX, the movie is not more than a standard Indiana Jones-style adventure, with a bit more gore and much less charm. It has recycled scenes and a _very_ standard plotline. The director tries to cover this up by a little self-humor, but I don't buy it. It's just ""deja-vous all over again"".Computer graphics have revolutionized the way movies are made today. Like all revolutions, we don't really know what the end effect will be.

Cringeworthy Indiana Jones Rip-Off,"""The Mummy"" is an embarrassing slapstick style rip-off of the Indiana Jones movies. It's not funny (though it thinks it is), it's not exciting, it's not dramatic, it's just willfully stupid.I'd summarise the plot for you, except that this would only serve to dignify the film by suggesting it actually has a story and characters worthy of the name. In fact there are only clichés and cringeworthy stereotypes, and to make matters worse the film-makers actually seem to glory in their total lack of originality or imagination. Every scene is presented with a condescendingly postmodern nudge-nudge, wink-wink, you've seen this one before haven't you, kind of attitude, as though by gaining audience recognition of the clichés and stereotypes this somehow makes them clever.Allegedly the action occurs in the 1920s, but actually the film scarcely even pretends to take its period setting seriously. This is not simply a matter of historical inaccuracies. The original Indiana Jones movies had plenty of those, not least in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the mystery as to what the heck half the German army was doing in British occupied Egypt circa 1936. Yet despite such absurdities, these movies were still careful to recreate a period setting that did, however tenuously, ground them in a semblance of reality.""The Mummy"" in contrast is set in an unreal fantasy land, completely divorced from any actual time or place. Just about everything is computer generated, and it shows. I'm sure I can't be the only one who regards CGI as the emperor's new clothes. Fair enough, it can be genuinely effective when used subtly to enhance footage that has been shot in actual sets or locations. But once you start using it to create whole worlds it just winds up making everything look like a video game. Call me old-fashioned, but I always thought that the whole point of good special effects was that they should be seen and not noticed. If people come out of a movie commenting on how amazing the CGI effects were, then self-evidently they weren't amazing at all. They were rubbish, because everyone was aware of them. In the case of ""The Mummy"" the phoniness of the CGI only exacerbates the phoniness of the script.As for the acting, it was generally pretty bad, although given the script that was hardly surprising. The only ""character"" who stood out at all was John Hannah's, and that was for entirely negative reasons. I don't usually mind Hannah, but here his character approaches Jar Jar Binks levels of obnoxiousness. Frankly I just wanted to punch his face in every time he appeared on screen. Meanwhile, Rachel Weisz looked gorgeous as ever, but that was woefully insufficient compensation for two hours of crass, cynical, cretinous drivel, passing itself off as entertainment.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the sequel is Much Better.,"On the audio commentary by Stephen summers, he remarks that they're halfway into the movie and they have yet to re-introduce the title character, and he isn't even revived for another 20 minutes.

In the Mummy Returns, she's a strong, sword-wielding Kick-ass who's able to take care of herself. in the Mummy, she's portrayed as a clumsy cliched damsel in distress. And with the Mummy Returns, the ending had me cheering in my seat, The Mummy left me saying ""oh WOW.""

Bimbo,"Fun, but dumb. That's how I'd pretty much describe The Mummy. Stephen Sommers has done some wild b-movies in his time (Deep Rising) and was a great choice to write and direct this remake of the old 1930s Universal horror show. Though I must stress that very little of this film is original.Basically it's an Indiana Jones rip-off with bits of Evil Dead and Hellraiser thrown in. Clichés are abundant and stereotyped, stock characters make up much of the supporting cast. Not only do we get a fair English maiden and a bumbling Brit designed to make the yank look cool but there are also gung-ho cowboys, stuffy professors, a cowardly weasel traitor (who really gets what he deserves) and a slimy slob prison warden. Argh! There's no real point in complaining about this as they're just supposed to be easy identifiable characters for younger audiences to appreciate.There isn't really much scary about The Mummy, which is what the original was all about. Which brings me to the main problem of the film. I'm-ho-tep (played by the wicked-cool Nicolas Cage doppelganger Arnold Vosloo) is not really a bad guy. Everything he does is for love. Hardly the worst villain in history. In fact the greedy folks excavating his tomb, jeopardising the lives of everyone else for the sake of money are far worse, morally.The action is exciting and some of the plot elements, however copycatted, are imaginative and clever. The 2 hour+ running time seems to fly by. It may be unoriginal but there's still more heart in The Mummy than in rubbish like Underworld.The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture with even better Dolby 5.1/DTS sound.

The Mummy (1999) Rocks!,"This 1999 movie stays faithful to the source material of 1932, and 1959's remake of the same title. The actors with Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and many others did a good job in this movie. The scarab bugs are very instant and very scary to the audiences, The scarab bugs that could eat the flesh of whatever creature they could catch, particularly humans.The movie has lots of awesome action, suspenseful moments, such as flying an airplane and getting chases by the Mummy sandstorm, the final battle scene with the Mummy. It stays true to the Egyptian culture, and the recreation of late 1920's Eqypt is well done. The story is pretty well written and it didn't take a lot of elements from other movie companies, and this written story does its own Indiana Jones inspiration, but it has different styles throughout the entire movie. It was a huge success, and it had an movie inspired Universal Studios theme park attraction called Revenge of the Mummy in Orlando and Hollywood Florida, and even in Singapore.Overrall, it's fun, and it great!Hope you like my review! :)All rights goes to Hasbro, and Universal Pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Part of the fun is saying, ""stay in the car"" or in this case ""don't read that!"" Just because this is not my favorite type of movie does not mean it was not done well for the type. There are always those that want it scarier, better graphics, and with some sort of script. I swear someone would even have Imhotep change his name to Freddie.I would like to say something negative about this movie. But then why do I keep watching it? I think that once you get past the name thing, this is a fun movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A magical adventure!,"I can't tell you the number of times I've seen 'The Mummy' but each time it takes me to a place of history, adventure and pure excitement! A well rounded story with jeopardy at every turn and some great character acting you won't want the ride to end.I don't know what it is about ancient Egypt and the history around it but it's something magical and wanting to know more and more whilst being so invested in the good guy bad guy story means you're always rooting for the hero's.

Good fun,"Just a great 90s action adventure movie. The CGI hasn't aged well, and it's a bit long, but the practical effects, humor, and setpieces, and the charisma of the cast are every bit as enjoyable as they were 20 years ago. I miss movies like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Extremely entertaining and fun,"This is one of my favorite movies, I wish Hollywood would do more movies like this with incredible settings, great visuals, everything about it is simply breathtaking.  I've seen it several times now and it's always entertaining, it's just a great adventure.It's hard to put the movie into words, it's just a great combination of breathtaking settings, great special effects, great action & comedy, very likable characters, great story.  It's a very balanced movie, it can sometimes be very funny but also sometimes scary and dark, it's just pure FUN. :)Anyways if you like adventures like for example the Jurassic Park or the Indiana Jones movies then this one is definitely for you.  It just saddens me that they don't make many similar movies because these types of fun adventures (that are actually good) are very rare.  I've seen the sequel and although it is a good effort, it simply can't compare to this original movie.  With the sequel I thought they focused more on the special effects, but this one has a lot of heart.Anyways I recommend The Mummy to everybody who likes a perfect adventure pop corn movie.  :)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is not a film that you would expect it to be when you enter the Theatre.,"When I went to see the Mummy with my friends, we all expected a action-suspense thriller, like Indiana Jones. Instead we got a film that was filled with jokes, nice special effects, but bad acting. I like the whole concept of the film, a man mummified alive because he loved the Pharaoh's wife, and tried to bring her back to life, and then 3 thousand years later, is brought back to the world to finish what he started. It was very interesting, but the acting in the film was horrible. The Villain, (Mummy) was played by what seems to be a new-comer actor, and some of the other bit parts were played by locales to save Universal money.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun blockbuster of the adventurous kind,"Dashing legionnaire Rick O'Connell stumbles upon the hidden ruins of Hamunaptra while in the midst of a battle to claim the area in 1920s Egypt. It has been over three thousand years since former High Priest Imhotep suffered a fate worse than death as a punishment for a forbidden love-along with a curse that guarantees eternal doom upon the world if he is ever awoken.This isn't like the Universal Boris Karloff or Hammer horror, but it's more like Indiana Jones, with emphasis on goofy humour, wisecracks, and horror - it's a Big Bang action adventure, epic in all its glory with frantic action, suspense, great sets and location - there's a great cast; Brendan Fraser drips with goofy wryness as the hero, Rachel Weisz shines as the heroine, John Hannah steals the scene as her dim-witted brother and the treacherous Beni is more backstabbing than a knife.

I'm giving it a 9 because of the bad jokes. Also in the end the villian does nothing. He just stands still and watches while the heroes do their job. I thought he had powers.

"Horror movie? well, not at all...","OOOOWWW.... this movie is cheesy, a huge rip off from 'Raiders of the lost ark'. But still a fun movie to watch for its FX under no assumptions that it is nothing more another popcorn flick.Starts off in the ancient Egypt with exciting FX and visuals (the priestess -- whit-woo, aougah aougah, hubba hubba!) that explains that bad guy's problem. Then moves up to 1925 with a confusing war scene that started off without any reasonable reason. Up to this point the movie is still confusing. But afterwards, it goes on very well with a reasonable pace.Brendan Fraser is doing a surprisingly good job as the Han Solo type of hero. The English chick played by Rachel Weisz is also surprisingly good at performing her character, without being a plain female side-kick that usually portrayed in this kind of movie. While the rest of the characters are a mixed bag of stereotypes. E.g. Trigger happy American, smelly but evil and cunning Arabs etc.The FX are superb. There are some scenes that your eyes can't believe it's computer-generated (e.g. Fraser's fight with the priest mummies) but some of the time they are CG-noticeable. The FX helps creating the updated mummy character that is more than a slow walking pile of bandages.Finally, don't expect this to be a horror movie as it is not frightening enough (as it could be more frightening), expect it to be an Indiana Jones with great influence of your typical mindless popcorn-blockbuster and you will have a 2 hour of pure fun.

it's definitely outdated,"""The Mummy"" feels like a movie that will only appeal to those who watched it as kids and have a sense of nostalgia. Watching it for the first time now, in 2024, the movie seems very outdated and unappealing for new audiences or younger generations. The plot is predictable and simple, and the characters come across as stereotypical and clichéd. While the effects may have been impressive back in the day, they don't hold up to modern standards. That said, there aren't too many annoying or frustrating moments, and the film is fairly easy to watch. However, it lacks originality and feels rather bland for someone seeing it with fresh eyes. I would give it a 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a movie to reminisce about the old times, it might work for you, but it's not for viewers seeking something fresh or engaging by today's standards.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertains, but the films falls flat on its face if you analyse it.","The opening sequence to the Mummy is pretty good, but once the picture cuts to the hero, it really suffers in the story, plot and dialogue. The story is poorly constructed, as is the horrid dialogue, but the film moves at a decent pace.It entertains, but if you have trouble leaving your brain at the door, then don't watch this. I have trouble leaving my brain at the door, but somehow I managed to get through this picture, and it was enjoyable.The film's special effects are atrocious at times, a lot of f/x look fake. This proves that computers cannot always produce a quality effect, other tools, or use of models would've been more appropiate.The acting is fair, some the characters are annoying in the picture. Being a fan of Rachel Weisz is one reason to watch this film, but she does get corny lines in most movies. Brendan Fraiser does what he can with a lacklustre script.The screenplay is poorly structured and defies logic.The directing is okay, but should've asked for a serious re-write, the script is way too campy and tongue-in-cheek.You must see this wide-screen.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Inconsistent, disappointing eye-candy.","As a BIG fan of the big-budget, hi-gloss, Hollywoodized, action-adventure, I have to say that, after salivating over the candy-like previews for weeks, The Mummy was gross disappointment on a grand scale.  Unless you count the amazing contradiction present here, there's really nothing special about this film. The acting was sub-par at best. The lack of even the most base character development eliminated my concern for them and therefore the ""horror"" scenes seemed both typical, far-fetched and inconsistent at the same time.Lots of little discrepancies (no Africans, no blood, infinitely loaded guns, sewer systems in the desert, collapsing pyramids...), plagued this film. The CG, which is undoubtedly superb in it's own right, was WAAAY overdone and looked really bad on-screen.  There is such a thing as too much.  I remember thinking at one point, ""This looks more like FMV cut in a video game than a movie.""  Arnold Vosloo (Imhotep) didn't even (re)appear until nearly the middle of the movie.  On the plus side, I think the best performance was done by Beni, a snivelling little weasel played by Kevin J. O'Connor, who became Imhotep's minion and had the best lines of all. Rachel Weisz did a decent job with her role as well.  Frasier was stiff, out of place and apparently, completely indestructable.  The same, however, can NOT be said about the Mummy.  Better off rented.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Anyone who can't find enjoyment in this film is simply a boring person, probably a miserable, jealous human being. Frasier has never been better; it's as if the role of O'Connell was written just for him. Rachel Weisz is utterly enchanting as the brilliant yet naive Evie.

Pretty Good Actioner,"Seems to lean rather heavily on RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK escapades, yet has a few good moments.

More young people were spouting ""Professor Bombay"" in the theater...God Bless ""Nick at Night"" or pre-press hype, whichever you prefer.The special effects were quite entertaining, if not downright reminiscent of the choreography used in Michael Jackson's ""CHILLER"" video.The baddie was exceptional (Arnold Vosloo), being menacing, but not over the top, ham-handed. His character was intelligently, and thoughtfully portrayed. Overall, despite its cheek and borrowed elements, THE MUMMY is better than average. Recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just not good,"I mean seriously there was nothing enjoyable about this, none of the characters were actually likeable (except that stupid british guy he was alright), I didn't believe anything that was happening for a single second and the conflict and tension were so forced they might as well not even have tried.The acting was also shocking, with huge amounts of dialogue being said rather than actually acted and sime of the physical acting was so awfully fake it would've made a decent comic actor cry.The worst bit though was the thorough lack of plot. I genuinely don't think I can describe how boring the plot was, because theoretically, saving the world from an ancient mummy sounds really cool. I think, however the film spends too much time killing people (without suspense) to make a plot of any sort.I really did not like this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Raiders of the Undead,"In ancient Egypt high priest Imhotep is having an affair with Anck-su-namun, the mistress of his Pharaoh Seti.

In 1923 adventurer takes Egyptologist Evelyn and her brother Jonathon to the city of the dead.  While searching for the Book of the Living they accidentally release Imhotep who plans to bring Anck-su-namun back to life and to rule the world from beyond the grave.This is very much of a mix between Sam Rami's Evil Dead and Raiders of the lost ark - Raiders of the Undead, if you will.  However it never reaches the level of those.  The plot is so full of holes that even when played tongue in cheek it's still hard to swallow.  The film moves very fast through a large number of action scenes and you never really get the chance to notice the holes until it's finished.  The action scenes are well handled and the special effects are really impressive.Fraser is not a great action hero - he's a great actor, but here he just has to be a wise-cracking hero.  Weisz is pretty dire, she doesn't have much to do and takes her role way too seriously.  Hannah deserves to have better roles, but at least he knows to mess around for the whole film.  Vosloo is good and the support cast are OK.Although the film's all a bit loud, but it's good fun throughout and there's much to enjoy.

So, in fact, are the rowdy Americans. So, in fact, are leading members of the desert organization (though before we learn their purpose, some are spooky). Even the revivified mummy is likeable, as well as his extra-sexy, body painted girlfriend (well, sexy in her early scenes). Later on, they run into Bernard Fox (Hogan's Heroes, Bewitched) and he's a teddy bear. Even the treacherous Beni, a thoroughly disgusting little man who'll follow anyone or do anything if he sees an advantage for himself, is likeable.All this adds to the enjoyment of the movie's well-told story, which is just one problem after another right to the end.The special effects are great, but at rock bottom ""The Mummy"" is a delightful yarn of variously interacting characters who, in the best sort of horror-story tradtions (though the comedy in emphasized), gradually band together to fight a mutual foe.

Wonderfully dated popcorn movie,"This movie really scared the crap out of me as a kid. The scenes with the partially reanimated mummy, the flood of scarabs burying under your skin to get inside your head, this made me prepare for a scary watch ahead of my revisit over 20 years later. But it's funny how different your memories can be from reality. I remembered this movie as being much darker than it actually is, which is a lowbrow blockbuster, fun as long as you don't think too much about what's happening. Not that you need to as characters outright tell you what is going on while the music tells you how to feel at any given time.The best parts are definitely the acting and chemistry of the two lead actors, Brendan Fraser especially gives a great performance as a confident treasure hunter type, not up to Indy's level but definitely up there. Next is the CGI which has aged like a fine wine. Only the most hardened connoisseurs will be able to appreciate the unbelievably realistic fluid physics, moist mummy models with totally real eyeballs and mouths stretched open like in those ""soy"" memes you come across online. There's actually a lot of unintentional laughs in this movie, especially with the endless amount of adventure and horror tropes it has that come across as silly by today's standards.If you manage your expectations and know what you're getting into this is an easy and fun watch even today, or even due to the fact that it is today.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The film was, without doubt, a huge departure from the original going for more of an Indiana Jones action-adventure tone with a hint of horror, romance, and comedic elements. All and All creating a very enjoyable film it a well-paced despite being 2hrs building up to the grand moment when you finally get the mummy you get some moments getting to know the characters who do leave a memorable impact. Braden Frazer combines the right amount of charm. Rachel Weisz has a very snarky personality doesn't take crap or play games from John Hannah with anyone and is very serious when it comes to her work, but she has a cute personality. And she and Brden play well off one another. The biggest Highlight of The Mummy is The Mummy Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep makes for an enjoyable villain to say the least. While not as Iconic as Frankenstein Boris Karloff is memorable for his performance speaking in this very soft-spoken voice. While not Physically imposing he had a presence to him.

It's been compared to the superior Raiders of the Lost Ark, although the comparisons aren't entirely apt. Raiders was a bit darker in tone and the characters were more nuanced. In contrast The Mummy is a bit more affable and character morality is clearly delineated from the outset.

The temples, the outfits, the royal scandal, make this an interesting plot, but in some points the scenes are a little corny.The dialogue is funny and clever, but sometimes falls short.

"**.5,2.5 out of 5 stars,Brendan Fraser as a bit dopey but a surprisingly somewhat hipper & funnier attempt of Indiana Jones","With the exceptions of plot & film design & Sp.FX the way on how you can rate this film is its PG-13 content I'll show you: (This is not something I do commonly) Violence:Incredibly over-gruesome! at least the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the film's gory parts(which proves that censored graphic violence can have a good side which in this case prevented this film to be a dumb gorefest),this film along with the corpse Sp.FX make the much better film(**** out of 5 stars to be specific)transformers the movie look like a epidose from ""Barney & Friends""(note it did had its fair share of over-brutal violence but no where near enough as much as this film) Language:like most films(Top Gun,MST3K the movie,notable exceptions) the language wasn't all that needed but that's no big deal here. Brief Nudity:Don't be fooled by this part (note I'm NOT one of those hormone-surging perverts),there was no nudity in this film just the princess in the film was wearing an incredibly revealing outfit - true she was almost nude but not enough to be ""must be covered not to be seen by children"" type of nudity,so basically there was no nudity. Sp.FX:Most of the Sp.FX in this film saved it from a much worse review,some of it actually helped to bring it down,The impressive:the Sp.FX in the beginning were actually the best as if they had help from the people of Pixar(Toy story,A Bug's Life),but after the ancient egypt prologue what wasn't in the unimpressive list did look well done but not as much in the prologue,unimpressive:I'll start with the mildest the face in the sand wasn't all that impressive,the 2nd worst the scarabs were more like leeches in this film & besides they more looked like little blue blobs than scarabs,now the worst the corpses(I can't really call them mummies which i'll get to in the plot),for the pre-teen to adult it'll more than likely nauseate you if you see the corpses on a moderately-to-full stomach & it places this film from the intended ""Well too scary for li'l kids"" to ""Would probably traumatize to at least place li'l kids in thearapy for a long while"" & the recently dead corpse's I'd wish the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the scenes of those corpses (but they wouldn't)Plot:A big problem to a big helper in this film,the plot is completelly weak & is rather bad at times(the only actual mummies in this film were the priests when they were mummified alive),& like what I'd said before the scarabs mostly were more like leeches,& the film was a big mild ""ROTLArk"" parody not too mention that after I'd seen the reviews here I'd have to admit the pilot guy was rather wasted,but the only light part of the Plot & film was the moderately funny one-liners they'd never contend to great comic films but at least it gives a comic break from most of the films plot(not to mention the ancient-egyptian love scandal during the prologue was a little weak too)Film Design:What most I can tell you here is more relev. to the other areas,So I tell you a couple of noticed film flubs,1 the anubis jar tops -1 of them is a brass St.Wrs Yoda head I'd kid you not, 2nd when im-ho-top got his arm chopped off you can see the metal wiring on the sliced off arm before he placed it back on So in short:the 2 main reasons why I saw this film were 1:a mother's day present for my mother I saw it with her,2: (I know there's still plenty of the year) but I saw it so I've actually seen a movie this year(the last time I'd went to the M.Theaters was seeing the Rugrats movie back in Dec.98),so even though most of the special effects were impressive & the one-liners were funny the rest of this film is a freaky-I.J stylish-monster-mummy movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Modern Classic.,"The Mummy (1999)-An epic and fun adventure to rival 'Indiana Jones' and with a style similar to 'Tomb Raider' (2001). Also, Brendan Fraser is looking his absolute hottest, it's a shame he doesn't get naked at some point.I like the way that they build the suspense and the characters are well constructed too. Jonathan in particular is surprisingly entertaining, not the boorish and typical upper class twit that he could have been and Rachel Weiss as Evie is brilliant. She is beautiful and a great, feisty character.I could do without the bugs and some of the other bits are only just my side of acceptable for grossness or horror, but they ARE acceptable, maybe with the exception of Omid's exit.It's the subtle jokes and looks they give each other that really make this film, blended with the more obvious humour and the action too of course.Having watched the sequels as well, I like the build up to them that is secreted in the background here and ready to be used later. It's as if they filmed it knowing that it would be a success and gave it the time and budget that it needed, which I think made a better film.969.85/1000.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film is obviously made in the tradition of Indiana Jones flicks and they at least made an entertaining movie.  But what it was not, is a good flick that would make me want to see it a second time.  Everything lacked by just a step or two.  The action and adventure was good but not great.

An adventure great in the style of Raiders of the Lost Ark,"Bad reviews of this movie make me despair of humanity. Packed with action, adventure, suspense, humor and the odd gruesome moment, The Mummy is one of the adventure movie greats. Its overall style is in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark - thrills and humor go hand in hand. It also pays homage to the horror genre of Mummy movies, referencing many of its 'mummy' predecessors. The leads are terrific with wonderful chemistry and they deliver memorable, quotable lines with aplomb. ""Your strength gives me strength""; 'I've just made a bit of a mess in the library"", ""No harm ever came from reading a book""; ""I am a librarian!""; ""He was just looking for a good time""; ""I hate bugs!"", ""The only things that scare me are your manners"" -- the quotable list goes on and on (and they are all regularly used on repeat at our house).

Entertaining and Mildly Amusing,"'The Mummy' is a pleasing movie that combines light-hearted humour and elements of horror to give an entertaining watch. An excellent cast and decent script gives an entertaining array of believable characters that enjoy some excellent on-screen chemistry, particularly between the characters portrayed by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiss. The locations/sets are well-chosen/designed and look very realistic, and input from real-life experts lends a pleasing reality to when the actors are speaking in ancient Egyptian. The plot is fairly straight-forward, but still contains enough suspense to keep you interested and it retains plenty of light-hearted humour to keep from getting too serious. All-in-all, I really like this movie and will watch it many times again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining.,"The first time I saw her was on television in 2007. I was terrified Little because it was small, but still loved it. The scenes of the Beginning accompanied by the music are great, you get the bad vibe in the body. The characters are charismatic and come to like you. Especially Brendan who plays a part.The special effects are very good for the time, and animations By computer are not noticed in the least. Arnold acts very well as Imhotep and scares.The part when the mummies leave the ground gives much fear for the Little sounds they make, and their appearance is terrifying.

"I loved this movie, but I have no idea why.","Before I give my comments on this movie, let me set the record straight on one thing. This movie is silly, far fetched, the special effects can be seen as just being that: special effects. For that matter, the plot isn't that entirely deep or perfect by any means. But I had a great time watching it. What I enjoyed the most about this movie are the one-liners. They were clever, well-timed, and quite a few of them had me laughing loudly in the theater. The acting was over-the-top, and had more of a comic book feel with its wise-cracking, overly ""dashing"" hero, the damsel in continual distress and the weasly henchmen working to suit his best interests. This movie was filled with those kind of ""adventure movie"" stereotypes, and instead of being disgusted by these cliches, I found that it made this movie all that more fun. Anyone going to see this film thinking that this movie is going to be serious or scary is going to be sorely disappointed. (That doesn't mean that little kids should see this movie. It's mildly gory in an ""Army of Darkness"" sort of way.) However, people wanting to be amused by a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously will find the two hours enjoyable. I can't wait to see this on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Feels Like You're Watching Indiana Jones,"The Mummy, starring Bredan Fraser in his most promising role at the time (and probably ever since) was a great triumph. The direction by Stephen Sommers was great, as well as the special effects and story. The story especially, since it's a remake of the Universal Monster film series of the 1930s.The action and adventure make you feel like you're watching a new version of Indiana Jones, it's that good. The supporting cast was great too, you have Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Jonathan Hyde. The ending doesn't really set up a sequel, but at the time, one was not planned. Eventually, two sequels would follow and also spawn a spin-off series (Scorpion King).It's hard to believe that less than 20 years later, in 2017, Tom Cruise tried to reboot the Mummy series again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Last word on the Mummy,until it returns","Colorful, old-fashioned, full of adventure. Yes, all these describe this big-budget re-make of the old Universal flic; what a difference 67 years make. A box-office winner, this capitalizes on the current FX capabilities to display almost anything one can imagine (as long as you have the money): wanna show a locust invasion? No problem. A 'living' sandstorm? Okey do-key. Essentially a horror comedy, the minor horrific elements are offset by a tongue-in-cheek attitude; probably the creepiest sections for the audience have to do with the marauding hordes of beetles that scour the insides of the burial grounds and have a tendency to get under your skin. The monster of the title (played by South African actor Arnold Vosloo, who has no English lines) is more like a force of nature, with many supernatural powers, who needs to feed off the life-essences of various victims to regenerate himself, uh, itself. The movie has some great on-location desert photography, with the whole thing having a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" feel to it. So, why doesn't it rate higher with me? There is a word, I believe it's 'derivative,' which can also be used to describe this romp. When ""Raiders.."" came out in the early eighties, it was fairly original, even tho it was based on old-time serial pics. By the late nineties, this scrambling from one peril to the next is not. This is also a primary example of computer FX used to such excess that nothing resonates with any real impact on the viewer. Since the story is set in the 1920s, I could hear in 1999 the wheels turning in Hollywood executive heads regarding a sequel set in modern times. But, that didn't happen - the sequel moved ahead only a few years, to even better grosses. Now, THAT'S Hollywood. Uh, The Mummy Returns Again?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mild headache,"Decided to write a review after seeing all three films today. Quite happy with the first one after seeing the other ""masterpieces"". This film definitely had it all, people killing for no reason, evil triumphing over good, the true love that the mummy has being not developed properly (at least until the second film).
The acting is as you would expect, which means that it was bad. 
The story is as comical as any. 
The inability to harm the major characters fits with the culture.In conclusion, if you go into this expecting anything other than some good cinematography, you are an idiot.
If you enjoyed it, don't watch the next two films. Be happy that you saw the best in the series and end it there.
If you can turn off your brain for a while, this might be fun. On the other hand, YouTube has tons of conspiracy theory videos on ancient Egypt, which might be better.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breakdown of the elements,"The Mummy squeaks in as an acceptable blockbuster. Humor, good timing, off-timing and recurring horror all come together producing a full cinema experience.The romance is a little hokey, but not ridiculously so. I thoroughly enjoyed the modesty of the lead female character. The character, Evelyn Carnarvon, was delightful, smart and a lady.Brendan Fraser once again has chosen the role of a lovable leading man. He delivers the hero talents too, lots of punches thrown and knockin' around bad guys - both living and dead.Special effects? Very well done. Spooky stuff.Story line? Mmmmmmmm... There's a gaping free fall within the movie when the goal or goals are lost. But we, the audience, are along for this ride and we're all in this together. We're still having an acceptable night at the movies.About the humor... much of it was great. But I was upon saying the words to my husband as Brendan Fraser said my line. Granted, I'm a funny person, but that line must have been waiting there to be said. I struggle with it being a trite line or I'm a witty person of the same caliber as the screenwriter. (grin) Other than that and one completely flat line delivered by the character Beni deep into the film, the humor was good.This is a remake of an old horror film, and is ""as good as can be expected."" There will be better films. But if the previews attracted you to the desert mystery, you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A rewatchable classic that has lost some of its hype....,"6.9/10 (7) (Highly Recommend)""The Mummy"" becomes twenty-five years old this May and it still holds the test of time as a classic to be enjoyed again and again. While it's not the be all end all for visuals, story, or acting. It still holds a terrific adventure of ancient times and romances that work very well.I've always loved the actors selected for the film, but my favourite character has always been Rachel Weisz's Evie. She's a strong female lead that the whole story encompasses around due to the adventure that she seeks and the knowledge that she holds. Though I won't rule out Brendan Fraser as a close second.Visually I'd say the movie holds up well for the 90s, but it's far from perfect. It's lower quality that at times is harder to enjoy, but at the same time I wouldn't have it any other way. Unlike when ""Star Wars"" got ""ruined"" on its remastered editions, this one stays true to its originality, but with better clarity. The mummies don't come across as heart racing as they once did, but they're still a spectacle to enjoy.I realize now that the story is a little meh, but despite tue salty feelings I now feel the film still brings an aura of adventure and yearning. I think this movie made me want to learn Ancient Egypt and visit the country one day so I think it still holds its job even now.Overall, this is a film worth watching for the chemistry the characters bring and the story's sense of adventure. It's always going to be better than the 2017 version just for Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz alone. I hope theatres bring it out again because I would be all over it.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What's not to like?,"Seems like you either get it, or you don't. Just as with Sommers' followup, the wonderful, hugely entertaining and cruelly underrated 'Van Helsing', this movie seems so unfairly destined to be relegated to cult status, as does star Brendan Fraser, . Our family adored it and still do, and as a reimagining of a classic for the modern audience, alongside 'Flash Gordon', it's a virtually perfect vehicle, delivering solid thrills, laughs galore, marvellous scenery and effects, action aplenty, hearty romance and, yes, heart. The casting is simply perfect, highlighted by the glowing chemistry between the two irresistible leads, both so ably assisted by the truly terrific supporting cast, performing a smart, witty and sincere screenplay that strikes a beautiful balance between the various elements of comedy, horror, mystery/thriller, adventure, romance and good old-fashioned camp. It's a romp, it's genre, it's ""derivative"", sure, but it still has that extra something special, and it's a heartfelt and soidly rendered tribute that inscribes itself convincingly into the canon and, on reflection, proves itself to be a classic of its kind. It must be hard heart indeed that does not love this film and will not recognise how hard all concerned tried to make this the best filmtney could make, and how well they succeeded. Critics may carp, but it's boffo box office is the proof of the pudding and for anyone not terminally jaded, this is and will remain a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Exciting, but not special","The Mummy is a big box-office hit and it will be too in Holland, but is it a good movie? Say about the first 45 minutes are so bad, that they qualify to be ranked in the worst movies ever list.

And then the movie really begins to be exciting. The end with a lot of mummies is actually really funny and good. So it is an exciting last hour but the movie is certainly not special and so isn't Brendan Fraser or the rest of the crew; the only one with a really good part is the South-African that plays the Mummy.

What a wild ride. The funnest Mummy of them all!,"To start off with, this movie is not strictly speaking a horror movie. That is not to say it does not have horror elements to it, but they are, in a way, secondary to the main focus of the film. This is an action-adventure, comedy, love story. Brendan Frasier shines as the American ex-foreign legion soldier who knows the way to Hamanauptra, an ancient city, fabled to hold the treasure of the Pharaoh Seti I (father of Ramses the Great) Rachel Weisz is Evelyn Carnahan, a librarian turned archaeologist who has found an object that will open the book of Ra, an ancient text with occult powers. The rest of the cast are all excellent also, as the humor, the horror, and the adventure become a roller-coaster ride of adventure. It is ""Indian Jones meets King Tut"" in a way.

"A fun roller-coaster ride, but mildly unfulfilling and lacking depth.","An exciting series of action sequences, but with stereo-type cardboard characters that lack depth and sufficient backstory. The effects, while beautiful are too extreme to be believed and lack the majesty and feeling of history of the real Egypt.There are so many good legends, curses and settings in real Egyptology that the computer generated ones used in this film are disappointing. After a while you are just waiting for them to say ""Oh no ! A million computer generated bugs are after us again !""The Indiana Jones films had the same problems and mixed in some actual history and a logical set of threats.This film has booby traps that nobody but an idiot would set off (of course one predictably does just that) and illogical things like mummies that crawl out of the earth where there is no reason to believe they would have been buried.  Also except for the main Mummy the Egyptian priests didn't intend to get loose, those lame boody traps and some killer bugs, there is no real guardians of the terribly overdone mega-treasure.

Bury this movie fast!,"Quite possibly one of the poorest movies I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few in my timeWhat an all too simple story. It's a weak excuse to throw some special effects around which surprisingly weren't that good. When I saw in the credits that ILM was doing them I was ready to be blown away. Mediocre is what comes to mind when I think of the effects. A few of them are impressive but when it comes to ILM most people expect eye-popping as a standard. In one scene, the mummy who is slowly regenerating, has scabs and scars on portions of his face. For some reason they were unnecessarily computer generated. And to make it worse, they seemed to floating off his face as the effects personnel did a poor job matching the shape of the scars to the mummy's face. Quite a few times there are thousands of bugs, be it scarabs, locusts, or flies buzzing or crawling around. The sheer number is a bit impressive but what distracted me was that the bugs were shiny for some reason forcing me to realize that they were in fact computer generated.The movie's script is filled with one-liners that just aren't funny. It doesn't help when most of them are said by the leading man Brenden Frasier who for the entire movie either needs cough medicine because his voice is forcefully scratchy or curls his lip as if he had some peanut butter stuck to the front of his teeth.In addition to a poor movie, it didn't help that I was surrounded by the most annoying people...ever. At countless points, two gentlemen in front of me burst out loud with an ear-splitting laugh just screaming of stupidity. It wasn't only at the parts where the movie tried to be funny either. When one of the characters just simply got on his camel, they burst out loud with a roar of a laugh rocking back and forth in their seats. And just for the record, many other people besides me were angry at these men (oafs?). Two people behind me got up during the middle of the movie after another one of the idiots' laughs. Coincidence? I think not...I would much rather have stayed home staring at a blank wall for a couple of hours than have gone to this trash. This movie is what gives adventure/blockbuster movies a bad name.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good effects, fun characters, quite entertaining, never a slow moment","This is a pretty good action/adventure film, the special effects were very impressive for the most part, although, nothing totally new, multiple bugs, sand storms, walking skeletons etc.  Brendan Fraser does a convincing job as the hero of the film, he's good looking, brave, ready for anything, but the guy is NOT the next Harrison Ford, though he does try. The most impressive part with respect to the main characters is that this movie is not a Brendan-fest.  The film spends enough time on ALL the main characters, and they all get developed past the point of being scenery. They even get to help fight the bad guy! Imagine! The plot of the movie moves right along, you get a brief background on the mummy, straight and to the point, you meet the main characters, and you're off.  No time wasted, which is just the kind of treat to have in this sort of movie.  If you go to the movies for entertainment, you will enjoy this, and have some laughs, if you go for enlightenment, give it up.  It's fun, it doesn't try to be a carbon copy of an Indiana Jones movie and even brings in a couple of surprises that you don't see coming.

"A well told epic tale with horror, action, comedy and romance!","For those of us who enjoy a good adventure movie and a good laugh, but burrow down into our seats when a movie gets too 'gory', The Mummy was a pleasant surprise!  I was dragged along and expected to only see half the movie, but was quickly engrossed in this wonderfully epic tale and amazed at the special effects so much, that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The story tells a timeless tale woven around a beautiful country with a wonderfully rich history. Something to remember is that it is based around the mythology and beliefs of an ancient society, and you can't get better storylines than that.Of course the actors played their part, by portraying action, adventure, horror, comedy and romance beautifully.  John Hannah was great (as always), Brendan Fraser showed he can do action and adventure as well as the next man, Rachel Weisz was also very good as the beautiful heroine.BUT Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr, not taking anything away from other cast members these guys were fantastic. I have to agree with 'catmom2' I definitely would like to see more of both these actors.  Arnold Vosloo, where have you been? His portrayal of the Mummy was magnificent, who in all his evilness still looked vulnerable, I have to admit to feeling sorry for The Mummy.  Oded Fehr, well I'm sorry for falling into the superficiality trap, but his dark and brooding good looks were definitely put to good use.This is a movie that I would recommend to my friends, who enjoy a good story with enough action to keep you interested but not too much blood and guts, some great one-liners and comedy scenes that have you chuckling and of course the fluffy little romance story for those of us who think there's too little of it in the world today.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Second time around is not a charm,"Boy this was a stinker (at least for the 30-40 crowd). I see a lot of comments on how fun this was... movie goer's have gotten much less sophisticated these days other than special effects.I came into this expecting a lesser Raiders of the Lost Ark... it sure was lesser. The narration at the beginning makes it look like a lot was left on the cutting room floor and Brendan Fraser's no Harrison Ford! More like Al Gore.The dialog was was a sad bit of script writing. I kept waiting for someone to break out laughing. There was no sense of horror... you know the kind where if a phone rang you'd jump two feet off your chair? This was more a comedy/melodrama with special effects. The effects were very good so if that is all that matters to you then go for it. I need more.Weisz, as Evelyn the librarian and amateur Egyptologist was something to look at for sure. I'll have to visit my local branch more often. :-) But she was given nothing script-wise and was an EXPERT on everything concerning Egypt and the Mummy. There was nothing she didn't know... a super-librarian.Even the music was poor and led to the non-horror feeling. All this movie has is special effects. The dead army of Imhotep looks great but they fall like bowling pins when confronted and still don't have the magic feeling of the Sinbad/Jason skeletons of the past.This may be a hit with 10 year old's (it sure is better than last year's Godzilla) but adults should hit another theatre for their money.Rating - 3 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Surprisingly engaging F/X movie.,"When I saw the advertisements for the remake of ""The Mummy,"" I could do little more than roll my eyes.  I am a fan of the original, mainly because of Boris Karloff's portrayal of Im-Ho-Tep, back from the dead to resurrect the woman he loved.  All this remake seemed to be was a bunch of silly special effects thrown together to catch a few of the pre-""Star Wars"" summer movie dollars.Well, it does have a lot of silly effects.  Unabashedly silly, and hilarious.  Not too mention the movie is exciting, engaging and all around a great action-adventure movie.Brendon Fraser is great as a two-gun American treasure hunter leading an expedition to the ancient City of the Dead in search of a golden book.  Of course, through the course of events, all hell breaks loose.  The story from that point, with some interesting diversions, follows the original rather closely, although with nowhere near the sexual tension.Although a great monster for the movie, Im-Ho-Tep in the original was a well-drawn character.  Arnold Vosloo comes nowhere near the performance of Boris Karloff, and is in fact more like Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula in several cases.  Still, when he can raise sandstorms and skeleton armies, I guess no one would ask him how he feels about his lot in life... or death.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Possibly the most enjoyable 'Mummy' film to date.,"Somehow, 'The Mummy (1999)' is pretty much the most enjoyable film to bear its name, one that takes the classic universal monster and makes him into the foe for an 'Indiana Jones'-style, 'archaeologist action-hero' adventure. It's precisely because it doesn't take it self so dreadfully seriously that it works so well, always being a fun time even when it's at its spookiest. Having said that, it also has a respect for the lore and knows that it's supposed to be a horror, too, which makes for some memorably grotesque yet still entertainingly light sequences. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful rememberable and remarkable adventure classic.,"When this movie was released, i remember it was a big thing so i decided to watch it again in 2018 to see if this hype was real or not.Surprisingly this movie is really great, it tells a very simple story but with very complex sub-stories and detailed adventurous journey that combines between British, American and Arabic style of fights, motivations and culture.Of course there is a drawback in moving that Arabic culture to the screen, as you can see there is careless in delivering an accurate culture, language and accent.""Brendan Frazer"" plays the main role here and I can't imagine someone other than him, he was just born for this role. He did well in action, romance and even silly situations. All other actors did great as well but their performance was not remarkable as ""Brendan Frazer"".All scenes are catchy to the eye, the director showed a few shadows scenes which were great. If you watch it in 2018, you will not feel that it's old or outdated.All the make up and special effects scenes are perfectly done. You will see magnificent scenes of Ancient Egypt and its treasures.Finally, it's a great adventure movie that is not comparable to any other movie that represented the idea of Egypt's treasure hunting, it's funny, light and you will not feel bored here.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yawn.,"This movie has to be one of the biggest cinematic letdowns in recent memory. After being pleasantly surprised by The Matrix I was less reluctant to watch a movie advertised for its special effects, especially since this one seemed to have a decent story to back it up.  Boy, was I wrong.The whole movie is based upon the idea that Brendan Fraser, et al., are to save the world from the scourge that is the mummy they've accidentally awaken after a three thousand year slumber.  At least my friends were there to wake me up after only two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Mummified Flick,"""The Mummy"" Trust me, I'm not opposed to having fun with silly material.  I don't consider myself a dour person and I love a good ""bad"" movie.  My take on ""The Mummy"" is this : Expectations were high, and the filmmakers blew it. Set with a 80 million dollar budget and a distinctly stinky track record, how could I believe in my mind that director Stephen Sommers could pull this off?  The movie is a mess of really lame and desperate jokes, boisterous effects, and an unproved cast.  Brendan Fraser leads this journey with a pinch of Indiana Jones, a dash of Jerry Lewis, and a sprinkle of a Barry White baritone.  I don't like Mr. Fraiser, and his usual wooden performance doesn't suit the material. By trying to make him into the hero, the film succeeds in showing off even more of Mr. Fraser's limits. John Hannah makes for a passable lackey, and Rachel Weisz is delightful as the ""girl"" of the film(I was already a fan). The two actors who really ooze mediocrity are Kevin J. O'Conner as the sniveling bad guy, and Arnold Vosloo as the title character.  While being a computer creation for most of the piece, Mr. Vosloo has to take over at the end of the film.Trouble is, he's not scary at all.  He resembles more of an aging lawyer who just flew back from Jamaica than a mummified agent from hell. The effects, which took up 1/4 of the budget, are in turns both impressive and depressing.  Using the computer to enhance a sky or to make 5 people 500... That's fantastic.  Using the same technology to create a noisy environment where each effect looks worse than the next is where I draw the line (Trust me, Spielberg was on to something when he used REAL insects in ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom""). All the CG stuff looks incredibly false to me, my kingdom for a guy in a rubber suit! Sommers has no tricks up the sleeve except to continuously bombard the senses with noise and predictable humor.  It could have been fun, it should have been great, what's left is the biggest letdown from a Hollywood production in some time.---------- 2",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It's more of an Indiana Jones look alike, but worth viewing","This is more of action and adventure than of horror. This is supposed to be a remake of the original 1930s version. Well some things are the same, Imhotep is in it, and his scheme is also there, but there are many changes, I mean many! The special effects, the 10 plagues that follow when Imhotep comes back to life, different other characters, a comic relief, more action, and a body count. It lacks what the original one was, it was too in your face, and tongue in cheek. But Despite all those, the changes made it better and attracted quite an audience I must say. And I like the brother Jonathan who is a greedy man and a coward, and the other guy who is like him, Beni, who is also greedy and a coward, it made me want to watch this even more.

"Indiana Jones meets Hellraiser, but with better actors","Totally disregard any previous ""Mummy"" films before going to see this. Not because this is the definitive effort, but just for the simple reason that this has nothing to do with any of them. It's a family-friendly version, with a lot of rather unnecessary CGI throughout, and far more gags than genuine shocks. It's your standard action/adventure movie, and yet, it still is reasonably entertaining. But the biggest disappointment of all, is the fact that there isn't really a mummy in the entire movie. Instead, in a plot exactly lifted from Clive Barker's original ""Hellraiser"" movie, we have a decomposing, cursed man who must drain his victims dry, to rebuild himself physically. Not exactly original.What does make rather a nice change, though, is the fact that both our leads are capable and seem to be having a lot of fun, rather than the po-faced posing we're so used to seeing in movies these days. Brendan Fraser is a capable and solid enough hero, who, despite his constant dry quips, is not at all arrogant, and has a quiet believability to him totally unlike your average action hero. Rachel Weisz, back before the dark days of ""Constantine"", is charming and talented, and there is a great chemistry between the two of them that keeps the movie alive. The vast swathe of other characters, largely comic grotesques, range form John Hannah's likable buffoon, to Kevin J O'Connors' weaselly little git. Connor manages to get even more and more annoying in each scene, and whilst he isn't the only thing wrong with this movie, cutting him out entirely would improve this movie no end.Arnold Vosloo is a fairly by-numbers villain, who adds little beyond a certain imposing physicality to the role, although he does look good in the role. His love interest, though, Patricia Velasquez, is phenomenal, and if ever there was a woman worth suffering a living death for, it must just be her. Velasquez has less than five minutes screen-time, but makes her presence acutely felt, with her elaborate, painted on costume, the most visually stunning element of the entire movie.The story putters along, with some impressively staged action scenes, with great stunt-work throughout. It's just a shame that the horror content wasn't half as good as the stunt-work, because then we'd have a proper ""Mummy"" film. Instead, rather than being at all creepy, all the supernatural elements are handled with heavy CG. Vast biblical plagues are realised effectively enough, but the over-the-top nature of most of the CG threats - plagues of millions of beetles you can escape by side-stepping, plagues of locusts you can avoid by staying indoors, huge walls of sand, etc - aren't written compotently enough to be exciting. The main problem is the old chestnut of the all-powerful villain, who somehow gets defeated. They've amped up Imhotep's powers so much, that he's a supernatural entity who can do anything with a thought - so how does he get so easily defeated? Lesson learned here - don't give your villain unlimited powers, or else we'll just be massively disappointed when he finally gets beaten, and this movie is no exception.There is a strong comedy quotient in this movie, where tension is never allowed to be built up, without immediately being diffused by a joke, or someone making light of the situation. It creates the jaunty, entertaining tone, but, unlike most movies, it doesn't go away as the stakes get higher. Our characters make jokes, and are engaged in comic set-pieces right up until the very end. The more fun tone is fine to begin with, but it gets a bit tiresome towards the end, when things should be getting a lot more serious.Dramatically, ""The Mummy"" is heavily flawed. The CGI is far too over-used, the threat amped up to totally unrealistic proportions, which only succeed in being faintly disappointing. But, Fraser and Weisz are good leads. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a very traditionalist soundtrack, which largely goes un-noticed in the chaos. The first half is fun, reasonably exciting, heavily action-packed, and funny without being silly. Sadly, the end gets rather flat, and the build-up we've had, where we're waiting to finally see the mummy, is rudely shattered by a rather shoddy piece of CGI.To be honest, it could have been a lot worse. It's very casually entertaining, made for audiences with a short-attention span, who laugh at gag after gag because they don't have the patience to follow a plot, or sustain an atmosphere. It's rubbish compared to the Hammer movie, but, compared to today's blockbusters, there's something charmingly human about it all.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A grand and immensely fun adventure!,"Strictly speaking, this is not a remake. Although I haven't seen the original, I highly doubt that a movie made in the early 1930's could have this kind of action and adventure. Apparently it shares a similar plot-line to the Boris Karloff classic, but unlike many remakes, or ""reboots,"" this one is entertaining enough in its own right.The film opens in Ancient Egypt, where a priest named Imohtep (Arnold Vosloo) is caught in a love affair with the pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). He and his priests are executed and the priest is cursed. Cut to the 1930's, where an adventurer named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is about to be executed. He is saved by a ditsy Egyptologist named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) because he knows the location of a lost city where rumors of untold treasure await. While there, they of course end up awaking Imohtep, and with him come a few nasty side effects to the curse.The best part about this movie is that it plays manages to chill us and make us laugh. There are some genuinely freaky moments, and there are also some openly funny bits. Not many movies can make that claim. Even better is the general adventurous spirit that the movie is filled with. It's just a grand old adventure! The acting is great. Brendan Fraser is a likable rogue who can fire a gun no problem but, as he puts it, ""I bet with my life, not my money."" His unlikely companion is a klutzy librarian who loves Egypt dearly (her mother was Egyptian), and Rachel Weisz is terrific in her star-making part. Likewise, John Hannah is hilarious as her dim-witted, treasure loving brother, Jonathan. You can almost see the jewels in his eyes every time the word ""treasure"" is mentioned. Oded Fehr plays the part of the native who knows all about Imhotep with a mix of ""adventure sidekick cliché"" and a serious character; it works. Despite being in only two scenes, Eric Avari steals them as Evie's boss who plays a unique roles in the proceedings. The only cast member who really doesn't work is Kevin J. O'Connor. As the cowardice, traitorous Benny, his character works, but O'Connor's shrill and croaky voice is extremely annoying. Surprisingly, O'Connor has been in nearly every movie with writer/director Stephen Sommors, so I guess Sommers finds something appealing about him.Stephen Sommers knows just what to do with his material. He clearly did not take offense to critics trashing his previous movie, ""Deep Rising,"" a reaction that I found unfair. Luckily, studios didn't either. Sommers brings his knack for action and goofy humor to this movie, and its more effectively used here.Other than O'Connor's annoying performance, ""The Mummy"" suffers from a few problems. There are a few continuity issues here and there, and if one takes this movie too seriously, they will realize that the story makes itself up as it goes along. Nevertheless, it's goofy charm will prevent most people from realizing them.Great art, this is not. Nor is it a classic like Indiana Jones. But it's still pretty entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

However, some of the campy dialogue made me cringe, and I felt that many of the punch lines fell flat with the audience. Some of the acting was second rate, although I enjoyed Frasier in the lead.

Great Mummy Film!,"The Mummy is probably the best mummy film there is other than it's sequel. Everything is great and enjoyable. Brendan Fraser actually did a good job which I doubted he would, the effects are great, the acting is great, the music is wonderful, even the plot is good. If you are expecting a horror film, you will be disappointed because this movie is similar to Indiana Jones with the the action and adventure The main character is Rick O'Connell. He is saved from certain death by a librarian named Evy and her brother, Jonathan. They head to Hamunaptra to find a certain book called ""The Book of the Dead.""

Brendan Fraser exceeded my expectations as the wise-cracking Rick O'Connell. I am pleasantly surprised by Rachel Weisz. John Hannah cracked me up. Arnold Vosloo is perfect as Imhotep.The music is very good. It's composed by one of the best composers ever, the late Jerry Goldsmith.This movie kept me interested in what's going to happen next.

Formula:  (Congo x Army of Darkness) + Raiders of the Lost Ark - Good writing,"You take the first rate production values (and lame script) of ""Congo;"" mix in the undead, book of the dead that is accidentally used to release the villain, & the goofy protagonist of ""Army of Darkness"" and have everyone convince themselves they're doing the next Indiana Jones movie. Half bake for 2 hours and you've got ""The Mummy."" This movie is to Raiders what ID4 was Star Wars:  Lame junk that may vaguely remind you of a classic while making a mint based solely on top notch special effects.What's good about the movie:  Likable cast and great CGI.  Set Design is top drawer as well. Also if you have kids it will scare them without traumatizing them for life.  Most of the grisly action takes place off screen or in silhouette.What's not so good:  Brendan Fraser plays his usual goofy guy that people loved in ""George of the Jungle.""  He also (like Chris O'Donnell in ""In Love and War"") cannot play a non-contemporary character. This fact is really another caveat (however unintentional) to Bruce Campbell's hero in ""Army of Darkness.  Fraser is not alone in his plight however, as every American character in the supporting cast would be hard to believe as a person from 1975 let alone 1925. Luckily they are all so non-descript and are killed off so quickly you'll have to think hard to remember any of them.The action scenes are done like a video game.  Fraser runs around with two guns that hold impossibly large quantities of bullets shooting everything that moves.  These types of scenes are really exciting when done with style like John Woo, however, that never happens in this movie.  The hand to hand combat also reminded me of playing Double Dragon on my old Nintendo system. The moment where you actually suspend your disbelief and worry that the hero won't succeed never occurs.The supporting cast is mostly unremarkable.  Rachel Weisz (the poor man's Helena Bonham Carter) is quite beautiful but so are the Rocky Mountains and she lacks their depth.  It's not really fair to put her down that way, let's just say she's equal to the material she has to work with.Kevin J. O'Conner just does an ethnic version of the same character he played in writer/director Stepehn Sommers' last opus ""Deep Rising."" (I suppose he is Toshiro Mifune to Sommers' Kurosawa.) Granted Mr. O'Connor is reprising a role from a movie no one saw and he plays it well so I guess he could actually qualify as a highlight. He certainly is trotted out whenever they need comic relief.  As a bonus to fans of ""Bewitched"" Dr. Bombay also makes an appearance as a WW1 bi-plane pilot.In the final analysis, this certainly isn't a bad film...just dopey. Remove the digital effects and it's a Roger Corman movie.  Unlike the effects heavy Matrix there is not a single innovative idea to be enjoyed.  This movie will linger with you about as long as it takes you to digest your popcorn into what the script was from the beginning.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action-packed adventure film,"I remember being terrified when I first watched this when I was just a kid. As I've grown up, there are still a couple of things, mainly the scarabs, that make me cringe. The use of Egypt mythology was a strong point of this film as it includes Egyptian gods, curses and even some of the 10 plagues of Egypt. I admired the performances of both Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, especially how their relationship develops over the course of the story. The supporting roles from John Hannah, Kevin J.O Connor and Oded Fehr were also highlights as their performances very easily stood out, just like the main characters. However, for me, Arnold Vosloo's role as the cursed Imhotep was the spotlight of the film as his performance alone created a strong sense of horror and power. Even though there were a couple of good laughs, I felt that this film could've been better without attempting to be funny. Overall, The Mummy is one of my personal favorite Universal films to come out within the last 14 years and I feel tops off anything that the later sequels can give to the audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

They were painfully bad and if I'm being honest, it's probably this that distracts you from the 99% that was spent on the effects. Maybe that is a slight alleviation for Sommers from delivering the worst film of all time, but he's pushing it.The dialect and script is so bad you feel embarrassed for the cast that they have to further relinquish their barely existent reputations by nearly enacting them.Now that I have slated this awful, awful movie, I will advise anyone who hasn't seen it never to even pick up the box and read it. The fact that this was so popular (admittedly among kids) is unlikely to be beaten as the biggest mystery on the face of the earth",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I wanted to be just like O'Connell when I was a kid.,"I watched this movie a lot as a kid, and I just had to watch it again now since it has been a while, and oh boy it is good! The dynamic between O'Connell (Brandon Fraser) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) is amazing, and all characters are funny and contribute in their own way. I love the relationship between O'Connell and Beni, and I love the scene when O'Connell throws the chair at Beni, just fantastic!The visual effects and special effects are great for its time. I was surprised that this movie still hold up today when it comes to this and many other things, and that I liked it just as much as I did before. The fight scenes are well made and funny at the same time. This movie is a perfect mix of adventure, action, comedy, fantasy, horror and camels!I also remember that I wanted to be just like O'Connell when I was a kid. For example, the scene on the boat when O'Connell rolls out his big bag of guns on the table in front of Evelyn made my jaw drop and I wanted to have all of those guns and run around guns blazing just like he does!Also, I loved that the camels survived in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For the laughs and effects, but not chills","If you go see ""The Mummy"" expecting to be scared out of your wits, you will be very disappointed.  ""The Mummy"" is not a scary, horrifying movie.And it doesn't intend to be.It's hard to take the antagionist Imothep seriously when every time he roars, his jaw grows as big as Jay Leno's.  Of course this movie doesn't intend to take itself seriously, as evidenced by the silly accident in the curator's library scene about 10-15 minutes into the movie.The acting was not above average, and there are loopholes in the plot you could drive a truck through, such as what are American cowboys doing in Africa in the 1920's?  However, the special effects were excellent, especially the sandstorm scene.""The Mummy"" probably won't be the worst thing you'll see this year.  It might even be entertaining.

Computer effects drenched excuse for a decent movie.,"First off, I have haven't seen the original version of `The Mummy' so I can't comment on how the new version compares to the original. But if it were anyway above average, then it would beat this one hands down. Because what we are presented with is a poorly acted, special effects laden, and rather cartoony, hopelessly unconvincing movie. Now I'm not one of those critical snobs who believes that all movies should try to be cinematic masterpieces, but this is just plain childish for the most part.But there is that one saving grace that only barely manages to lift it out of the dross- the computer effects. That was probably the sole intention of reviving this old film. But in fairness to it, the luscious landscapes and beautifully created computer generated images do compensate for some things, but not enough.The one bad thing that stands out amid the rest is the acting. Brendan Fraser was a blindingly bad choice as the film's hero. Mainly because he just isn't serious enough for the part. Rachel Weisz is OK for her part as a clutz, but does tend to overact in the worst possible way. John Hannah was yet another bad choice as yet another form of comic relief. He attempts to be funny but only succeeds in being excruciatingly annoying. Arnold Vosloo takes on the bad-guy role of the title. He's OK but it would have better had he been replaced by a CG mummy.Another very bad thing is the way that the film goes for cheap and rather childish jokes instead of solid shocks and genuine scares. It lowers the overall effect to make it seem far too much like a comedy than anything else.The visual effects only barely make `The Mummy' anything to recommend. The narrative, acting and overall tone are appallingly bad. But at least it's better than its disastrous sequel `The Mummy Returns'. At the same time though, this is below par. 4.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Mummy & The Mummy Returns,"The Mummy and The Mummy Returns both are my all time favorite movies as the Cinematic experience I got with both the movies on single screen theater is just I can not forget. Both films are the visual gems and has the capability to give you a great visual experience of ancient Egypt.
Action sequences, storytelling, Cinematography, Art, Costumes , Sets and CGI effects are some of the aspects to look for.
Both the films are blended with Humor, Emotions and some thrilling moments which may bring you to the edges. Director Stephen Sommers has effortlessly done his job to keep the audience intact with his crisp direction. The Screenplay articulated well especially in the second installment as story unfolds and connects with its first installment .Never forgetting the performances which also contributed equally to make this franchise worth watching. Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connel is surely the Heart and Soul of the movie, the Hero larger then life Macho, Blunt and Brave Fraser has nailed it, he was also exceptional as a caring Father and a lovable Husband in the second installment, Rick O'Connel is the best character Bredan has ever played supported toe to toe by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan, Arnold Vasloo as Imotep has done good job as most of his role was behind CGI but he is the proper villain we got in the movie, Patricia Velásquez, John Hannah & Oded Fehr all justified their presence and supported well to the leads.
What ruined this franchise was its third installment even Jet Li as main Antagonist couldn't save it. Rachel Weisz & director Stephen Sommers absence felt greatly and Alex as grown up is something that I didn't buy as the little Alex in second installment was Brave kid just like his father which was all lost in third installment.""",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The creature looked very interesting C.G.I wise and there were a few O.K. computer-assisted animated scenes, but overall, the story line and acting was bland, bland, bland.This flick tried WAY too hard to be another Indiana Jones, but it tripped over and landed on its head instead! We get lots of comic-book style action, flat and un amusing comedy (again Wild Wild West), comic-book bad guys, and the silly (but visually appealing) woman prancing about like a chicken with its head cut off.The main characters were cliched, unimaginative and quite forgettable. The Egyptian mummy-turned-priest was boring. Why didn't he get portrayed in a more sinister manner? I mean, he starts off trying to bring his dead girlfriend back to life and suddenly he's destroying the world!!!CONCLUSION: Quite nice S.F.X but it needs a LOT more than that!

A movie that goes on and on and on and on...,"Ok. I read Ebert's review first.

That's exactly what this movie has. A start, a climax.Another start another climax.Still another start, another climax.After starting a 1/2 half bottle of a rather decent white wine when the movie began I was ""chilled"" when the wine ran out but the movie didn't.It kept going on from one salute to another. A salute to Indy Jones, a salute to Romancing the Stone, a salute to Ray Harryhousen (sp), a salute to Star Wars, a salute to Temple of Doom, a final salute to Romancing the Stone and a final salute to itself.

Indiana Jones Horror Story,"If you think ""The Mummy"" (1999) is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again.

Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.Everything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the Magi guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah offers some comedic amusing moments as Eve's brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasel.""The Mummy"" is not great ponderous art as in, say, ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but it is great adventure and horrific fun.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The MummyAn easy Halloween costume for a Mummy is to go as the Invisible Man – and vise versa.However, the resurrected priest in this action-horror movie probably doesn't own a trench coat and fedora.While on an expedition with her brother (John Hannah) and a cocksure adventurer (Brendan Fraser), librarian Evie (Rachel Weisz) uses the Book of the Dead to awaken the imprisoned soul of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), a treacherous Egyptian holy man who assassinated the Pharaoh so he could covet his mistress.Now Imhotep wants to use Evie as the avatar for his lost lover's damned soul.While it does deviate greatly from the black and white Boris Karloff incarnations from the 1930s in terms of blazing gunfights and unforgettable special effects, this rollicking and eye- popping 1999 reimagining still manages to retain the overarching original message of love eternal.Incidentally, Egyptian afterlife bares a striking resemblance to the British Museum.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A decent summer blockbuster,"Loathed by the critics, but a huge hit at the box office, this updating of the 1930's Karloff classic provides solid entertainment at the cinema. It's not as good as The Matrix (although the plot is easier to understand), but far better than The Phantom Menace, The Mummy owes more to Indiana Jones than Karloff. Fraiser plays French Legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is rescued from death by Evie (Weisz) and Jonathan (Hannah) Carnahan to help them search for the Lost City of Hamunaptra. Unfortunately they end up awakening The Mummy of the title (a CGI clad Vosloo) who naturally causes havoc. Sommers' script is rather flawed. There are a few too many jokes about smelly Arabs and for the most characterisation and a bumpy romance between Fraiser and Weiez has been sacrificed to the action. This is certainly no Lawrence of Arabia as well, as there is a distinct lack of atmosphere to the film. Hannah is badly cast as Evie's work shy brother. Although he does get quite a few laughs, he is never convincing as a stuck up toff. Frasier is charismatic enough to carry the film and makes a good hero, although he's not a patch on Harrison Ford. However any flaws are more than compensated by the action which is superb, thrilling and spectacular as Sommers piles on the effects, the explosions, and the fights. These include a sandstorm, thousands of bugs, a recreation of Plagues of Egypt, plus the CGI Mummy itself. It you check you brain at the door, then The Mummy is good harmless fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The opportunity to create bone shaking myths and to bring something otherworldly into 'The Mummy' was missed.  Instead we are treated to a run-of-the-mill action film, with cheesy lines that, unlike Armageddon, just aren't funny. Rachel Whatever battles bravely to introduce some acting to cinemagoers, but all to no avail as Brendan Fraser and the zany fella with the fez all but mess it up.Despite the amazing stories that constitute Egypt's history, Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best film to touch upon that magnificent country.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Action, Adventure, Horror & Brendan Fraser All Mixed into One","25 years ago, Universal released their own remake of their 1932 horror film The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser in the lead role. In spite of the feature's mixed critical reception, it was a huge commercial hit and spawned two sequels, a prequel and a short lived animated series. Looking back on the film now, it stands well enough as one of the typical action summer blockbusters made when CGI was dominating that market. As for how it holds up nowadays on its own, while not all that different from the average blockbuster of its day, there's just enough to enjoy from its entertainment value alone.The film follows adventurer Rick O'Connell who travels to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, with a librarian and her older brother, only to accidentally awaken Imhotep, a cursed high priest with supernatural powers. As an adventure film, there's plenty of cliches to go around surrounding O'Connell partnering up with Evelyn and Jonathan Carnahan, the former of whom is both an aspiring Egyptologist and an obvious love interest from the get go. That being said, this is meant to be an Indiana Jones inspired adventure epic complete with high scaled action, swordplay, and dodging dangerous obstacles, and this movie has plenty of it all. While nowhere near as sharply engaging or funny as the better Indiana Jones movies, the tribute is still there and it makes the horror elements work well enough with the sets and effects shown throughout the feature. Many plot points are predictable as popcorn, but anything to keep the story on its feet is fine by me. The film is somewhat self aware enough to know that its story is more about the show than the substance, and it works well in the end.In addition to Brendan Fraser serving as the perfect swashbuckling lead who doesn't always take himself too seriously, the cast make the most out of the otherwise cheesy material. Rachel Weisz in particular is impeccably sharp witted and beautifully bold as Evelyn, and the bumbling chemistry between her brother Johnathan is often funnier than John Hannah's admittedly corny performance. Kevin J. O'Connor also makes for delightfully cowardice as the greedy yet pathetic Beni Gabor and the accompaniment of Jonathan Hyde as Dr. Allen Chamberlain and his men allow for much needed tension when the rival team is searching for the same treasure as our heroes. Lastly, Arnold Vosloo's straight laced presence as Imhotep still remains bone chilling and intimidating from start to finish, elevated even further by his spot on motion capture performance as the character in corpse ridden form. In a silly popcorn flick that mashes horror and comedy within its adventure, a cast of remarkable talent is just what's needed to keep things from losing steam too soon.Now with the special effects being the main selling point for this movie, the phenomenal optical and digital work of ILM holds up today in varying degrees. On one hand, some mystical effects and character animation come off as dated from their rendering alone and there are numerous post production add ons that wouldn't be necessary when compared to the practical production design on display. That said, some of the supernatural elements like the flesh eating scarabs and Imhotep's reawakened minions are still frightening by design, and the insane amount of dedication to making these insane effects work well are no wonder the crew finished the film on the day of its premiere. Much of these effects are carried through the intensely powerful score of acclaimed film composer Jerry Goldsmith, complete with bombastic conduction and a mixing of traditional European orchestral and cinematic Egyptian melodies. Whether the effects hold up well or don't, the actual viewing experience of this film will be determined by all the well coordinated ambition displayed on screen.As an epic action adventure film with horror and comedy mixed in for effect, The Mummy (1999) remains a fun staple of its time that can be enjoyed nowadays on its own for how much nostalgic value it offers. In a day and age where computerized effects have completely dominated filmmaking in more ways than one, seeing a big scale production like this at a time when the technology was still in its early years makes it stand out as a charming treasure from an older era. Whether you prefer this over the original 1932 film with Boris Karloff or the 2017 reboot with Tom Cruise, this one will be a good time for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Escape seemed their only recourse, and while suspenseful, it bordered on déjà vu.Visually, ""The Mummy"" didn't leap forward significantly from the effects seen in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which had graced screens nearly two decades earlier. The mystical allure of ancient Egypt, with its cursed tombs and vengeful mummies, failed to captivate me as I'd hoped.My belated encounter with ""The Mummy"" left me with a resounding ""meh.""

amazing adventure thriller film,"This is a movie about a man who fooled around with the pharaoh's mistress and lived (and died, and lived again) to regret it. As his punishment he is ""mummified alive,"" sealed inside a sarcophagus with thousands of flesh-eating beetles (which eat flesh ""very slowly,"" we learn). Millennia pass. In the 1920s, a French foreign legionnaire named Rick meets a librarian named Evelyn, and joins with her and her brother in an unwise quest to find Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead. (Sample dialogue: ""Are we talking about THE Hamunaptra?"") They get into a race with other fortune hunters, who have heard of untold treasure buried beneath the sands, while meanwhile the descendants of the high priests, who have guarded the city for 3,000 years, move against them. There is good reason not to disturb the mummy, named Imhotep. If he is brought back to life, he will ""arise a walking disease,"" we learn, and unleash the 10 proverbial plagues upon Egypt, of which in the course of the movie I counted locusts, fireballs from the sky, rivers running with blood, earthquakes, and flies. Also of course the flesh-eating beetles, although I was not certain whether they were a plague or came with the territory. None of this has anything to do with the great horror classic ""The Mummy"" (1932), which starred Boris Karloff in a strangely poignant performance as a long-dead priest who returns to life and falls in love with the modern reincarnation of the woman he died for. The 1932 movie contains no violence to speak of; there's hardly any action, indeed, and the chills come through slow realizations (hey, did that mummy move?). This 1999 mummy does indeed mumble something about his feelings for Evelyn, who may be descended from the pharaoh's mistress on her mother's side.

These effects are very cool, and overall I loved the entertainment aspect of the movie.  The humorous lines and actions were a bit campy/slapstick. It was therefore somewhat less intriguing than Indian Jones' wry humor.  Overall I recommend you see it if you like Action/Adventure/Archaeology but don't be surprised when its over and there is little substance to discuss, just enjoy it for the thriller it is!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Special effects...and little else,"There's little to like about ""The Mummy"" especially after the letdown I felt when going to see it. While the trailer was extremely intriguing the plot fell way short of expectations. The cardboard cutout characters were flat and lifeless. The actors were picked merely to fit set molds, including the witty adventurer, the ever degraded middle-easterners and the damsel in distress. Plot points and foreshadowing were even part of the dialogue, a sure sign of an attempt at ""PG-13"" campiness which sadly will only be appreciated by those 13 and under.The special effects are good, but not as good as I would have expected and they certainly do nothing to save the rest of the film which was barely a step above unwatchable. The movie is a barely disguised Keystone Cops adventure which might have been slightly more interesting if it weren't for truly different and interesting films that have already been made like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Fifth Element.""I suspect the masses will enjoy this movie in large numbers because it seems most are programmed to like movies that have expensive trailers, computer-generated special effects and enormous budgets...the current defining principles of Hollywood. So see ""The Mummy"" if you must but prepare to be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heart-pounding adventure.,"The first time seeing this film, it will totally amaze you. If you are a fan of action-adventures or horror movies, then you will like this film. Brendan Fraser stars in his first action-hero role as one of many people who unearth a three thousand year old mummy and accidentally return him to life.Some of the scenes are slightly cliched from other action films, and you may notice some similarities in director Stephen Sommers ways (he is the guy responsible for DEEP RISING). This film is indeed one of the founders of the recent films in the action-adventure genre. This is one that will certainly be remembered.I recommend Sommers' other work, DEEP RISING, and if you are interested in action films, then maybe something like VERTICAL LIMIT or THE TIME MACHINE.THE MUMMY gets 4/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A light-hearted update with all-due respect to the original.,"As a fan of the original Universal horror films, I dreaded the idea of a big-budget production replete with CGI; however, I was pleasantly surprised by this remake of 1932's ""The Mummy"".The story takes the original idea (old not-dead guy wants old dead high school sweetheart back) and gives it a 90's scarier-than-then tweak. Imhotep, a bad-ass Egyptian priest gets fresh with Pharoah's woman, and as punishment receives the worst death/curse in the books.  Unfortunately, as with most curses, if you find that book, he comes back.  And like most catch-22's, he's a booger to kill.Fortunately, like Richard Chamberlain's Allan Quartermain films, this action-filled horror film is sprinkled with good-natured humor which intrudes only once, fortunately at the beginning.  Gunplay is superb, as long as you dig good old-fashioned multi-six-shooter gunfights.  And historically the film does a good job, and very little of the fictionalized Egyptian culture is questionable.What surprised me most about the film is the special effects. The CGI as said before is the best I've seen in a long time, and only falters when more than one beetle is on screen and when .22 caliber machine gun shells make manhole-sized pocks in the face of a sandstorm.  The worst effect regrettably seems to be a favorite, as Imhotep's distended jaw lets loose too many supernatural howls.  The film lags only when the romance seeps in and breaks formula a little too much in those rare places when formula works.  The denoument does seem rushed, as the curses suddenly go on hiatus after arriving in previously rapid succession.  The ending was reasonably anti-climactic, but natural, and combined with the overall good-natured feel of the film, I was reminded of the best sci-fi film in years: ""The Frighteners"", and as is rare in Hollywood, the two films could be from the same universe.In short: A respectful update; a peanut butter and jelly cast; clean, but abundant special effects; good and plenty action & humor; fluid story & presentation; worth full price admission.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Modern Classic!,"This movie is meant to be a classic. It is so ingenious and good that makes you watch it over and over again!
This movie is great, the cast is so good, I never heard of any of them before this movie, except for Brendan Fraser who was in the super famous ""George of the Jungle"" movie. Anyways the performances are very convincing, Brendan Fraser is great as handsome hero, Rachel Weisz is great as Evy, a clumsy but very intelligent egyptologist, John Hannah delivers the humor in this movie as Jonathan, the good-for-nothing guy who only cares about money, I have to mention Oded Fehr too, he was pretty good as the mysterious and attractive Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Mejais who is in charge to put the mummy back in his grave, and how can I forget the Mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo, who was, without any doubt, the best one in this movie. His performance is so good as the evil and sexy high priest Imhotep, he doesn't make you hate him, he makes you feel sorry for him! That is what I call ""acting skills"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More adventurous than Horrific.,"The Mummy is a definite entertainer mostly from horror genre where entertainment, adventure, the ancient mysteries plays the heavy role than the fearsome taste. It's a journey into the ancient secret world deemed as treasure by modern standards where guns, bullets, explosives, swords, horses and idealistic traits all fused together. I saw it in its released year but reviewing it now after almost 25 years. But still it entertains me, still amazes me with all its captivating visuals plus the BGM and also some spooky moments of bugs eating up people. The film is well framed intended to provide almost all the taste of genres combined. You will definitely feel the happy ending right from the beginning.Brendan Fraser is tough guy with soft corner for Rachel Weisz because she saved his neck. Her brother is the dominant comic role throughout, who even help them unthinkably but in comic sense. The guy with black dress is an added treat to the positive vibe. All these characters unite to fight the greatest evil, Imhotep who was of course bought back to this world by Rachel implied by her statement- ""Nothing harm came from reading a book"". Arnold Voslo well acted as the passionate lover turned bad guy who would do anything to bring his lover back. There are scenes that spans knowledge hunting, chasing and fighting, fireworks, lies and cheating and ever predictable climax of the villain. The ugliest character of the film is that of Fiennes who is greedy, ungrateful and selfish at the same time. His ending is justified, so gory that it was kept hidden for viewers with suggestive reference. And finally the bugs.... they gave me the chills on my first watch.The film has some message too like greed ends terribly. The scenery of Hamunaptra is quite exotic to imagine as the crew bought to the screen with all its glories and treasures. The romantic angle is placed appropriately too which has strong role in both hero and villain's perspectives. The film provides us the fun ride with many myths, magic and spells being unfolded in a story of an Egyptian adventure, where love is at the center.The sequels were not engaging as the original. The Mummy would be the best of all it's franchise until well, Steven Spielberg decides to re make it to make it to a masterpiece. An 8/10. An 83/100.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Mummy (1999) BOMB,"CGI-infested, comical garbage ... an insult to moviegoers, or it should be -- because this idiotic film actually has its supporters. Mummy? What ""mummy""? All we get is what amounts to an animated, computerized, cartoony cousin to the Terminator skeleton that actually ""talks"" (!?) with a patented deep and demonic-sounding voice. But, mercifully, at least this thing's only on screen for a few minutes of this atrocity; the rest of the time we're pulverized with non-stop and ultra-cartoony computerized effects and inane humor, the type of which were so prevalent in American horror films of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, that it's becoming increasingly unlikely year after year that a decent monster flick can ever be made again.In his other incarnation, the bald-headed and very human-looking ""Im Ho Tep"" (who has the habit of elongating his open mouth extra wide for no apparent reason other than to utilize the rubbery computer fx) is a pathetic excuse for the title character, and Brendan Fraser is no Indiana Jones, despite his (and the film's) efforts to accomplish precisely that. The characters are idiotic and my mind was so blitzed out by the over-use of computer effects that I didn't even know what I was looking at most of the time. And the stupidity! I knew I was in for trouble the moment those bookcases toppled over like dominoes in that library.Senseless, plot-less, meaningless, mind-numbing, CGI-diarrhea'd, stinking rubbish. This kind of material was far better respected even when Abbott and Costello met their mummy.0 out of ***",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spirited adventure yarn,"Spirited adventure yarn, the (very) bare bones of which retells the classic Karloff movie from the thirties.Fraser plays square-jawed, two-fisted hero Rick O'Connell with affable good-humour and obvious enthusiasm.  Weisz plays prim librarian Evelyn Carnaham, who unwittingly releases Lord Imhotep from his eternal living death. The rest of the cast, not least Arnold Vosloo as the titular bad guy, are all equally great, not bad considering their roles are (necessarily) a collection of hackneyed stereotypes.Were people going to accept an archaeology-based pulp yarn, necessarily crammed with referential gags and slapstick action, without pointless comparisons to Indiana Jones? Well no, but to Sommers' credit he's made room for his own creation in the homage to the pulps' genre. The movie's topped off with a rousing homage to Harryhausen's seminal battle scene from Jason and the Argonauts, here with dusty CG mummies taking the place of stop-motion skeletons. Because of this scene alone I went to see the movie a second time at the cinema. Brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Still Lots Of Fun,"This is another Universal Pictures, classic monster, brought back to life and given a major face-lift, almost 70 years after the original film. The Mummy (1999), would spawn two sequels. Brendan Fraser gives a believable performance, hitting the comedic and serious notes, with no problem. Director Stephen Sommers, recreates the origin scenes, found in the original 1932 film, quite well, and after that, the mummy is given a 21st century update, with super powers and magic, as opposed to being Karloff as just an immortal ghoul. The Mummy (1999), is a lot of fun, packed full of action and has great special-FX. The supporting cast consists of pleasantly good personalities, such as Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo. The film also co-stars Bernard Fox (most-famously known as Dr. Bombay on Bewitched, 1964-1972), as a washed up airplane pilot. This might be the sixth time I have seen this movie and it is still great fun. Still an enjoyable favorite for me.PMTM Grade: 8.7 (B+) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of my childhood favorites,"The Mummy (this version) was my personal introduction to the Universal Monsters. As such, it holds a special place in my heart as a fun, silly, sometimes scary adventure film. And, with it being re-released in theaters for its twenty fifth anniversary, I was able to watch it for the first time in cinemas (I was too young to watch it when it first released). And all I can say is I still have a ton of fun with it. The film knows to take its time, establishing the backstory in a phenomenal prologue, and developing the setting and characters for the first hour until the mummy wakes up, where the real fun (and scares) begins. There aren't any real surprises for newcomers, but who needs them? We're here for a fun action movie, and it delivers, with tons of great lines and funny gags to boot. The bit with the bookcases still kills me.The cast is pretty much flawless. It's funny to think that this was Brendan Fraser's follow-up film to George of the Jungle, and he's as fun here as he is there: a classic action hero type with plenty of cool fights and amusing quips. Rachel Weisz is as beautiful as ever (had a big crush on her as a kid), is a likeable and smart heroine, and has great chemistry with Fraser. Arnold Vosloo is terrifying as the mummy. Oded Fehr is enjoyably enigmatic, and a great action star in his own right. John Hannah and Kevin J O'Connor are great comic relief. And the rest is solid too.Some of the CGI, particularly on the mummy's skeletal form, hasn't aged well, but that's to be expected in a movie this old. Besides, there's still plenty of legitimately great looking effects and some cool ideas that go along with them. Seeing the mummy slowly regain his skin as he regenerates is as creative as it is creepy, as is the giant sand wall with his face on it. And the less said about the scarab beetles and how scary they are, the better. The action's a ton of fun, with great stunts, choreography, and plenty of variety. The sets are impressive and just scream Egypt. And the music's appropriately epic and, at times, ominous.Overall, The Mummy has aged surprisingly well and is as much fun now as when I first watched it. Is it as good as the original? Absolutely not. But, it stands on its own more than well enough. Besides, I'll take it over its sequels and the Tom Cruise film any day.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Death that came from the sands,"Films about all kinds of mummies were shot with a good dozen, and maybe two. And all of them, in my opinion, are much inferior to this picture directed by Stephen Sommers. The success of the painting followed immediately. There are several reasons for this.Firstly, this is not a standard horror film, but a kind of mixture of horror and a film with good humor, for which thanks to Broendan Fraser and John Hanna. This approach was a novelty, played positively, found his fans.Secondly, the technical possibilities in cinema have reached such a development when it was possible to show a mummy as a mummy, and not as a person wrapped in bandages and whom you don't really believe. In the same film, you really see in front of you a man who died several thousand years ago, who rose from the dead.Thirdly, excellent actors who perfectly convey the era of the beginning of the XX century, in which events take place.Fraser plays the role of Oconnell. This is a classic main character. Tall, handsome, brave, ready to save and fall in love with the main character.Weiss plays the librarian. An exemplary young girl who studied conscientiously, learned science, and now seeks to help the main character.Hannah portrays the main character's brother. Also a typical assistant to the main character. He is a klutz, a slob, always gets into trouble, from which the main character has to help him out.Voslu demonstrates the villain. A horror from the past who is ready to do anything to resurrect his beloved. This motivation of the villain captivates the viewer. He embodies horror, but at the same time acts in the name of love for a woman with whom he could not have been in life.Velasquez appears in this film only at the beginning, playing a beautiful concubine, the chosen one of the pharaoh, whom the villain wants to resurrect. In a small role, she managed to convey the mystery, grace and sexuality of that distant era.The film is full of action, does not let you sit up, makes you worry about the characters. It has everything a movie like this needs: shootouts, chases, fights. Especially memorable is flying on an airplane in a sandstorm.

Classic Adventure Film,"It's a massive shame how underappreciated the Mummy is, considering the amount of aspects it balances and gets right. It only has a 60% on RT and only seems to have a small following, despite being an excellent action, adventure and monster films. I rewatched it recently, and only confirmed prior thoughts of greatness. Here some of the pros/takeaways I have:-The setting is perfectly realized: the movie does an incredible of taking the viewer to 1920s Egypt, a setting rarely used in film. The beautiful desert shots, egyptian-like score and specific period set pieces contribute and enhance the film in many ways. It's often just a joy to look at and listen to the film.
-It does a fantastic job with it's creatures/mythology. The story blends aspects of Egyptian mythology/history seamlessly, as it showcases various locations, gods, objects and characters. It is a lot easier to get into the movie with the excellent world design created here.
-The story is fresh and exciting.
-The actors/characters are excellent. The Mummy has an almost entirely unknown cast (Rachel Weisz being the only actor/actress to star in critically-applauded films) and yet nearly every performance in the film works in its own way. The two massive standouts are John Hannah as Jonathan, honestly in my opinion one of the best comic-relief side characters in movie history, and Arnold Vosloo as the Imhotep, an excellent villain with the perfect amount of humanity. Brendan Fraser is an excellent lead, Rachel Weisz is solid, and even most of the minor characters contribute to the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Death is Only the Beginning,"It's always difficult for brainless action movies to hold up over time. It's incredibly rare that such films can stand more than a decade or so without feeling too silly. The Mummy, which was made nearly 2 decades ago, definitely falls under this category. With a dumb script, exaggerated acting, dated CGI, and a dopey tone, 1999's version of The Mummy is a cable movie at best.It's amazing to see how far this series has come, from the intellectual 1932 film to the blockbuster action 2017 feature, it's clear that this is a property that people are interested in no matter the genre it forms. With that said, if a film titled 'The Mummy' never manages to offer a single scare or thrill, there's something seriously wrong with the direction. ""But that's not the direction they wanted to take with the movie"", some may say, well then make the film you intended at least a little bit entertaining. I had heard this film wasn't to be taken seriously, but to show no respect or knowledge for the source material at all feels disappointing to say the least.The acting is abysmal. Some of it can certainly be contributed to the dialogue they were given and perhaps the direction as well, but the line delivery here is just brutal. I know Brendan Fraser isn't particularly regarded as Oscar caliber, but Rachel Weisz definitely is. To see all them do such poor work is more than difficult to watch. But I think this can all come back to the tone established by director and writer, Stephen Sommers. The lighter, goofier tone is clearly purposeful, but it only works if you buy into the characters. I always bring up the Fast & Furious as examples for these types of films because they succeed in making over the top action movies without sacrificing the dynamics between their central characters. The Mummy doesn't do that one bit.I think one of the things that does work is Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score. Not only does it harken back to the days of John Williams' heroic theme for Indiana Jones, but it actually complements the action quite well. It's just too bad I didn't particularly care for the action that was going on anyway. Overall, this film displays a serious lack of awareness in tone, humor, and writing, even if some of the action provides brief swashbuckling fun amidst a great score.
