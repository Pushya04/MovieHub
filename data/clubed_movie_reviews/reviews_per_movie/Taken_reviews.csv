It was all personal to me.,"Much of what occurs in Liam Neeson thriller Taken is incredibly implausible, but with suspension of disbelief turned up to eleven, the film proves to be an extremely satisfying viewing experience—a brutal action flick that effectively exploits that most basic of human emotions: the desire to see the wicked punished.Neeson stars as ex-special forces operative Bryan Mills, who kicks seven shades of the proverbial out of the Albanian human traffickers who are stupid enough to kidnap his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).Although the film's star is well into his fifties, Neeson shows no sign of taking it easy in his old age, kicking, punching and blasting his way around Paris with the energy and power of man 20 years his junior. Director Pierre Morel conducts all of this mayhem with style, and doesn't skimp on the nastier stuff, having Mills mercilessly torture his victims for information, kill without a moment's hesitation, and generally act like a total bad-ass—enough of a bad-ass to make it easy to forgive the film's sillier aspects.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Probably the fastest 93 minutes of my life !,"Wow - I had already read reviews of this movie, and with the writer being one of my favourite directors, Luc Besson, I just had to go see this movie as soon as possible...I was not disappointed... I'm not sure if this was intentional but there were no trailers before the movie, so being thrown strait into the film unexpectedly with people whispering ""is this it then ?"" only helping build up some initial tension and excitement.The film starts nicely, but with overtones of spy thrillers like ""Day of the Jackal"" coming to mind. Neeson seems a bit pityful at the start, but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thriller.Then, before you know it, it's over. 93 minutes, gone in a blur of fighting, fear, chasing and excitement at serious pace. The artwork and direction is nicely done, giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possible.It was one of those films that I wanted to applause after the film, I actually clapped about three times, but no-one joined in... too afraid of being the only two people clapping I suppose...Neeson was great, and I can't wait to see the movie many more times. I only gave it 9 out of 10, as it was too short ! The film could have been easily stretched to 2 hours in my opinion, with some more development and intimacy with the characters. But I guess this may have not made it so exciting... still, well worth the money to see this in the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Who needs luck when you can break a guy's arm in three places?,"Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going.By setting the chase within the ultra-sleazy world of human trafficking, which we secretly hope is just a media creation, but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality, the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isn't present in most revenge films. Liam Neeson's daughter isn't ""Dead"", she's ""Taken"", so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what's going to happen here.The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star, but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here, we're left hoping that he's got a franchise in him.The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films (although, like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen, the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon's antics), but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer.You don't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam's plight here, and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex, ambiguous studies of man's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesn't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beat-downs all over Paris.This film doesn't want you to think. Like Neeson's character quickly realizes, thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts, and for those who miss the era of the lean, mean 85-minute skull-crack fest, Taken will re-conjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff, Seagal, and Van-Damme chomp through a slew of B-Movie terrorists. Having an Oscar-caliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot.Forget about Oscars, plot points, or coherence. This dude's daughter has been kidnapped, and he's a former government agent trained to make bad guys' lives a living hell. Do you want to see him find his daughter and take down the scum who took her? Of course you do. Even reading this review is over-analyzing it.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Neeson is the vodka of James Bond's martini,"The most thrilling movie I've seen in a long time. Neeson is what we would fear if James Bond went to hell and came back for revenge (I doubt big budget Quantum of Solace will top this). I loved Jason Bourne; but where Bourne is confused for half the movie, Neeson is looking down a barrel of a pistol 3/4 of the time. In a three way spy battle, I would put Neeson edging out Bourne, who would be a step ahead of Bond.Between the jaw-dropping action sequences was the subject matter of international trafficking, which was pretty miserable to watch. Although killing is wrong, death was never more satisfying to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

perfect high speed action,"Just saw the movie in the sneak preview. First of all this movie will get a lot of those people who will whine about everything that is not realistic really (If you are one of those, you'll have a lot to whine about). But if you can just enjoy a movie as its intended to be and you appreciate some action this movie is near perfect. The main character is so pure and non complex.

brilliantly executed film,"First thing to say is, this is a great and fun movie from beginning to end. If you like the Bourne titles then you will love this movie. The fighting style and the way things get done is similar to Matt Damon's character and it doesn't get old and is interesting and great to watch throughout the whole film.The movie has a similar plot to other action thrillers, but even though you may know the outcome, it is the journey that counts in this movie. It is the way he does what he does, the way that he fights and overcomes problems that draws you into the movie and makes this movie so great to watch.Liam Neeson is such a great cast for the main character, he delivers an outstanding performance. I love to see an actor that can portray themself in anyway, a good guy or a bad guy and in this film he fights for his daughter and he will not stop for anything. You love to watch him seek revenge and feel for him the whole time, maybe just because its Liam Neeson, can you help yourself from loving this guy? He is such a great actor and shows himself as a badass with charm.Great, great , greatness i loved this movie so much and had great fun watching it.

It doesn't get much better.,"A no nonsense, kick the crap out of everyone who gets in your way action movie. Liam Neeson's character is the angry love child of Bourne,Bond and all the other pretenders put together. If I was asked to cast the movie I guess he wouldn't have been my first choice but having seen it I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have in the role. The fight choreography is bone crunchingly good. This is one kick ass flick and one I will definitely buy on DVD. There's little doubt who the bad guys are and they get a very satisfactory smack in the mouth - when they aren't being shot or electrocuted. This was made by people who like the genre and know how to get an action movie from A to Z. I can't help but giggle at those reviews that mention plot and probability in this kind of movie.

"Excellent film, much like Man on Fire","Just watched this film and have to say, very good in the scheme of things. The film is quite slow at the beginning as others have said, however it quickly gathers pace. The way the script introduces you to the characters is excellent and its only when you see Liam Neeson tackling a crazed fan that you think he is an excellent choice in the lead role, in fact he carries it off very well. I wasn't too sure on Holly Valance as the pop singer, but as the number of scenes she is in are fairly minimal its OK. Action sequences are very well shot and you can tell Luc Besson had his hand in this. To this end, the overall film has an excellent pace which keeps you very well entertained. It has the same sort of storyline as Man on Fire so if you liked that film, then you will definitely like this. I would say its probably slightly better with the direction and cinematography being just a bit classier. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend you seeing this. 7/8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Surprising original exciting action movie,"I saw this movie tonight at the sneak preview and I was completely surprised and blown away. I went to see this movie with no expectations. In the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie, but after a short time it turned into a high-speed action movie. I found the story original and so did my friends. At some times I found it hard to watch, because of the drug abuse and violence. To know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling. I was completely taken away by this movie. At some points it was very very quiet in the cinema, because of the excitement, you wonder what is going to happen next. Some moments in the story I found a bit not convincing, but the rest of the movie makes up to that. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. It had good action, a good story, some humor. There are also some sensitive / sentimental scenes. There are no plot twists. It is just a story being told. This is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen. The movie that had that same effect on me was Traffic (2000). Personally I think this movie is underrated, but maybe this is because it is new. I would give it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Surprinsingly good - definitely must see,"I'm still under the influence of this movie, so my comment is likely to be superlative! I went to this movie, knowing that one of the writers and the director were both French, and since I've seen some not-so-impressive movies (almost fell asleep), i was really skeptical.BUT this one proved to be a great action movie. The best movie to compare with Taken is Hit-man. The idea is somewhat the same (lots of action, shots, flying bullets etc) - though the motive for the actions are not money. But the level of realism, the motivation of the character, the cold blood which moves him on makes this flick a good option to choose when selecting a movie.Liam Neeson does a great performance, perfectly interpreting his role of a former spy. As he says in one of his lines, he's ""retired, but not dead"", having an opportunity to show everyone what he knows to do best.The movie covers a hot topic too, kidnapping young women to force them to prostitute, and all the business this involves. You get to see the kind of people are supporting these arrangements and what it takes for the victims to be there.Of course, the movie has (very small, almost invisible) drawbacks, like some lines in a wrong language (english instead of french) and some Rambo - stuff, but the overall impression is simple: a strong recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"Never Boring, Always Exciting","This movie had me excited from since I had read reviews on IMDb about it, and it did not disappoint. This is a fast paced thriller that had me gripped till the end, with great elements of action, a bit of gore, a lot of suspense, and all in all a fun movie that was completely worth the 90 minutes.Liam Neeson once again proves himself to be up there among the best with another brilliant performance and this one has really made me a big fan of his work, especially after great performances recently in Batman Begins, and voice roles in Narnia and Fallout 3. All through the movie he gives you the impression that he is not one to be messed with, and makes the action sequences look absolutely fantastic. The next Bond? Although a bit old, he would fit into the role brilliantly seeing as how easily he carried it through in Taken.All in all, a great movie, and one I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good action thriller...

A thrilling movie and Neeson at his best !,"Gone to see Liam Neeson, I've just seen a great movie. Much action, some American humour (you Americans don't take it too serious, and that's just as pleasant taht way !), a Liam Neeson at the top of his art and as a background a very hard subject that makes you think about it (procuring). I don't know how the critics are reacting in USA, but in France they are vilifying this movie. So, whatever your American critics are saying, just do as usual : don't listen to them ! And enjoy this ninety-minutes show. Regarding Liam Neeson... Well, I am a huge fan, thus I can't be unbiased. Yet, I found his interpretation very convincing, he is still the same : one of the best actors ever, along with... Hum, I'll stop there, don't want to be controversial. Have a good sitting !

"It's no ""Man on Fire"" but it's good","I gave this movie a 7 rating based upon Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and his die hard tactics alone. At the beginning of this flick I was ready to pull the plug and call it a bust, but I'm glad I hung in there. Still, the only compelling part of this movie was Bryan Mills' tenacity, resourcefulness and ability to kick a**. The movie started very slow and uninteresting. I'm well aware that movies need some character build up time, but I found that I didn't like the characters. When a spoiled girl, with the help of her mother, lies to trick her father into letting her go to Paris with another equally young and naive girl only to be kidnapped... we tend to say: you make your bed you lie in it. You reap what you sow is also applicable. In other words, all that was going through my head was, ""far less deserving girls have gotten kidnapped and I'm supposed to care about you?"" So, to start, I wasn't all that sympathetic nor was I moved to fully root for Bryan Mills to buck all odds.My attitude soon changed. It didn't change because I saw the purity and innocence of his daughter, it changed once I began to see the sheer creepery (or should I say creepness?) of the characters involved in the kidnapping. Then, and only then, did I want to see faces smashed, pain inflicted and overall destruction. I don't think it was Liam Neeson's acting so much as it was the script that depicted Bryan Mills utter desperation and at-all-costs willingness to get his daughter back.This movie was a cross between Hostel and Man on Fire and it was still able to have a unique enough flare to separate it from those two. A vigilante film done well is always good in my book",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Step aside Bond and Bourne... Niam is better !,"Yes, its only an action movie; Yes, the script has more holes than the victims of the main character!

I left the movie feel very satisfied... its that kind of movie that is fun and thrilling and brainless at the same time. Doesn't get tiresome. When its outrageous its funny... when the action gets going you feel right in it all.When you finish seeing the movie you do wonder why Bond and Bourne aren't as macho or mean. Niam's character Bryan(""B"" letter too) beats up baddies way better and he looks more scary and real somehow than those other pansy agents.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"""I will find you... and I will kill you"".","With these words, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills has exactly 96 hours to set out and look for his daughter's kidnappers in Paris before she is lost in the sex/slave trade. That's it. No subplots, no cheap thrills, nothing. Even the film's length shows the simplicity of that purpose. 94 minutes. But...William Friedkin said it best when making the hunted; ""today's action movies are too long (winded) and overblown."" Sure, there are long action movies that are still enjoyable; all 4 ""Die Hard""s, ""True Lies"", ""Speed"", ""Face/Off"", and then there are some which are dumb fun but somewhat incoherent altogether; the last two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, ""xXx"" and most Michael Bay films show this. Not here. It's short, fast and definitely exciting.A realistic knuckle-bound, no-holds-barred thriller, Taken has the ingredients that make a great action movie, added with some ""zing"" to make it better. That ""zing"" is Liam Neeson. His character, Mills is a flawed person. A lonely man with a dark past. His wife left him for another, seemingly better man, because he could not leave his job. His only daughter seems to be the only thing that shows his true human qualities. But take that life-saving angel of his and he will unleash a hell-storm upon those who took her. No, really. It's all about characterization. Neeson is transformed from concerned parent to angel of death within a flash. He would shoot, punch, kick, snap, kill anyone within his rescue path, and yet, possess some humane qualities that make him believable. It's great, because Neeson shows us that he can be an action hero that everybody can cheer on and be afraid of at the same time. I wonder what would Neeson's career would be now if he had taken that action hero path. Don't get me wrong, Neeson is still an exceptionally brilliant actor, but here he shows he can kick ass, hard, and still be up and out, thirsty for more. Mills give Jason Bourne, The Transporter, and 007 a run for their money.Now the story (by action great Luc Besson and partner Robert Mark Kamen) is simple, but it is refreshingly written well and quite original. It's clear these guys did their research. The first 20 minutes is slow-paced, explaining in detail Neeson's characterization, as well as building up the tension and expectations. However by then the pace will skyrocket, and you will find yourself immersed in this speeding bullet of an actionier. Also it is straightforward and simple, but that's how I (and presumably most action fans) like our action movies nowadays. No confusing plot twists. No cheap thrills. No third person life-savers. And although there are some flaws, it's mostly because they're predictable and clichéd. But that only occurs very few times in the film. It's literally in-your-face action. The dialog is also well written, especially some lines (as exampled by the title comment) said by Neeson himself, in a cold and brutal manner. All I can say is the simple ""child-gets-kidnapped"" plot device is slightly reinvented and done with justice here, ala the ""out-for-revenge"" plot device used in ""Man on Fire"", another excellent action movie.It's clear that almost everyone involved in the technical aspects of the film is French, and seeing that the film is mostly set in Paris, comes to no surprise. The direction by Pierre Morel is very lively and kinetic, increasing the pace as the film progresses until the climax. He shows a knack for directing action sequences - and there are plenty in this movie. Brutal fights, shootouts, car chases and hand-to-hand combat are put to well use here - in fact this may be THE hardest PG-13 action film ever made. Morel is a guy to look out for in the future. The scenery is photographed by fellow cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, who clearly knows his background as we see the lively and glamorous streets of Paris disguising the gritty urban atmosphere of the underworld. It's really neat and fits the mood of the film well. Accompanying these is slick editing by Frédéric Thoraval, and really neat music by Nathaniel Mechaly, whose score can compete with John Powell's score for the ""Bourne"" trilogy - fast and kinetic during action scenes, slow and reflective during dramatic scenes. Puts you in the mood. Closing off this expanded review, the supporting actors. Don't have nothing much to say as Neeson alone has your total attention. However some credit goes to Maggie Grace as the daughter, convincing us she's not exactly the typical damsel-in-distress.Overall, ""Taken"" is not just solid, it's SUPER solid. It's excellent. Not only one of the best films of the year, it's also one of the best action movies ever made! A joyously refreshing film to watch, especially if you're an action fan, make this a must-see on your list. It's freaking brilliant and will linger in your mind for some time.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Good cinematography by cameraman Michel Abramowicz using Steadicam and zooms with numerous locations from Paris.

Should have been better,"The teaser warns how dangerous Liam is and the set-up is enticing... slave trade, kidnapped daughter and so on. Liam had a team of high-tech people to help him...but goes it alone. It's like Mission Impossible, except it's not Tom going solo this time. This should have been a great action film, with gadgets and planning, with a team working together to not only get back Liam's daughter, but bring down the entire kidnapping/slave trade organization. Instead, it's just one string of killings and fight scenes, followed by chases -- plus the baddies are the worst possible shots in the world. At one point machine guns blast away from near point-blank range, shooting holes through the doors and windows of Liam's car...but every shot misses both Liam and the girl in the back seat. And when it's not ridiculous that so many bullets could miss, the shooters simply can't hit a standing target twenty feet away. This would have been a great film if Liam hadn't gone it alone.

"Shaky In Spots, But No-Nonsense Neeson Is Neat","Liam Neeson as ""Bryan Mills,"" reminded me of Denzel Washington's role in ""Man On Fire.""

An ex-professional killer in retirement, ""Bryan"" travels to Paris and shows the bad guys who they're messing with! Neeson is very good in here.Yeah, it's a little far-fetched but it's a fun hour-and-a-half that's guaranteed to entertain and a no-nonsense, shoot-first film that always satisfies.

No compromises,"I have to start with a review of the movie, in a magazine (Empire), which gave this movie a real rating. The reason for that, was the fact, that the movie shows Europe in a dark light and if you would actually take the whole thing seriously, you could accuse the movie of being ""xenophobic"" (or should that read ""euro-phobic""?) ... but that's missing the point.The movie is there to entertain and not to warn Americans, to stay in America and take their vacations there (which the review also stated). Entertain might seem a bit of a stretch if you have seen the movie, but I do stand by that. After a slow start, the pace picks up and there is almost no stop until the end.The movie is pretty intense, but it is completely justifiable. And it does stay true to itself, which makes it a lot better than recent efforts (Brave One, Death Sentence) in that same or similar fashion.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The lesson for today is don't mess with Liam Neeson.,"The film star is all kinds of bad ass in this grim, intense action flick, which could be described as a very lean and very mean James Bond type of film. It's so briskly paced and action packed that it clocks in at a very trim 91 minutes (and it only runs an extra two minutes in the unrated extended cut). If it does its job, you won't be thinking about how implausible any of it might be - you'll just be wolfing down the popcorn and having a high old time.Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative who's left the business to make up for lost time with his now teen aged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). She gets an opportunity to travel to Europe, and the protective, cautious dad is dubious about the whole thing, especially upon learning of the lack of parental figures on this trip. Of course, he's proved right as the hapless girl is abducted by Albanian human traffickers. He gets his ass to Paris and leaves a trail of death and destruction in his wake as he does everything he has to do to save his girl.As long as one is looking for some undemanding no-brainer violent fun, they can quite enjoy ""Taken"". It definitely doesn't waste its time once its gets going. It is a little slow to start as it establishes Bryan trying to be a cool dad and making a living performing such duties as security for a pop star (Holly Valance). But when Bryan gets moving, the movie turns into a wild ride, with plentiful scummy bad guys who can't die soon enough. It's also amusing to note how ruthless Bryan can be. The man doesn't care who he has to shoot in order to get what he wants. Some viewers may find the activities of the bad guys to be quite off putting, especially considering the fact that they place a high value on virgins. Editing, location work, and photography are all well done, and a good supporting cast including some familiar faces (Leland Orser, Jon Gries, Xander Berkeley, and the lovely as ever Famke Janssen as Bryans' ex- wife) all help to make this agreeable escapism.As far as this kind of entertainment goes, one could certainly do a lot worse.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"""...I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you. ""","It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. The film has not been released in the USA yet even though it's been out for months in Europe and Asia. I don't understand why because as the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture.The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite ""Special Activities Division"" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, would tell you everything you have to know: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly.Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women, he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad. I don't recall when was last time I felt as satisfied as when Bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger. I saw perfectly clear all movie's weaknesses and clichés while I was watching it but it never bored me, it was non-stopping action, and it had a hero whom I desperately wanted to succeed. Perfect or not - I liked Taken a lot and would recommend it without hesitation.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

A pleasant surprise,Quite a surprise to see such a good movie highly ignored. The film is shot similar to the Bourne movies but carves out it's own niche. Great job by Neeson who once again proves that he can basically do any role and is highly underrated. The premise of the movie is simple and the action starts out with a bang. I just wish the release date would be the same in the United States as abroad. Supporting cast is solid.Action seens ae intense and much more realistic then what is normally shot. I think this could have had a very good theatrical run but being released so early in other countries means it will just be pirated. Hopefully we'll get to see a sequel but I doubt it.

The Best Action Movie of the Year,"The seventeen year-old Kim (Maggie Grace) is the pride and joy of her father, the retired agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) that left the secret service to stay near Kim in California.

When they arrive, they share a cab with the stranger Peter (Nicolas Giraud) and Amanda tells to him that they are alone in Paris. When Bryan succeeds in contacting his daughter, she tells that criminals have just break in the apartment and Bryan listens to the assault. The girls are kidnapped by an Albanese gang of human trafficking. Bryan promises in the phone to kill the kidnapper of his daughter and immediately travels to Paris to find Kim and chase the criminals.""Taken"" is the best action movie of the year, and everything that I could expect from, for example, a 007 movie. The plot is predictable and full of clichés of the genre, with cars chase, explosions and lots of shootouts; but the story is highly entertaining and Liam Neeson is excellent in the role of a needy father and efficient agent. I did not count how many bad guys Bryan kills along the story, but I hope to see this character back in the near future in another adventure.

A New Face in the Action World!,"This must be the time of the year for old men to open some big ol' cans of whoop-ass; first we had Clint Eastwood as the sour racist in Gran Torino, and next we have Liam Neeson on a globe-trotting mission to return his daughter. Now all we need is them to star in a crossover. He's Taken My Gran Torino, anyone?Taken is not so much a revenge thriller as it is kidnapping film with revenge simply tagging along for the ride. And it's quite a ride. Bryan Mills (Neeson) does everything he can to please his daughter Kim. (Lost's Maggie Grace) He has retired earlier then his colleagues from his job as a spy, he moves to California to be nearer to her and his ex (Famke Janssen) in an attempt to reconnect and regain his lost years. While Kim adores her father, his disciplined background keeps them at a distance so when the opportunity comes to allow Kim to take a trip to Paris with her friend, Bryan reluctantly takes the points, and allows her to go. But shortly after arrival, Kim and her friend are taken my unknown assailants, and it is up to Bryan to track down and rescue Kim before she vanishes forever.Taken succeeds because of three things. Firstly the characters and the actors playing them (especially Neeson) are developed enough and do sufficient enough acting jobs to lend a lot of credibility to the unlikely scenario. Secondly, the low key way the story unfolds somehow manages to mask the highly preposterous likelihood Kim would ever be found and thirdly because of its thrilling and gritty action which never for a second fails to entertain. After seeing this film I was bothered by why I enjoyed Taken so much more then other revenge or kidnapping films like 2007's Death Sentence which I found to be both utterly ridiculous and morally repugnant. While Taken had its somewhat sadistic scenes, it never felt morally bankrupt like other films of its ilk. It finally clicked at random; Taken is driven by an objective, an end goal, for Bryan to return his daughter. Similar films are driven only by revenge and chronicle the vigilante killings and promote jumbled messages. Like I stated in the opening of this review, the killings are the means to an end, and because of that it is far easier to enjoy.I have no hesitation in calling Taken the best action movie of the year and it is certainly a joy to see Neeson back on screen and doing something different and entertaining. It just lends to the long running trend that acting is usually the last thing to go wrong with a film, and with somebody like Neeson at the helm, Taken achieves a whole new level credibility and could mark the beginning of a new face in the world of action.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Both terribly good and terribly bad,"The spy-thriller film genre is a favorite of mine, has been since I first saw Connery's James Bond in Goldfinger as a young boy. In my late teens I was introduced to Jason Bourne and my liking of the genre was decidedly solidified.I like Luc Besson (his Leon is an all-time favorite of mine), and The Fifth Element was a breath of fresh air that mixed elements sci-fi, humor, horror, and suspense in a wonderfully well-balanced and entertaining way (not to mention that it had Milla Jovovich in it...).After hearing almost nothing but heated enthusiasm for this movie, I finally saw it last night. Honestly, I wanted to fall in love with this film. Liam Neeson is a splendid actor, and I've liked nearly all of his efforts to date. His character in this movie is an ex-spy whose dedication to his former career spelled a divorce for him and an estrangement from his now teenage daughter who he dearly loves. Of course, the title of the film lets us know what the movie is about. The movie's plot elements are awfully tired as they've been overused to agonizing redundancy in countless films, but hey okay, it's supposed to be really good, has Liam Neeson in it, and after all, it's a spy-thriller, right? Well...I won't give any details away here. Suffice it to say that parts of this movie had me cheering and hyper-adrenalized, but conversely, parts of it had me rolling my eyes as I sat through scenes that were laughably implausible, unbelievably predictable, and, acting-wise, downright wooden. There are no surprises in this movie. While Jason Bourne was a bad-ass spy that we expected to mess people up, his character was complex and all three films in the Bourne Trilogy featured intelligent plot twists, good acting, and decent scripts. The same cannot be said of this movie. Taken reveals some of the most pathetic acting, annoying characters, and mindless Hollywood drivel I've seen in a long time. But...It's entertaining, to say the least. Actually, if you can shut half of your brain down, it's quite good. Just don't expect anything you haven't seen before. The early scenes in which Neeson seeks (and gets) delicious revenge are excellent, yes. But although he always destroys his enemies, the freshness of his victories becomes absent before half the movie is over. You'll see why. For the most part, Taken is a repetitive, one-dimensional, and mind-numbingly unrealistic movie. Too bad. With a little more ingenuity and all-around versatility it could have been great. The bottom line: Taken is a movie that is both terribly good and, yes, terribly bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Of all the women we kidnap, we happen to nab the one with a deadly spy as a father....just our luck...","Remember that time period when Hollywood used to release incredible action/thriller movies in an orderly pace? Neither do I. What used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s (Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Jurassic Park, The Mummy, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, Clear and Present Danger, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) suddenly became a distant memory, as the 2000s served very few decent Hollywood thrillers. Instead, we have to head overseas to find them. The 2000s consisted of many surprise-surprise excellent European actioneers with Hot Fuzz, Run Lola Run, Transporter, Kiss of the Dragon, Unleashed, and this superb flick.What happens nowadays is that Hollywood is scaling back its amount of action in order to make the extra money. In the first paragraph, 15 of the 19 movies I mentioned from the 90s were rated-R. In other words, they did not care about the PG-13 rating. Now, nearly every action movie must hit the PG-13 barrier. Even the fourth Die Hard was edited to not reach rated-R (which was a Die Hard staple). To add to that movies from overseas (like this one) become edited in the States in order to hit the weaker and friendlier PG-13. But don't let that stop you. Taken is one of the most vicious PG-13 movies you'll ever see, and you'll enjoy every minute of its inability to cut back on the gruesomeness. It sounds barbaric, I know, but if you truly want to see what good action used to look like from the studios of Tinseltown, look no further than this excellent effort.Luc Besson and his talented filming crew provide yet another gripping story to sink your teeth into. This time it's about a retired spy (Liam Neeson) who searches all of Europe in order to find his kidnapped daughter (Maggie Grace). He is given a small time frame, since his daughter is about to be sold into the deep, disgusting, and grueling underworld of sex trafficking. The movie starts off with Bryan, the spy, trying to adjust to a life without espionage, and the rest is just a wild roller coaster ride containing plentiful action scenes and fight after fight. Written by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, Taken provides a healthy dosage of father-daughter sentimentality as well as provide an insight into a dangerous illegal world not seen often in movies.But it's not just the delightful taste of gunfire, fights, and chases that maintains the entertainment in Taken. Liam Neeson does an excellent job portraying the retired spy. While there are indeed great action stars, very few of them are excellent actors as well. Liam Neeson can proudly say he fits both billings, as his version of a spy is just as cold and calculating as even Daniel Craig's James Bond. Most amazing fact is that he is over 55 years of age. While Jason Bourne remains the most lethal of all the movie character spies in the last decade, Bryan isn't too far behind. While everyone else in the movie delivers decent performances, it's Neeson that runs and carries the show with a mix of emotion, determination, and rage.Pierre Morel directs this movie well, by keeping the action within a decent view, maintaining good pacing, and also allowing for the actors to breathe out a scene when more emotion is involved. The fights themselves are brutal, and not held back in the least bit. You will feel every blow, you will chuckle at every clever maneuver and trick, and sometimes even jump in surprise as to what's happening. The movie is quite cold, as sometimes you'll forget that Bryan is the good guy, especially in moments where innocent people are within the crosshairs. Like Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy, it's at times difficult to root for Neeson when he involves people that well.aren't really involved. But that feeling is quickly vanquished when you see him waste the next sap that is part of the sex trafficking ring.Bottom Line: This movie proves multiple things: Neeson can be an action star at a relatively old age, Europe is suddenly a rising force in the action/thriller genre, and also that you don't need fancy CGI or special effects to craft a good movie that will also lead to good money. Taken quietly emerged as the top action film of 2009, and becomes another great film with Luc Besson's stamp on it (The Fifth Element, Unleashed, Transporter, Nikita, Leon). The movie has the trills and the tension, but also has the heart that is sorely missing in most mainstream action films. You will cheer this movie on as it delivers with a great storyline, great acting, and just an overall satisfying cinematic package.Did I already mention that Liam Neeson is 57 years old?",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"turn off your brain for the good ""good-God-do-they-expect-me-to-believe-that"" Besson production","On facebook there is an event coming up I believe in June which is called ""National Man Day"", which will be a day for all men everywhere to feel and act like ""Men"", whatever that is. If there are any screening rooms available for this kind of created event, Taken could be a good choice as a movie to screen. It's a preposterous action movie fantasy that has a good dosage of Jason Bourne and surprisingly, and not offensively, some conservative connotations in it. Yes, conservative: where else will we get a France-is-evil tome that also includes a sex-slave trade (which, apparently, is based on real things going on in Europe right now) complete with deflowered girls the highest marker- yes, American girls, go to France and you will be sold into the sex trade- for Albanians or whomever the immigrants are with the can-do American government bad-ass with one step removed from Jack Bauer and a penchant for torture when it suits best.Sound not like your cup of manly kill-kick-ass tea? Then look away and read no more. But if you're still with this, well, you know what you're in for, sort of. This is another vehicle by Luc Besson, as writer and producer, to use Paris as a backdrop for a crazy plot designed to give whoever star it is- usually Jason Statham- a run for his money for the good of the entire audience as super-violent escapist fare. The plot, with Liam Neeson's retired government agent who has a strength comparable to both Jason Bourne and Batman having to go to France after his daughter is kidnapped along with a friend, is of not much consequences as we've seen it in other molds and folds before, sometimes in sleazy packages or straight-to-video deals (one may wonder where Chuck Norris is when you need him).But the plot actually becomes a little more believable, or at least acceptable, because of or in support of the presence of Liam Neeson. He's such an underrated presence today in movies, popping up when a director has the right mind to use him (yes, he was even pretty good in Phantom Menace), and in this case director Morel and Besson have here an action hero who shows weariness and real conflict on his face. He's not the first person you'd think to play Brian, but he's the right person for what he can bring to the part. He's tough as nails but isn't chiseled or completely stone-cold like Daniel Craig. There's something else going on, like he's thinking and makes us think with him as he crashes through glass and kicks and punches and shoots and strangles and bamboozles dozens of gangsters and baddies. He helps make Taken something of a wonderful contradiction: believably unbelievable all the way through. You know this guy can do these things because, frankly, he just can.As my own mother, God bless her, said after seeing the movie: it gives a good enema to the brain.

"Over the top, but excellent...","While watching Taken I was reminded of several other ""Lost Child"" films and surprisingly the one which first came to mind was Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando. Specifically this movie is what that movie should have been like. Liam Neeson outshines Arnold with a witty and far more sympathetic and charismatic character portrayal.The film's plot is simple but has enough twists and texture to make it into a fulfilling experience. The film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but Neeson's charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segments.However, it's perhaps of the film's over-the-top nature why it will never reach the same classic and timeless status as Flightplan or Frantic. The film stands out well for its relative grittiness but also suffers slightly from it. The film is a pleasure to watch especially since it offers so many memorable moments and for once an appropriately up-lifting closure.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

I thought of mine the whole time I was watching this flick and I begrudgingly became extra aware of parents' POV when they have to let go of their kids. It really can be a bad, crazy world out there, and after watching Taken, you'd want to have a dad like Liam Neeson's character, Bryan Mills.Bryan retired from the CIA to get closer to his beloved daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who has just turned 17. Kim lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), and asks permission from him to go to Paris with a friend. He reluctantly allows her, and his worst fears come to life when she is kidnapped by an Armenian white slavery ring. Bryan is forced to use his special set of skills to get his daughter back, armed with only very few clues, in only a few hours he has before she disappears forever.Written by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Transporter series), Taken is the impressive Hollywood directorial debut of cinematographer Pierre Morel. He has loads of help from Neeson, though, who is super believable transitioning from ultra-doting dad to unstoppable force to reckon with. If you're ever in trouble, you'd want to have him on your side. When he says he's coming to get you, you know he will, especially when he quickly and efficiently handles anyone who gets in his way. I would definitely like to see him taking on more roles like this one. It was just as startling to see the beautiful Janssen in a subdued mother role, having been used to seeing her as the femme fatale or the superhero for the better part of her career. While definitely pretty, Grace was miscast as Kim. Not only is she a decade older than the character, she's already famous as whiny Shannon in Lost. While still whiny, her acting was too affected, perhaps trying to compensate for playing someone much younger.

Surprisingly simple and effective ...,"I'll be honest. I didn't quite put this movie on my ""must watch"" list until i was invited for free to watch it with a friend. And i have to admit, i'm honestly ""taken"" into this movie! First off, it's a movie that does not have a lot of special effects. So really, if you do catch it on DVD, it's not an entire loss also, so don't worry if you're missing out.The story is really simple. Father is a former government agent who retired, living away from his daughter and ex-wife. Daughter goes for a trip to Paris and gets kidnapped away in a mishap (that could have been very very easily avoided, but i won't spoil it for you), and reactivates himself to hunt down the people who did it and rescue his daughter in the process.Real simple story, so it's up to Liam Neeson to keep your attention span active and in tune with things ... and i have to admit, he does a great job. I recently played and completed FALLOUT 3, a video game that he does voice acting in - as your character's father, and really, he has the magic to play the role of a father ... assuring and for sure, able to bail you out of situations even if it means risking his life. You see that a lot in Taken ... from start to end.Action wise, i was told that Luc Besson is involved in this movie, yet i don't honestly feel his magical presence in this one compared to his other movies. But Liam does a nice job of being quick to attack and get the upper hand before you could even say ANYTHING. I'm convinced that he can go into the action genre from time to time ... he's got that magic!

"If you ignore the ""message"" and accept it as a derivative Bourne then it is actually a solid thriller","Having hardly seen his wife (now ex) and daughter for the last decade or so due to his work, Bryan is now a former special agent who has taken his retirement early in order to move close to where his estranged family now live. Despite his better judgement, he gives consent for his 17 year-old daughter to go to Paris with a friend. However all his ""paranoia"" is justified when his daughter calls him during an abduction by some unknown men. Using his contacts, Bryan learns of an Albanian group specialising in kidnapping travelling young women into sex slavery and estimates he has 96 hours maximum before she is drugged beyond redemption and sold into prostitution. Calling on a lifetime of skills, Bryan goes to Paris to track down those responsible and find his daughter.I have not heard or read any reviews for this film when I went to see it but I imagine that many of them will have called this film a cross between Death Wish and the Bourne films because that is what it happens to play like. The Death Wise side of it makes it a little harder to enjoy but the Bourne side makes it worth seeing. The thin plot is where we have the Death Wise material as the nice retired man who loves his daughter turns out to have been correct that the world is a hideous place outside of the US whenever his daughter gets kidnapped. With hours before she is transformed into a junkie and working for her hits, Joe goes to a Paris where it appears that the Louvre is the only building NOT fully of young women trafficked into sex (and we never seen that so I have no proof). Fortunately, rash violence will save the day. OK so politically this is not the most pleasant pieces of work to be watching but, aside from the first twenty minutes of setup (some of which I could have done without) the plot doesn't really matter and it becomes a race against time thriller.This is where it does owe a great debt to Bourne because the filming style, the action, the urgency and the fighting style are all very similar to the formulae used to good effect in that trilogy. The camera never sits still, the editing is fast and the sound-effects produce an audience reaction themselves. Of course it is very much derivative of Bourne and not up to that high standard but it does still make for an engagingly violent thriller. When it stops moving even for a second, it sags and it doesn't seem to know how to link the scenes (so many actions scenes fade to black and then into a slower scene setting up the next sequence) but mostly it keeps the pace high and keeps moving. This does not make it a great film though, and it is quite a cynical affair in some regards however it is hard to fault it when it delivers such solid thrills as its main function.Of some surprise to me was to see how effective Neeson was in the lead. Channelling some of his crazed performance from Darkman, he is a tremendous force ripping through criminals and surprisingly convincing in the action scenes with fluid and natural motions (helped by very good editing as well). The rest of the cast don't matter so much but Janssen, Berkeley and Vallance are all odd finds in smaller roles while Grace does her bit in regards being a thoughtless teenager and then ""in peril"". Morel's direction is effective even if it is easy to imagine that he has lots of Paul Greengrass films at home and had been studying them pretty closely.Taken is not a brilliant film but if you accept it for what it is then it is an effective thriller driven by brutal (but not gory) violence which is justified by the family heart of the plot, much like Death Wish did. It is best to ignore the ""message"" within all this and just leave your brain off to enjoy the action which, while not Bourne level, is still effective and enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Action
"You will be taken once the movie lands in Paris, and then it's breathlessly fast and violent.","Taken (2008)Once the real plot kicks in and Liam Neeson goes ballistic (in his very icy, obsessed way), the movie takes off, too. With good reason. He's out to get his cute, almost innocent teenage daughter out of truly horrific danger. We feel for him, and we don't mind a lot of collateral damage in his wake. A lot.Be prepared for lots of dead bodies, including men (all the deaths are men, now that I think about it) killed either gratuitously or with mindless vengeance. Neeson's character, ex-CIA man Bryan Mills, has the particular ""skills"" that give bad guys ""nightmares."" And he is skilled in a way even Matt Damon would love, just short of superhuman.

The minute Bryan Mills lands in Paris, he is incredibly resourceful and tireless, and the writing makes every encounter a match of wits and nerve, and the editing makes every car chase truly dizzying. We really root for this guy, and cringe at the ugly, really awful underworld he finds himself deep in. And Neeson is also terrific. Besides being believable as an angry father, he's believable even as he pulls off the unbelievable feats of a super spy, showing presence and that brooding, charming depth he is known for.The core of the movie--the Paris part--is less than an hour, in all, and the other plot, if you can call it that, is pretty lame. In fact, the opening scenes almost seem thrown together, either as an afterthought (to give the movie some heart) or as an edited down remnant, because it clunks along and has a whole series of logical gaffes, which aren't worth listing. Don't let this stop you. It's as if, when the girl and her friend arrive in the Parisian flat, director Pierre Morel suddenly shows up, too. Morel, in fact, is a cinematographer at heart, and that much is evident in the visual pizazz that keeps every scene popping. This is his second feature, and first in English, and we'll probably see more of his work, hopefully with a better writer in tow.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Purpose of the ""story"" is to give Liam Neeson a cause for action.","I was really disappointed by this movie because of its very poor and simple story. Its not thrilling at all. There is no time wasted introducing the characters. It feels like you have 5 minutes time to see the museum of modern arts.So this movie is basically a very brief introduction of dull characters with cheap / flat dialogs, then lots of action by Liam Neeson, followed by a brief and cheesy happy end.The good thing about this movie is the action part although its not particularly spectacular. But Liam Neeson manages it very tough.As the title of my review concludes.

Exciting and thrilling action drama!,"Liam Seesom stars as a a retired CIA agent who travels across Europe to find his kidnapped, estranged daughter. He has to rely on his skills and wit to rescue his daughter from the kidnappers, who are trafficking young girls for prostitution.This film gives the notion as to what highs and lows a father would go through in order to save the ones he love and it is intriguing to see all his methods and skills of survival he utilizes on his mission.Trying to find somebody in a foreign city of millions makes you feel the suspense and eerie of being in a foreign country, where you know almost no one and where you do not know your surroundings - everybody and everything is a stranger to you. This just makes this rescue mission even more thrilling.Overall, a very entertaining and non-stop action film that is a must-see.Grade A-",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam Neeson in action,"Liam Neeson, immortalized himself in his role as Oscar Schindler, here challenged himself with an action movie. The end effect is sparkling. Even when I was sitting during the film, I knew something big and exciting was happening, although it may not be a happy experience for ""Kim"" :).This movie has every elements that an action-thriller movie should have and must have. A lot of bullets, car chasing, hand fight, drug, a superman-like protagonist and a beauty kidnapped. Although I found the onset of the whole story a bit strange, the development of it appealed to me. Liam Neeson was perfectly fit in his role.

The king of Thrillers,"Liam Neeson stars in Taken, a film about an ex-spy divorcé who tries to make up for years of parental neglect to his daughter, Maggie Grace. The film follows Maggie's journey to Europe, specifically Paris, where she is kidnapped by Albanian gangsters who plan to sell her victims to Arabs for white-girlie sex. Maggie's father, a paranoid parent and towering xenophobe, is right that a young Caucasian girl is prey to every godless, sex-mad, drug-pushing foreigner. Even his French-spy buddy, Jean-Claude, is not reliable in helping her. Taken is a risible male-re-empowerment fantasy set in a world where a fatal headshot and rescue from a life of inter-racial rape is the best way to win back Maggie's heart. The film features a brutal and violent portrayal of a father who is determined to make amends for his past neglect. The film is a risible male-re-empowerment fantasy that should not be considered for viewers. Taken is a film directed by Liam Neeson, starring Liam Neeson as a divorced father and special-ops superhero who proves his love for his teenage daughter while also exposing her stepfather. The movie begins when the daughter is abducted by sex traffickers in Paris, leading Neeson to become angry and cosplay with Frenchmen, Albanians, and Arab sheiks. The film is slick, dubious, and morally bankrupt, with a scene where Neeson presides over a sex auction, saving the daughter as ""the best 'til last"" and sparking a bidding war among the pervert connoisseurs. ""Taken"" portrays Bryan Mills as a skilled CIA agent who would have been an American prisoner since September 2001. Mills is a master of various skills, including laser-eyed, sharpshooting, and karate-fighting. He lives in Los Angeles, enjoying steaks with old CIA friends and spending time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim. Kim lives with Mills' ex-wife and her wealthy husband, who gives Kim a thoroughbred as a birthday present. The film highlights the skill of CIA agents like Mills in capturing and capturing terrorists. ""Taken"" raises questions about the existence of secret clubs or covens of wealthy white men who despoil innocent women in perversity. The movie proves that Liam Neeson can bring credibility to most roles and that co-writer Luc Besson, whose actioner-assembly line produced the film, turns out high-quality trash, sometimes even better. The film demonstrates that if you can't wait for the next Bourne thriller, you don't have to.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Nothing more than a Director's highly overrated mess.,"Alright, I watched the movie about a few weeks ago and after seeing its ratings on IMDb I was expecting a really good action movie with good acting, a wholesome plot and obviously some amazing action. An 8.0 rating on IMDb means it's equal to movies like 'The Matrix' or 'Die Hard'.Admittedly I'm quite a big action fan, and I do understand the concept of it not being 'realistic'. That's what films are. They're stories. Name me one movie that is completely realistic with no fantasy elements included and I'll give you a million bucks.However when I saw this movie I was bored, embarrassed during some scenes at how atrocious it was, and I found it to be completely overrated. The action was slow, the cinematography was laughable, the acting from everyone except Neeson was very sub-par and I just felt disappointed. This isn't the action movie that would start a second renaissance, of course not. That's not what I was expecting. I didn't think it'd be anything more than a tour-de-force action film that was pure entertainment and silliness wrapped into a satisfying bubble. And honestly all I got was another second-rate action movie that's not even worth the time and effort to watch unless you're an extreme fan of the genre. I mean, during the scene where Neeson runs to the boat to get his daughter... the camera cuts so many times and there's about a million shots of his car in different angles that I completely forgot what was going on. That's just an example of the many things I thought brought the movie down.I really don't see how this film deserves the recognition it has received. I've read the forums and people say ""well it's an action flick... you're not supposed to take it seriously!"" To that I say, why isn't Meet the Spartans in the IMDb 250? ""Well, it's a parody flick, you're not supposed to take it seriously""? The same principal applies.I'm not trying to say the film isn't enjoyable because that's down to tastes. I'm just saying firstly; film technicalities (i.e. the direction, photography, musical score) were atrocious and anyone with a basic knowledge of film and its production will recognize this.Secondly; the acting of the support cast quite bad. Not Troll 2 bad, but still not something you'd expect to see in a Liam Neeson movie. More like something you'd see in one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies from the 80's.Thirdly; the directing was very amateurish. I felt this constant need to find Pierre Morel and hit him every time the scenes went on too long. He'd be extremely bruised right now.I really wonder how the screenplay went for this movie, too. I'm guessing the writers/artists got very proud of their ability to draw and started getting excited during the car scenes, resulting in about 200 frames of a car from as many different angles as possible. And the director just went ""Hey, why not? It's action, right?"".I haven't mention the plausibility of this movie, because anyone here could go to the LOTR forums and start asking how some old dude with a beard has magical powers, or why some big dude explodes when he loses his ring, and we'd all be stumped for argument other than to say the same lines I've seen being used here.But for god's sake this is a generic action movie, not an Oscar-deserving masterpiece. If someone can tell me how I'm wrong, why this movie DOES deserve its rating and explain to me what I missed, I will be very grateful.For anyone who thinks I'm talking nonsense - check out http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/taken/?critic=creamcrop and see how they rated this movie.

The OG John Wick,"Creating one of his most iconic roles, Liam Neeson jumps into the world of action films with Taken. While the subject matter is quite heavy, the story will constantly keep you on your toes, with twists and turns that keep your heart racing to the finale. Neeson's performance makes this an instant hit, as he pours his heart into the role of Bryan Mills and uses even the simplest facial expressions to showcase the pain and suffering his character feels. Every moment of his screen time is a wild ride and no second is wasted as he fills the film with fast paced action and powerful emotion. Although the story is superb, I feel that the payoff does not feel satisfying enough and left it feeling a bit hollow in its final moments. It's hard to dislike such a thrilling film and with a strong story to make the action, Taken is a surefire winner.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Your arrogance offends me.,"It is proof positive that you can still have a basic and formulaic genre piece and the multiplex crowd will forgive it the sins of film making. For here we have a revenge thriller that is over reliant on a ream of contrivances? The kind that people scoff at when horror pictures not wanting to be serious get screamed down for?. There is also some pretty poor acting performances on show, the usually reliable Famke Jansen looks lost when asked to show emotion, Maggie Grace needs to go back to acting school, whilst some of the French actors on show give French actors a bad name.However the true saving grace in the movie, outside of some serious revenge fuelled torture sequences, is Liam Neeson in the lead role of Bryan Mills. Charismatic and believable as a father hell bent on finding the one thing worthwhile that he has in his life, it's only here that Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen's uneven writing gets any sort of urgency to go with the tidily put together action sequences. Taken is an enjoyable film if taken within the context of its genre, and for sure the subject matter of skin trafficking is a noteworthy plot, but no one can surely deny it doesn't have a shallow core and honestly isn't giving anything new to a pretty stagnated formula...By the by, the thrills ensure popcorn pleasing pleasures and thus it's rated as such. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Best action tough guy movie in a long time.,"This movie.has a run time of 90 minutes. It seems like 1/2 that it moves so quickly. After the preliminary 15 minute set up, the pace is unreal. If this movie were a sandwich, somebody forgot the bread, because it's all meat.I wouldn't have guessed Liam Neeson being cast as the tough, butt-kicking hero, but he does a really great job.This movie is capable of making anyone afraid of world travel, particularly young women. (Add in real world viral fears, and it's a no brainer.)I won't go into story or plot; but the daughter is as naive as she is spoiled rotten; and Neeson's (now miserably remarried), X wife from Hades, does a great job drawing any viewers ire.I rate this 10 because of how the incredible the sequenced action scenes are put together.

Crass,"I have just watched this film on TV having made a point of missing it on the big screen - the awful trailer put me off! It is one of the worst, pretentious pieces of cinematic clap trap I have ever watched. Surely it is not trying to be a serious thriller. The plot line is clichéd, and predictable. The car chases likewise, the dialogue excruciating. It was like a third rate James Bond film without the humour. What ever was a well respected actor (Neilson) doing getting involved in this crass feature. Does he really need the money? It was as bad as the old Rambo films from Stallone, but at least we got what we expected from them. It seems that the film going public will watch anything today.

Good Action Flick,"Just got back from the theater (caught a $5 10:00 am cheapie @ AMC) and thought this was a good movie, with a good plot and action sequences, albeit typical shoot 'em up how the hell did Liam Neeson not just get killed fashion.Liam Neeson is a retired CIA spook whose daughter lives with his ex-wife and her current husband, who apparently is very very rich. The movie begins with Liam attending his daughter's birthday party at her home, which looks a lot like the Villa Borghese. The daughter goes to Paris with a friend and is kidnapped by some Albanian mafia types, to be sold into a prostitution ring. The rest of the movie is Liam opening up several jars of whoopass on the bad guys. It was lucky for Liam that the Albanians were terrible shots. They couldn't hit water if they fell off a boat.I had fun and so will anyone who enjoys these types of action movies.

"Liam Neeson's defining role, in a tense and exciting action thriller.","Having left his position as a U. S. counterintelligence agent, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) now lives in L. A. doing low level protection work in the hopes of maintaining a relationship with his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who he was often away from during her childhood due to the nature of his work. When Kim wants to visit Europe with a friend, Bryan is reluctant but eventually relents after some works with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). Upon arrival in France Kim and her friend share a cab with a handsome stranger, Peter (Nicolas Giraud) un aware he's a spotter for human traffickers. When the traffickers storm the apartment, Kim is able to get a call out to her father Bryan and give her what information she can in the short time before she's taken. Now Bryan must traverse the Parisian criminal underworld using his ""particular set of skills"" to rescue his daughter and take down any who try to stop him.Released in 2008, Taken, from Luc Besson's Europacorp was one of the bigger ""sleeper hits"" to emerge, even though it wasn't until a year after its release. Made by Pierre Morel a cinematographer turned director who'd worked with a number of French directors, including Besson, Besson pitched the premise of a father trying to rescue his kidnapped daughter and Morel became immediately enamored with the concept. Jeff Bridges was originally cast as Mills before dropping out and being replaced with Liam Neeson who took the role looking for something more physically demanding. Neeson had no idea how big the film would become, even expecting the film to be released direct-to-video in the United States. The film was distributed by 20th Fox on the typically sleepy Super Bowl January weekend and gave the weekend it's second biggest opening behind Hannah Montana, and reintroduced the public to Liam Neeson as a credible action hero, inspired other mid budget action vehicles with 50+ year old leads, and inspired an extended franchise based on Taken. While Taken traverse well-trodden ground, its tight minimalist direction and a strong performance from Neeson elevates the material.Make no mistake this is Neeson's movie, Bridges dropping out early on probably did this film a favor because while bridges is a good actor, the role of Bryan Mills calls for a level of intensity and tenacity that would be challenging for Bridges. Neeson's iconic ""unique set of skills speech"" was what 20th Century Fox built the marketing around, and rightly so because not only does it sell the premise of the movie in such a short amount of time, it shows Neeson's intensity and why he's so credible in the lead role. Through Neeson's performance you feel the anger and the desperation, but you also feel the intelligence and calculation as well. There's also some good establishing work in the opening act showing Bryan's estrangement from his family and desire to reconnect with them.The plot is about as simple as you can get with a movie like this and can be narrowed down a sentence ""a man's daughter is kidnapped, he sets out to find her using any means necessary"" and that's where Taken's strength comes from, its simplicity. Taken came at a transitionally time where we were moving past the elaborate ""wire fu"" from The Matrix that multiple films tried to copy (Charlie's Angels, Bulletproof Monk, etc.) and moving into the Noisy, bloated, kinetic stylings popularized by the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay. With Taken the stakes were smaller scale and more economically delivered which lent a sense of gravity and weight that was rather lacking from other action thrillers. The movie isn't air tight as there are some noticeable ""jumps"" the movie takes simply because it has to (such as Neeson being able to pass himself off as a French intelligent agent, or using a consumer grade digital photo kiosk to enhance a picture a la CSI) but the movie's quick pace and high tension make it easy to forgive.Taken is a simple concept given the full works. Pierre Morel's direction is intense making the action tangible and impactful, and the film is anchored by a strong central performance from Liam Neeson. The film is quotable, memorable, and enjoyable, and it's influence can still be felt all these years later.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"Taken with ""Taken""","After meeting a cute guy in the airport, a teenage girl proclaims, ""I'm going to sleep with him"" to her best friend. It's in these opening moments that ""Taken"" is very unnerving, showing naïve teenagers ready to cut loose from mom and dad only to discover that there is a darker side to the beauty of the international world. Yet this movie is an actioner from France filmmaker Luc Besson, known more for escapist entertainment like ""The Transporter"" and ""The Professional"", so its safe to say the seriousness of it starts and ends with that. This movie comes from a very real place, but its pure popcorn. The screenplay is by Besson and writing partner Robert Mark Kamen and cinematographer Pierre Morel makes his English-language debut behind the camera, and despite some things that go over the line, it gets the job done.Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, who we can assume did some pretty shady, black-op type things for the government. Now divorced and retired, he finds himself competing for the attention of his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with her new richer father (Xander Berkeley), while being constantly at odds with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). Against his better judgment he allows Kim to go on a vacation with a friend to Paris and as if he predicted it, he receives a call from Kim right as kidnappers are taking her friend and coming after her. From piecing together the background noise he overhears, he places them as an Albanian group with their hand in drugs and the sex trade. It's up to him to fly to Paris and put his ""particular set of skills"" to good use in order to save his daughter.What follows is really a string of martial arts, gun battles, explosions, and car chases. The movie goes by in a brisk hour and 25 minutes and for the most part it's a well-made thriller with a good central performance from Liam Neeson. It's his show for most of the movie. Besson isn't interested in the heartbreak of the parents back home or what horrible things the girls being preyed on are suffering. Even the villains remain off-screen and one-dimensional for most of the time, unless Neeson is beating the bloody crap out of them. What Besson (and I'm sure the people looking to see this movie) is interested in is an intimidating badass who knows how to kick-ass and take names without mercy and Neeson covers that and more. He also shows the sadness and finds the humanity in a man desperately trying to find his daughter.What bothered me about this movie though is the torture angle. I know the last thing your supposed to do is look for morality in what's basically a revenge fantasy but there are times when you just feel like Mills goes too far. Electrocuting a man for the schere joy of watching him suffer or shooting an innocent woman in the arm so as to get information from someone else isn't entertaining or the stuff that makes him particularly rootable. ""Taken"" works in the same vain as ""Out for Justice"" and is, for the most part, a fairly thrilling revenge flick, just sometimes it gets too carried away and crosses a line that you wish it knew not the cross.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam - you must REALLY have needed the money!,"Each time you see a lousy film, you think nothing could possibly be worse until along comes something that blows the previous one out of the water for sheer awfulness. This is true of 'Taken'. Up to pres, it is the worst pile of junk I've had the misfortune to sit through in quite some time. Quite simply I am outraged that this should score so highly on IMDb and that I should have been taken in by it! Liam Neeeson goes through this looking like some badly made -up corpse, gaunt old features emphasized by an appalling hair-dye job, calculated to make him look younger and perversely emphasizing his age. Lousy script, lousy acting -the worst of which being the daughter who behaves like a demented 6 year old rather than a 17 year old asking to tour Europe. Why would anyone allow an obviously backward/retarded girl to do this? This film absolutely STINKS - it is utter RUBBISH!!!!!! Dozens of gangsters firing automatic weapons at one man and all missing the target etc.. the usual clichés, in fact its so bad its like a parody. Only watch this if you are a particularly unsophisticated/immature 15 year old boy because that's the only type of person who could possibly enjoy this garbage. Everyone has to pay their bills and Liam Neeson must have seen this as a way to pay his, because my God- he can't seriously have thought 'I've just GOT to play this role!' when the script landed on his mat!

"Fantastic Neeson, great 90 minutes!","Matt Damon in the Bourne saga wants to be Liam Neeson when he grows up. This is how it's done. Liam Neeson builds a coherent and human character very close to those we've seen in the Bourne saga or series like ""24"" or ""Burn Notice"" Not only his portrait of a paranoic ex spy is believable but his skills look real. It's like he had them in him for years, which is something i really appreciate being a fan of realistic martial arts. I must add here that Matt Damon did a great job there in his Bourne movies (yes, and i loved Brad Pitt and Eric Bana at Troy). I really thank them for that effort and i pay gladly for the dvds of their movies because of that.Said that, the movie succeeds in creating a flow of emotion in the audience (me). Sympathy and a bit of shame about a father who can't clearly keep the love of his daughter or his ex-wife (fantastic and beautiful Famke Jansen, she looks so beautiful when she's upset). Lucyly for him, the situation will be that he will be able to use his only good skills to regain the love of his family. Drame ensues, rage and fear, and in the end an exhilarating sense of happiness and ""justice has been done"" feeling.

Firstly the movie is way over hyped, the billboards comparing it to bourne series, but in reality it doesn't even touch the class of bourne.The theme sadly brings no surprises (similar to punisher/commando etc.) with a well trained x-military man trying to rescue his daughter being kidnapped. The main character Liam Nesson doesn't look very convincing as a slick killer with wrinkly face and dimensions of a man more fit to be working in a garden with his grandchildren rather than taking on trained militants.What i did like about the movie was its fast pace and good direction which makes up for a feeble script and cast. The movie has been intelligently grilled with no fancy stunts or hard to believe action sequences but with smart moves. Worth a one time watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
96 hours,"A father's worst nightmare is what Bryan Mills, a former CIA agent, has to endure when his daughter, whom he reluctantly let go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, is kidnapped right after she arrives in the city. The purpose of her being taken away is not for ransom money, it is because this girl is a young morsel for the degenerate crowd that deal in turning these naive women into prostitution and drugs for a profit.""Taken"", directed by Pierre Morel, is a thriller that comes from Luc Besson and his factory that churns this type of entertainment for fans of this genre. It is better to leave one's mind at the entrance of the cinema, or in another room if it is viewed on DVD, or another type of format, because most of the action is incredible, at best. We don't mean to say the film is unwatchable, for it is the kind of action film that keeps audiences riveted to the screen. But alas, when not even the first 30 minutes of screen time have elapsed, Bryan Mills has disposed of a dozen men, and he will get rid of many more scum bags before the flick is over! Why did the CIA did not insist in keeping Mills in its payroll is hard to imagine; he is a one man invincible team. In many aspects ""Taken"" is a comic book fantasy.Liam Neeson, much leaner than he used to be, appears as the hero of the story. This man is so resourceful that he knows from early on because of his contacts who is behind the group that took his daughter away. He is an action man when threatened, in this case because the love for his only daughter. Mr. Neeson is the whole picture and he does not disappoint. Others in the cast include the wonderful Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and other less unknown faces.The editing by Frederic Thoraval needs to be mentioned because the way the action is arranged to create the immediacy and fast pacing that are necessary for a film of this genre. The cinematographer, Michel Abramowicz, does a good job capturing Paris, especially at night. Pierre Morel, whose second venture in directing this is, will go far if he chooses wisely for he can deliver a thriller like ""Taken"" almost effortlessly.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Life of Bryan - Neeson as Eastwood in Luc Besson tale of Albanian Human Trafficking,"Luc Besson, magnifique, what can I say, hein? He wrote Fifth Element with Bruce Willis set in the far future and then he also did The Messenger with Mila Jovovich set in the past looking at Joan Of Arc; this time Luc handles Human Trafficking and removing certain stereotypes some may have of Liam Neeson, of ""Love Actually"" and the first ""Darkman"" film.Neeson is Bryan, a former CIA operative who so loved his daughter he went AWOL for her b'day showed his devotion to her despite being punished with an Antarctic assignment.He chooses retirement in order to be near Kim, his daughter for her b'day despite her Mother resisting Bryan's attention. This aloofness no doubt is to prove her devotion for the new rich husband in her gold-digging life played to scintillation by ex-""X-Men"" Famke Jenssen.When Kim wished to go to Paris, Bryan's old war-horse alarms tingled and he ignored them at the pressure of his former spouse to show his daughter he was not uptight, big mistake! Luckily, Bryan made sure Kim carried a roaming mobile which was essential when she got abducted by Albanian smugglers - all he had was the MP3 of their voices and he kept replaying to learn their voices and other clues.Neeson's calmness yet underscored with a leonine ferocity far blew away any previous notions of his playing a college professor type! The technology used in the film to track down the abductors was amazing, a perfect counterpoint to the ""Interrogation Methods"" used by Bryan on Marko, the Albanian ringleader in human trafficking...Two knitting needles, jumper cables and house current - oh yes! A gag too, brrrr! This is definitely a story to make you think twice about letting your kids go gallivanting off by themselves since much of this new/old crime - also called ""White Slavery"" has been happening for decades! Make sure teens do not blather all their travel details to complete strangers, OK?",9.0,Anonymous,Action
I love it. Is everything you could want from an action movie,"I watch it 3 times in the past few years, and still enjoy it.Don't want to spoil anything so I will keep this simple.I can't complaint on anything, and that is something very good to say about a movie.The story is very original. The main character is like James bond, but at the same time ""the guy next door"". Let's say a retired James bond. But unlike James bond movies, Taken is more realistic. Is like all could happen in real life. Maybe a few exceptions, but not a deal breaker.Even with a good story, the action also by itself is enough to enjoy it. That is why I can watch it many times and still enjoy it, like I watch Die Hard.You should watch it if you like action movies like Die Hard. My sister don't even like die hard and she like Taken. Maybe because Taken is even better than die hard? More updated? Who knows. But my point is that you might like Taken even if you don't like die hard.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Neeson is a Bad-A!!,"An absolutely brilliant film! A really enjoyable film, one of my favourites! Made me see Oskar Schindler in a different light! For those that enjoyed this: Taken 2 is a good sequel, but not as good as this one (as many sequels aren't). Neeson has also released other action films and more of him being a BadALiam Neeson is obviously the main star in this film, and this has been the stepping stone for him to being cast in other action films. His performance in Batman Begins in 2005 was good, and I was disappointed that it didn't shoot off his action-film career, but I am glad this has! Can't wait to see his film coming out in February (Non-stop) nor see what humor role he has in Anchorman 2 (has anyone else seen that Ricky Gervais video??)Couldn't ask for a more action-packed-thrill-ride-more-bada film.

Taken for a Long Painful Ride,"I actually signed up to IMDb after seeing this brutal film. I turned to my companion at the end of this movie and said ""Anyone associated with this movie should be removed from Hollywood immediately"".Rather than following the advice of the movie review in The New Yorker I decided to favor the opinions of IMDb and boy was I wrong. The story is so contrived, the acting so weak and the violence senseless that I would have figured that at least the majority of reviews would have reflected these sentiments.Further to the violence, Liam Neeson's character was shockingly evil killing without remorse. It was so violent that people actually let out sounds of shock during one killing. What a waste of time and money.",,Anonymous,Action
In response to a review receiving one star,"This is addressed to the man who commented on Taken - giving it one star and basically insulting everyone who got something out of the movie. I understand there are times when the question - what has American come to should be asked. However, I do not think that it qualifies in this case. The question SHOULD be however, what has this world come to that stuff such as what was portrayed in this movie exists in real life. Now that is a valid question. Granted, this movie had some holes. It was not a documentary and therefore cannot be held to the same standards however ask yourself one thing: Did it cause you to be aware or meditate in any way, shape or form about what happens in trafficking? If so, then the move did it's job. It may not have been an academy award winning movie but it brought an awareness and may have caused many to reflect about what happens not only in our own backyard but if you chose to travel outside of the US. So sir, with all due respect, I don't think those that enjoyed the movie are the ones you should be examining - but rather yourself because heightened awareness should be the most important on affairs of social awareness - not whether or not Neeson can deliver a good kick to the head.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Highly enjoyable and exciting,"I'm going to keep it short - some people find a lot of stupid details in this film and they nag about the loose morals of Neesons character. But so what.The movie is really, really exciting - it is one of the only films in a long time to give me a true sensation of excitement. I felt like the little boy and the secret spy within me just woke up. I just wanted to see more, know more and experience more. I think the only fault in the movie is that it's only 93 minutes long; I could have watched this all night long!One thing about the action in this film - you can REALLY feel the action. A lot of movies have tons of action but they use it to the point of fatigue. Not this movie! The violence feels real and the story will suck you in.Neeson is great - I love his charisma and voice. The story is good and the action is nicely directed. So forget too much criticism and just enjoy this thriller! It's definitely worth the money.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Great Action Flick,"""Taken"" is a typical action movie, but it is pretty entertaining. I wouldn't call this movie amazing or anything like that. However, it puts you on the edge of your seat. It's full of action, mainly Liam Neeson beating the crap out of people in various ways, and with a good right to do so. The plot is a little hokey, as I highly doubt the likeliness of certain situations present in the movie. It is a movie though, and we know it is not real. So, it has great entertainment value, a typical style action plot, and not too much character development. Is it the best action flick? No, but it is pretty good and has some nice beat downs. Not bad at all and worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Renewed my faith in the action genre,"Only a week ago I complained they don't make good movies anymore. ""Ip-Man"" finally gave me a worthwhile experience a couple of days ago, but ""Taken"" today re-news my faith in action movies again.Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Karem haven't done it better together since they wrote ""The Fifth Element"" 12 years ago. Director Pierre Morel are new to me, but his debut as director was in another Luc Besson written ""Banlieue 13"" and he has been involved as cinematographer in both ""The Transporter"" and ""Danny The Dog"", which both are written by the Besson/Karem duo. To be honest Luc Besson haven't been convincing to me in much he has done since his work in back in those days with ""Leon"" and ""The Fifth Element"", but he is back now. No doubt about it.""Taken"" is very much mold in the same ways as the Bourne trilogy. The camera angles and the fighting style very much follows the way the Bourne movies was done, but here the main character are driven by his goal rather than spending half the time wondering who's the bad guys. It makes for better action rather than the spy vs spy ways of Bourne, and Liam Neeson does a performance Bruce Willis' John McClane from the early Die Hard movies would be proud of.He is the been-there-seen-it-all former CIA-agent retired to spend more time close to his 17 year old daughter he's been seeing to little of because of his work. His daughter now lives with the ex-wife and a stepfather, and Neeson does an excellent job giving life to the father on the sideline in the early stages of the movie. A very common and realistic family way in these days, and as the main plot of the movie revolves around girl trafficking it stays with another relevant problem of the darker side of life too many girls are victimized by still.It do take some time until the action unfolds, but the time is well spent giving the audience an insight into the relationship between the family and into the main characters background. And when it takes off, the movie doesn't slow down until the end credits.I might have given my rating on the upper side of what it deserves, but as an action movie I think it really deserve it. If you watch it as the action entertaining it is, it delivers in more ways than I've seen in a long long time. Maybe even not since Die Hard, and that's about 21 years ago.....Highly recommended 93 minutes.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
fast-moving action thriller keeps surprising,"Good movie in many respects - twists and turns and fast-paced drivenness keep you on the edge of your seat. Neeson was great as usual. The actress cast as his daughter was too flighty and silly for my taste - I wouldn't let a hyperactive, over-emotional screaming-prone teen go to Europe, either. She acted like a tiny child without a thought. Anyway, I like how the film opened up with Neeson protesting the trip and also liked many of the mysteries along the way and his awkward but caring relationship with his silly daughter.Don't think they should have included Neeson shooting the French police exec's wife's arm though - seemed incongruent with the character's moral bent and history with her. Point about sacrificing a family member is not well-made with faint apology afterward.How is it that Neeson is instigating showers of gunshots and never takes a hit until right before finding his daughter? we don't even see him put on a bulletproof vest or see any reason to believe this at all. And what happened to the girl he rescued in order to sober her up and ask about his daughter? I'd like to see that thread sewn up, as long as we're dealing with as heavy a subject as sex trade - as long as we're taking on the social blight, why not some resolution to the system, somehow? At least a suggestion that there's a care beyond family. A few regrettable points where the script missed and perhaps overly choppy camera-work - do we have to become dizzy to get his frantic emotions? it's too forced. The ending is clapped on cliché - why not show the difficulties they would obviously have leaving the country in the wake of the father's blood-bath? And some deeper, wizened daughter. How is is that through all this, she doesn't even change? Yeah right. More character development is a must. Overall a fine story and nicely made film with important subject matter and potential for more thought.Where have we seen this script before? Perhaps reworked in many scripts, but especially from 'Target' from the 80s starring Matt Dillon as the rebellious teen and Gene Hackman as the former FBI father who surprises his son with his know-how, savvy and worldly connections when the mother/wife is kidnapped? All teens need their parents to be a brave role-model, so this kind of film fulfills those fantasies. Plus a nod to social commentary on sex trade without sugar-coating makes this worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Neeson teaches a lesson to Bond.,"Is it really that fast? Oh yes. At an astonishing level, 'Taken' achieves to manage a very quick rhythm with no dead-moments. Liam Neeson is perfect to the job, and gives this year's James Bond a knockout.Pierre Morel's directing exploits the simplicity of the plot and creates a paced level to the movie's environment. The movie is always focused on the film's quick ambient and action, rejecting the few calm moments existing.Liam Neeson is THE man. The action starts when Bryan's daughter is kidnapped, and then what we have is a roller coasting ride. Liam Neeson accomplishes what's expected of him and just kicks-ass, by dismantling all the human-trafficking organization in France in only a few days (or for us 93 minutes, which gives an even faster sensation).If you are in for adrenaline, then this is the right movie for you. If you want to see Liam Neeson in a bad-ass character, then this is also a movie for you.'Taken' is one of the best action movies 2008 has to offer and probably one of the best of the genre in years.

"Fun Action, Great Neeson","Taken (2008)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A former CIA agent (Liam Neeson) has his world turned upside down after his daughter goes to Paris for a vacation and gets kidnapped. He's an expert of this type of thing and it's going to take all his skills to locate her with the short amount of time he has. If you wanted to pick this film apart you really could because it's certainly far fetched and everything Neeson can do here isn't really believable and what he's able to do isn't really believable. With that said, who in the hell cares? Even though the story isn't that believable there's no denying this is a first rate thriller that will have you biting your nails from the moment the daughter gets taken all the way till the end. This movie has a simple story but Neeson takes it to a whole new level and really makes this film seem plausible. I mentioned it wasn't believable but this never comes through while you're watching the film because Neeson is so wonderful in the film you're willing to go along with him on this journey no matter where it takes you. The movie is extremely fast paced, well made and delivers on all levels. The action is first rate, the suspense is top-notch and Neeson performance is downright wonderful. I can't think of an actor who would have been better in the role. This is an action movie but with someone like Neeson it just brings the film up several notches. Again, you could pick apart how his character goes about doing things but just sit back and enjoy the ride. The film is very stylish in terms of the cinematography and it also features a very good music score to pump up all the action. In a lot of ways the film reminded me of another underrated gem and that's BREAKDOWN, the 1997 thriller with Kurt Russell playing a man looking for his wife who seems to have vanished out of nowhere. The two films deal with a simple kidnapping but both have a great actor to pull everything together so if you did enjoy this film you're highly recommended in checking out the other.",,Anonymous,Action

Highly Unlikely Thriller,"My theory is that most thrillers, perhaps only the best thrillers have any chance of being remotely plausible or realistic. If a thriller were actually plausible, some real-life bad guy would have already figured out the would-be plot device. At that point it could not be a thriller simply because it would already have become national news.Taken is not a great thriller. It looks pretty good, and Liam Neeson does his best at knocking guys out, but underneath it all it is a silly movie. The film is slightly more serious about itself when compared to the Die Hard movies, but other than that, they seem a lot alike.Thrillers do not have to be endless machine guns bursts, car wrecks, and fiery explosions, they really don't. One of my favorites is The French Connection. But don't get me wrong; Taken has its place. I mean, the idea is to give some thrills and raise the pulse. Taken does that.

Liam Neeson is one bad motha...shut yo mouth!,"Okay, I put a 10 out of 10 as my rating, more like a 9.5 out of 10, but whatever. I've watched many, many action movies and usually when I find one rated PG-13, I'm always wishing it was R because of the material that's left out. Most of the time it feels PG-13 and you can't believe anything's real in a feeling like that. But this movie really pushed the boundaries of a PG-13 rating with the violence and let me tell you, I'm glad it did! I know violence doesn't make a movie better, but in this case, it really adds to the intensity of Liam Neeson's character, which is Dirty Harry mixed with John McClain and a little dash of Jason Statham in Transporter mode. It's a very taut thriller with an interesting setting and story line, filled with outlandish (yet effective and very cool) fight/shootout sequences that only Luc Besson of The Professional fame could bring to the screen.

Excellent action thriller,"A film that solidified Liam Neeson's action star credentials and launched him into superstardom. Taken hearkens back to the good old days of action movies when action stars were unbeatable badasses, the plots were comfortingly black-n-white yet still gritty and the violence had purpose, style and weight behind it.Taken's pace is at the same time a source of much criticism as well as one of its greatest strengths. The fact is that the story does contain a lot of happy coincidences that in the hands of a lesser director would have made the film superficial and unbelievable. But because the pacing is so tight and because the film can flow from one breathtaking action scene to other without a pause, you can ignore these serendipities.And what action scenes those are. They would be interesting being performed by pretty much anybody, but they're given an extra boost by Neeson, who can expertly sell both the anguished father and the retired badass aspects of his character. His background in drama helps him to alleviate this above a mere shoot-em-up.Taken is one of the best action movies of the 00s and an excellent movie to pick up if you're looking for intense action, deeper characters and all around entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"Action Porn with Liam Neeson, Step up from Chuck Norris","The first half hour of this film is the set up. It's difficult which person is more detestable - Neeson's ex-wife for playing the part of the narcissistic, condescending b-word or the daughter for being the self-obsessed, over the top, annoying spoiled teenage brat. You hope either or both get offed and quickly. But it doesn't turn out that way because Neeson cares about both of them, including holding the candle for the ex for reasons that aren't clear.What follows is some action porn as the daughter gets taken and it's time for Neeson to spring to action with his ""special set of skills."" He does a very good job of playing the action hero with superior skills and also capable of making the bad guys miss every time, including with their automatic weapons. As poor as this film should be, Neeson somehow carries it the rest of the way which is about 50 minutes of sheer action and pretty fast paced fun.Some didn't like the political ploy of using the bad morals of the middle east to portray. Bear it or go to one of those countries and you'll begin to accept the sad reality that things like this aren't really that far fetched as crazy as that may seem and might be a little over the top.Overall this gets all the stars for fun action. The dialogue during the set up is laughable and painful. But the last 50 minutes make it fun. Don't worry if you make dinner during the first thirty and then enjoy the best part.

Neeson finds Kim's friend Amanda (don't want to spoil it and say where and how she was when he found her), then obviously goes on to find his own daughter.

In every scene (except the ones where she's drugged)she's jumping around like a total moron, to display a 17-year-old-girl type of behavior, I guess. In my opinion, she fails miserably. Totally unconvincing. Liam was good, as always. Though his lines were probably the most clichéd thing about this whole movie.

Liam Neeson sells this pedestrian but entertaining action thriller,"TAKEN is a simple action movie about a family man with ""a particular set of skills"" who takes down a sex trafficking ring in order to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped while on holiday in Paris. While this could have gone straight to the bargain bin, what really sells this movie is Liam Neeson, who brings a everyman quality to his role as Bryan Mills. The production values by Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel are also worth noting, with just enough emotional content to make the story relatable and a kinetic style that keeps things moving along at a good pace. Generally speaking everyone gives a decent performance, but I thought that Maggie Grace was miscast as she doesn't look the part of a 17-year-old girl, and her acting is questionable at best. Story-wise, I did appreciate that the movie took time to establish characters and relationships before heading off into more standard action thriller territory but, that being said, it only taps into the basest of human emotions and tendencies. Only someone devoid of empathy wouldn't understand the sticky situation that the characters are put into. Still, despite the rote nature of the setup it works, and the latter two-thirds of the movie rarely let up. As far as the action is concerned, it is well-shot for the most part. Pierre Morel shoots the close quarters combat up close, but the editing isn't so bad that you can't tell who's fighting who, and the geography and shot compositions are decent. If there's one complaint I have in this area is a nighttime car chase which was perhaps a bit too chaotically shot/edited. Overall, this is a decent time-passer that has enough story and thrills to keep you interested, and the running time is only about 90 minutes so it never overstays it's welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Very fast paced,"Actually I never expected Liam Neeson to play the role of Rambo. But boy, he is made for this stuff. Despite a clumsy start, this flick turned into ""James-Bond"" from ""Father of the Bride"" within 15 minutes. After that I lost track of time. Action was just too immersive.But director could have made it a bit more realistic. Instead of making ""Liam Neeson"" character a gung-ho-I-will-kick-your-balls-super-spy, some realism might have relieved mature moviegoers (but that's just me).This movie also touches a very sensitive issue of sex-slave trade and a corrupt system which is facilitating all this. But since girl's dad was a bad ass super-spy this issue was more or less sidelined, which leaves some gaping holes in the story.But this movie is too good action flick to be missed.

They take his daughter. He starts taking lives.,"""Taken"" revolves around a retired spy whose daughter is kidnapped by a human trafficking ring in Paris. Naturally, he hops the first plane to Paris in order to dole out some serious ass-kicking.The plot may be pretty contrived but that sort of deficiency probably won't make much difference to the kind of viewer that this film is aimed at. As a revenge flick promising an abundance of action the film delivers on that promise, though seasoned viewers have probably seen this sort of thing countless times already.Liam Neeson is pretty good here and handles the role better than I would have expected. There's not really anything awards-worthy in his performance but that's mainly due to being limited by the material. Other than Neeson, only Famke Janssen really stands out.Pierre Morel's direction is in the current action flick mold and is solid as far as that goes. Gratuitous cutting doesn't detract from the flick, except in the case of one chase scene. The score is decent enough but unremarkable.When it comes down to it, ""Taken"" is the sort of action movie that does its job well but takes no chances. The film's high rating (7.9 at the time of this writing) suggests that there might be more to it but that isn't the case as far as I'm concerned. Nevertheless, I'm sure that action fans will eat it up.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Pierre Morel avoids the 'sophmore slump' after the highly enjoyable District B13,"Ex-CIA operative, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) lets his 17 year old virgin daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace of ""Lost"" fame) travel to Paris with her friend not knowing it's to follow the band, U2, when he gives his reluctant permission. It seems that daddy does indeed know best, as the girls are not in the City of Lights too long before they're abruptly abducted for nefarious purposes. Bryan is on the phone with Kim at the time and upon hearing what's happening, uses his CIA training and prepares to go all Jack Bauer on their collective asses.The middle to late 2000's have been great for Liam Neeson with fantastic roles in Batman Begins, Seraphim Falls, and a memorable videogamed role in the superb Fable 3. This film does nothing to change the mojo he currently possesses despite a slow start and a few action film clichés. Neeson is damn good in his role here and is quite the bad ass (a lot of people were surprised, I'm not one of those because I witnessed it in Seraphim Falls as well) and he carries the movie himself, as Maggie Grace just blew her role (I can't even begin to tell you how). Famke Janssen doesn't fare much better as Bryan's ex-wife, yet both these parts were relatively small enough to casually dismiss. This is Liam's movie through and through.My Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Surprisingly great action movie.,"I love to be surprised like this... definitively a revelation. Real actors make the difference in any movie, like Liam Neeson in Taken. He's really convincing... and once an actor is making me believe, the job is done. Great movie, a must see in these days of teen ""stars"" and CGI. Superb acting by Liam Neeson... scene after scene, simply an acting lesson after another. Don't mind at all any ""unrealistic"" shot... like I said, he's making me believe it all, the job's done for me. This movie reminds me of Ronin... fast, good action, and great acting.

Action-Packed Tense Thrill Ride,"One of Liam Neeson's best performances. Taken was the movie that helped me discover that Liam Neeson is one of my all time favourite actors. It was brutal and gripping, with great cast. A 90 minute thrill ride for me, intense and action-packed. If you didn't think that Liam Neeson could be an action star, you were wrong. After Schindler's List, Neeson's performance in Taken is the most memorable of all his performances. I've happy that they're making a 3rd Taken film. The first 2 were great, especially this one. Taken is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of the action.I was surprised that Taken was an 18 certificate in the UK when I've watched films like Kick-Ass 2 and Prisoners which are rated 15 but have much more graphic violence in.No complaints for Taken, a definite must-see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Surprisingly good.,"I went into this film with low expectations after reading the review from Empire. It received a 1 star for all the wrong reasons. In a nutshell it basically said that this film was nothing more than a bloodfest, which believe me is quite far from the point of this movie. The acting is fairly well done (spy turned caring father is quite a hard role to fill). The camera, sound and lighting are also well done. Now, despite what I've said, of course there are flaws, for example, I think that the action/storyline ratio was waving more in the favour of action, the action was good, but if you were to add more story it would make the film drag on quite a lot. Both story and action was good, but i think Morel may have focused more on the action rather than story. All in all, it was a rather good film, underrated somewhat so don't listen to anyone bashing this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
surprisingly good movie,"IMDb is really good in telling a movie is crap, most comments on various movies will prove that. Now we come to this movie, Taken, for me, it's one of the best movies i've seen last year! I'ts got a good solid story, good cast and lot's of nicely captured action. Liam Neeson is not your average action hero but he does a great job being one.Story in short; A girl goes to France and get's ""taken"" from her apartment while making a call with her dad who used to be a retired secret agent. He doesn't waste any time and goes after her in France.The movie has no surprising plot turns and just goes on and on, which in this case is a good thing. Some scenes may be found shocking cos of violence and drug use/abuse. Personally i think a good balance has been found here and would like to rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"good story of family, change and action in Paris","I watched Taken on a library DVD after watching Taken2 earlier. Taken sets more of the scene of the retired CIA agent trying to stay near his 17-yr old daughter while being the ex-husband and much poorer than the step-father. He has his daughter's best interests at heart. As other reviewers have noted, watch the story unfold and don't think about the props and action scenes. Iaam is great and always finds the weapons, technology, and people just in time. The location and action scenes are lovely as well as dark. His buddies are helpful and funny. The rescue scenes are physically brutal as well as the shooting particularly in the French agent's house.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Why Neeson accepted to do this trash?,"It's really sad that such a good actor like Liam Neeson is in this mess (for lack of a worse word). This is a typical (awfull) movie that Steven Seagal has been doing for the last 1o years or so. The movie also wasted a very interesting idea: the plot of an ex-agent trying to rescue his daughter from white slaves trafficker's is actually pretty good. If they had put better screen writers this could have been a very crude, strong and believable film - instead, they want us to believe that: 1) Neeson is sort of a Rambo-Terminator, completely indestructible; 2) the baddies are the worst shots ever seen in movie history - they miss even at point blank range; 3) there are no police or law enforcer of any kind in Paris, since no one eve stops Neeson of killing literally everyone that is in his path. One of the worst action movies in many years. Don't waste your time and money with this trash!!",1.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam Neeson as a Bourne-again Schwarzenegger?! ...Well okay then,"Just a little bit more over-the-top than Damon's Jason Bourne, Neeson here has gone the full-Schwarzenegger from Commando (1985).Once you're over that shock (couldn't Neeson have shot more people in Love Actually? - that movie could really have been something!) this is a surprisingly good vigilante genre flick in the best cruel and blood-thirsty sense.Can't say I'm normally a fan of former cinematographers-turned-directors (look at your Jan De Bonts, Dean Semlers, even Barry Sonnenfeld is pretty hit & miss) but thanks go to Pierre Morel, who has been patient enough to nurture the character moments between all the wham-bam that makes you want to buy into the whole hackneyed kidnap/track-down and one-man-revenge-juggernaut premise all over again. The actors carry it off too - this is Neeson's movie of course, but even the teenage daughter is played quite genuinely (ie: genuinely irritating... these kids today, I don't know...) and you can feel Luc Besson's touch in the jarring mix of the sweetly sad/sensitive/sentimental protagonist with an explosively violent side to his personality. What's up with Luc Besson - did he only direct as a stepping-stone to screen writing? He can really smash a film like this home... but I digress.I enjoyed this film lots, it was a free preview screening but looking back it would be well worth paying for.Caution: If you're French, Albanian or Arabian... prepare to be offended!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
A must see,"What can i say, great movie, one of the best i have seen for a long time, probably at the same level of enjoyment with the Bourne trilogy. Luc Besson is one of my favorite action movie Director and he knows how to keep you on your seat for the entire length of the movie. Neeson is playing one of his best action roles and the entire casting is there to support him. To bad i didn't see it at the movies but even at the comfort of my own place on a DVD, i was still glued to the screen. Imaculate storyline, revenge is not a plate eaten cold but an action TAKEN now, and immediately. The problem of watching such a good movie is that you'll be judging everything else based on that and from the movies that i've watched lately i can assure you it will be some time until the next good one.

Her father happens to be retired special agent, and gets back in action to find her. OK you should see it, it is packed with action, both car chases, fighting, shoot-outs and the underdog winning in the end. Just don't expect to be challenged on the story line.

As adrenalin-rushing as it gets,"I watched ""Taken"" last night and, even though nearly 20 hours have passed since then, my blood is still pumping to my heart at a vastly increased speed! That's how exciting and adrenalin-rushing this brand new and brilliant French/American co-production is. Courtesy of the extremely gifted writers Luc Besson (""Leon"", ""The Fifth Element"") and Robert Mark Kramen (""The Transporter"", ""The Karate Kid""), this is easily the most spectacular and non-stop exhilarating movie of the past five years or so; even surpassing the high quality and intensity level of the Bourne trilogy, the newest Die Hard sequel and all movies starring Jason Statham. The concept of ""Taken"" covers the derivative formula of a rudimentary kidnapping movie, but what truly matters here is the unceasing fast-paced violence and the testosterone-packed performance of Liam Neeson. He stars as a retired spy for the US government who desperately tries to get in touch again with his estranged and heavily spoiled teenage daughter. When the girl and a friend travel to Paris against Bryan's will, they promptly become abducted by an Albanian network of drugs and network. Bryan has only 96 hours to save his girl, but barely a clue where or how to start his investigation. Luckily enough, Bryan is a trained fighting specialist with connections all over the world. ""Taken"" is somewhat similar to Roman Polanski's late 80's thriller ""Frantic"" story and setting-wise, but the speed and stunts are typically Luc Besson. Obviously this isn't the most plausible movie ever made, but I don't even think you're even supposed to believe half of what you see, just sit back and enjoy the ride. ""Taken"" is a smörgåsbord of virulent car chases, fist-fights, martial arts, explosions, sweet torturing methods and ultra-revolting bad guys. Fantastic stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Overall, quite exciting & finely paced","Like I said in my summary above, overall I found Taken quite exciting and well paced (and well and suitably paced through the entire movie also), even though it is flawed regarding some of the action which lacks enough strength to make Taken TRULY exciting. However, some of the action was fun to watch fortunately. My favorite scene from the film is where Liam Neeson is in his car and drives on the streets at a crazy, absolute full speed after the boat on which his abducted daughter was embarked unto, including the scene, seconds before that where he's seen running after the kidnappers for such a long time (while he was running, he made me think of the terminator running after his prey in terminator 2 Hahahahaha.), before tiring himself out and finding the car I've just been talking about. When I say he made me think of the terminator don't think I'm saying that I didn't like to see him run for so long because of that. I found it heroic to see him run, run and run, and I don't care if he makes me think of the terminator as long as I like to see him running and that it gives me the tension I want. The car scene was the absolute best, because you could feel the tension of the ride there and it was non-stop driving for what looked and/or felt (on scope) like 5 minutes to me when I watched it. Or, at least 5 minutes is the first thing that would come to my mind if I had to say how much (in minutes or seconds time) did the car ride feel and/or looked, because of the long time it took. My favorite quote is ""I will tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to"" because of the dialogue to which it connects to (I'm not telling the dialogue in case of SPOILERS! for those who haven't seen the film) For the family conflict, it is well developed and fun to watch and hear how the characters (father, mother and daughter) each behaves and reacts as a consequence of another's action. And there is also a strong performance from Bryan Mills'ex-wife when she discovers news about her daughter being taken. She performs perfectly and just the way you would expect a mother to behave when her child's been taken. Everyone is well cast. My recommendation to you if you've never seen Taken: Taken is far from being unmissable, but you will nonetheless still find some good thrills to hang around with. At least, you have to! Just, don't expect the action, whenever it comes to involve your brain at a high rate!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
This ACTION film has it all.,"Great use of the story premise, plot devices and very believable build up. The dialogue is precise and idiosyncratic to each character. The characters are incredibly well fleshed out. The acting is great; Liam Neeson did this role incredibly, everyone else doesn't have that much but at least they didn't ruin the film because of it. The cinematography is excellent and the editing masterful. Action sequences are beautiful and deliberate. The soundtrack/audio is specific but not deterring. This movie reeks of ""Leon"" or ""The Professional"" or even ""Ronin"" and will have that cult following who will rant about it for years. Specific details made me think of ""The Professional/Leon"" (for example the sleeping/sitting in the armchair by Neeson) and I was not surprised to learn it was written by Luc Besson (director of ""The Professional/Leon""). I thought that many action films fail because of the lack of attention to detail, but this is not the case for ""Taken"". It is a must see for action fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Liam Neeson Kick Ass... then Kills It!,"This has got to be one of my favourite movies since The Rock. It's tone is unapologetic, and the action is hard hitting and extremely fast paced. It's been a long time since I saw bad guys being terminated so mercilessly and enjoyably. Liam Neeson is one of those people who's an actor first and everything else second, so this movie has emotion and a sense of purpose. That's something most movies that rely on just action could never have, because without a story to carry them they go flat when the action rests. Here there is a relentless drive to a definite end. Liam's acting is such that you never forget that there is a driving purpose behind it all.A note on the fighting: since the Bourne series, there's been a (to me) welcome move towards using more realistic fighting systems in portraying a bit more realism. I see that the keysi system Liam learnt for Batman Begins didn't go to waste here. It's a great thing to see truly unconscionable bad guys being so brutally treated. I guess that's the magic of the make believe world of movies. You see things that you wish you'd see but know will never ever happen in real life.The only thing that would have made it a bit better for me was if it had a bit more blood in it. From a fighting arts point of view, I would also have liked some wider shots to better appreciate the technicalities of some of Liam's moves. I was able to understand what he did almost all the time, but to others the cuts may be a bit too choppy and distracting. But really that's a small point that is just nitpicking.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Creators of B13 spin an all new web of an intelligent yet uber-brutal spy thriller,"I knew nothing of this film.

This is an amazing film, and running at a pace of 93 minutes, you won't even know when it started and finished, and will leave you craving for some more. The fight scenes are exhilarating, the car chases are slick, and the way in which Neeson dishes out his own brand of justice is just plain super. We had no romantic interconnections, no boring humdrum or anything to loosen our grips on the tight narrative.Even then, this ain't your usual Statham action film, Neeson is a great actor, just check out the scene when he hears his daughter screaming while being kidnapped , and his lines after that, just before the ""Good Luck"", i knew this film was gonna be kick-ass at that moment, but i never expected so much.

"Now's not the time for dick measuring, Stuart!","On thing that is a sure as the sun coming up tomorrow is that a film written by Luc Besson will be thrilling. There's Taxi 1-4, Transporter 1-3, Leon, the Professional, and many more. This is just another one of Besson's magical films that will thrill you from start to finish.Darkman himself, Liam Neeson, is magnificent as a father that will do anything for his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). When she is taken for the sex trade, he springs into action that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.I have seen some very good films about the sex trade. Mira Sorvino in Human Trafficking, and Kevin Kline in Trade; but, Neeson is at the top of the game in tracking though the muck of this business to get to the top.

A Nutshell Review: Taken,"It's been just too long waiting for an action thriller that will knock my socks off, given too many bland attempts that left me wondering if the genre is too tired for my liking, with nothing left to wow. Then comes the Europa Corp team of Pierre Morel directing a Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen story, and Taken now ranks as one of my contemporary favourites for its simple story executed with so much style and gripping pace, that you'll be left breathless by the time the end credits roll.The trailer had one of the best monologues that I'm sure would have put many in the theatres, and probably be representative of the film. You have a stoic looking Liam Neeson as a father who tells the stranger at the end of the other line the conditions that the game will be played in, with perhaps bluff calling against bluff, only for the challenge and gauntlet to be thrown. From then on it's a non-stop adrenaline rush because this daddy happens to be a top ex-covert operative for the US government, so the bad guys essentially have chosen a wrong opponent to play the game with.The story worked well in dipping into some familiar fears, where daddy's little girl Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad lie after lie so as to cover up her tracks in wanting to do things she knows he would disapprove of. Such as, in this case, going on a tour of museums in Paris supposedly, rather than letting him know of her intent of being a groupie with friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) chasing U2 all over Europe. Some may dismiss this fear as paranoia, but I think that heightened sense of awareness is a by product occupational hazard, and it's always better to err on the side of caution. For any parent who are confident of their kid's conduct, there is absolutely no guarantees that their kids' friends would toe the same line, and there are often those who are magnets for trouble due to their thrill seeking. As is in this case where you see supposed safeguards to lower risks being systematically peeled away.With his reluctant consent and lessons being thrown in on very simple survival tips (that would even serve well in real life), things still go wrong according to Murphy, and Liam Neeson's Brian has to race against time in finding a needle in the perennial haystack, relying on contacts and skills built over the years in carrying out government missions of prevention to save masses, now to put them into something more personal when addressing what could be any parent's worst nightmare, in having their daughters sold to the sex slave trade.Action-wise, Morel employs a whole host of fights ranging from gun battles, knives and the good ol' fisticuffs, with Neeson employing some cool Shinsai Goshin Kai moves for close quarter combats to take out opponents. You might balk at how it's probably another one man army movie with the hero ripping through the streets of Paris, but this borders close to the Jason Bourne movies in the way opponents are dispatched without remorse and without much bullshit. It's clinical as it is deadly, just the way I suppose anyone would do so without the very hokey monologues that plague lesser films prior to each kill. The action direction was top notch without resorting to cheap MTV styled quick cuts, and had kept the shaky-cam syndrome at bay, which in turn provided for a pure adrenaline rush for action junkies out there.Taken well deserved its accolades and I say again, one of the best action thrillers to have hit the screen of late after a number of bland peers. I highly recommend this and it's a shoo-in as a contender for top films of this year. See if you can spot that SQ plane flying overhead in a scene too!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Much better than you would expect it to be - Do not miss out,"It is unfortunate that 'Taken' is automatically regarded as clichéd by hearing its plot alone. In a nutshell, the daughter of an American secret agent is kidnapped and so he goes after her kidnappers. Sounds like a movie-made-for-TV doesn't it? Well it's not! The writing is excellent. Very tight, it gets to the point really quickly. It is obvious that they worked on the script a lot, to ensure that nothing boring or redundant is left inside. The rhythm of the plot picks up quickly and you don't want to stop watching.The action scenes are filmed to perfection and they are all convincing and interesting. The European set gives a kind of exotic vibe, adding to the value of the movie.Finally Liam Neeson is perfect for the role.

Taken: A Thriller That Forgets to Add Substance,"Taken moves at such a breakneck pace that it barely leaves room for depth.

He never quite brings the necessary weight or nuance to his role, making his character feel more like an action-movie stereotype than a compelling protagonist.

Amazingly good movie.,"I don't think I've seen much that could actually be described as 'better than Taken'. I train and teach Krav Maga and my head instructor has been in situations that I will describe simply as 'similar'. The fight scenes show accurate hand-to-hand combat, including Bryan Mills' ability to take on multiple opponents in quick succession. The near-miss accuracy of his opponents at such ranges is also accurate to someone not professionally trained, unless they've been in as many firefights as a child-soldier in the 3rd world.The 'plot holes' that some critics complain about are easily filled in by the fact that a trained spy or mercenary would easily have enough contacts to come across any information necessary to fill in the gaps of his knowledge.The plot was sound, the fight scenes were superb, the premise believable (and one that actually occurs in real life).",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A very good action/thriller flick,"This is a very good action/thriller flick. It currently holds a 7.9 rating at IMDb which it certainly deserves. The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).I generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real bad--s, I-kick-the-sh-t-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.The movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.This is really a textbook action/thriller movie. A very enjoyable hour and a half indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Although, in some point of views he is doing things against the law, but if it was me,I would do the same. When anyone of your family is in dangerous, and when you can not rely on the government, you should action quickly and use all your skills to fight for them. But of course,in real life most of us have no such skills as his,but it doesn't matter,the choices you make do matter.

Taken,"Pierre Morel Film "" Taken "" is a 2008 action movie , Starring Liam Nesson as the main character . At the beginning of the movie , Bryan Mills , Liam Nesson , a former CIA refused to let Kim ,his 17 year old daughter, travel to Paris with her friend , Amanda .Lenore ,his Ex-wife , convinced him to let Kim go , if he wanted to gain her love . He then approved to her , and what he didn't know was that she was planning a Europe tour .At the first scene of the film I felt uninterested by the intro , as for me I think it's the most important part of any film . It also does not highlights more on Amanda's personality , although she was a crucial part of the plot . As Kim and Amanda were kidnapped by groups who uses women for sexual pleasure and slavery , the film started to gain my attention and had me in suspense and eager to find out what will happen next .What I liked most about the movie was its moral theme , people should risk and go beyond the limits for their beloved one's . It teaches us to always be there for our close people , and help them when they are in danger with whatever it takes from risks or limits we go above from .A negative point of the movie plot was when Bryan went into the building of the gangs as a French Ambassador , and then he speaks in the English language with them instead of French . Also , Lenore showed no signs of worry to her daughter , and did not insist in traveling with the father to look for her kidnapped child instead of sitting home waiting .I recommend these to movie goers whom like fast action and incredible fighting scenes with a hint of unrealistic action that will not cease to keep you amazed . Also , I recommend "" Man on Fire "" directed by Tony Scott and "" Speed "" directed by Jan De Bont if you liked this movie",,Anonymous,Action
Entertaining no-brainer,"The only reasons I'm reviewing this movie is its high rating on IMDb (8.0 as of January 2009) and the fact that it was made in 2008. ""Taken"" is definitely not worthy of that high rating as it is nothing special at all. In fact, this is just an old school action movie that could have been made in the 80's. I was expecting Arnie to show up at any minute.In stead of Schwarzenegger Liam Neeson is starring, though. He plays a special-agent-whatever-kicker-of-asses whose daughter gets into the hands of evil Albanians. That's right: evil Albanians. Like in the 80's, the bad guys are just from some little country the audience knows nothing about, except that it's probably populated by EVIIIIIILLLL people.Anyway, Neeson (I forget his character's name) is that typical father that only exists in Hollywood: He totally loves his daughter Kim and is always there for her, but his ex-wife just won't acknowledge all his love and concern, because of his absence in the past or whatever. Wifey has already found a new boyfriend, a rich guy who's able to buy Kim more expensive presents than Neeson... like a pony... a pony for a 17 year old-girl. Yeah, you go make sense of it.Anyway, when asked to agree that Kim goes on a trip to Paris over the summer, Neeson in all his special agent-educational wisdom rejects his allowance at first knowing that the world is a bad place and not one for a 17 year old-girl and her 19 year old-friend to travel. However, in the end Kim and her mother bitch until Neeson finally lets his daughter go... Oh, boy, had they better listened to good ol' Spy Dad. Within the very first minutes in Paris the girls get abducted, of course, and Neeson has to go overseas to get them back.""Taken"" is full of clichés, from the wooden dialog, to the depiction of teenagers (17 year olds who love ponies, 19 year olds who have never had sex, girls who are fans of U2 and Holly Valance at the same time) up to a plot that just falls into place a little too neatly (much too neatly). The hero is a Dad with superpowers. Bullets magically miss him, while the ones coming from him hit their targets every time. We've seen this before and better BUT: It's a concept that never gets old, isn't it? And, well, the movie is very entertaining. It moves along quickly and the 90 minutes rush by in an instant.""Taken"" is not quite as stupid as ""The Transporter"", but then it's not choreographed as stunningly, either. It's just an old school action flick for anybody who's willing to turn off the old brain and watch Oskar Schindler kick some butt.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Taken 2009,"WOW! talking about non-stop action this was the movie of the year to me, as soon as it came out in theaters I knew I had to go see it as soon as possible. Just watching the previews over and over again made me want to watch it even more. The plot and Theme and Storyline of the movie were fantastic! I don't think that Luc could of made this movie any better than it already is. The whole entire cast played their roles perfect it didn't seem fake it seemed so real.I can watch Taken everyday if I didn't have a life, but unfortunately I do.I felt that when Kim got kidnapped it was a slap in the face for her Lenore, Lam tried to tell her but she wanted everything her way. Even though the movie was only 93 minutes long it didn't feel like it, maybe because I was too into it. One thing that I didn't like in the movie was Famke's role I thought she was a irresponsible parent and way too selfish and bitter for no reason.

Taken Works Solely Because Of Liam Neeson's Stellar Performance.,"Marking the dawn of a new era in Liam Neeson's acting career by reinventing his image and establishing him as a capable & charismatic action film star, Taken is a purely generic action thriller that's filled with all the known elements of action filmmaking, and has nothing new to offer but thanks to Neeson's stellar performance, it still makes up for a damn good ride.The story of Taken follows a retired CIA agent named Bryan Mills who's trying to strengthen his relationship with his estranged daughter who's leaving for Paris with her best friend. But when both of them are kidnapped by human traffickers for sex slavery, Mills is compelled to go after the kidnappers and relies on his old skills to track them down before it's too late.Co-written by Luc Besson & directed by Pierre Morel, Taken wastes no time in setting up its plot and once it gets going, it doesn't stop until the very end. The direction is slick, script is almost always focused on its lead character, its moments of action definitely benefit from its kinetic camera-work, while its tight editing makes sure that the narrative unfolds at a frenetic pace.Coming to the performances, Taken is Liam Neeson's show all the way for the actor returns to form in grand style and delivers a swashbuckling performance which, despite being over- the-top at several instances, resonates a charm of its own for Neeson is believable as both an merciless assassin & a protective father. Other than him however, the supporting cast is dull & don't have much to contribute.On an overall scale, Taken may not feature any moment that any action fanatic hasn't seen before but watching Liam Neeson beat everyone to a pulp is something that turns out to be refreshing & rewarding at the same time. Stylishly crafted, fiercely paced & elevated to new heights by Neeson's impressive input, Taken is an unexpected surprise & an undeniable fun flick that lives up to its cult status. Definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,Action

The real DArk Knight,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen, most defiantly this year at least. Liam Neeson is as I hinted at in my summery the real Dark Night, in this film he shows us the true side of a man pushed to breaking point which then leads to total destruction of the bad guys. To this I add that the film Batman Begins which also stared Liam Neeson was in a sense owned by him, it wasn't until I saw this film that I realized just how good he was in that film, I have to admit I haven't seen the Dark Night yet but I'm willing to lay down a few quid to say it isn't as good as the last Batman, and it isn't as good as Taken.There was only one bad point in this movie and that was when he takes out the spotter! Why? All he had to do was let the blond be taken and he could have followed them to the crib where the girls were being kept. That said he wasn't really at any point in the mood for messing around.If you love Batman, then you will like this film, if you liked Batman Begins and thought it was good because of the new Batman (Christian Bale) or the new Batmobile or new insight into the super hero known as Bruce Wayne. I think you might be a little disappointed because it is clear from this movie Liam Neeson was the bad guy that made Batman look good in Begins. I cant help but feel I'm going to watch The Dark Night and think about this film.To be honest I don't really need to sell this film to you, the 7.5 should do that for you, I do admit there are weak points in the movie but boy did the movie move along at a rapid entertaining pace. Good watch!, by the DVD, go to the movies, or download this movie you will watch it more than a few times.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Contrived,"If a little more care had been taken over the plot, this could have been an excellent movie. Integral and essential parts of the story are too rushed and contrived, and require a huge if temporary suspension of belief.Where it scores more highly is in realism during the action scenes, with what would appear at least to be physically possible and well executed stunts. Neeson is throughly believable as the no-nonsense, shoot first and ask questions later, man you definitely don't want to make angry by kidnapping his daughter. Apart from the fact he's Irish and playing an Ex-CIA operative. Maybe they were short on American actors that week, or maybe the CIA had more involvement in Ireland than they would admit to.At least we get yet another movie where Paris is torn up with car chases and explosions, and the French are portrayed as corrupt and inefficient.

"Original, thrilling, and totally badass thanks to Liam Neeson","In a world of James Bonds, Jason Bournes, and Frank Martins, it's hard for a little random ex-spy named Brian Mills to get some love. On the surface, his film seems a little formulaic, and he seems a little...well...old. However, once we get into Mills's story, and see how infinitely badass the wonderful Liam Neeson plays him, you'll probably be saying something along the lines of ""James who?"". 'Taken', which follows Mills as he pursues those responsible for kidnapping his daughter, is a heart pounding thriller with a stupendous display of badassery from Liam Neeson. It may have a plot that's sort of unbelievable, but it's one of the best action thrillers in years.Why do critics dislike this movie? Is it because they have no ability to see beyond the obviously far-fetched events of the movie? Is it because they take themselves too seriously and don't know how to have fun? It's probably both of those two reasons, but I find peace in thinking that they're complete idiots who don't know what they're talking about...sometimes. The fact remains that 'Taken' is plain fun, popcorn entertainment, that doesn't resort to cheap explosions in looking for thrills. It relies on the gritty closeups of the marvelous hand to hand combat and stylistic action (Liam Neeson's 'Batman Begins' training certainly paid off here).The film is the brainchild of Luc Besson, the mind behind the Transporter films. Here, he relies on a director that may be inexperienced as a director, but one who also has more experience in shooting action on film than most. Pierre Morel, responsible for the photography in action films such as 'War', 'Unleashed', and of course, 'The Transporter', does a great job in choreographing some very good action sequences, especially giving them some flavor when they end. The film was not just pure action, which was good, as it also showed Neeson's character working as a spy and shows some intelligence in that aspect.Speaking of Neeson, it appears that his days as the kind hearted mentor figure in films such as 'Narnia' and 'Star Wars' are behind him. His ruthless, badass, and perfectly natural performance makes the movie watchable and carries it from start to finish (which isn't too long, as the film clocks in at one hour and 45 minutes including previews). Neeson is a veteran, and it really shows. His performance goes deep, and will excite the viewer in all ways. Maggie Grace was also noteworthy as his daughter (it was tough to recognize her without her blonde hair!).This is probably the best example I've seen in awhile of how stupid and self-righteous most film critics can be. They fault 'Taken' for having events occur that aren't entirely realistic. Do they recognize the film for being a great roller coaster ride that will leave most viewers happy (pretty much my entire theater of 150 people seemed happy)? No. It's further proof that Liam Neeson is one of the best leading men around, and that these critics really need to catch up with the times.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Don't bother,"Someday someone will have to explain to me why an actor who starred in, and indeed received an Academy Award nomination for his performance in, one of the greatest movies ever made, a move that will be watched as long as movies are watched, Schindler's List, would waste his time and very real talents appearing in this embarrassing collection of clichés and cheap thrills. Someday someone will have to explain that to me.This has it all, folks. All the classic clichés. Young women who are brutally tortured, physically and mentally, because they (thought about being) bad girls. Different-looking Eastern Europeans who exemplify the most degraded possible aspects of (sub)human nature. (That has a long pedigree; think ""M"".) French police officers who are corrupt to the core. Endless scenes of violence and gun-play in which the hero is never hurt even against incredible odds but all his opponents get wasted. (Eastern Europeans can't shoot straight, etc.). Lots of peek-a-boo scenes of young women being prostituted in the most vile fashion. (Not, of course, that any are not vile.) This movie has it all, and used it all to play to the worst in anyone.

Thrilling,"For the first fifteen minutes or so, you are convinced that ""Taken"" is just going to be another run-of-the-mill action movie, albeit with a strange choice of action hero. We meet Bryan (Liam Neeson) who seems quite ordinary, as he attempts to hold onto his relationship with the daughter (Maggie Grace) who lives with his ex-wife. He takes a brief job as a bodyguard and we see a glimpse of something extraordinary about Bryan when the girl he is protecting is attacked. So far though, the movie is pretty average.But then his daughter is kidnapped in Paris and that's when the entire movie moves up about five gears.Although there are certain plot holes in the story, if you're looking for something to satisfy your craving for action in the style of the Bourne movies, then you're going to forgive those and go along for the ride. And what a ride it is! Once Bryan arrives in Paris, the concerned father persona gives way to another; a terrifying whirlwind of fury which will do anything to get back what was taken from him. Legs are broken, faces destroyed, rounds of gunfire are emptied into fleeing men and torture is employed. If you thought a 56 year old Liam Neeson would be slower and less impressive than a 32 year old Matt Damon, you'd be dead wrong.Once the main storyline of ""Taken"" began, I found my eyes glued to the screen. You see, Neeson does two things here - firstly, he completely sells the audience the fact that he is a father who will go to any lengths to get his daughter back alive. You see the concern in his eyes when he learns who has taken her and you see the absolute, unconditional love he has for her. Secondly, he convinces you that he really does possess the ""particular set of skills"" he warns one of the kidnappers about. You've seen Neeson in many movies but you've never quite seen him like this. The scene where he takes out an entire den of kidnappers at high speed by stabbing and shooting people before they barely have a chance to react is a particular highlight.In summary, ""Taken"" is one of the best action movies of 2008. Give it a chance and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

The plot is a lil weak, no real message or moral to learn from unless you are Albanian and have kidnapped Liams daughter. I liked it, except for the instances where things occurred so conveniently for Liams character, eg the correct villain said ""good luck"" the 1st time around also it was so easy to analyze the phone call to exactly pin point the main kidnapper. But the action and fight choreography was very very good. Liam looks and fits the profile for a highly talented deadly retired CIA agent.

"Unoriginal story, but AWESOME action","I have to describe this movie with The Bourne Movies as a Frame of Reference. First of all, this movie wouldn't work unless it was someone like Liam Nesson starring. HE is the movie. The movie is focused on him kicking major donkey. Storywise this movie is very weak. It plays off the stereotype that everyday, thoughtless girls run to Europe and get kidnapped and all manner of horrible things happen. Furthermore, the parts of the movie that aren't good guy v. bad guy, are borderline crap. Some of its bad acting, but most of it is just mediocre directing and editing in those areas. DON'T watch this movie expecting an awesome web of lies for a story, its straightforward enough to be a video game.Now with all that said, the Action is quite EPIC. The moves Neeson pulls in many of these scenes (even though they're probably not actually Neeson] are on the level of Jason Bourne greatness. IF one simply wants to see a movie with THRILLING ACTION MOMENTS! and INTENSE SEQUENCES! in between, then this movie is a perfectly good use of 8 bucks.But personally, if I really wanted to see it just because, I'd go with the matinée.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
More dismally written propaganda...,"The exposition was jaw-droppingly clunky. Critical moments were utterly unbelievable. Generally terribly written.

This is a cringingly obvious propaganda piece for the new world order and its torturing, murdering servants. Really there is nothing more of interest in this trashy, badly-written, clichéd rubbish.

Kill 'Em All,"Released in the U.S. in January, 2009, ""Taken"" is one kick-axx movie! In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.""Taken"" plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.The moral of ""Taken"" is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. ""Taken"" pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious ""No Country for Old Men"" a perfect 4/4 rating. Unbelievable.The film was shot on location in France and runs a short-but-sweet hour and a half.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Clichés and lack of character development aside,it's easy to be taken with Taken","Quiet divorce Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson,someone I figured was overdue for doing a movie like this and he doesn't disappoint!)lives a solitary life,pining only to stay close to his now near-adult daughter's life. His attractive ex(Famke Janssen,not minding to sacrifice her sexiness for grit)has re-married to a super rich guy,and he can give said daughter(Maggie Grace)anything she wants. Fortunately for our hero,she still wants--at least when she's not momentarily blinded by all the cool things she can get and do--her daddy's love and approval.A long-coveted trip to France(that is semi-supervised,of course)is what Kim,the daughter,gets from her folks,despite her dad's misgivings. Sure enough,her and her friend's bags have settled on the Rue-de-Place hotel floors more than an hour when some brutish,swarthy thugs violently overtake both girls and leave only vague,residual clues to what they're gonna do with them.Of course,said thugs didn't count on Kim's dad being an excellent spy,a ""fixer"" who has plenty of contacts and a wealth of skills in tracking and neutralizing hostile foes.Director Luc Beeson(who,I'll be honest,I was not fully aware of helming this picture when I decided upon seeing it)may be stooping a bit by helming this pretty straight-forward action genre flick--the guy helm-ed the trippy,near-definition busting SciFi offering The Fifth Element for crying out loud!!--but he has a more than competent feel for the frenetic,fast-paced activity and story here. I cannot give this TOO high of marks simply because the whole run of this story has a few too many clichés and many,if not most viewers,will recognize the standard chain of events right away. Not to mention the near lack of character development(heck,even Neeson's character only gets a broad outline when you really think about it),this movie would seem to be shallow entertainment. Still,it's hugely satisfying and,at a blistering 93 minutes,it doesn't leave the viewer enough time to dwell on the show's deficiencies. Perhaps it's playing dirty pool with audiences,but this movie works on a very basic and involving level. At the risk of using the oh-so-ready word play supplied by the movie's title,I think Taken is an appropriate title for this punchy,effective ride of a film.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
""" I  have  a  very  Special  set  of  Skills,  . . . and  I  will  find  and kill you ""","There is a very serious crime most prevalent in Europe, which is daily spreading across the globe. The crime is Human trafficking and it's tragic results can be seen on the evening news. Police often uncover the remains of missing victims, days, months and often years later. It is estimated that 10,000 victims are listed as missing, kidnapped or murdered every year and includes beautiful women, ignorant young girls and underage boys. That is the basis for this film called "" Taken! "" After retiring from the C.I.A. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is government spy learns his precious daughter, now 17, has been kidnapped and is on her way to being sold to wealthy sex merchants. Told he has 96 hours to find her, Mills put's his expertise to work and promises his adversaries he will learn who they are and eliminate them all. His many hindrances include his ex-wife and her new but rich husband. Vowing to find and retrieve his daughter, Mills will leave no stone unturned or friendship undisturbed including his old French Police friend Stuart (Xander Berkeley). Neeson is in find form and artistic element as he gives the surreal impression nothing will stop him until he succeeds. Love for his daughter, morphs the aging spy into a fanatical lunatic, turned juggernaut. High speed chases and plenty of energetic physical action are the essence of this highly charged movie.

Do not #$&$ with Liam Neeson,"""Schindler's List"" turned Liam Neesom into a legend. ""Taken"" turned him into the baddest guy you don't want to #$&# with.The story has enough interesting twists and surprises to keep you guessing.

A nasty piece of work,"It's difficult to believe that any Europeans were involved in the making of ""Taken"", least of all someone reasonably smart, like Luc Besson.Liam Neeson's character is clearly an over-protective dad, but he's also someone whose CIA past means that he knows how dangerous the world can be. Is he justified in his anxiety about letting his daughter travel to Paris (yes, not Damascus, Kinshasa or Caracas - Paris)? Of course it is. His daughter and her friend are barely out of the airport when they're abducted by swarthy types (clearly a daily occurrence at Charles de Gaulle). And do these bad guys seek to ransom the clearly very wealthy young women? Mum, Famke Jannsen, and her new fella have got to be good for a few million. No, it makes better financial sense to get the prom queens addicted to heroine and sell them into the sex trade (apparently Eastern European women cost too much to transport?).Clearly Europe is also a place where venal corruption goes to the top, plus it's just a short walk from... the Middle East. Keep your daughters safe, America! Fortunately foreign laws don't apply to U.S. citizens, so anyone even tangentially involved in the kidnapping is welcome to a bullet in the back. Problem solved.One of the most xenophobic films I've seen in a long time, clearly intended to reinforce American distrust of Europe and loathing of the East. Its moral compass is so absurdly right-wing it might persuade Harry Callahan to vote Democrat.",2.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam Neeson aka Bad A$$,Liam Neeson plays the lead role in this movie as a former CIA operative who has to go back into action after his daughter gets abducted on a trip to Paris.In this movie Liam Neeson made himself into an action star with the best action movie since the Bourne series ended. There definitely needs to be some sequels made to continue on the Brian Mills character since they're just starting to stratch the surface of this character.From going from one bad guy to another to get that much closer to finding his daughter in an unflinching manner is what makes this movie great.,10.0,Anonymous,Action

Very Impressed,I was extremely impressed. I watched this for the first time a couple of weeks ago (and stupidly after watching the 2nd of the Taken films) but it didn't ruin my experience. I'm not an action fan but I have to say this movie really surprised me.This is a really clever film. Bryan (the main character) is so clever! He doesn't need all the gadgets and gizmos that Bond and other action guys need to kill the bad guy. He uses his brain and he's killing the bad guys for personal reasons rather than to 'save the country' so this sets it apart from other films of this genre.I was hooked from start to finish and I love that the film didn't feel long. It flew bye. I want it on DVD. Could watch it again and again. It was excellent. Really well written and acted. 10/10 millions better than I ever ever expected it to be!,10.0,Anonymous,Action
Flawed too much to fully enjoy,"It looked okay but I didn't like the orange/cyan tinge to most of the movie. Immersive and well placed sound design, almost perfect! I think I detected some dodgy dubbing. This is shocking. It reminded me of Hostel (2005) but instead of intense gore there was a forced into prostitution theme. There were moments of utter silliness where the story was boring and other moments where the story was stupid. It did ramp up to full on excitement and shock.

The classic which started the late career action hero Liam Neeson (a very good thing),"The first time I watched this film I was surprised how good it was, knowing it more through the great meme. But it blew me away how good it was.Second time same thought- the setup is as good as any film, with Neeson a man desperately seeking to reconnect with his daughter, who gets kidnapped on a holiday in France he didn't want her to take.Europe is a great setting and Liam Neeson plays so well as an ageing ex-agent on a one-man mission to rescue his daughter, with no one, even cops getting in his way. It's irresistible to watch him on his fact finding, owing a lot of influence to the Bourne films in terms of one man's resourcefulness, Europe's as the setting and the camera action during the fight scenes. The look into a dark criminal underground is also genuinely frightening but plausible.Only negative is the daughter, a 17 year old being played by a 25 year old actress at least to me seems a bit obvious - I have no idea how 17 year old girls act but I don't know why they couldn't have made her a bit older, and believable.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

"Let Liam Neeson take you into ""Taken""!","""Taken"" is not another stupid action thriller of B production with bad actors and low budget; ""Taken"" is what modern action thriller should look like, written by Luc Besson, directed by Pierre Morel and brilliantly acted by one and only Liam Neeson. Neeson brings completely new approach to his character and proves that you don't need to have tons of muscles to be an action star (he's 56 remember!!); he has the height, style, approach, in one word: he's cool! Above everything he is a great actor and he proves that once again. I could go on and on talking about Neeson but I want to say a few things about this movie. Following path of revenge Besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity. It doesn't present nothing new, but the way the whole movie was filmed, with amazing action scenes (some of them brutal like electricity torture) and great actor in main role, you gotta' be satisfied with final outcome. And yes, you know that he's going to save everyone but then again Seagal also saves everyone but 95% of his movies are stupid. That is the magic of this movie cause Besson didn't present anything new. You just need to have passable script, good, young director, be European and have good actor in main role. All I can say, just let Liam Neeson take you into ""Taken""!",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"A pure popcorn, action feature.","This is a very hard one to review as I can see why it's loved by so many. On the plus side, it contains the swiftest direction by Pierre Morel and a production by the king of action films himself Luc Besson. The film seems to just breezes through the gears. Also the star Liam Neeson gives almost a perfect performance, as an ex C.I.A agent out to recapture his taken daughter. On the negative side, the plot is so far fetched you have to stifle the laughs and at many a point. The way the central character takes on (single handed), the most one dimensional Albanian gangsters is almost laughable; whilst (simultaneously) taking out the whole of the French Intelligence service. 'Taken' though proved to be both very successful and highly influential (spawning two sequels and countless imitators). On the downside, since the original 'Taken' Liam Neeson himself, has become more typecast than Daniel Craig as James Bond but the upside is of course, the most lucrative of acting roles.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

"Good action, nice acting but...","I have been looking for some action this month and this piece satisfied me well enough. There is a great job from the director and especially from the camera and cut although it misses some points to excellence.The main idea - retired ""James Bond"" - Bryan (Liam Neeson) saving his daughter in Paris - is simple but efficient. It provides all the action we need. Liam really stands out and outdoes himself. The movie is not too long, I would say just the right time, it keeps you thrilled for the most of the scenes. He is self-confident, sure of himself and desperate to find his Kim. This is the good part - believable.On the other hand, there was time when I thought ""how the hell could this happen ?!"" I mean, some facts are not so convincing. There is too much luck and accidents that favor Bryan. I just could not go with it. In the end there is a little twist, but this is not enough. Bryan always knows where to go and what to do. And if he gets caught, hanging bound waiting for execution, he escapes the death miraculously. But I guess this is just the way the movies are turned today..Despite this, I think the movie is well worth watching. Its not disgusting but of course without some corpses would be no action and no fun. Enjoy the show! :)",,Anonymous,Action
Don't Be Taken for a Fool,"And now producer/writer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel present the comedy event of the year!Here's the pitch: Two spoiled obnoxious teenage girls from California go to France and get kidnapped by a group of Albanians trafficking dumb tourists into sex slavery to the highest bidders--and you guessed it, one of those high bidders is a Middle Eastern sheik. But oh yeah, did I mention one of those girl's fathers just happens to be a retired Jack Bauer-style super-spy who's about reign down a sh*t-storm on the streets of Paris in order to rescue his idiot daughter? And guess what--it's Liam Neeson!Yes, there is a bit of a novelty factor in watching the guy who played Oskar Schindler go against type and get crazy on these moronic dirt-bags. And gosh darn it, Liam does his best with the role. I can't remember the last time a film was sold to the American public entirely on the sound of one man's voice reading dialog. He alone makes the otherwise unbearable film watchable. However, let's be honest. As much fun as it is to watch Liam Neeson outrun a speeding car or electrocute some guy or kill a dude with a broken bottle, Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" was a far better and more refined example of grizzled old guy ""badassery"", and it was a hell of a lot funnier, and fancy that, had a moral.What we have here in ""Taken"" is tone deaf French filmmakers sticking their nose up at Americans and spreading xenophobia abroad. I'm pretty sure they thought there were making a slick black comedy that no American would see through. Had they manifested this with a harder edge or more overtly satirical tone, they might've been on to something. Instead we get a second-rate episode of ""24"" watered down by a PG-13 rating that takes away any possibility of entertainment on even an exploitative level.Bottom line: Don't be fooled by Liam Neeson's voice. He commanded our attention in the teaser trailers, but this should be film not taken.",4.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam Neeson saves ridiculous script,"Liam Neeson, father of a slightly rebellious teen, finds himself confronted by a parent's worst nightmare: his daughter has been abducted. Paris serves as the background for first rate action, spiced with one of the worst scripts I've come across in years. Apparently Europe is a den of iniquity where police, the rich and famous and seedy Albanians all connive to abduct innocent American girls not heeding parental advice.The film lacks local colour, which is all but absent. Paris is depicted as if it were the capital of Dagestan, where nothing is as it should be and crime and treason lurk behind every corner.Liam Neeson is his usual concentrated solid self and makes the film worth while, delivering a believable ex secret agent.

Good for the genre,"I normally don't go out for action flicks, so I was sort of surprised by how Taken picked me up on a wave and carried me pretty well through, though with a few hiccups along the way.But, in the end, it's just an action flick. It's pretty predictable stuff, hence, no danger of ""spoiling"" it. To wit: Enormously talented security dude, estranged from his family (because of his line of work), but still deeply loves his daughter. She's kidnapped. Dad jumps into the frey, saves his daughter. End of story! Lots of entertaining sleuthing, lots of kicking ass, occasional serious breaches of believability: Dad tells daughter ""don't go to Paris""...accused of paranoia...and, of course, the daughter is promptly kidnapped by Albania's only export to the West; politically-correct gangsters. Hero, faced with bursts of near-point-blank automatic gun fire, is not hit. He shoots a Paris police big-wig's wife in the arm, crashes many cars, kills many people; yet, when the action is finished, he hops on a plane with his daughter to fly back to the States.Some great subtlety in handling and pacing, but occasional firehose action sequences (esp. toward the end, natch) where you feared you were watching ""just another"" action flick.I really do appreciate acting professionalism; and Liam Neeson is an absolute wonder. Great actors can do *anything*, and that's why Liam gets the big bucks.The main reason I watched this was because I saw Besson's name on it, and he gave us such great tours-de-force... I expected something like that, and instead I got a quite tolerable action flick treat.No moral complexity; real white/black hat stuff.Quite good for the genre. Even if action flicks aren't your bag, you might want to try this one out, to recalibrate your attitudes a little.",,Anonymous,Action
Neeson turns action hero,"'Taken' garnered mixed to average reviews critically and still is, looking at the reviews here, a film that divides audiences. Can see both sides, being one who was mixed to moderately liked the film. It is interesting for being one of Liam Neeson's first endeavours as an action hero, and considering that the trailer was an intriguing one and Neeson has always been very watchable and often very good the potential was there.As was said regarding 2011's 'Unknown' recently, 'Taken's' potential wasn't fully lived up to. Enough of 'Taken' does work, or at least to me it did (not everybody will agree and that's fine by me), but also from personal opinion what could have been a pretty good film turned out to be an above average but uneven one that could have done much more with what it had. It entertains and intrigues, but doesn't wow.Really liked the rawness and slickness of the way 'Taken' was shot and edited, and the bleakness and grit of the rest of the production values suited the tone and genre perfectly. It's nicely scored, not intrusive but having presence, and the direction is solid.There is enough taut suspense and fun to keep one gripped and the violence is uncompromisingly brutal and leaves one biting the nails. The sound effects are thrilling in authenticity and will leave one wincing in shock, with it adding hugely to the harrowing effect of the action. Neeson is a very commanding presence on screen and there is energy to the directing.It is a shame though that, excepting Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen, the rest of the cast fail to match him or engage, being largely indifferent. The script also doesn't excite, descending into too much cheese and tedium and tending to lack clarity, subtlety.Despite it being fun, slick, gritty and generally taut, the story is far too predictable and gets far too far-fetched and over-the-top in the latter stages. The violence, while thrilling and well done on its own, tends to overpower the basic drama of the story, so things feel unbalanced. The characters are pretty sketchy.Overall, above average but uneven and more a mixed to moderately liked sort of film. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Intense but too short,"When the daughter of a former CIA agent gets abducted the guy gets to use all his skills to track her abductors down. There are a few lines of story twisted through this, but the main line stays the same: quick, sometimes crude, action.It all starts when the daughter, who is living with her mother, asks her father to sign a paper that allows her to travel out of the US because she wants to see Paris. The guy is a bit reluctant because he's seen too much darkness on this planet during his days of work for the agency, but he signs anyway and thus the story starts rolling.And roll it does. Taking a few plot holes at a time it finds its way to the bottom of the rabbit hole pretty quickly and as things get more and more dirty the plot holes get deeper.The film isn't entirely bad, but if they had listened to the call of reality a bit more often it would have been a lot better. Now it is just another film where some invincible angry human chases after a lot of bad guys and that really doesn't credit it as well as it might have been.Another irritation factor to this film is its short running length. Taking just under 90 minutes this feels a bit like a rip-off - having to buy full price for a film that rushes its way to its end doesn't make me happy.6 out of 10 bad guys beaten to a pulp",6.0,Anonymous,Action
What a take!,"As I finally woke up to the sleeper action movie hit of the year ""Taken"", I was taken by surprise on how immensely entertaining this narrative is. Sure it does incorporate various faux action tactics by the lead action character, but you know what? I'll take it! Liam Neeson stars as retired CIA Agent Bryan Mills who might be the best of the action heroes to arrive in the cinematic millennium. It's not so what Mills can do, is what he cannot do. He is sharp, cerebral, dynamic, skilled, swift just to give you a few takes on his strengths. Mills' CIA training definitely comes in handy when his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is what else ""taken"" on a Paris vacation by an Albanese gang for slave trade. Thereafter, Daddy Mills puts on his vengeance suit and off to Paris he goes to rescue his daughter and take down the malos. Does the Mills prevail? Well, I can't take that away from you by providing you the answer. You are going to take it all in cinematic stride by watching ""Taken"". Director Pierre Morel excelled in orchestrating action sequences in ""Taken"" with his rapid style. Sure no CIA agent could realistically be as skilled as Mills and sometimes his marvel proficiency seemed more illusory than authentic. But we could say the same for ""Die Hard"" machismo John McClane and many other infamous action heroes. So we should all take it with a grain of salt, and ask ourselves ""Is this plain action movie fun?"" I sure thought so! I am glad the protagonist role was taken by veteran actor Liam Neeson! He was, to simply say it, ""kick ass"" as Mills. ""Taken"" will not capture everyone, especially those nitpicking critics, but I was sure taken in on this 90 minute action entertainment ride. OK, that was my last take for the compelling ""Taken"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam Nesson owns this role,"(2009) Taken
ACTION/ THRILLERIf you're craving to see an action film as I am, this film doesn't disappoint, and the action is more credible than 2 and three of the Transporter movies but you' re going to have to overlook the idiocy surrounding Liam Nesson and his friends. Like watching ""Die Hard"", the original when you want the villains to lose and you're not completely satisfied unless the stupid and bull-headed people are shot too. The characters playing Liam's daughter and ex-wife didn't do anything wrong but are two of the most annoying characters in the whole film, so care-free as if nothing could ever happen to them, sha-la-la I felt like slapping them silly. Although, I'm glad the movie is doing really well that I hope that in the sequel the character playing the daughter and the imbecilic mother (Famke Janson) get there comeuppance just for being gullible. I understand the reason for this kind of stupidity is just an excuse for Liam Neeson to do his thing and that is to torture and then kill bad guys which hasn't really been shown for most action films as of late. Most films especially from the horror genre always showcasing innocent people are tortured and then killed, that the reason this film is a kind of a relief where the good guy gets to do what bad guys do to innocent people for years. And as a result I was quite gratified at what I saw but kind of wished that their were more action sequences regarding Liam since I felt that he could do so much more with his character.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Pimps & Assassins: Do the Math,"Taken (2008) **Is it better to evaluate a movie on what's good about it? Or is it better to judge a movie on what's bad about it? If 2/3s of a movie are competently entertaining, but another third shockingly dreadful does the good still outweigh the bad? That's the issue with the new Luc Besson/Pierre Morrel Liam Neeson starring vehicle Taken.Neeson plays Bryan, a former spy/assassin of the government sort. He's retired, now living in California to be close to his daughter, who lives with her mother and step father in a lavish mansion. She wants to go to France with a friend, and she needs her father's permission. He's hesitant but lets her go, only to find out she's actually following U2 around adding to his nervousness. Of course he's right to be nervous, as she is kidnapped immediately after settling into the city. This occurs while he's on the phone with her, which conveniently has been recorded so that his ex-assassin buddies can analyze the call, pinpoint that the kidnappers speak Albanian, with an accent they can apparently narrow down to one village, and then determine that the man speaking into the phone is named Marco. With this information he travels to Paris to search out his daughter employing his mad skills.While there he pieces together one by one who is behind it, finds them, finds where the girl has gone, kills a lot of people and then, well I won't spoil it but I'm sure you know where this is going. The plot line in the picture is very, very standard. Allow me to quote film critic Jules Brenner in his review of Taken: Just calling this formulaic doesn't cover it. The script should be credited to the computer software template that originated it."" Now that is a gem of a soundbyte. It's also pretty much bang on. Besson never really takes any time to seriously look at a very serious subject. It's just a conduit through which he can insert standard action movie happenings. Just because a movie is made in Europe doesn't mean it's any less prone to Hollywood clichés.In describing the movie, I'm realizing more than I did when I started writing how mediocre the actual story is in the film. But, for 2/3s of the movie you can kind of forget about that most of the time. Fact is, the action sequences are quite well done, and director Morrel realizes that the key to keeping the audience from realizing just how predictable and substandard his story really is, is to never give them a chance to think about it. The film moves at breakneck speed, and when the hunt is really on its quite entertaining.Liam Neeson goes from totally unbelievable to mildly believable by the end of the movie. He gives a good performance, but sometimes he's a bit of a distraction. Question: Is he American or British here? Sometime he doesn't seem to speak with an accent, others he clearly does. All his ex assassin friends are American (save for a French guy in France), he lives in the US and his American wife refers to him sacrificing for the good of the country. Anyway, that's irrelevant.So that's what's good about Taken. Now, the bad. Well we've established that the plot originated from a standard action movie template. It's got the usual foreign baddies and fat cat Arab's lusting for Western virgins. And for an underground human smuggling operation, it's surprisingly easy to find. Oh, and of course, the bad guys all have terrible aim while the good guy's is dead on - but that's so old hat in any movie with a gun fight I probably just wasted 20 seconds typing this out.So this is all forgivable given the success of the nonstop action in denying us the opportunity to reflect on the plot. What's not forgivable is just how shockingly awful the first half hour of Taken is. How bad is it? I don't even know if I can describe it. Things really go down hill when a bunch of cheery, wildly unbelievable former assassins show up at Neeson's door.... with beer, and chips and hotdogs for a BBQ. They chat nonchalantly about jobs in Beirut and so on and so forth. The effect can only be described as unintentionally hilarious, or perhaps the most unbelievably miscalculated plot point since Micky Rooney played an Asian in Breakfast at Tiffani's.Then there is the daughter and her friend. I don't know if they're bad actors or just entirely at the mercy of the worst written characters I've ever seen in a film with such prestige. For that matter, I assume Besson must have wrote in French then translated to English. Lost in translation is the only conception I have to explain such awful lines (""They're there, I can hear them!""). Its no word of a lie that I almost walked out after the opening third confused as to whether give Taken half a star for sheer ineptitude or 5 for being the funniest comedy I'd seen in ages.But, I stuck it out. I guess I'm glad I did. In the end, yes I was entertained. Then I had the opening conundrum. I was really almost ready to give Taken a mild pass. But now that I've come to the end of the review, I've been given the time to reflect. And Taken is still dogmatically formulaic. Maybe if you don't think about it afterward you'll be satisfied. Unfortunately for me, I thought about it.",,Anonymous,Action
"Worth a rental, but not much else","First things first, I came into this movie with no expectations, it was simply a last minute recommendation from a friend.Pros: Great production quality! The action scenes were well choreographed, car scenes weren't too laden with special fx, and the lighting of the film was really superb. To boot, the storyline was pretty convincing and the thematic content was quite serious. It was nice to see an emotional character written with a certain cold-blooded-ness that is usually glossed over for fear of alienating the audience. Oddly enough that brings me to my next point.Cons: Gratuitous carnage. Probably about 10 cold-blooded murders with another 30-40 other 'slaughters'. I don't mind a bit of death, but this was over the top. It's foolish to assume that simply filming lots and lots of murder scenes will help a movie compete with other studio action films. Violence can be artfully and thoughtfully woven into a film, but that definitely did not occur here.The ending was also a fairly big letdown, but at that point it felt like the film just wanted/needed to wrap up quickly - it was getting a bit tired.All in all a fairly decent film, definitely a solid rental. It would have been eerily spectacular if it had been directed by David Cronenburg, a director who's understanding of violence and the more disturbing parts of the human psyche would have made this story pop!",6.0,Anonymous,Action

The love of a father=the death of many men,"I actually thought this would be just another action movie.Remembering Neeson from his astounding role in ""Schindler's List"" i was mesmerized by his capability of showing us what a father feels when his daughter is in danger.The movie is just meant to keep your adrenaline level extremely high and puts you in a revengeful mood.It got me to the point were i wished those pimps/mobsters would suffer a great amount of pain(and they did).Yes,it's that GOOD.Final words:a very good action movie(i haven't seen one like this in a few months)",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The Bourne Paternity,"I'll bet Neeson's Bryan Mills character could beat the crap out of Jason Bourne. Talk about an over-protective father figure! Too bad most of the young ladies kidnapped for real in this world don't have a father like this guy.With each film he makes, Liam Neeson is becoming more and more likable. In fact there has never been a part he's played that I wasn't totally comfortable with him being there. Except the time he played a Kansas sheriff in some Steve Martin movie... the name of it escapes me. It wasn't a great film. But Taken certainly is! It requires great and skillful movie-making to present us so many unbelievable elements, and still keep us begging for more. Neeson is a former CIA agent who has to fly to Paris on very short notice after his daughter and a friend are taken hostage moments after arriving on a vacation. He was against the trip from the start, but eventually he gave in to the pressure from bitchy ex-wife Famke Janssen. After all, her husband gave the girl some champion thoroughbred for her birthday, and all Neeson could afford was a tiny Karaoke machine! If he says no about this trip, his daughter may never speak to him again.Neeson arrives in Paris and just about tears the city apart looking for his daughter and her kidnappers. Not only a world class ass kicker, this man is also very technically proficient and in no time has this coven of sleazy Albanian immigrants on the run. Since the daughter is a virgin, she is to be sold off to a wealthy sheik! It is estimated that Neeson has only 96 hours to find her! Can he do it?? As many people understand, the film is not at all plausible. And its makers must know this. So instead of many thought-provoking scenes, the film treats us to several fights, car chases, shootouts and whatever else keeps an action movie rolling. The film touches on the dreary practice of the sex trade, and even though the film is PG-13, we get a good sense of how disgusting that world is. Neeson is exceptional as always. A skillful boxer in his early days, now he uses martial arts and makes them look good. He, like Jason Bourne can knock just about anyone out with a couple quick and perfectly placed shots to the head or neck. This film was a huge box office hit, but unfortunately for Neeson, his wife passed away in a terrible skiing accident about the time it was in theaters. My condolences go out to him, and also my congratulations on making a wonderful action film. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Powerful, Relentless Action Movie about the Modern White Slave Trade","Liam Neeson is a retired CIA action man, whose wife has abandoned him for a rich creep, and the couple are spoiling his 17 year-old daughter and driving a wedge between him and the girl. The girl has foolish spoilt brat rich friends and is persuaded by a featherhead named Amanda to travel to Paris with her, which Neeson tries to prevent but cannot. As soon as the silly girls arrive, they are spotted at the airport by Albanian gangsters who provide girls for captive, drugged prostitution and sell the prettiest into the white slave trade. Naturally, the girls are kidnapped, and Neeson's daughter being especially pretty is destined for the harem of one of those corrupt Arab sheikhs we all love to hate, this sheikh having a luxury boat docked at the quays of the Seine in the heart of Paris. Neeson moves into action mode, rushes to Paris, knowing he has only 96 hours to save his daughter before she vanishes forever. 'I have special skills', he says, and that's for sure. He starts tearing Paris apart, kills lots of disgusting Albanian gangsters (can't somebody do that for real, please?), and is generally unstoppable. Nor can we catch our breath, what with all the emergencies, chases, fights, murders, and fantastic tension. Neeson is brilliant at this role, giving us the impression he was born with an automatic in his hand and held his mother at gunpoint demanding his first suck. This is a very, very exciting movie. It is also incredibly horrifying, because the extended cut on the DVD shows all the young girls lying drugged on beds in rows, with men queuing up to rape them after buying tickets! Alas, I fear this all really goes on, but without Neesons to stop it. The ultimate organiser of the high-level sales of girls to sheikhs is a suave member of Paris society who lives in a huge mansion with parties for hundreds of people but with kidnapped girls being sold at auction in the basement while unknowing socialites drink their champagne upstairs. This theme must have come from co-writer Luc Besson, who is well aware of the rotten state of much of the French power elite. Indeed, French political and commercial corruption is an increasingly urgent theme in films made or written by French cinema makers these days, as 'Tell No One' showed so powerfully (see my review of 'Ne le Dit à Personne'). You have to be strong to see the extended cut of this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Disturbing, Yet Shockingly Enjoyable","Well, I don't really know what to say about this movie. It was very different, I can say that. I got it on DVD recently and watched it the next day, and enjoyed it very much. I mean, by different, I don't mean it was bad, but it was a little disturbing. I'll start out with the general comments, like I almost always do. Liam Neeson played a believable dad, searching for his daughter, and played the role very well. Interesting fact, he was a dad, he was close to the age of the man he was playing, and that's where he got his motivation for the movie. Famke Janssen did a great job as Lenore, the annoying, pushy, and not very likable mother of Kim Mills (Neeson's daughter). Maggie Grace did an astounding job as Kim Mills, the girl that is abducted. SInce those are the main characters, all I can say is the acting by the rest of the actors is very good, take my word for it. The special effects and action scenes were also very well executed. They were very real looking throughout the movie, and added a high level of intensity to the film, not that it needed it. The whole film was intense and full of action, but I'm talking about the scenes where there are tons of explosions on a high scale. Specific comments, I will say now. This movie is a stark realization of how disgusting the world truly is. Saying that because, this really happens! Some people I know's greatest fear is exactly what happened in the movie. I can say, if this happened to me, I would be deeply scarred for the rest of my life. How about you? Pierre Morel, (is that how you spell it?) did a wonderful job directing this movie, and even better, he doesn't speak any English making an American movie. SKILLS! Anyway, if you are squeamish or easily disturbed, do yourself a favor and not watch this movie. If you aren't and have a liking for great movies, then go ahead and watch it, I recommend it very strongly to you. This was a great movie and will watch it again sometime, and enjoy it again.

An action junkies fantasy,"""Taken"" - wherein a repentant father, played by Liam Neeson, is now trying to be involved in his daughter's life after many years of working as a kind of fixer in various shadowy government agencies - is abruptly forced to draw upon his numerous talents that generally involve very efficiently killing people when that daughter is ""Taken"" by Albanian flesh merchants at the beginning of her trip to Paris.""Taken"" might be considered a revenge fetishists' delight, but it is also something relatable to fathers (and moms too) who would not hesitate at all to do anything that was required to save their children. Though I clearly lack the hand-to-hand combat skills Neeson portrays in ""Taken,"" as a father of three daughters I can quite easily relate to the drive and determination to do whatever it takes (no matter what) to go and save his daughter before she is literally lost forever to a perverse underworld of well-heeled, creepy sheikhs.Breakneck-paced from start-to-finish ""Taken"" does not let down in the action and violence department. Neeson leaves many bodies in his wake as he tears, literally, through Paris, to get to the men who took his daughter. Brutal and decisive, Neeson is a machine, nearly maniacal in his single-minded pursuit to get to his daughter, no matter the cost.Stylish and pretty, though somewhat muted (more ""real"" according to the extras on the DVD) Paris is the beautiful backdrop to the horrific underworld enterprise goings on. Penned by the great French auteur Luc Besson and helmed by a French director, Phillip Morel, the film does have a certain ""foreign"" feel and in fact was released in France before the US. Morel's history as a Director of Photography also gives the visuals their refined but also slightly gritty, rain-slicked feel.While stylish and essentially perfectly composed as an action movie, ""Taken"" has no great message other than to say: Don't mess with my daughter, pal. It might serve to make us dads feel quite inadequate as protectors of our children. Don't know about you but I wouldn't feel comfortable stepping into a room of 7 Albanian criminals and waxing them all. In two moves I'd be dead meat.Regardless, ""Taken"" is quite enjoyable, a full-throated action film, and wonderful to watch Liam Neeson in action.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
An American in Paris,A big enough success to warrant two sequels and provide Liam Neeson with his very own franchise.Did it perhaps appeal to some deep-seated yearning American parents felt at witnessing the spectacle of a lubrious middle-aged father with very particular skills consistently being proved right - despite occasionally making the most outrageous assumptions - while his sanctimonious ex-wife and dizzy teenaged daughter are always proved wrong?

Gripping and Realistic,"Taken (2008) is a film that really grabs your attention and doesn't let go, earning a solid 8/10 from me. The story is incredibly gripping it's the kind of plot that sticks with you long after the movie ends. The concept of a father relentlessly pursuing his kidnapped daughter is both thrilling and emotionally resonant, making for an intense cinematic experience.What makes Taken particularly compelling is how it taps into real-life fears. The idea that such terrifying events could and do happen adds a layer of authenticity to the movie. It's a scary thought, but it's this connection to reality that makes the film more than just a typical action thriller.The pacing of the movie is spot on it's fast, it's tense, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The action sequences are well-executed, and the sense of urgency never wanes. Liam Neeson's performance as a desperate father using his particular set of skills is both powerful and believable.

"I'll find you, and I'll rate you 8","Taken (also titled 96 Hours and The Hostage) is a 2008 English-language French action-thriller film written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, and directed by Pierre Morel. It stars Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Katie Cassidy, Leland Orser, and Holly Valance. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former CIA operative who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter Kim (Grace) and her best friend Amanda (Cassidy) after the two girls are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers while traveling in France during a vacation.Taken was a really good surprise. I was expecting a brain-dead action blockbuster but what I had was a good action-packed thriller with nice cinematography and a fairly lucid view on the situation of Paris nowadays.
As a Paris resident, I can tell you that the Albanian traffics are a real problem in this city and, even if it's hidden most of the time, it's slowly killing some districts. Taken shows a clear, un-PC view of what happens in the shadow. Liam Neeson plays an iconic character, he's helped by a beautiful photography highlighting some of the most beautiful roads of the French capital, especially in an awesome scene of chase near the end. Producted by Luc Besson, and far better than what he's directing nowadays, an effective movie who gave birth to a rather successful sequel and a fairly disappointing third opus.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Great Show!,"This show is fun, and the action is so real that I was so much taken aback. the pace is good and the humor is... cool! The movie depicted the love of a father where he will go all ways and means to rescue his beloved daughter (Child). I think the movie is trying to depict that love story between a father and daughter. it uses lots of 'cold' humor and action to cover that lovey-dovey stuff we see in dramas.I like every bit of the action, and Liam Neeson, although old, has that charisma to pull this one off pretty well. The ways the baddies are dealt with are with no-nonsense bang on their head, no second chances and I liked that style of action because it leaves no room for the bad-guys who will overthrow the good at the later part of the story.I watched it with my colleague and they said it's good.

I'm taken with Taken,"Yes, we've seen the Paris scenery many times before, with the likes of The French Connection, Ronin and more recently The Bourne Identity.Fortunately, we were saved the whole driving-the-wrong-way cliché they often throw in there, quite uselessly, as the French and Americans both drive on the wrong side of the road anyway!Yes, I freely admit that Taken takes a huge hunk of the slams and bangs from the aforementioned Bourne Identity.And yes, Taken is iterative rather than innovative — Liam Neeson paying the bills rather than aching for any accolades.But still, I find Taken to be an irresistible smash-and-grapple feel-good movie, up there with the surprisingly good Walking Tall — you really are rooting for Bryan, living every kick, crack, snap, shot, punch and grimacing, withering body blow.I have to wonder if Kim (played by Maggie Grace) could have been any more irritating, and any less convincing as a teenager. Probably not.Why did Bryan (Neeson) take the hair sample from the broken mirror? I've seen this film three times now and I don't recall him making use of the sample.Neeson does a Connery and fails to hide his thick accent, but scores points for at least trying.And the less said about the photo enhancement the better (you can't catch a reflection of yourself straight on when you're taking a photograph of someone else at an angle).All that aside, I really like Taken.

Probably one of the best action-thrillers,"Remove Liam Neeson's mind-blowing performance, this film would have been just another generic action thriller. Neeson completely defines this film and is exceedingly likable as a loving father who becomes a merciless killing machine when his daughter is kidnapped by human- traffickers. This may be typical save the kidnapped girl story, but the way it gives edge-of-seat thrills combined with well-oiled action its becomes highly engaging. The sharp dialogues with Neeson's deep voice add to the package. Who wouldn't like Neeson's ""I will find you and I will kill you"" dialogue? And the action sequence when he finally finds the bad guys is simply mind blowing. Another of my favorite scenes is when he makes his old friend realize that he has been sitting on desk so long that he has forgotten the difference between a loaded and an empty gun. The plot remains intensely focused on the father's pursuit to find his daughter without floating into unnecessary sub-plots. The only relevant and important characters where the father and daughter, and their relation is well established in first 20 minutes giving room for the audience to invest their emotions. The film also portrays the horrors of human-trafficking giving enough reason for rooting Neeson's character to find and kill all those bad guys. With well choreographed action, engaging soundtrack and slick camera work with power-packed Neeson Taken is a ride not to be missed. I have watched it 5 times now and it was exciting each time. I still remember the first time I saw it about 4 years ago and how it totally blew my mind!RATING: [4/5]",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Let's be honest here!,"I won't take anything away from the action-packed goodness of ""Taken."" No pun intended. This movie is right up there with ""Under Siege"" and ""No Way Out"" in terms of old-fashioned butt-kicking. But the plot? Please! Girl wants to go to Europe. Father (ex-mercenary) is worried off his rocker. Girl goes anyway. FIRST person she speaks to turns out to be a human trafficker and the girl gets sold into bondage. Father, of course, tracks down said trafficker and all his employers, right up to the top, and gets daughter back. Any of us who have been to 'the continent' will see this film as another ridiculous Hollywood example of how life in Europe really is. Does human trafficking go on? Of course and that is sad. But what are the chances that this girl gets kidnapped out of the million-or-so tourists traveling Europe at any given moment? It was a little dumb. They should have had the father not even know his kid was going. That would have made it a little more believable.I also loved how Liam Neeson kills hundreds of people, burns up building, blows up boats, etc and he returns to the States untouched to reunite his kid with her mother!

10/10 for shotgun editing style!,"Yeah - I read the other reviews where people are getting pedantic about the formulaic nature of the film or lack of moral/social commentary.However, I disagree and although thought the same within the first 10 minutes - washed-up father, dedicated his life to the job, loses family, ex-wife finds someone richer & better blah..blah. However, if you ignore the minor details - the first half-hour is the set-up and then it is straight into high-speed car chases, a bit of parkour, close contact combat, gunfights, drugs, trafficking, immigration, spying, almost no nudity(yes, you read that right) moral dilemma of being a parent etc. and then some more...I like Liam Neeson as an actor and was not fazed by his lack of distinct American accent - neither should you. He is no J. Bourne/Bond and he is not intended to be, no mystery - but his single-minded goal provides immense entertainment till the end and there is almost no let-up. There are plenty of languages thrown into the mix with the Paris backdrop, which no good euro-Besson flick would be complete without! A lot of action; if you had time to think - you are thinking waay too much.A really good movie to get your blood flowing. Personally, I feel the movie does have an ethical side - but, no need to get tetchy about the politics - as you don't even have to leave home, read the papers or possess a connection for that these days, it will come at you faster than you can say Frantic!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Thrilling with some flaws here and there but very good,"According to movies, Paris is not safe anymore on the first day you get there! First, kidnappers took Harrison Ford's wife in ""Frantic""; now they took Liam Neeson's daughter and her friend in the action thriller film ""Taken"", where both girls will be sold as prostitutes by Albanians slave traders. But instead of a vulnerable doctor like the one presented in Polanski's film, our hero is a former CIA agent with skillful tactics that goes to rescue his daughter from the evil.Among the favorable points of this film, besides a great performance by Neeson, is the way this father manages to save his daughter and the techniques he uses to track her last steps after being kidnapped. Small things that makes a total difference like hearing the traders conversations on the phone or even asking his daughter before she was taken to mention a few characteristics of these people (but this moment fails a little if one considers the impossibility of someone doing so since she was very distressed, and how come these guys show up without wearing masks which would make impossible their recognition?). Of course, some of these things are pure exaggeration but as long as the film played with some tension, nice action sequences and a solid drama involving human trafficking and all the desperation of the main character, we are thrilled with a above the average flick.A few things could be worked better or played more fairly and that is 1) the editing, because we need to know who is beating who. The fights are great, Neeson is very believable in doing all this and writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen provided to the main character lots of combat with Nagasu Do, a interesting and mixed martial art style, but the director, editor and the camera went all nuts and they wouldn't allow us to see precisely what was going on in key moments; 2) the cold-blooded character played by Neeson and his coldness didn't work at some moments, most notably where he shoots at a woman trying to discover where one of the traders were. This was something surprisingly strange to see it, didn't work so good, and this kind of implacability works better in a Bond film or a Schwarzenegger type of film (and ""Taken"" resembles ""Commando"" a little bit). It is comprehensible in the context used for this film, here's a desperate father trying to save his daughter in a short period of time, he did way worst to the guys who took her but for some reason this was too strange, and this woman wasn't even involved in the whole situation although her husband was.It might be an overdone and clichéd picture but it has a lot of good things to show, it's well made, well acted with a nice supporting cast with names like Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Jon Gries and Xander Berkeley, and the action is great. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Entertaining,"When his daughter is kidnapped abroad, a former CIA operative follows the trail of a sex trade ring and stops at nothing to find her.Taken walks the fine line between ""true action movie"" entertainment and a a grim thriller. The formula works although there are times when you wish director Morel had made a clear choice between the two.The movie starts well, establishing ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills as a flawed father with the best of intentions. And once his daughter is kidnapped (during a brilliant iconic scene involving a call between Mills and his daughter) the tension rises considerably. The action sequences impress early on and some people have compared them to the Bourne franchise.However, the body count starts to pile up at rate that is hard to swallow when the feel and tone of the movie seems like a thriller or procedural flick. This is not Die Hard or Lethal Weapon where you expect a fun romp filled with humor and extravagant scenes and yet, the movie cannot be viewed in a serious tone as Mills leave a huge trail of killing and destruction behind him.Likewise, the sex slave ring angle gives a grim tone to the entire movie but Taken never fully explores that aspect, keeping the movie fast and furious. The second half of the flick stretches the confine of realism but without ever becoming tongue-in-cheek. Liam Neeson is perfect as Mills but the rest of the cast sleepwalks through the film. Casting Maggie Grace (25 year old during filming) as Mills' 17 year old daughter is very questionable to me. So this is really a Neeson one-man show.All in all, this is packaged as a tense thriller but is really just a good old action movie where the plot does not make much sense. There is nothing wrong with that but, with a tighter plot and an extra 15 minutes of character development, it could have been an even better movie.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Great Action Movie!,"Taken is an action movie which really does justice to the genre—it avoids shallow Hollywood excesses (like ridiculous explosions, expensive cars, and half-naked women) and really focuses on creating a serious, moving piece of cinema. The premise itself is very simple and even conventional, but it works. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a former secret service agent, employs his highly developed set of skills to find and rescue his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who has been kidnapped and sold into the Albanian slave trade while on a visit to Europe.The film's premise is set up in what feels like the first ten minutes of the movie, and, while the background story and character development seem rushed, the intention is made clear: the movie is about the events that follow—about one man's unrelenting hunt both for his daughter and for revenge upon her kidnappers.Liam Neeson is a perfect cast for the role of Bryan Mills. He calm, stern, and almost dispassionate in the way he works, bitterly vowing to find and kill the kidnappers. It is clear from the outset that he is ruthlessly professional, a legacy of his training as a government spy. Every move made by Bryan Mills is cold and calculated, which means that the movie never drifts into cliché shootouts where one man infiltrates some warehouse and manages to evade the bullets of countless attackers. Instead the movie's writers respect the viewers' intelligence and opt for a more inventive plot which revolves around Bryan Mills abilities and deadly efficiency. Another point to be made about the writing is that—despite the one against hundreds odds—the viewer never has to suspend their disbelief. Never did I find myself saying ""yeah, right"" under my breath, and for that matter, neither did I find myself yelling at Bryan Mills or thinking how he could have done things differently. The plot is very, very believable.Credit must also be given to the director, Pierre Morel, in this regard. It comes as no surprise that the Morel has worked mostly as a cinematographer, as much of the action and fighting is realistic and almost palpable at times. The camera angles, the choreography, and even the sound effects have a gritty, arresting quality to them (in a way that surpasses the Bourne movies), and much of the directing is something foreign to big screen action flicks.What Taken accomplishes is the best kind of cinematic experience, with refreshingly believable fight sequences, a clever and engaging plot, and some great acting from Liam Neeson. While the movie's subject may be lacking in originality, it taken the best aspects of the action genre and reinvigorated them with a bold sense of realism.Written by Anton for www.overcranked.net",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Not too Shabby, Not Too Shabby At All.","In the long line of espionage/rouge-agents genre, you have varying qualities. Arguably one of the greatest may be the Bourne trilogies, which are in themselves films of very good caliber. Then you have the opposite end of the spectrum, such as the cliché crapfest that was ""Salt"". ""Taken"" manages to stand quite nicely amongst these films, above all else due to the presence of Liam Neeson. He plays a role we are familiar with, but Neeson never lets his audience down. His acting keeps the emotional aspect of the film intact, and fine I suppose Famke Janssen as well. I also highly enjoyed Oliver Rabourdin in the film. The movie's obvious focus is action, and it does this superbly. There are many well choreographed fight scenes and believe it or not they stay well within the walls of realism for the most part. The plot has a nice pace to it, and the uglier side of reality is seen throughout the film as it displays the gruesome nightmare of the sex slave industry.I recommend the extended version for more ass-kicking, and definitely catch this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Liam Neeson is a god.,"I have to say, I am in love. Liam Neeson is god. Taken is a fairly run of the mill action movie, utilizing several times the ""Bourne"" method of camera work during several action scenes. I'm sure you know, but I'll explain it to all the newbies out there (because I'm that popular already). Shaky, shaky camera, cutting back and forth between what's happening, seizure inducing, etc. Liam Neeson is Bryan Mills, a retired spy/secret agent/whatever goes on a kick ass rampage of anger and destruction in an effort to find his kidnapped daughter, who is being sold into the sex trade. It's fun in the beginning, seeing Bryan's goofy smile when he makes his daughter happy, and watching him trying to be a father figure in his daughter's life. But that all pales when you see the transformation from bumbling dad to Deathbringer 5000. The smile disappears, and that's the first indication that all you're going to be seeing from him from then on is lovely, face-breaking violence. One problem I did have was some of the things you're expected to believe, like how he was able to get the exact name and home town from a brief description by a frightened teenage girl and a few moments of Albanian speech. I could be wrong and this sort of thing happens all the time, but it just seemed silly to me. And the very end. They should have just stopped. But they didn't.

Will Hunt Them Down,"In my view, as far as action thriller revenge genre films are concerned this movie has almost everything, is well paced and delivers what it was set out to deliver.

"Mindless, but Well Made","Taken {dir. Pierre Morel, 2009} (**½/****)A mindless little thriller, but entertaining in its own right. It features Liam Neeson (good to see him back in leading film roles) as an ex- C.I.A. Agent. Neeson daughter is kidnapped whilst vacationing with a friend in France and it falls to Neeson to get her back. The film's best scene comes early with Neeson addressing the kidnappers over the phone, and warning them that they are unaware of with whom they are messing. He, of course, phrases it differently and speaks with a steely reserve that is quite effective. Neeson is very good, but overall Taken is too mindless, to violent and too xenophobic to truly recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
A never stopping father looking her daughter,"This a really pursuable thriller where Neeson destroys every bad man opposing him. Neeson plays a former Central Intelligence Agency operative who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter after she is kidnapped by slave traders while traveling in Europe.From the filmography view, this movie is very amusing and fantastic with a good idea.Seeing the movie, some questions arises: 1) How wonderful skilled Neeson is that finds the Albanian kidnappers quickly and more important 2) He has the right to kill all the bad men confronting him even the buyer of the slaves (including her daughter), 3) Killing a lot of people in France, he returns home without any problem and 4) all the people in France including the Albanian mafia speak in English!!!!.Totally I strongly propose this movie to see to all!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
A streamlined dose of adrenaline. Too bad they had to make sequels.,"The Taken series has been done to death, memed out to glory and mined for market value a million times over since the first film came out way back in 2008, which has somewhat dimmed the charm of that original vehicle, at least for some of us. Like, how many times can Liam Neeson or his relatives be Taken before even they as characters realize that it couldn't be happening and that they're in a movie? Eventually the material unwittingly spoofs it's origin in its need to repeat itself time and again. That's not to say the first isn't enjoyable on it's own, in fact it's quite the streamlined little dose of adrenaline that essentially coasts on some great pacing, neat choreography and the endlessly watchable Liam Neeson, whose career took a shot of nitrous to the heart after gamely stepping into the well worn shoes of the grizzled action hero. This was him nimbly ducking through the genre boundaries that his career was in up til that point, and the action thing fit him like a glove. The film is at its best when it follows Bryan Mills (Neeson) in action, which thankfully is most of the time. Mills is an ex CIA spook with some tactics that will seriously put a hurtin' on you if you cross him in any way. A gaggle of moronic Bosnian human traffickers come under the receiving end of these tactics when they kidnap his vacationing daughter (Maggie Grace, looking suspiciously like she's a decade older than her character is supposed to be) from Paris and auctioning her off to rich raghead perverts. This propels him into like an hour of non stop energetic ass kicking that is so fun to watch, as he shoots, stabs, sprains and splatters his way through hordes of eastern European cannon fodder, with not a second to spare for even the utterance of a single cheesy one liner. He's assisted via Bluetooth by his three ex agency barbecue buddies (Jon Gries, Leland Orser and David Warshofsky) and has a few encounters with his jaded ex wife (Famke Janssen). And that's about it, but Neeson sells the bare minimum as far as the genre goes with his effortless cool and stony, formidable stature that springs into startlingly spry motion every time he has to dispatch a new troupe of Slavic wise guys. If only they didn't have to desecrate this little piece of lightning in a bottle with two sequels that dampen the momentum with cheap attempts at thrills, I may still feel strongly about this one as I did when it first came out. Hopefully they quit while they're ahead, shirk the slimy dollar signs and let their first outing age in peace.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Amazing movie!,"Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, ""Taken"" is an action-packed film that takes place in the U.S. The daughter of an Ex-CIA agent—portrayed by Liam Neeson—takes a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda. After arriving from the airport, the two girls share a taxi with a random stranger. This proves to be the beginning of the action as the stranger overhears that the girl are staying in a home by themselves. She gets kidnapped by an Albanian gang of human traffickers kidnaps the girls using information about them being alone in Paris. After an intense phone call with her kidnappers, the father then realizes that he must to travel to Europe to save his daughter. The movie is full of action whether it is car chase, yacht chase, or the immense amount of hand to hand combat, the movie never fails to maintain your intention. The viewer gets a close up view the CIA-style of investigation and problem-solving skills.One of the most interesting scenes of the movie also doubles as one of the most crucial scenes as well. Liam Neeson's voice alone can make any paragraph sound like a well-planned out and intricate threat. So when Liam Neeson gives his calm yet intense the viewer because so immersed in the scene that you would want to pick up the phone yourself and reply. During the short phone call with his daughter's kidnappers, all Liam Neeson gets in return is a ""good luck."" These two words played a crucial role in the finding of his daughter. Using this phrase and CIA connections Liam Neeson is navigate his all over Europe and attempt to save his daughter.This movie is successfully designed to keep the view on their times the entire time. Taken is one of those rare movies that no matter how many times you watch it, you would never mind watching again. This action-packed movies has got it all; suspense, thrill, twist and turns, car chases, gun fights, multiple opponent hand to hand combat, ever thing that you would want to see in an Action film. You can never go wrong watching a film in which Liam Nesson plays that main or one of the more important characters in a film. The same remains for ""Taken"" As an amateur movie reviewer I can honestly say there was nothing I disliked about this movie. This movie obviously shouldn't be seen by children due to its adult content and subject matter.

Taken is a series of violent sequences in search of a plot,"In Taken, Liam Neeson plays an overprotective father with a violent past whose paranoia is proved right when his daughter is snatched while on a trip to Paris. Mere hours later he is on the ground in the French capital, determined to find his daughter and punish those responsible. What follows is a haphazard series of fights, interrogations, car chases, more fights, several smashed windpipes and an ending totally at odds with the film which preceded it.The action should have been harsh and brutal and while it is sometimes effective it is crippled by being framed too close and by the PG-13 rating. Who thought that a film dealing with violent revenge, dozens of deaths, torture and prostitution rings should be watched by people in their early teens?Taken is all the more disappointing given the talent behind the camera. Luc Besson may not always come up with masterpieces when he's credited as a writer, but he can usually be relied on to churn out something that is fast paced and fun (Unleashed, The Transporter, etc). Likewise the director, Pierre Morrell was last responsible for the ridiculous but exhilarating free running action of District 13. Yet together they have managed to come up with one of the most underwhelming action films in recent memory. As for Neeson, he handles the few emotional scenes with his usual impressive restraint and, with his size and reach, looks like he might actually pack quite a punch in real life. But when the action pulls out a little and he's forced to run or throw himself through the air to avoid a hail of gunfire his 6'4"" frame just looks unwieldy and slow  essentially a really big, easy to hit target. There are also endless moments where Neeson suddenly appears behind another nondescript soon-to-be-corpse which always made me wonder what magic massive closet he had found to hide himself in. He is fine when he's hitting things and emoting but I think his career as an action star will be rather short lived.I wanted to like Taken. It had potential as a gritty revenge film with the realistic action so popular since the advent of the Bourne series. Neeson is always a likable lead and the Besson pedigree with the French setting should have worked in its' favour. Unfortunately, the weakness of the story and random, unmotivated nature of the violence is simply boring, the potential wasted. Taken also shoots itself in the foot with its choice of subject matter. By delving into the subject of kidnapping tourists for prostitution it appears as though initially Morrell and Besson have some moral lesson for their audience. It soon becomes clear that they were merely looking for a backdrop for the action and the ugly stereotyping of the Eastern European characters in the film is irresponsible, even for a film of this type. Also, for a film rated suitable for young people, the lessons imparted by the hero are less than reassuring  if something bad happens to someone you love you really have no option but to kill dozens of people mercilessly until you reach some kind of resolution. This is fundamentally at odds with the initial plot of the film, as Neeson is trying to leave his past behind in an attempt to reconnect with his teenaged daughter (played with vapid gawkiness by Maggie Grace  proving her vacuous performance in Lost was not an accident). I'm not suggesting every film should have a blatant message of peace and love and there's no denying that nihilism can be cool but when it is taken to this level it has an effect on the overall coherence of the film.Disappointing and bland, if this film was kidnapped in a foreign country I'd leave it there.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
Taken to a new level,"In Taken Neeson proves himself a true action hero as he fights his way across Europe to save his daughter in this action packed thriller. I must admit I wasn't entirely sure how good the film would be, I'd read a couple reviews but still wasn't sure about Neeson taking (ha, ha) the lead role as an action hero. Let me say now that all uncertainty is now well and truly gone. Taken is a truly excellent action thriller with Neeson giving a great performance in a role I could best describe as James Bond if he was retired with a family. The action never let's up and is pushed forward by a more compelling motive than most films of it's type as a father races to save his daughter, stopping at nothing to get her back. With certainty I can say that Taken was a pleasant surprise and a most definite hit for me, a hearty recommendation for a more unique action thriller then I have seen in a good while.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Neeson is the perfect fit for a revenge thriller long overdue,"""Taken"" only begs one question: Why did it take producers this long to give Liam Neeson his own revenge thriller? OK, there was Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"" in 1990, a cult favorite before Neeson rose to fame, but the Irish actor who seems to age like fine wine has dished it to baddies in 18th Century Scotland (""Rob Roy""), a galaxy far, far away (""Star Wars: Episode I""), during the Crusades (""Kingdom of Heaven"") and dare I say WWII Germany? So what took so long for him to be a modern day retired CIA agent?""Taken"" and Neeson belong together. Neeson has always well-played the wise mentor role that draws respect from all other characters in the films he's in and the audiences. He's a natural fit to play an older man still capable of laying a beat down on amoral criminals, particularly of the European trash variety. ""Taken"" is a simple but genius vehicle to deliver that.Written in part by Luc Besson, whose films (""Leon: The Professional"") have only gotten more commercial with age (""The Transporter"" and sequels), ""Taken"" tells the simple story of former CIA agent Bryan Mills, who retires in order to make up for lost time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace from early ""Lost""), a relationship destroyed by Bryan's never being around. When Kim goes to spend the summer in Paris, her overprotective father calls her right when she gets there, convenient timing considering she's about to be kidnapped. Bryan vows revenge on the kidnapper and flies to Paris, using his incredible wealth of skills to track her down and make her captors pay.Besson gives us another action/revenge story motivated by love. The father/daughter connection can never be exploited enough considering it guarantees our utmost sympathies. It also makes the hard-nosed ""don't mess with me"" attitude of Neeson on his revenge spree all the more crucial in our minds. ""Taken"" never has a dull moment because we're behind Neeson 100 percent and love every move he makes.Sure, ""Taken"" could go much deeper. It's sort of just assumed that part of Neeson's motivation is to prove to his daughter how much he cares, but that never actually crosses our minds thanks to anything that's in the script or that director Pierre Morel does. It also couldn't hurt to make Bryan a bit more conflicted; give us some sense that he's not exactly a paragon of justice, something that would make ""Taken"" come more from the head and a tad less from the fists. Instead, the movie happily enjoys the fact that it's plot, motivation, action and force of an actor in Neeson will win over the audience. And it definitely does.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Great emotion and topic; weak film technique,"So i went to see this movie with my friend, hearing beforehand that it was going to be more than any other action movie. So true!

There are scenes that you will watch and burn with rage at the appalling business that the antagonists are engaged in. Your eyes will widen and your spine will chill faster than you thought possible at the action's thrills and surprises.I had some issues with this movie, though. The cinematography is not up to par with many movies i've seen. There are several action scenes that are missing a huge chunk of quality. Pierre Morel fails to take advantage of the camera's ability to enhance the emotion and give the audience a blow-away experience. He makes the same mistake with the editing and the sound mixing. Timing kills certain pieces of the movie that could have turned out incredible.I will admit, though, Neeson does a darn good job with his character in this film. His character is both brutal and loving, a hard-trained killer spy and a real genuine father at the same time, something i have barely ever seen from any other actor in any other movie.Go see this for the subject matter and the acting.

It treats its antagonist with disdain, catching us off guard by dispatching them at an unexpected moment.Secondly, there's Mr. Neeson. Despite his portrayal in action roles verging on caricature, here he exudes a presence that commands attention.

Taken is a 2008 action/crime drama directed by Pierre Morel that shows you exactly what happens to you when you kidnap Brian Mills' (read: Liam Neeson's) seventeen year-old daughter, played by Maggie Grace during her vacation abroad to Paris with her nineteen year-old friend Amanda, played by Katie Cassidy. This thrilling tale of a father's complete and utter devotion to his daughter will captivate audiences as they witness his genius yet violent quest to rescue his daughter from human traffickers.After Brian Millis retires from his job as a CIA agent doing bodyguard work, he moves to California to be with his daughter, Kim, who he barely saw when she was growing up. Now as a seventeen year-old, Kim and her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) convince Millis to allow her out of the country for what he thinks is a multiple week stay in Paris with Kim's friend Amanda and Amanda's family from Paris. Too late Millis finds out that Kim's trip is actually a Europe-wide tour of the band U2. Shortly after arriving at the airport, the two teens meet a friendly, handsome man who finds out where they are staying and invites them to a party. Unfortunately for the girls, there never is any party. Within fifteen minutes of getting to their cousin's apartment (who actually are away at the time) a bunch of thugs break in and kidnap Amanda and head for Kim. Fortunately, Brian is on the phone with her at the time, so he hears the whole thing and begins his trek to find his daughter.Liam Neeson definitely plays his role well. His character becomes this one-track mind Terminator-style character that stops at nothing to find his daughter. The movie goes into great detail of explaining that she is the only aspect of life he cares for anymore, so his focused and vengeant personality reflects this deep paternal care as he struggles to find his daughter deep in the heart of Paris.I really enjoyed this film. It is definitely focused on an older crowd; not only is violence a heavy emphasis, the theme of a father caring this much about his daughter will definitely strike a chord in more parents than teens. The premise of an ex-CIA using his skills to save his daughter is believable and is really cool too. The action scenes are also very crisp. Each one shows Neeson as a careful and calculated killer who is able to take down any man due to his CIA training. Overall, I'd rate Taken a 9/10. While the scenery could have been better, the plot and Neeson's character more than make up for this shortcoming.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Killing Good,"In 2008 this fine thrilling action experience hit me out of nowhere: Taken belongs like John Wick and The Equalizer to the new top movies of the action genre. Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast are top, the production too, the story is simple but effective. The sequels are good too but the first one is the real deal.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Junior Bourne,"The Bourne series appears to have rejuvenated the whole action-movie genre (even infecting the Bond franchise), in my opinion mostly for the better, with white-knuckle-ride thrills, conviction acting and contemporary settings now the norm where once there was Willis / Schwarzenegger cartoon excess. I know which I prefer as I say. This kidnap thriller certainly borrows heavily from the Bourne template, (not to mention Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"", from an earlier era and even recent French thriller ""Tell No One"") with Liam Neeson metamorphosing from a seemingly ordinary average doting father into a driven, clinical but of course resourceful killing machine to rescue his teenage daughter from Algerian abductors in Paris. The film did though for me take a little too long to get going and suffers somewhat from too much sentimentality (of all things) particularly in the mawkish scenes between Neeson, his estranged wife, now a rich-man's plaything and their spoilt 17 year-old daughter. Disbelief suitably suspended though, Neeson incredibly tracks her down pretty much from scratch to a girl-trafficking syndicate where drugged-up teenagers are bid for in an eerily abhorrent ""auction"" by respectable-seeming businessmen, his character unsurprisingly racking up car-wrecks and body-count a-plenty. ""The Searchers"" it isn't and Neeson basically has to carry the film as he's by far the biggest name on board here but he certainly convinces as the expert retired intelligence operative, who snaps back into the groove under extreme provocation. The rest of the acting's nothing to write home about however and I feel the film could have benefited with better support and also by building up the Mr Big character a bit more as Neeson's nemesis. I also felt some of the action sequences were tricky to follow and fully engage with as the backgrounds were often unnecessarily dark and afflicted by a sort of staccato, stop-start camera style. The best action sequences in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", by contrast flow naturally in a sort of heightened real-time and often in broad daylight. For all its plagiarism however and other defects I've mentioned above, this was still a watchable almost-all-action movie for a Saturday night.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"One of the best Liam Neeson action, drama films","When I first saw this film back in 2008 it blew me away. The action, the story, the drama, the suspense. Would he get his daughter back yes or no? Unlike a lot of Hollywood films nowadays this film had stakes and it felt like Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) could fail his mission, I loved it.The acting is great, the action is great, the cinematography is great, and the choreography is great. Taken was my favorite action, drama film for the longest time until of course John Wick hit cinemas and changed the action genre forever.Admittedly the story is basic but Neeson carries this film on his giant back, it's a wonder he didn't need back surgery upon the completion of making this film.At the end of the day it's a classic Neeson action film and even after 14 years it still holds up.IMDb: 8/10

Let me talk to those who don't like action films...,"Yes that's usually me. But there are some stand outs like Die Hard and Speed. But for some reason I never wanted to see this and have just done so for the first time in February 2025! Why so long? I'm wondering too, I think I got a wrong impression of too violent, too cliche; but hey cliche isn't that bad that's why they are done because, if done right, they enhance a film, and this is definitely the case with Taken. And dare I say it's a good violence - in the fact it is limited blood, no limbs being cut off or eyes gouged! Just the kind that resembled more the tv shows in the 60s and that of the great James Bond years also in the 60s!In other words you don't have to worry about not enjoying this film even if you're not a super fan of the genre! For so long Taken was hijacked by the great .... Set of skills ... speech by Liam. That it's both a barrier to wanting to see anymore and a contribution to those who only talked about and showed this clip, that I never actually knew what the whole story was about. And in fact was under the impression that you never do find out about him or the reasons behind the taken part. But you do and there is a back story, and great plotting and heart, along with the usual and fantastic suspense. So if you're like me and haven't seen it yet - do yourself a favour and get yourself a 'particular set of skills'!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Exciting & Violent Action at it's Best,If you like very violent action movies with an invincible hero then they don't come any better than this.

Taken Better Than Expected,"I saw Taken not expecting much just another routine action movie but it was better than expected. Liam Neeson does a great job as Bryan Mills a former ""preventer"" spy who retired so he can be closer to his daughter and make up for time he lost with her. Mills quickly finds himself in a race against time to save his kidnapped daughter whose been sold into a sex slave trade in Paris. Neeson continues to show his skills as an actor especially in the action/fight sequences. With movies like Rob Roy, Schindliers List, Batman Begins, and Seraphim Falls, Neeson continues to show his talent as an actor in Taken. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Maggie Grace, Leland Orser, Xander Berkely, and Famke Janssen in a brief cameo appearance. The movie does have some intense action and fist fights that are well executed as Neeson's Mills wages a one man war against the men who have taken his daughter in order to save her from a terrible fate. Director Pierre Morel did a great job of making Taken more than just your routine action movie. At the heart of the film is a story about a father's love for his daughter and how far he'd be willing to go to save her. Morel keeps that story at the center while giving audiences some cool action sequences for guilty pleasure. If you're a fan of these type of movies. Then you'll also enjoy Taken. With just enough action, suspense, thrills, and some surprises Taken is sure to please anyone looking for a good movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Good action flick but no more than that,"What can I say, one great ride! Taken was a surprisingly good movie.I mean I knew Pierre Morel's talent, but surely didn't expect it to be so accurate.The story tough completely unoriginal and predictable, is captivating from one end to the other. We have many energetic action moments, but very few intelligent and creative ones. To say it with few words : intense action, few surprises.Liam Neeson was what I call: the main event, because I've always looked at him like an icon of caring and mildness. This time is just as lethal as an AK-47, or M16 the American version of AK-47 :) Didn't care too much about the girl, I almost wanted her dead , she was annoyingly stupid, too stupid if you ask me.Taken, however doesn't intend to be extravagant, it sticks to the point ant that is very important for me. Better simple and good, than one complicated, ""inteligent"" mess. That doesn't men i wouldn't have appreciated some depth in this plot. It may just have filled the gap.I'd like to add that I've appreciated the authenticity of this title, the European scent was obvious since the image of human trafficking was kept unaltered.All in all Taken was a simple action film, which will please almost any fan of the genre. I recommend it to those who seek for fast action thrills.I liked it even if it has some flaws. I therefore rate this title a ***1/2 out of *****",7.0,Anonymous,Action
As fast paced as a Lamborghini....U never wanna see the race end,"Now let me be very clear about this.I am a super-freak fan of action thrillers n this movie sit right at the top of the lot.It is action packed to the core n has a pretty good script as well which gives a humane n heart-rendering account of the very burgeoning problem of human trafficking.Liam Neeson , I must say has done a real fine job.He has played the character with many shades in the most perfect manner which probably none of the the actors would fit into in such a sublime manner.He is a caring father,has been a good servant for his country,n is the Ex-CIA operative who is still pretty good at what he used to do.His composure to think with a clear head in even in darkest situations is what sets him apart n not to forget his superhuman effort in the process of freeing his daughter from the hands of a very highly connected human trafficking gang.The action sequences of the movie are pretty awesome n not over the top but believable to a greater extent.The city has been used as a good backdrop to the fast paced story.It is a very true to its genre of ""action thriller"" n will surely grant u what u want from a film of this genre.And to round it off i am sure the movie can boast of the famous line ""LET ME ENTERTAIN YOU"".",9.0,Anonymous,Action
For Paunchy Fathers Everywhere...,"This is one of those films you enjoy even though you know it's slick and glossy and totally dumb. It contains nothing original, has trite dialogue, an indefensibly heavy dependence on coincidence and luck, narrative signposts that a visually impaired simpleton wearing a blindfold could read in the middle of a blackout, and super-heroic antics from an ageing leading man that in reality would have him reaching for a comfy chair for a sit down within five minutes of the chase beginning. And yet the film's action sequences are so well-staged that they somehow manage to hold it all together and stop you from reaching for the stop button on your remote.Liam Neeson plays a prematurely retired government agent. He's one of those amiable but secretive men who never tell their family what it is that he really does, choosing instead to lend himself an air of mystery by explaining that he was a 'preventer,' i.e. someone who prevented bad things from happening. He tells this to his virginal teen daughter which is when you first suspect that the writer isn't just aiming for the usual 17-24 demographic here but is also reaching out to every pot-bellied, slouch-shouldered, balding middle-aged dad who has seen their life pass them by but who console themselves with the fact that they've at least raised some reasonably decent kids (even though they feel totally alienated from them and probably don't know where they are or what they're doing 85% of the time).Anyway, against his better judgment, Liam allows his daughter to go on a holiday to Paris with her best friend and, wouldn't you know it, they go and get themselves kidnapped by a gang of Albanians. Typical. You let them out of your sight for five minutes. At least that's one good thing about the dispensing of barriers in Europe: us Brits, so long the villainous figure of Hollywood flicks, have now been usurped by the East European.Neeson calls on his security pals for help and, using only a few seconds of taped conversation, a small piece of string and an empty Fairy Liquid bottle, they are able to identify not only the ring leader of the gang but where he used to live. Personally, I'd have shelled out for mates like that to come with me to Paris, but Liam's made of sterner stuff and flies out on his own. And within something like two-and-a-half minutes of arriving in Paris he's on the trail of the young dude who groomed the girls for abduction.OK, so this film isn't really to be taken seriously, even though it doesn't really seem to have much of a sense of humour about itself. Like most films of this genre, if there is any obstacle to the logic or progression of the story it is either ignored completely or summarily dispensed with through the use of a throwaway line. That's why nobody thinks to tell the parents of the second girl that their little precious has just become a statistic in the human trafficking/sexual slavery figures. And it's why nobody in Paris has noticed that lithe young female tourists to the city are regularly disappearing within hours of getting off their planes. It's why Neeson has no trouble making himself understood in a foreign country, and why every Albanian gangster in Paris has an excellent grasp and command of the English language. It's why Neeson can identify his daughter's spotter through a hazy reflection of him taking her photograph on her mobile phone. And it's why a drunken and drugged girl can remember the name of the street in which she was imprisoned as her captors turn her into a junkie ready to turn onto the streets.And the reason I highlight all these weaknesses, inconsistencies and flaws of the film isn't so much to damn it as to emphasise how surprising it is that I managed to enjoy so much of what was going on. The action scenes are the kind of highly-charged, adrenaline-pumping set-pieces that sometimes have you forgetting to breath, and the makers are canny enough to know that this is where the real strength of the film lies. Because when you strip the story down to its bare essentials – innocent young heroine plucked from the warmth and security of her family to become the plaything of a wealthy but villainous sheik – you're talking about a plot that was old in the 1920s. And Liam Neeson's hair-raising escapades and last-minute escapes are straight out of those old boys-own serials of the 30s.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Not a good movie at all !,"Well, with so many good opinions about the movie and a good rate, about 7.8 I think, at first I was thinking that I have seen a different movie from the other people in the forum! What I saw was a very mediocre one. It was fast and action-orientated but nothing to think about. 10 minutes after the end, there was nothing left in my memory. Only unnecessary violence, many slightly formulated racist references (the bad people, Albanian and Arabs mostly, kidnapping the innocent virgin damsel). What a crappy story, improbable and unlikely to be true!! Really, why a gang of pimps have to kidnap a probably wealthy pair of girls to make them prostitutes? They will probably bring troubles to them, as they did... So many dames, as it happens in reality, can be exploited from the poor countries in Europe and they chose the American Virgin.

"Bryan, a dedicated and brave father, uses his government agent skills to find his daughter and save her from the slave trade","How far will a man really go for his daughter? Taken is an action packed, high suspense, thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. This father is willing to cross oceans and destroy anyone in his way in order to say the one person he cares the most about, young Kim. Using pure skill and the ability to think fast and intelligently, Bryan keeps his cool and chases down a boat. Running through the streets keeping his daughter's location close in eye sights jumping in a car to catch up, and then fearlessly jumping off a bridge onto the moving boat to rescue his daughter, Bryan Mills is a true hero. Taken has many outstanding actors and actresses. The main character, father Bryan Mills, is played by the exceptional Liam Neeson. Kim, the daughter, is played by Maggie Grace. Other actors and actresses in the phenomenal movie are Famke Jensson, Jon Gries, Leland Orser, and Davis Warshofsky to name a few. The movie was director by Pierre Morel and came to theater January of 2009. Taken made 144.9 million and is looked at as a success by many. The underlying theme of Taken is human trafficking. Kim's parents are divorced and she wants to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda to follow a band tour. To keep the peace and gain his daughter's love, her biological father, Bryan, reluctantly agrees to let her go on her little adventure. Soon after Kim arrives in Paris she is faced with a traumatic experience and is kidnapped. Bryan was on the phone with her as he listened to his daughter fight and struggle and be taken away by criminal strangers. Bryan made it his mission to find his daughter and kill the men who took her and her friend. The rest of the movie was all about Bryan's journey to find Kim. Many plot twists were reveled and the ugly truth about sex trafficking is reveled. I would definitely recommend this movie. Many scenes and topics are not suitable for young children as it may seem scary and overwhelming at times but it is perfect for a mature audience. Taken is not only an awesome action packed, adventure filled, thriller but it also discusses trafficking as a very serious problem. Yes, this movie is Hollywood and many parts of it are very unrealistic but it still draws awareness to the cause and for that I would give it two thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
One of the Most Memorable Commercial Trailers Ever,"When this movie first came out, for weeks before its release, the Trailer of ""I have a particular set of skills.... I will find you..."" was being shown practically daily. It was probably one of the best marketed and advertised films of the early 21st century considering it didn't have any huge movie star names attached to it; yes Neesom is popular now, but back then he was only popular with an older audience from his 90's movies so to see him in a lead role in an action movie was odd and not a perfect match.How anyone into action movies wasn't compelled to watch this after the bombardment of commercials would be hard to believe. I couldn't wait to see this, but I waited until it was available for rent.Even though it is mostly cliched, the marketing and something special and different about it made it totally unique and able to stand on its own away from most action movies. Neesom just going around simply kicking butt with his skills to hunt down his daughter's kidnappers was fun and intense to watch. It's a modern classic spin on the revenge tale.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Don't be taken about what's been said about Taken,"""I will find you and I will kill you"", CIA retiree, Liam Neeson says resolutely to one of his daughter's kidnappers. We know he'll follow through on his promise too. It's great to see Liam back on the screen in this tailor made role, kicking butt, but really folks, this is an overrated movie. Neeson's a character you don't want to mess with and these Albanion scum have messed with his daughter. He's been trained to kill, and this is basically what he's gonna do to everyone involved here, one an old friend of Neesons. His daughter and her friend are vacationing in Paris or France, I'm not sure. Within hours of their arrival, where the friend has already met her Romeo, the two girls are snatched and are sold into a sex slavery, Grace's friend not so lucky. So it's Liam to the rescue, trawling the streets for his loved one and pulling some deadly moves on his oppressors. The auctioning scene near the end, where the girls, drugged, virtually walking zombies, are shown singularly into a room, first cloaked with a brides's gown as such, before it's whipped off, is the most fascinating as it's unforgettable. The bidders sit above in booths, a female V.O outlining the girl's assets, before starting with figures. Apparently Grace is the best import, so she's the last girl to be auctioned, not unless Liam has something to say about it. He sure knows how to break up a party. Taken to me wasn't anything special. It needed more input into it's story, if it's characters too. At least it ends, happily for Grace, back in the loving arms of her father. Some nice stunt work near it's gripping final. Holly Valance has a small role, doing what she does best. She's Grace's character's idol, who first tells Grace to not waste her time.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

since when did Liam Neeson become Rambo,"Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is referred to Rambo by some of his ex spy buddies in the beginning of the film. And as it turns out, he turns into a sort of Rambo later while trying to find his daughter. Neeson is not an action star, which was the main problem with this movie. It wasn't believable.Mills daughter, Kim, goes to Paris with a friend and gets kidnapped a few hours after arriving. It just so happens she is talking to her dad when the kidnappers strike. So Mills goes to Paris and all by himself he hunts down the Albanians and kills people left and right. Mills doesn't even ask any of his ex spy buddies to help out.Mills ex wife was the worst character. She lies to him to get him to sign the papers to let their daughter go; Plus she doesn't even seem concerned that her 17 year old daughter is going to Europe with one friend. Then when her daughter is kidnapped, she's not going nuts saying call the police. And the ending was terrible when Mills and Kim return home.

well acted role by Liam Neeson,"This is a straightforward action movie. For a guy who was already 55 when it was filmed, Liam comes across as pretty darn tough. I credit the camera work/editing and also the fight choreographer. They make Liam look well-trained and lethal - quick to kill without unnecessary effort. For an older man, he compares very well with the new James Bond persona - no-nonsense, gritty, deadly.The plot could have used a few more minutes of run time to solidify with some more development. There are too many convenient, lucky breaks - like finding his daughter's jacket, recovering a witness who remembers a key location, etc. - the usual shortcomings one must be willing to overlook to enjoy this kind of film.But on the whole it is a very satisfying movie with a high body count of easy-to-identify bad guys. Loads of action - the obligatory fast car scenes, but almost everything else involves killing. Lots of dead bad guys, realistically done - blood as necessary but no gratuitous gore.

Delivers on Action and Suspense,"Taken has been widely considered a great cinematic action film experience as it combines action and suspense and overall thrills from start to finish. Having seen the sequels before the original, one can agree that the original does live up to the hype and is massively more concise and arguably the best film of the franchise. Liam Neeson plays his role as one should and is convincing in the role, as well as the supporting cast of the daughter played by Maggie Grace and his ex-wife played by Famke Janssen. Another great thing about Taken is the length of the film, as we have seen many action films drag on with little subplots we do not care for, but with Taken the film isn't too long and every piece of screen time is vital. Overall, Taken delivers on what it should as an intense and thrilling action piece of art.

Short but fun revenge thriller. Neeson is awesome,"Having your child taken away from you is one of, if not the most, horrific thing that could ever happen to a parent. We would dread to think how we would react were this tragedy ever to befall us. This is the situation Liam Neeson finds himself in, in Taken. Neeson plays an ex spy who begrudgingly allows his 17 year old daughter to travel to France with a friend. His fears are confirmed when he finds out she has been abducted but, rather than let the authorities handle it, Neeson takes matters into his own hands and pursues the captors to deliver his own brand of justice.You would be forgiven for sneering at the idea of Neeson as an action hero but he excels in the role and is clearly having a lot of fun with it, despite the unsettling subject matter. Playing like a cross between James Bond and Jason Bourne, Neeson's take no prisoners style affords the viewer some immensely satisfying fistfights as he tears through the streets of Paris in search of his daughter.Were it not for the disturbing subject matter involving human trafficking of underage girls, Taken could be described as a dumb, fun action blockbuster. But with the seedy undercurrent running throughout, it's hard to cheer too loudly, despite the fact that a great number of despicable human beings get their just desserts. The scene in which Neeson hears his daughter being abducted over the phone is incredibly tense and unsettling, but it does set up the viewer for the brutal retribution that follows.There are some shortcomings, such as the failure to really explore the very real danger of human trafficking, and the end is wrapped up a little too neatly and abruptly. But these are minor quibbles which can be easily forgotten thanks to a great performance from Neeson and excellent fight choreography.A fast paced action movie which deals with a very serious issue in a rather glib and unfocused manner. Nevertheless, there are some fantastic set pieces and Neeson does a great job of generating sympathy in the viewer. Not bad for a guy who tortures someone by sticking electrified metal shards in their thighs.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

You don't have time to breath. It's true that it doesn't allow you to play with the movie cause it gives you no time to think. Don't look here for a psychological thriller cause is not. Is pure tension, action, suspense and high levels of adrenaline.Better than any ""Bourne"" movies, million times better than any ""007"" ones (at least for me). Make some popcorn, sit and relax (if you can). 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Grounded, Intentful and Smart","A very sensible and adult movie, 'Taken' is a masterpiece by director team up of Pierre Morel and Luc Besson.Liam Neeson's most prominent action role sees him take almost all the screentime and deliver a truly driven character. His hard approach is a sight to behold and he is given a straightforward complimentary screenplay. Additional credit to Olivier Rabourdin for his scummy and highly necessary character whom ties everything together.The action sequences are very well choreographed and at times breathtakingly tense; the ruggedness and roughness portrayed through brilliant sound mixing.The movie has magnificent flow and respect for the audience, and it's one of the best action movies ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Turn Off Your Brain and Embrace This Awesome Film,"The daughter on an ex-CIA agent is touring Europe with U2. Well, that idea ends quickly when she is abducted in Paris by the Albanian mafia, who want to get her hooked on drugs and sell her as a prostitute to the highest bidder. But they picked the wrong daughter to mess with!Okay, let me just say first of all that I do not know how this film got such high esteem from the voters. Yes, it's awesome, but critically it's pretty cheesy. The acting is nothing special and the situations are impossible. Anyone who has any basic understanding of technology or intelligence gathering is going to slam their head into the wall.But, if you ignore that, and just sit back and let the film take you, you're going to be amused. Liam Neeson kicks butt and shoots his way through Paris, doing everything he can to rescue his daughter because, for gosh sakes, he loves the little spoiled brat. And anyone who has ever loved will understand exactly how he feels... even if they don't have the resources necessary to kick as much booty.I'm not one who watches a lot of Bond or Bourne or action flicks in general... but I loved this one.

Hollywood XXX style.,"This film is terrible. Is this seriously the best tripe that Hollywood can create post Bourne. I'm sure Bond is lying awake terrified of Liam Neeson's American accent. This is well up there with Segal movies (apart from Under Siege), Transporter and XXX. Somebody please create an action movie with realism, plot and a character I actually care about, because taken has about as much substance as lets say...Green Street.Come on please, your telling me anyone can listen to a man on the phone and triangulate the location of his village just from his accent!

An excellent and poignant piece of cinema,"This is the first time I am writing a comment on IMDb and that's because this movie has compelled me to do so. This movie shows how a thriller should b paced. But more than anything I loved the way Liam Neeson has portrayed the role of a protective father. Being a father myself, I could feel the pain in his eyes. He completely overshadows everything and everyone in this movie. Absolutely breath-taking!! Another aspect of this movie that I loved is that it has its heart at the right place. Superb acting, pacing and very believable storyline make this a must watch.

Liam Neeson is immortal,"This movie filled my body with so much adrenaline, I almost decided to sign up for a marathon after watching it.

By using his honed skills, he does his utmost to track down the perpetrators and bring his daughter home. This movie has the major action requirements covered: lots of violence, no mercy, and adrenaline-infusing scenes. Liam Neeson is a great actor, and this movie adds to his repertoire! 93 minutes is all it takes for your adrenaline meter to go from naught to max!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
No one takes from Bryan Mills...,"I sat down to watch the 2008 movie ""Taken"" once again here in 2024, making it my third time to watch the movie since 2008.The storyline, as written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is nicely written, as it proves entertaining and enjoyable. And there is a great combination of action and good old fashioned crime thriller elements to the movie, and that is a combination that blends well together.Leading actor Liam Neeson is great in the movie, and ""Taken"" has definitely become one of his more iconic movies, all because of some lines delivered on a phone call. However, I will say that Liam Neeson really carries the movie quite well, and even at his age he is proving to be a great action star. ""Taken"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of established actors and actresses such as Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, Leland Orser and Jon Gries. The acting performances in the movie, by the entire cast ensemble, is good and the actors and actresses certainly put on good efforts to bring the characters and storyline to life on the screen.Of the entire ""Taken"" trilogy, this first movie in the franchise is undoubtedly the best movie, which is often the case in trilogies, isn't it?The action sequences in ""Taken"", and there are many of them, are quite nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, making the movie all the more enjoyable to sit through.If you enjoy action crime thrillers then director Pierre Morel definitely delivered quite a movie back in 2008 with ""Taken"". And it is a movie that is quite well-worth sitting down to watch. And it even is a movie that has enough contents to the storyline that it can be watched more than just once.My rating of ""Taken"" lands on a eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Retired, Not Dead","Greetings again from the darkness. Was actually looking forward to seeing Liam Neeson in an action movie ... especially one written by Luc Besson. Unfortunately, just didn't find this very believable, though the basis for the story is frightening and fascinating.Curious as to why 25 yr old Maggie Grace was cast as 17 yr old Kim. Aren't there any actresses available who actually look that age? Did enjoy the hyper-energetic, thrill seeking character of Amanda, played by David Cassidy's daughter Katie Cassidy.One of my pet peeves in action movies is when the hero can scrunch his shoulders a bit and turn his head while successfully dodging automatic gunfire. Liam would have been killed a few times, especially in the car and on the yacht.I did find Liam's character interesting because of his simmering passion toward the captors and those in his way. Reminded a bit of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Still, for a dad digging into the underworld to rescue his daughter, I'll take Paul Schrader's 1979 ""Hardcore"" with George C Scott. While nowhere near the one-man demolition team that Neeson is, Scott really captures the disgust that a dad would feel.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Exceptionally engaging,"This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang.""Taken"" has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it's full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout.

blam blam pow pow i wish liam neeson were my daddy too,"**CONTAINS NO MORE SPOILERS THAN IN A MAGAZINE REVIEW, BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE, DON'T READ**After listening in his cell phone, to the sound of his seventeen year old daughter being dragged away and brutally kidnapped by unknown brutes, the former Special Forces Agent Ryan (Liam Neeson) quietly waits until somebody picks up the phone. Then he says:""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""A few quiet seconds pass before a voice in the other end replies:""Good luck""If this sounds exciting to you, it's just the beginning. TAKEN is one of those rare gems in it's genre, a simple and wonderfully well crafted action movie where Liam Neeson plays previously mentioned ex-spy; a mediocre and somewhat pitiful man that while spending a career for his country, has been neglecting his family. Now, when the marriage is broken and the daughter already is seventeen, he bravely attempts good fatherhood, even though he barely knows who his daughter is these days, and even though the ex-wife hates him and has re-married with a rich square, who buys the daughter a horse as a sweet seventeen-gift.The whole shabang gets rolling when our anti-hero is forced to agree to his daughter going for a trip overseas to Paris with her best friend - even though Daddy (through paranoia, or supernatural knowledge about the future) sense trouble. The minute she sets foot in Paris she is abducted by horrible villains connected to the trafficking industry - and our friend Liam has to give up what he's bad at, buying birthday gifts, and start doing what he does best - knock off bad guys.Because, after that there's just one direction and that is full throttle, dead ahead. The revenge/rescue-action blows high in the sky - Neeson is undeniably great as a well dressed Rambo when he in one white knuckle sequence after another tracks down the big shot's bigger shot's biggest shot's even bigger shot, passing all limits of rage to stack up the bad guys in a body pile and bring back his daughter.Luc Besson had a finger in the screenplay, and you can tell. For one thing, the setup is beautifully done for it's genre, that James Cameron-ish formula where you as quick as possible set up the score (which takes about fifteen minutes) and then hit the pedal to the floor. But there is a human edge to the story too, many people have had complaints about the ""boring first part"" of the movie, but it serves a point. Neeson gets time enough to make a nice and believable portrait in the beginning, and that is why we like him through the rest of the movie, and that is also why we totally agree that his every act of violence is, well, ""justified"".Apart from that, there's no need to think too much in this movie - one great hold-on-to-your-adrenalin-scene follows another, it's the dark knight on a vendetta, bourne with balls, james bond not with a vodka martini but with a big damn scotch on the rocks - and when the 90 minutes suddenly have passed, you get that feeling you get when the roller-coaster ride has stopped - already over? Better get back in line, I mean jeez, we just have to do this one more time.No action fan alive can miss this film. There is one line in particular that concludes the experience: "".....We can nego""BOOM",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Liam Neeson in a Harrison Ford-style role,"Previously, the only ""Taken"" with which I was familiar was the TV miniseries executive produced by Steven Spielberg (focusing on extraterrestrials). If I had heard the plot of this movie and knew nothing else about it, I would probably have assumed that it stars Harrison Ford. What a surprise that Liam Neeson plays a former government agent searching for his kidnapped daughter, using rather aggressive tactics. Seriously, some of what he does just might count as torture.What I thought early on was that the one girl did incredibly stupid things when they arrived in Paris: giving a bunch of information to a stranger. This is only the second time that I've heard Albanian spoken (the first was in ""The Inside Man"", in which I learned how to pronounce Enver Hoxha's surname). Anyway, this ""Taken"" isn't the movie that I would recommend above all others, but it's OK for the length that it runs. Also starring Famke Janssen.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
I Was Very Taken With Taken,"Liam Neeson is currently enjoying an Indian summer of stardom, and it's all thanks to this movie. One he thought was going to go straight to DVD.Plot In A Paragraph: Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) a retired CIA agent, goes on a rampage across Europe, and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter Kate (Maggie Grace) who has been kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.Of course it's silly, unrealistic, and overly the top violent, but I enjoyed a lot of it. Liam Neeson is very good here, (somebody said to me ""why would someone like Liam Neeson wan to get himself involved in something as nasty and insane as that"" I disagree) and is most of the reason the movie works.If it was a Sly Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger type of action hero cast as Mills, you would have expected the violent action scenes that followed the kidnapping with the hero coming out unscathed. With Neeson, you never know what will happen. And his ""Certain set of skills"" speech would have appeared cheesy, corny and predictable.

Barbaric glorification of violence,"I checked IMDb before getting me the Blu-ray. It said 7.9, wow. So I was looking forward to watch a thrilling movie at home on a Friday night. But what did I get? Liam Neeson recently made some poor decisions concerning the characters he represented on the screen, I already thought he might be running out of money. Dumb stereotypes like the bitching ex-wife, her new of course old and rich husband, a retarded daughter of 17 who acts all the way like a 7 years old and the Neeson character himself, the ex-CIA torturer / killer, but therefor ridiculously enough all loving and righteous are totally insulting each educated public's intelligence. But even worse are all those cheap prejudices against people from the Balkan states or Arabia. Of course they are all criminals without exception and are invading countries that like to see themselves as the crown of civilization, which is nothing less than sheer fascism. Following this perspective it is only logical and without a shadow of a doubt allowed to kill each and every of these ""parasites"" in the most violent ways, which are all shown detailed to guarantee a most disgusting pleasure. Of course Liam Neeson being a deadly one man army with no scruples whatsoever kills an entire legion of these subhuman beings throughout the film, which finally presents us the most predictable and sugar-coated happy end. What have we been served? A trigger happy superior white man who blows away all the low life crooks from evil countries where everybody has a darker skin and can never be anything nothing more than woman trafficking cockroaches that need to be squashed as they deserve it. Again: this is only one thing: fascism on screen. Quo Vadis, Liam Neeson?",1.0,Anonymous,Action
taken,"Taken is an action thriller film which features the recognized action star, Liam Neeson as the father of Maggie Grace his 18 year old daughter who longs to travel to France, encouraged by her mother, Famke Janssen who is remarried to Maggie's stepfather, Xander Berkely. The start of the movie is set in America in 2009, until Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to France, where the remainder of the movie is set.Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former CIA agent who is struggling to come to terms with his divorce and is trying to keep a good relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim is a teenager and wants to travel to France with a friend from school. Kim's mom Lenore (Famke Janssen) is encouraging this trip along with Kim's wealthy stepfather Stuart (Xander Berkely) contrary to what Brain believes to be best for his daughter. After much convincing, Brian allows this trip to happen and gives Kim a plethora of safety precautions in order to stay safe. However, upon Kim's arrival in France, she and her friend take a taxi with a man who, once he finds out where they are staying, eventually comes back to kidnap them. During the kidnapping, Kim is on the phone to Brain, and he knows exactly how to handle this situation. Kim is brought into the human trafficking industry and Brian must bring back his previous CIA training in order to make it to his daughter before it is too late.A lot of this movie shows Brian using his special training to get to what he wants, his daughter Kim. The actions scenes keep the audience on their toes. One scene in particular where the filmmaking was crucial was in one of the final scenes where Brian comes face to face with a man who had purchased his daughter. In order to reach this man, Brian had to have many violent fights. The music was suspenseful and the sound effects made it seem extremely realistic. The fast paced camera switch ups between the villains and Brian also kept a high energy. When Brian finally made it to the man who was in control of his daughter, the suspense is extremely high. This energy is maintained by the suspenseful music and the gunshots exchanged in the fight.Taken was an action film that kept me guessing throughout the entirety of the movie. It was refreshing to see an action movie that stayed true to the plot without being predictable and was also based upon true events. Usually, I try to stay away from stereotypical action movies, but this one definitely captured my interest, kept me guessing and left me wanting more.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Predictable plot but extremely engaging...,"Very few action movies have a very strong emotional motive for the protagonist. The protagonist of ""Taken"" has a very strong emotional motive. He is after all trying to save his kidnapped daughter from a sex trafficking gang. The bad guys in ""Taken"" are lets say - pretty bad. They evoke no sympathy and it is a treat to see them smashed to pulp. Every blow, every bullet, every kick is slick, fast and if I can say so - extremely enjoyable. In Taken, it is fun to see someone really take on the bad guys and hand it to them in their own coin.The plot is pretty predictable. Bryan's(Liam Nesson) daughter is kidnapped by an Albanian sex trafficking gang in Paris. Bryan, a former CIA agent, goes on a no holds barred rescue mission to save his daughter. All hell breaks loose- that is -for the bad guys. The body count is pretty high - my guess is that it is more than 50. No prizes for predicting the finale - the bad guys pay dearly - real bad, I must say.The plot is not the highlight of the movie. The acting is good. Liam Nesson does a good job. This is often exactly the kind of role tailor made for Harrison Ford, but Liam Nesson does a neat job here. I am not a big fan of flash editing but it seems to work well in this movie. The action scenes like I said before are really good even though they are pretty violent.I would give a movie like this a 6 out of 10 but I am inclined to give this movie a 8 just for sheer edge of seat engrossing action.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"Terrible opening, but picks up, decent overall","Taken is a film that has been rather poorly received critically, but has been highly enjoyed by the majority of mass audiences, and it's not hard to see why. It definitely has its flaws, but keeps such a pace, at least after the opening act, that it's not challenging to watch and doesn't overstay its welcome. The movie boasts Liam Neeson; in a role dissimilar to anything I've seen him in, stars as an ex-spy and security detail agent named Bryan Mills, who goes on a committed rampage to find his kidnapped daughter.The film opens with some painfully generic exposition. We have a divorced father, who now only wants to get close with his daughter, whom he neglected earlier in life because he was always away on business. His ex-wife is still bitter about the amount of time her spent away from them, and obviously desires the preference of their daughter. The daughter, Kim, of course, now has a new step-dad, who provides her with a much larger house, gets her better presents, and earns the compassion of his daughter. Kim then asks Bryan if it is all right for her to go away to Paris with her friend. Bryan is torn because, with her gone, he won't be able to form a closer relationship, however, in saying no, Kim will only be angered with him, also making relationship matters worse. There's also the fact that he has seen many monstrosities in his line of work that he's scared of what could happen to his daughter if away, alone, in Paris. Mills begrudgingly agrees to let her go. This wouldn't have been as bad, if there weren't awkward and contrived subplots spliced in.When Kim departs for Paris, we are introduced to the next cardboard cutout character, her friend, Amanda, who plays the enthusiastic dumb blonde. The first thing they do upon arrival in Paris is trust an attractive Albanian fellow who they think not to question, because ""who cares, he's hot""- Amanda. Low and behold, he isn't the nicest guy, and the two of them are seized. Kim manages a quick call to Bryan, and, from there, Bryan is forced to follow a trail of clues in attempt of Kim's rescue. This opening 30 minutes is pretty much awful. It's all familiar, and not even familiarity done well. However, after the initial eye rolling, the film does pick-up.Once the film reaches the search, the viewer is treated with a relentlessly paced quest. The action rarely ceases, and, thankfully, the action is exciting and remains surprisingly grounded in reality, without being dull. As far as casting goes, Liam Neeson was the perfect choice for the role. He is believable both in the sense of compassionate father and focused action hero. Apart from one scene, the scene of the kidnap, he's pretty much spot-on the whole film. The supporting acting is surprisingly serviceable as well. Despite not being delivered much character to work with, I don't really have much to complain about, they all work well with what they have. Some on the one-scene actors are particularly impressive. I find, those doesn't often deliver as much emotion as someone in their place actually would, but the emotionally honestly of even the very small roles was well done.One problem with where the film goes after the introduction though is that it never really builds. The first action scene when Mills arrives in Paris is just as exciting as the climactic scene of the film. The film remains rather flat, without a real rising action. Another complaint is that I felt we didn't get inside the protagonists mind as much as we could have. For instance, at the scene of the kidnapping, we see it from Kim's point of view at the time, and then as Mills retraces it later. It would have been far more effective had we only been treated to Bryan's end of the conversation the first time, and then trace along with him. The viewer would be more involved with his character, and it would have made it less repetitive.Despite the film having some flaws after the opening, in certainly wasn't as bad as I feared while watching the opening act. I enjoyed watching Neeson in frenzy as he destroyed everyone in his path with cold and determined matter-of-factness. And while I can't give this film a hearty recommendation, I'm not going to warn to steer clear either. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

One of the best action thrillers I've seen and enjoyed again more than a decade later. I have a friend who doesn't usually care for action films and even she liked it.

Fun but predictable.,"Taken - Brian is divorced but still deeply loves his daughter. Consequently he's very protective of her, and doesn't want her to go to France. Brian relents and, sure enough, the daughter is kidnapped in France and he goes in to bust some heads and rescue her. Also along for the ride is Famke Janssen as the bitchy ex-wife Lenore, and that's about as much of a character as she gets.Look, there's not a whole lot in this film that has not been done before. Your taste for this is limited to how much you enjoy Liam Neeson knocking out, killing, or otherwise incapacitating 50 or 60 people. As unbelievable as that sounds...no strike it. It's just largely unbelievable. There are many things that are unbelievable in this film, such as killing so many people, in another country no less, with no repercussions. Also the various technological devices used to get Brian from points A to B to C border on magic. But the fights are so pretty and hard and fast.Liam Neeson does a decent turn as Brian. I love his attempt at an American accent. I hope it replaces Arnold's voice in popularity in the 21st century. It's hard to believe his able to go from mildly over-protective humble giant to Frank Castle in the course of a plane trip, but those who have lost family members in the past are free to dispute that. His willingness to put innocents in similar predicaments does him for favors in my eyes though.In the end we learn four crucial lessons from this: 1) Never go to a foreign country. 2) Foreign countries only want to sell our women for prostitution. 3) Over protective fathers are always right. and 4) A father's love for his daughter extends to using torture on others to ensure her safety. Why oh why do we have a film advertising torture days after a new president bans it's use? *sigh* I just had to laugh afterwards. All the film needed at the end was a ""This could happen to YOU!!!"" Fun, fast, simple-minded and hard-edged. Just don't go in expecting any life lessons whatsoever. B-",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Bowel Movement  Inducing,"After watching the first 20 minutes or so of this film, I seriously considered taking a walk. As mind-numbingly silly and atrocious as it is, I decided to wait in hopes of a single interesting thing to happen. What you get at the beginning is a borderline obsessive father who only thinks about his 17 year old daughter, a birthday party for said daughter who gets a freaking horse from her stepfather (a HORSE?!), an ungrateful ex-wife, and a Britney Spears wannabe.The daughter is the main reason this film is a turn-off. I don't doubt that Maggie Grace may be an adequate actress, but here she portrays such a dumb, childish, naive, annoying 17 year old with the mind of a 12 year old that perhaps it's the writing that is at fault. Just watch her run and jump clumsily with glee when she gets what she wants and you won't believe your eyes. It wouldn't be a spoiler to say that the movie has a happy ending (it's implied in the tag-line!), but I still found myself hoping for the worst for this pitiful, spoiled brat.When the film does ""start"", there are a few cool sequences involving Liam Neeson maintaining his cool as he breaks bones in search for his daughter. However, Daniel Craig's Bond he is not.Finally, I use the term ""happy ending"" loosely. Sure the girl is rescued, but what about the numerous others who are locked in the sex-trade industry? This film could have been so much more if it had portrayed some government initiative to bring it down, rather than the rescue of just one truly obnoxious American girl.",4.0,Anonymous,Action
"Pretty good, but not great movie","I saw the trailer for this movie and really thought it would be great. It was pretty good, but fell into a few movie cliché's and suffered from poor acting from most everyone but Neelson. This was especially true from all the scenes in Paris.The acting and occasional plot hole aside, this was a good action flick. Several reviews have pointed to the Bourne movies, and it does have that spy character who is ready for any situation. Unfortunately this movie doesn't get nearly as deep or even pretend to build characters. Instead, this movie focuses on a father who just happens to, as the trailer notes, have a particular skill set that enables him to track down and deal with people.There is some exposure to sex trafficking, but that only goes as deep as it needs to find his daughter.

Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA paramilitary operative who has to track down a group of slave traders who take his daughter Kim(Maggie Grace). I won't give away too many details but I will say it is a strong film that blends action, suspense and drama in a nicely concocted cocktail.

A Surprisingly Good Time!,"Liam Neeson stars in this new actioner about an ex-CIA agent, played by Neeson. While on a trip to Paris, Neeson's daughter has been kidnapped. Neeson of course takes matters into his own hands and decides to hunt down the kidnappers himself.The film was an enjoyable experience. It was well written and directed for the most part, as well the acting was good overall. Still, the one man that made this movie was Liam Neeson. His presence elevates this film from a passable action romp, to a fun, must-see entertainment picture.Overall Taken was an enjoyable experience. It was fun and entertaining, with terrific action, and made you want to stand up and cheer for the hero.

Best (non-superhero) action flick of the year,"Liam Neeson: Bad-Ass?? Hell yeah he is. Believe it or not, Neeson stars in the best (non-superhero) action movie of the year. This movie was the out-of-nowhere surprise of the year I've been hoping for.As an ex-government agent out to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter, Neeson's character is like Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer combined, except that this guy could take either of those two down in a heartbeat. He's skilled, intense, and won't hesitate to take down anyone who stands between him and his daughter.This film opens in the U.S. in September, and it's a shame that it is getting virtually no promotion. Neeson isn't the biggest box office draw, much less as an action star, but I urge everyone out there to give this a chance. It's a thrilling action/drama that truly impressed me, and it's full of moments that make your jaw drop, make you cheer, and make you yell, ""Daaaaaaamn!""",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Becareful who you mess with,"Now this movie is basically the epitome of a badass Liam Neeson. Sure Liam has played some badass characters before and will do so in the future but he is a badass in this one as well. Luc Besson is one of the writer for this movie and he is known for being part of making quasi video game style action movies. Sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he doesn't, this is one of the movie he does succeed. Now the plot isn't anything amazing, in fact it's pretty straightforward. But the action and everything is so cool without it being cheesy. Now you don't really find out the exact background of Liam's character Bryan Mills but the movie does give hints. His character is a someone that has ethics and knows exactly what to do in order to get the job done when it comes to his special set of skills. But he isn't a nice guy either and will do whatever it takes to retrieve what he lost. And that is what stands out about this character. He isn't a moralistic character that has to be the nice guy or the very good guy to with the audiences approval. The plot is this Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) is divorced but has a daughter but she is with his wife and her new husband. The new husband is a rich guy that provides anything for his wife and daughter but Bryan still has a lot of love for her daughter. And wants to make up for lost time with her and win his daughter's affection. The wife who is played by Famke Janssen who was in the X-Men movies and GoldenEye is simply a mean gold digger. Anyways his daughter gets kidnapped and all hell breaks lose because they angered the wrong man. Overall if you want to see a simple but fun and cool action movie this one might be for you. I heard there will be a sequel to this movie and I am hoping it isn't a terrible one. And not just a cash in for the sake of a sequel but have a coherent and fun story with better action scenes.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Pretty Liam, but also pretty clichéd!","Well, it was quite fast moving and filled an hour and a half and I managed to watch it to the end so it can't be as bad as SOME I've seen.But a class film this was NOT - very predictable, very clichéd, and no real suspense about what the final outcome would be. Totally implausible storyline had about as much tension as a cup of tea and none of the one-dimensional characters were even remotely likable (no, not even the delectable Liam Neeson, who came across as a bit of a bad ass wet fish).I spent £3.99 on this DVD - £1.99 would have been about right.

Go Liam!,"Liam Neeson's daughter is ""Taken"" in this 2008 action thriller also starring Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and Katie Cassidy. Directed by Pierre Morel, the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.A retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills, has moved and given up his career to be closer to his daughter Kim (Grace). His ex-wife Lenore (Janssen) has remarried, to a very wealthy man, and she seems to be limiting Bryan's access to his daughter. However, on her 17th birthday, he drops into her party and gives her a gift. He's thrilled when she calls later and says she wants to have lunch with him. However, Lenore comes along; in order for Kim to travel to Paris, she needs his permission and signature. Bryan doesn't agree right away. He's seen the seamier part of life and doesn't want her traveling alone in Paris. He finally agrees to let her go when he learns she'll be staying at the apartment of her traveling companion Amanda's cousins.Of course, the cousins actually aren't there, and rather than haunt the museums, Kim and Amanda are following a rock group's tour. Kim is supposed to call him every night but that slips her mind. When she finally calls, it's just as Amanda is being kidnapped. Bryan remains calm, tells her to get under the bed, and when she is taken, and she will be, to scream out as much of a description as possible.What follows is a rip-roaring, fast moving, kick ass Liam Neeson tracking down the culprits, who are engaged in the trafficking of young women. Bryan takes no prisoners, and he uses every CIA trick at his disposal, including hotwiring cars, torture, gunplay, fighting skills - you name it.This is a terrific movie, and there's just enough of a setup so that we care deeply what happens. So often action films give us a shell of a story and then get right into the action - and while the action can be terrific, this is the type of film you can get into for the characters as well as the action.Liam Neeson - action hero.

More Like James Bond Meets Death Wish,"The more often I see this film, the better it gets (and it was terrific the first time I saw it!). The acting is first rate, with Liam Neeson perfectly cast and giving an outstanding performance as the ex-spy Dad on a rampage to rescue his kidnapped daughter from euro sex merchants. After the opening set-up, the action is non-stop and amply displays Neeson's training and an athletic skill that belies his late-fifties age. Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, the dialog is crisp and compelling. All in all, a wonderful action film that has you pulling for the protagonist from beginning to end. Although many other reviewers cite the similarities to the Bourne franchise, they are probably too young to fully appreciate how closely the flow of the film parallels the Death Wish series, particularly in the efficient and dispassionate manner in which Neeson's character dispatches ""the enemy"" to meet their maker. Overall, a great movie you can watch again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

But beyond that, what his daughter has to go through herself is a movie within itself...this movie stayed on my mind for a couple days and i applaud it for its brutal honesty I did not give it a 10/10 because with every action movie there are a few slip ups of an unrealistic happening, as that does happen twice in this movie with a very fast pace that you almost don't even have a chance to think about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Conventional but entertaining,Taken uses the fear every parent has when their child leaves the protection of home. For most of us this fear is misplaced but occasionally it is justified. This simple premise is used with effect in this entertaining film. Liam Neeson is a convincing action hero even though he is middle aged. The plot is complicated enough to ring true but not so complicated as to interfere with the pace of the story. That said I think it could have been a better movie if there had been more of Neeson's character. What does the character do when confronted with such lawlessness? It's got to be more complicated to deal with intransigent ill will than is depicted in this film. I think this could have been mined for a more complex character study while maintaining the taught plot of the movie. This is one of my pet peeves about film making: it's always plot v character. Why does it have to be either/or?,6.0,Anonymous,Action

Something for the aficionados.,"As a critic, to draw comparisons between Taken and the James Bond series would be like taking a gun and shooting yourself in your foot, and so I must continue on with this review in a limp. While this latest effort from director Pierre Morel isn't exactly as compelling or engaging as most of Mr. Bond's movies, what it does have in common is a riveting mix of action that runs on adrenaline and kicks with personality; of course, Liam Neeson is hardly a James Bond type, and quite frankly, neither is his character, but the trials and tribulations that Bryan goes through here share the same sense of personal conflict that often occurs during the best Spy-Thrillers. This isn't a movie riddled with politics, evil villains looking for world domination or fancy gadgets. No, instead Morel adopts a much more grounded, everyday threat to work with here, and as such achieves a good sense of focus and pacing that drives the feature forward. Unfortunately, despite this keen eye for bringing action that we care about to the screen, the script's lack of just about anything else hinders the movie's ability to work anything but the brain. It can be touching, but only momentarily; Taken is fine for a couple of hours of thrilling mystery, but if you crave more than a six-pack, you're probably best waiting for a martini.Telling the story of an ex-spy and father Bryan, who is on the hunt for his daughter's kidnappers in France, Taken takes a much more domestic, heart-driven source of narrative to drive itself forward. Compelled only to find his enemies for the sake of saving her daughter within a contrived timeline before she gets sent somewhere out of his reach and knowledge, Bryan makes for a cold, unrelenting character to follow. Throughout the feature, Neeson proves he has what it takes to fulfil such shoes, conveying the abrasive, goal-driven attitude of his character with enough conviction to maintain our own interest in his story. Of course, when it comes to showing how he feels outside of a piece of combat however, both Neeson and his persona fall a little short.Bryan is a regretful father, who in the past neglected his ex-wife and daughter in order to be good at his job. Yet realising how much bonding time he lost in doing so, decided to quit his job in order to move closer, and spend time with his daughter. In this arc there is genuine sympathy to be felt for Bryan, and Neeson does enough to get this across, even if he is far more compelling when firing off a weapon and breaking people's bones. The closing sequences are where the majority of all this development does finally pay off however, in an emotive climax that provides adequate catharsis involving the two central characters. However compelling such moments are though, there is no denying that the majority of Taken is driven by pure logic and visceral action; moments involving the heart are sporadic and almost immediately forgotten, and as such, the movie's tone can get a little erratic at times.As a whole, the feature isn't as remarkable as it could have been, but it is in no way disappointing either. Instead Taken takes a much more focused route, and delivers a spy-thriller that delivers on all the elements needed to create tension, conflict and does so with a character that is convincing in his role as a source of unrelenting pain for those who have crossed him. Those looking for a taste for the genre before Bond comes out should find themselves at home here, and while Taken is certainly a lot darker, more grounded and at the same time, less charismatic than cinematic icon 007, there's enough action and plot here to justify a watch. Perhaps with a little deeper characterisation the production as a whole could have been stronger, but for what it is, Taken is pretty much standard for the genre; no too remarkable but not too disposable either; something for the aficionados.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Action
A Kidnapping Gone Wrong,"""Bryan Mills"" (Liam Neeson) is a former special operative working for the CIA who neglected his family while on repeated assignments and after a bitter divorce from his wife ""Lenore"" (Famke Janssen) has decided to retire so that he can be closer to his teenage daughter ""Kim Mills"" (Maggie Grace). To that effect, he during a scheduled luncheon with her, she surprisingly requests that he sign a consent to allow her to visit France with her best friend ""Amanda"" (Katie Cassidy). He initially declines out of safety concerns, but after intense pressure from both Kim and Lenore he finally relents under one condition-that she keep him informed of her movements while there. To his horror, once she arrives in Paris, he receives a frantic call from her saying that several violent men have entered her hotel room-and then after a loud skirmish she is gone. Thankfully, due to his experience, he managed to record most of the phone conversation and upon sending the recording to one of his colleagues is told that the intruders were speaking in an Albanian accent which doubtlessly belonged to a specific sex-trafficking ring known to be operating in Paris. So, in great haste he heads to Paris to rescue her and kill those responsible. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, even though the plot is hardly unique, this film turned out to be a cut above most of the others due in large part to the exciting action scenes and some good suspense. Admittedly, some of the scenarios were extremely unrealistic but even so I enjoyed this movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
An American in Paris,"***SPOILER ALERT*** Over the top thriller with Liam Neeson as the indestructible ex-CIA Agent Bryan Mills a man you just don't f**k with if you want to stay alive or remain in one piece.Bryan against his better judgment allows his virgin daughter 17 year-old Kim, Maggie Grace, go on a two week vacation in Paris with her oversexed girlfriend Amanda, Katie Cassidy, so long as they don't go so far as within ten blocks of their hotel room. Bryan's family life-which resulted with his wife divorcing him- has been royally screwed up in him being a secret agent for the CIA in that he never was around when Kim needed him when she was growing up.As it soon turned out Bryans greatest fears came true with both Kim & Amanda being kidnapped by this gang of Albanian white slavery traffickers within hours of arriving in the ""City of Lights"". Like a shot Bryan is in Paris looking for Kim & Amanda and ends up manhandling the guy who had them kidnapped the gangs look-out man at the Paris Airport, for young pretty and innocent women tourist, Peter, Nicolas Giraud. Suffering form a brain concussion, in his being thrown by Bryan through a car window, and on the run for his life, from a mad as a hornet Byran, Peter ends up being crushed to death, when he forgot to duck, by an 18 wheeler. Seeing that he'll get no cooperation from the Paris Police, who all seemed to be paid off by the Albanian gangsters, Bryan goes solo in order to find Kim, and Amanda, breaking arms legs heads and spleens along the way.The film ""Taken"" keeps topping itself in every scene that has Bryan confront his daughter's kidnappers. Making even James Bond look like a rank armature Bryan take out dozens of Albanian gangsters, and their French and Middle-Eastern associates, with the ease of someone pealing a banana! No matter what the odds are against him Bryan has no trouble at all in overcoming them with his expertise in electronics hand to hand fighting explosives knives and firearms. Bryan even has the uncanny ability to learn any language, like the very difficult Albanian, by just memorizing it from a dictionary with his photographic-like memory. Finishing off the Albanian white slavery gang Bryan then goes after, on his yacht, the #1 guy in the business of peddling an buying of human flesh who the gang was working for the filthy rich Shiek Raman, Nabil Massad.***SPOILERS*** Scared out of his wits, in seeing what the outraged and out of control Bryan already did, all Sheik Massad could do was offer him, with a gun pointed to Kim's head, a deal for his worthless and rotten life. The deal was off before the startled Sheik could even finish the sentence with a bullet, from Bryan's gun, hitting him right between the eyes.In the end Bryan not only ended up saving his daughter from a life of drug addiction and prostitution he also got her an audition with her idol top pop diva Sheerah, Holly Valance. Bryan, by being her bodyguard, had earlier saved Sheerah's life and her giving Kim, who's dream is to be a top pop singer like herself, a start was the least she could do for the proud, of his daughter, dad!",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Awesome movie.,"I finished watching Taken (2008) on Disney+ tonight and it was an awesome action film with Liam Neeson. The film is about an ex-CIA officer named Bryan Mills, who sets about tracking down his daughter Kim and her best friend after they are kidnapped by Albanian bad guys during a vacation in Paris. Since this is a French film from EuropaCorp, this was quite a very popular film when it came out in France, it was such a big film back when it came out in 2008.This film has pretty good acting, great pacing, neat direction by Pierre Morel, fantastic action sequences and a story that is executed very well. The scene where Marko gets tortured kinda reminds me of the torture scene from Casino Royale. I think my favourite character is Kim (Bryan's daughter who is played by Maggie Grace) because she's very pretty to look at. There is a very memorable line that will never, ever get old, which is: ""If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""Although the only flaws I have with this film is that not a lot of side characters get that much screen time.

"Neeson out of his element, but possibly at his best","I have to admit that I started watching this movie with my breath held. Let's face it, Liam Neeson is not exactly known for bringing the action. Perhaps that's why I liked this so much...not only does Neeson deliver believable action but he damn near rocks your face off.My experience with Neeson is fairly limited, I'll admit. Yeah, he was in the new Star Wars flicks, but I didn't much care for those and Batman Begins which was fine but he was pretty much absent from that. And then there's Nell. We'll not discuss that. Long story short I always knew Liam Neeson as the guy who always looked like he was just about to start crying (even when he's smiling). Needless to say I was more than a bit surprised when he breaks out into his bad-ass alter ego for Taken. I would liken him in this flick to a slightly more aged Jason Bourne...his action sequences are fluid and impressive but still very based in reality without a ton of flash.The supporting cast is also pretty good. Famke Janssen is fine if just as cold and uncaring as she is in pretty much everything. A post-Lost Maggie Grace does well as the daughter who's abducted (ok, all she really does is scream and cry, but she fits the bill for the part). I almost didn't recognize her since she comes across looking a lot younger even though it was made after she was killed off on Lost. All in all it's really a shame this movie didn't ever (to my knowledge) see serious theater time. It's every bit as good as anything in theaters right and in many cases better. It's definitely worth your time. I'm almost hoping Neeson keeps this up even though I'm pretty sure he won't.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

What do they know?,"Critics continue to be disengaged from the general public. Taken is a classic example.

Its one of thew few movies of a year of bad movies that leaves pleasant memories behind.Mind you, I am a fan of the previous work done by this crew.

What ensued was a father in hot pursuit of his kidnapped daughter through the seedier side of France. The movie preaches no message, and makes no pretense that it is anything but a ""fun"" movie. So why is it that critics cannot sit back and see what we see? Trust the viewers on this one. If you're in the mood for a great action flick, Taken will be right up your alley.

"Rabid and unrelenting action film that teeters on the brink of both exploitation and as a dumb, guilty pleasure but pulls through on a basic level.","Taken is a trashy, pulpy, throw-away thriller in every sense of each of those words and terms. It is a film that thrives on making the lead come across as down and as out as possible; one that thrives on making the people around him, both good and evil, come across as instantly and intensely dislikable as possible; and one that really thrives on rapid, cause and effect action which desperately tries to stay as realistic as possible but very much has its mind on the notion of escapism as it panders to a crowd. The film is a shameless action movie; a revenge film; a tale in which the women exist purely to be either rescued; act like complete wenches towards their ex-husbands; or get all excited at the prospect of a ride on a cute, four legged animal. And yet, there is a certain pleasure to be had out of it, a certain dumb but familiar sense of siding with the one likable character the entire film possesses, and just willing him on with a big smile on your face.I have an odd relationship with Luc Besson; anything he's written and made himself from what I've seen, I've taken to. As a writer with view to produce, his work's been ordinary to just plain stupid at best. Taken is a slight exception; a piece that more resembles what 1985 action movie Commando might've looked like had someone like Donald Westlake written it. It sees Liam Neeson play a divorced man, from a marriage that saw him father a daughter, but essential to the plot, he is an ex-CIA operative now working relatively small time as a bodyguard with some buddies from the government years. His name is Bryan Mills (Neeson), although at one point during the opening in a jovial exchange with a past comrades, he is referred to as 'Rambo' in what is another link to past, Reaganistic driven action film-making of the 1980s on top of the already mentioned Commando. The fact he is referred to Rambo so early on produces slight smiles as you witness what transpires.The inclusion of a friendly character very early on whom mentions Rambo assures me that Taken knows its place, knows what it is, and by the end, is hoping we're not taking it all so seriously as to despise the film as we watch on with our brows furrowed and our tongues entrenched within our cheeks. Bryan's isolation from his daughter, the antagonism he gets from his ex-wife and the fact she has a new partner anyway is enough to make you think he might just go nuts and wipe everyone out at a vomit-inducing, overly fluffy birthday party very early on. What Mills needs is his own noir fuelled franchise; with shady and fleshed out gangsters, a past tragedy driving the bitter, cynical and somewhat ruthless lead anti-hero whom isn't afraid to shoot first, ask questions later nor ask the questions first and then leave the poor guy to suffer whilst bound to a chair.Then again, we get some of that in Taken; a film that crosses its wires all too often but gives us an experience we enjoy without ever taking too seriously, but are immersed enough to feel the threat, helplessness and desperation most characters go through. After going to Paris with a friend, Kim Mills (Grace) is swiped from her apartment, along with friend Amanda, in a ruthlessly efficient sequence that makes Elite Hunting and their Eastern Europe set up-come-operation look amateur. After no help from anyone, Bryan takes it on himself to go after her and recover her, thus kick-starting a blood-drenched trip to Europe where people will pay.Interestingly, Taken is listed on the IMDb, under its 'country' sub-heading, as a French film and its view of France is a less-than-desirable one. I was reminded of the 2006 Venezuealan film 'Express Kidnapping', which looked at the frightening and harsh realities of what might happen if you're not careful on the streets of Caracas. In Taken, rather than integrate an individual city (in this case, Paris) into the story as it supports the basis of the study, writer Besson and director Pierre Morel cop out and somewhat disappointingly use Albanians as a means of getting across the antagonism. All this does is tell us that 'Yes, this may happen in a nation as developed as France but if it does, it'll be down to those immigrants whom have come over and set up their own operations'.Taken doesn't hit particularly soar, but what else can you say about a film that, unashamedly I hope, uses that laugh out loud instance in which the hero sits at a café, reads a newspaper and then reveals to us that he wasn't actually reading it as much as he was spying on a suspected enemy. It recalls that glorious moment in one of Nick Park's early Wallace and Gromit shorts in which the ever-alert mutt of the title acts like he is reading a paper, but is actually stalking a suspicious character; all played out under a banner that blurs the lines between what we take seriously and what we find amusing by way of pastiche. The film is a bizarre blend of often hard hitting material revolving around torture, sexual slavery and shootings unfolded under an umbrella of the guilty pleasure, and the idea we're watching Liam Neeson in the lead role; but don't let that sound like it's a complete load of nonsense, because it carries a certain watchability about it, something that you don't often get the chance to say about action films these days.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Ooh baby baby it's a (cough) racist world,"Don't get taken in by Taken. Sure, it's 7.9 on IMDb and with Liam Neeson in it you may figure it's going to be a cut above. You'd be wrong. It's the kind of film Mel Gibson would turn his nose up at.For a start, it's very broadly written. Neeson plays a dad estranged from his ex-wife - Famke Janssen, who played a wonderful femme fetale in GoldenEye all those years ago, and is now content to play a Desperate Housewives-style mom.. The dialogue is all, ""I really missed you Dad!"" ""I missed you too pumpkin!"" Rubbish exposition: Neeson meets his old mates, they reminisce about how they went to Beirut on a mission, how he cried off with no warning to attend his daughter's birthday. Clumsily signposting his past life as an action hero, along with his dedication to his daughter. Though one also might also think, this guy is pretty unreliable, he might be a bit soft in the head to desert his mates.And it's that which kept me watching, the thought there might be a subtext going on here, that Neeson might be a bit simple. Later, Neeson and his mates are security for a rock princess; Neeson asks her for career advice for his daughter JUST AS SHE'S ABOUT TO SWEEP ONTO STAGE! Media types never like to dish out free advice to wannabe competitors at the best of times. What kind of response is he likely to get? He seems a bit retarded, likewise his paranoid fears about his daughter going to Paris. But no, we're meant to admire him.It gets worse, and you begin to suspect it's a metaphor for US foreign policy. I can only imagine those giving this a high rating are Americans loving the double whammy of the French and the Arabs getting a kicking. And incidentally, you really don't get to see much of Paris either, if you were looking to rent it for that reason.",2.0,Anonymous,Action
'Man on Fire' meets 'The Bourne Identity',"This movie immediately caught my interest when I first saw the trailer, and thankfully, it was everything I thought it would be.'Taken' stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA operative, desperately trying to rekindle his relationship with his estranged daughter. So when she suddenly springs the idea of traveling to Paris with one of her friends, he very reluctantly allows her to go in an attempt to get her to take him back into her life. Before his daughter could see the Eiffel Tower, Neeson's worst fears are realized, and his daughter is kidnapped and dragged off, only to leave a very determined Liam Neeson to recover her.At 97 minutes, this movie is short, sweet, and to the point. Initially, I was worried if Liam Neeson may have been miscast, as this is not usually the sort of roles we are used to seeing him in, but he shows us a hardcore, and welcomed side of his acting. The action sequences are well done and well timed. Neeson is as resourceful as he is brutal in this role. You see the determination of Denzel Washington from 'Man on Fire', with the moves of Jason Bourne in Neeson's performance. All in all, a very entertaining movie and a welcomed change of pace from Liam Neeson.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
brilliant action movie - but not at all politically correct,"From the action point of view, there isn't much to add to other reviews: it's a brilliant movie displacing James Bond and Bourne and all the other action heroes. It's very well made.So, I will only give a comment on a few things that some of you might want to know before you watch this film: The movie is extremely violent, and the use violence is never really questioned. Instead, violence is accepted even if affecting innocents. Further, the dark picture of Europe (France in particular) is absurdly overdone. OK, it's a dramatic element needed for the plot. But you can really spoil a kid's mind with these completely awkward ideas.For adults, of course, it's a super cool movie. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
It was all personal to me.,"When Taken came out, I don't think anybody knew that Liam Neeson would become the next big action star of the 2000's. But the Bryan Mills character he portrayed will definitely go down in history as one of the best action heroes. The story is compelling, the action is excellent, and It's a movie that once it gets going it never slows back down until the very end.Unfortunately for me this is one of those films that I didn't see until a couple of years after it came out, but better late than never. This is now one of my all time personal favorites. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

A Typical Action Movie = Awesome,"Liam Neeson star in this movie about a father who find out that his 17 year old daughter was kidnapped while she was abroad. What the kidnappers didn't know is that Liam Neeson has some amazing skills that he pick up while working for the government before he decided to retire. Using the skills that he attains from the government, he tracks down the culprit that kidnapped his daughter and punish them.I honestly did not believe that Liam Neeson can kick some ass, but in this movie he certainly looked the part. Liam Neeson is basically playing an older version of Jason Statham in this movie. He goes around whacking everyone that is in his way and does it very convincingly.Maggie Grace plays his daughter. Even though Maggie is older than what she potray on screen, she doesn't look as if she's her age, she looked very young in this movie and pull it off as a teenager.If you are looking for an action packed action movie, then this is the movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Reshaping...it's possible, but you gotta know how","""I'm retired, but not dead"", Brian Mills, a former CIA agent tells a friend in Paris when he can't understand how he manages to get any kind of information about anything. Mills, played by Liam Neeson with unstoppable force and as an old-fashioned vigilante who fears no one and kills everyone in every room he sets foot in; is in Paris because his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, 25 and capturing the essence of a 17 year-old) was kidnapped by some Albanians while on vacation with a friend.That's all about the plot, and even if you know how it ends, it's not everything about ""Taken"". It's no coincidence that Pierre Morel, the director of the movie, was the cinematographer of ""The Transporter"" and ""Danny the Dog""; and of course it's less of a coincidence that Luc Besson, writer of those films, wrote this film (alongside Robert Mark Kamen, who also wrote 'Transporter') and produced it.Besson never ceases to amaze me. This whole decade, he has created a new kind of action piece and reshaped it, again and again. I'm not sure if I know the exact formula yet, but I can tell you some of the elements. I use the word 'reshape' because Besson's writing material is never original, but it never sounds repeated. The same happens with the action itself; whether it's Corey Yuen's fantastic use of cars in 'Transporter', Leterrier's excellent management of the fight scenes in 'Dog' or Morel's wonderful car chase scene around a trailer-or any single frame of a gunshot, for that matter- in this movie, the producer always gets the best out of the directors he chooses.""Taken"" is so straightforward in his development, and this is respected by the whole cast and crew and assures the success of every moment of every scene in front of the viewer. The parental relationship Besson is so obsessed about and never fully developed (watch 'Dog', ""Wasabi"", ""Leon"", ""Nikita"" to experience the pieces) is the basis of the moving content of the film, and it's written with enviable intelligence. When Kim is kidnapped and his father decides to look for her desperately, we don't know very much about him, or her, or their relationshipAnd somehow that's precisely why we root for him, for a man who burns down every place he visits. By not giving us enough information of the characters, Besson leaves us no choice but to believe in Neeson's confident face-and fate-, no matter what.Brian, with this confidence, says (and not to a friend): ""I'll hunt you, I'll find you and I'll kill you"". The movie doesn't waste time in unnecessary dialogs, shots, or scenes. This father always goes right to the point, and the camera goes with him skipping everything in the way. As I told you, you may know how it ends, but you can't imagine how impressive the ride in between is.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Is it believable and authentic ? Except for the theme and the initial kidnapping - absolutely not however this is forsaken for a very enjoyable, fast paced romp of pure escapism.

Old plot new tricks,"You've seen the plot of TAKEN before: A former CIA operative's daughter is kidnapped and is to be sold into a life of slavery and prostitution. He immediately goes after the kidnapers. The action takes us from Los Angeles to Paris and back. Liam Neeson is the operative and Famke Janssen is the ex-wife; otherwise, the cast is largely made up of an army of stuntmen, all on hand to be mowed down by Neeson in his quest to retrieve his daughter. What makes the movie work are the incredible fight sequences, which are plentiful and modeled on the fight sequences in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. Since the movie is rated PG-13, there is no blood to speak of, but the violence feels real enough and Neeson is believable as a killing machine who cannot be stopped or even slowed down.

Watch Liam Neeson take out the bad guys,"(Synopsis) Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) retired from the CIA as a black ops field agent so he could be close to and reconnect with his 17-year old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim wants to go to Paris with a friend, but she must get her father's permission to leave the country. Bryan knows how dangerous the world is and doesn't want her to go, but he reluctantly gives his consent when she turns on her tears. He gives her a cell phone and wants her to call him everyday. After just arriving in Paris, Kim is talking on the phone with her father when she sees that several men have broken into the apartment and have grabbed her friend. Bryan tells her to hide under the bed and when they grab her, to yell out anything she can identify about the men. Bryan talks to one of the kidnappers and warns him to let his daughter go. ""But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The kidnapper replies with ""Good Luck.""(My Comment) The movie covers the topic of young women being kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers who hook them on drugs and sell them into prostitution. Using his CIA contacts, Bryan learns that Marco is the man he was talking to on the phone, and that he only has a maximum of 96 hours to find Kim, before she is never heard from again. Bryan flies to Paris and is in a race against time to find Kim. He uses all his skills to track her kidnappers down, and when he finds one, he extracts information and takes out his retribution. Liam Neeson is the good guy who will not stop for anything to find his daughter. You will love his character seeking revenge and feel for him while he is doing it. The best line in the movie is the line when Bryan is talking on the phone to Marco, because that is what any parent would want to say to any kidnapper. There is non-stop action after Bryan arrives in Paris. The hand to hand action is nicely done. The story is straightforward with no plot twists and predictable, but it doesn't matter. It will hold your interest and enjoyable to watch him take out the bad guys. (20th Century Fox, Run Time 1:34, Rated PG-13) (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Action

A gripping action thriller surprisingly heavy on the violence,"Taken is a taut action thriller starring the somewhat improbable Liam Neeson as the avenging hero.Neeson is somewhat of an everyman actor, very believable in everyday hero roles that Tom Cruise and the like could never do. It is this versatility that is his great strength as an actor – see his roles as Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars and the legendary Irish hero Michael Collins in the film of the same name for further evidence of this. But as Brian Mills, the loving father and retired CIA operative, he brings a new intensity to the fore, and the film is all the more satisfying for it. Brian has seen how the world works and wants to protect his daughter from it. But after his daughter is kidnapped on a trip to Paris, Brian must dust off his skills that have lain dormant in order to rescue his daughter and punish those responsible.After taking a little too much time to set events in motion (considering it is only a 90 minute film) the pace and power accelerates rapidly, and you find yourself slowly gripped by the single-minded intensity of ex-spy Ben. While you remain sure that the outcome is inevitable, the method and projected body count remain in question, and it is this that makes the film such an enthralling tale. Some good, if not particularly spectacular, set-pieces, keep the pace moving quickly, while the vast range of 'special skills' Ben displays throughout the film ensure we never lose sight of who it is we're dealing with. The film wears its emotions on its sleeve, giving the film a raw feel, which all adds to the gut-wrenching intensity. As the plot thickens and more layers become apparent – including corruption within the gendarmes – you are left asking yourself 'how far would you go to rescue someone you love? What lengths would you go to?' Ben's methods become morally ambiguous at best, if not outright questionable, but as we see more of the seedy underbelly of Paris and how far it extends, the slightly sour taste that has been growing from the we discover the truth behind his daughter's abduction becomes quite uncomfortable. The rather surprisingly high level of violence adds to this level of discomfort, yet the violence never seems to feel gratuitous.Neeson is a man who can deliver quiet intensity like few others can, but the fury he displays never seems to rise much above a whisper – no matter how much training a spy may get, surely nothing could prepare someone for the kidnap of their daughter? A slight increase in volume of emotions would have benefited somewhat. Meanwhile, Maggie Grace as Ben's daughter has little to do other than look severely distressed and frightened, while the villains are largely nameless and faceless. The lack of a single clearly identifiable villain, while ensuring the focus remains solely on Ben's search for his daughter, dilutes the fury and vengeance factor somewhat. However, Taken remains a riveting narrative, unfettered by the convoluted machinations that frequently litter CIA-based films. By taking the spy out of the CIA, the story is free to focus on the action-based thrills rather than the political ones, and is all the better for it. In fact, with a sub-90 minute runtime the audience is left feeling slightly short-changed on plot, and an additional twenty minutes to develop Neeson's character further, maybe even displaying some bursts of uncontrolled rage at some point, would not have harmed the movie in any way.Be that as it may, with TV series like Alias having made the spy genre somewhat stale, Taken shows there is no substitute for seeing this kind of story as a full-blown action thriller on the big screen. Genuinely gripping.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"I was pleased, but not at all Taken","Adverts for this film had me looking forward to, at the very least, a formulaic that cannot fail: Bad guys get their due by the hand of a righteous good guy. Vengeance is served somehow, and all that. Overall, the film delivers on its promise.It is not exemplary in its genre however. I wish I could cite a title that really gives that satisfaction that is set up by the words 'I will find you and I will kill you'. A film or TV show that does that is a rare find.To get that vigilante righteousness where you can applaud the protagonist for banging heads and killing everyone that crosses his/her path is a key issue. It most often requires that the antagonist be really really bad, to the point that that their crimes are so disturbing as to be unimaginable. This is perhaps why I cannot name a more satisfying film. I may have blocked it out.Perhaps ""Die Hard"" could be called into play here, because I recall it was eminently satisfying and not too disturbing. But ""Die Hard"" does not exactly fit into this genre. It should not be a spoiler to say that kidnapping is an element of both, but that alone would hardly describe either film.""Taken"" does not spend enough time on the guy that offered 'good luck'. You barely know who it is before it is gone from the story. Once you see it, you will agree that this is no spoiler, the film and the adverts did that already. Action sequences are implemented with more cuts than bristles on your toothbrush.It is more convenient to have a series of action sequences filmed and then piece them together in an ineffective effort rather than choreograph them before the start. This shortcut has plagued many an otherwise good film and ""Taken"" is no exception. See, I just did that. You have no idea what I am saying.I will now make it clear, this movie is not all that great. It was not bad, I enjoyed it. I watched it alone and was expecting to re-watch it with someone else once I could recommend it, but I cannot.

Tensile!,"A satisfying addition to the Revenge/Action Thriller genre. Its portrayal of violence is reminiscent of Cronenberg's History of Violence, which is to say that every attack is decisive, every punch bone-cracking, every trigger pulled multiple times without hesitation. A ruggedly restrained Liam Neeson ties the whole package together nicely. Luc Besson seems to have really hit his stride here with a newly-realized economy of cinematic language. This is a lean, mean fighting film, nothing flabby about it, not a moment wasted. Although I agree with some of the comments other users have posted about Maggie Grace's seeming misinterpretation of her character's age (perhaps this was a directorial gaffe?), in terms of pure popcorn entertainment value and tight narrative adherence to its basic premise of personal justice, the film deserves a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Revenge Has Been Taken to a New Level,"Before I got this movie on DVD, I had never heard of the director. I wasn't even sure whether I should spend an hour and a half watching it; my father convinced me otherwise.Taken, directed by Pierre Morel, is the story of a father's limitless love for his daughter. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a strict, colorless and reserved father who wants nothing other than his daughter's love. He is so desperate for her acceptance, he allows her to take a vacation with her friend to Paris even though he knows much too well the trouble she could encounter. The situation is made even more irritating for Bryan when he finds out Paris isn't the only stop on his daughter's list.The movie starts off a bit slow, but quickly speeds up with Bryan's quest to avenge his daughter's kidnapping; you'll soon find out Bryan isn't the dull character he first appeared. He is calm and clever, tying together all the clues to find his daughter. Some of the stunts may seem over the top, but are still believable. And all action sequences are beautifully choreographed, leaving you wondering, ""What will he do next?!""Taken is a film based on the human trafficking industry that asks every viewer the same question, ""Why aren't we taking more action to crack down on this destructive industry?""

Adrenaline and action in Paris,"After a slightly slow predictable scene-setting intro, Taken takes us on familiar territory, but oh so well done. The hand of Besson is writ large across (he was a writer for the film) showing us Paris as the dynamic backdrop for this movie of retribution. It's hard not compare it with Harrison Ford in Frantic, but Liam Neeson as the hard man is an intensely satisfying experience as he carves a swathe of death through the suburbs. I found myself shaking watching it as the adrenaline kicked in, and he shows that adrenaline rush in many scenes. The acting of all concerned is believable and I never found myself questioning motives or behaviour. The only reason I do not give this ten-out-of-ten is the ease with which he rampages through Paris without substantial police interference, and the rather contrived final ending. Hollywood has to have a little cherry on top of the ice cream. Well worth seeing, whether you are a boy or girl, for a rush of juicy adrenaline.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

A lot of ""MacGyver"" moments, some car chases and cool spy stuff. I wouldn't say it always kept you guessing, but there were plenty of gasps and more than enough interesting bits throughout. I think what really impressed me is that there were REAL actors/stuntmen on film, moving about, no digital enhancement needed, and it looked great. I saw this at the drive-in after Wolverine and that was full of poorly finished computer effects and overdone fight scenes that ruined the movie.
