A movie that lives up to its title,"When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it. Why? Preconceived notions. Thank goodness for Cable TV, or I never would have seen this film. I like it, it makes me laugh.This is not a masterpiece. This is not an academy award winning film, not a film of strategic plots, this is as sophomoric as it gets  -- and that's fine with me. Sometimes, ya gotta escape. This'll do it.The title says it all. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are perfect for their roles, every time I watch this film uncut, I am laughing. I was always thinking, ""How dumb can you get?"" And in the next frame it gets dumber.This is one of those films you just have fun with. Either you like this kind of humor or you don't. But the world is in such turmoil, this is a welcomed, stupid, silly, break that hits just the right spot. I find it ""stupid-funny"" beyond belief.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a Ride,"They might be dumb, but they sure are funny. I think what really makes the movie come to life, besides the superb acting performance of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, is that the jokes feel genuine and innocent instead of overdone and forced. In one way or another it is easy to relate to some of what the poor guys go through. As the movie goes on it gets better and better. Overall great performance and funny jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Samsonite. I was WAY off.""","The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, made their big break into filmmaking with this memorable vehicle for the talented Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Here, the Farrellys were able to establish a formula for their movies involving crude, absurdist humour and outlandish situations. Thought-provoking, intellectual entertainment is FAR from their goal, but Farrelly brothers movies like ""Dumb and Dumber"" work just fine in an undemanding way that doesn't tax anybody's brains. There are certainly some very notable bits and lines of dialogue throughout, plus two very enthusiastic performances by Carrey and Daniels.The two of them play Lloyd and Harry, two utter morons who can't hold on to jobs or go for long without screwing up. Then, one day, limo driver Lloyd drives the lovely Mary (Lauren Holly, Carrey's real-life girlfriend at the time) to the airport. She leaves behind a suitcase, and it becomes Lloyds' mission to return it to her and win her love. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the suitcase contains a fortune in ransom money, and the lowlife who was demanding the money is understandably NOT happy about what develops.There are a couple of capable actors & actresses in supporting roles - Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, Felton Perry, the comic Harland Williams (who tends to fare better when he's not the star of a movie), Victoria Rowell, etc. Veteran comic actress Teri Garr is utterly wasted playing Mary's stepmother, however. Making a very funny cameo as a redneck named Sea Bass is hockey player Cam Neely, and Lin Shaye, who became a repertory player in the Farrellys' next two pictures, appears briefly.At the least, you can say that a movie like this DOES live up to its title. And this viewer had a pleasant time revisiting it, and laughing at some of the ridiculous dialogue. ""I got robbed by a sweet old lady on a motorized cart, and didn't even see it coming."" Carrey and Daniels do share an excellent chemistry, and do appear to be having a great time; they're believable as best buds.Overall, good fun, beginning and ending in just the right way to demonstrate how clueless our protagonists are.Followed by an animated series, a prequel, and a sequel.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dumb and Dumber,"In my opinion the greatest comedy ever made! Daniels and Carrey work magic together in this film that more than 20 years later is finally considered a classic. When it first came out it was labeled as complete garbage and toilet humour. But to those people I say it is the best garbage and toilet humour you could ask for. What do you expect to see when the title of the film is ''Dumb and Dumber''. The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your'e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity. It's because of this reason that I am able to watch this movie countless times and still be entertained, as I listen to funny remarks that I missed on the previous 100 viewings. What's truly great about this film is that even people who say they hate it will always without fail crack a laugh or two when re-watching it. They just don't want to admit that they find this nonsense to be funny...but it is. More than 20 years later and I still have not seen a buddy comedy that comes close to matching it.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun and disconcerting film with slapstick humor and extremely hilarious situations,"An amusing and entertaining film about two odd and moronic guys . The picture narrates the various pranks , mayhem, mischiefs , frolics and lots of mugging carried out by the outlandish couple . This one will definitively not appeal to the stuffy critic or arthouse snob. An offbeat story of sex-minded people , dealing with brainless youthful and made with total craziness. The movie talks upon the adventures and misfortunes of two no-brain , quirk youngsters , Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) . They are idiot pals who are continuously doing jokes and seeing lustfully by the opposite sex . Both of whom travel in a strange Sheep dog Van from Rhode Island to Aspen , Colorado to return a briefcase full of cash to gorgeous socialite (Lauren Holly) . Along the way they attempt to solve problems without success . The average person uses 10% of their brain capacity. Imagine what he could do with 1%. What the one doesn't have, the other is missing. If they each had half a brain, together they would still only have half a brain. For Harry and Lloyd every day is a no-brainer.This funny film mingles irony , chuckles , giggles , dirty comedy , numerous sex jokes all sorts of gross-out humor and bodily function . And of course , there's very bad taste , being the extreme when happen the incrediblely embarrassing scenes on the crap in the bathroom . It will provide full of laughters , nevertheless ridiculously rendered , for everyone else . Jim Carrey mugs shamelessly and Daniels proves a convincing dimwit sidekick . The comedy is cheesy and gross-out but has some nice moments here and there . The film is an embarrassing and absurd mess , the plot is ridiculous and silly , being formed by several humor set pieces , though quite a few absurd and disagreeable , at times . There are some steamy hot scenes and some memorable and hilarious happenings of dirty humor which will rejoice the rogue aficionados to these kinds of things . Neither the players , nor the filmmaking seem to be extraordinary, and the storyline is utterly non-sense , but , curiously , it has some amusing moments and I found myself laughing in some times of the movie . The film benefits itself from two sympathetic starring : Jim Carrey , Jeff Daniels who are great comedy actors . Along with a pretty good secondary cast , such as : Teri Garr, Mike Starr , Karen Duffy , Charles Rocket , Harland Williams , Felton Perry , Lin Shaye . The motion picture was professionally directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, though it has several flaws , gaps and bad taste . Occasional ¨Seinfeld¨ writers Peter and Bobby Farrely make their directorial debut . Following a long string of hits , such as : Kingpin , The Heartbreak Kid , Shallow Hal , Osmosis Jones , Me, Myself and Irene , Green Book , among others.Followed by a below average prequel regarding their adolescence , an awful turkey , bottom of barrel movie titled ¨Dumb and dumber : When Harry met Lloyd¨2003 , made without solvency dealing with the beginning their acquaintance , starred by Eric Christian Olsen, Derek Richardson , and their parents : Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman , in addition , Rachel Nichols , Eugene Levy , William Lee Scott , Shia Labeouf and Lin Shaye was the only cast member to star in both the original Dumb and Dumber .

Will most likely continue to be the funniest movie of all time.,"Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be! It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give the greatest comedic performances and form the best duo that has ever graced a screen. Every scene, every sentence they speak, and every body movement is pure genius. The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too ""intelligent"" for a ""dumb movie"" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances. To those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the roles that they were meant to play.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dumb and Dumber is a classic,"The purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh, and there is a moment in ""Dumb and Dumber"" that made me laugh so loudly I embarrassed myself. I just couldn't stop. It's the moment involving the kid who gets the parakeet. But because I know that the first sentence of this review is likely to be lifted out and reprinted in an ad, I hasten to add that I did not laugh as loudly again, or very often. It's just as well. If the whole movie had been as funny as that moment, I would have required hospitalization. The movie is more silliness from Jim Carrey, who is beginning to grow on me. It's strange. His mannerisms, instead of becoming more wearisome from film to film, grow more endearing. I hated him in ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" enjoyed him in ""The Mask,"" and felt positively fond of him here. He plays a limousine driver whose roommate (Jeff Daniels) runs a dog-grooming service, although business is bad for both of them and they live in a dump. After developments that will be familiar to students of sitcom and other formula comedy, Carrey and Daniels find themselves heading west in their dogmobile (a van that looks like a shaggy dog). For Jeff Daniels, the role is a departure from his usual deadpan comedy roles and straight drama. He fits right in. The relationship between the two guys creates a lot of the fun, as they discuss their grim lifestyle and their bizarre plans to improve it. The elements are here for a better movie, and Jim Carrey, I am now convinced, is a true original. In ""The Mask,"" he had the screenplay and production to back him up. Here, the filmmaking is more uncertain.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""Dumb and Dumber"" is really ""Funny and Funnier""","This movie goes from joke to joke constantly and never misses a beat. I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it, and the tenth time I saw it, and the hundredth time I saw it. This movie never gets old. There is not one single dull moment. The movie takes off and never lets up, not even enough to let you breathe. There is something absolutely mesmerizing and hilarious about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' performances as the lovable idiots Lloyd Christmas( Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels).The movie starts out in Providence, Rhode Island with two guys who are down on their luck. They've just lost their jobs, are late on the gas bill(again), and make the best of a bad situation by returning a briefcase they've recovered to its rightful owner, an attractive woman named Mary (Lauren Holly). And Lloyd(Carrey), has fallen madly in love with Mary after driving her to the airport. It just so happens that Mary lives all the way across the country, in Aspen, Colorado (or is it California?) Sure its crazy and stupid, but they've got nothing to lose, so they take off in their 84' sheepdog. And let's face it, if we were them, we'd go too.Dumb and Dumber was not pretentious, the actors never made you feel like they were in on the joke. No, they played it with a straight face the whole way through, and that's really the best way to do comedy. Even when they aren't speaking, their body language alone is enough to elicit huge laughs. The reactions and facial expressions are perfect.The film wasn't warmly received by a lot of critics, but only because they couldn't lower their snouts long enough to realize that this was not another movie about dumb guys, but really a film about earnest guys. And they are pathetically funny just being themselves. They play stupid games in the car to pass the time, and sing aloud to keep from getting bored, and have crazy dreams of one day opening up a worm store.The movie plays out with a high spirit and feel good attitude that can't be matched. And the soundtrack is perfect; it really sets the tone and never feels out of place.Really, truly, without a doubt, the best comedy ever made. I will treasure this movie forever, and even when I watch it the 101st time, I know it'll make me laugh... and laugh... and laugh till it hurts.The film is well paced and has a spontaneous nature that lacks in most comedies. Behind all the stupidness, there is a real glow of brilliance. The fact is, more than all the goofiness and crazy antics, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a film full of smarts, and that's what we end up admiring the most.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Don't watch the extended version, the cuts happened for a reason","I thought this was one of the funniest comedy movie of all time when it first came out. It's a bit outdated now and just not as funny as I remembered it. But it still works and the dumb elements didn't really get to the point where it's more annoying than it actually being funny. Jim Carrey gags are getting old now, but I could tell why it was such a hit back in the 90's. This has got to be one of the best duo to be in a comedy flick. If you like immature and yet at least somewhat amusing comedy, this one is most definitely worth a watch. While watching this for the 3rd time after a long period of not seeing it. I got a few chuckles out of it, but didn't find it all that funny. But I give credit for the comedic value when it first came out. I mean that laxative joke has been used over and over again after this movie. I am not sure if they are the pioneers of that joke, but they sure made it a hit in comedy flick to come afterwards. This is most definitely one of the movies that kick started Jim Carrey's career.7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny For A While,"This is one of those films you can watch, and actually laugh at for a time or two, but after that, it's just not funny anymore.For a first viewing, this flick will deliver some genuine belly laughs, although you will feel your intelligence slip, as you enjoy it. Watch this one only for the chuckles. If you watch it for any other reason, you're watching the wrong movie.One of Carrey's better performances. His earlier works are far better, comedically, than are his later works. I like the genre change he seems to be experimenting with of late, and I hope it does something to rejuvenate the quality of his performances. Either way, this is quite entertaining, if only for a few run-throughs.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Hands down, the funniest movie ever made","Saw it a hundred times, and from crying in laughter to making your stomach hurt from laughing so hard, it is one of the funniest movies of all time. Caught it again recently for the over one hundredth time and tried to view it as an older skeptic, and I laughed even harder at scenes that originally were not as funny as the funniest ones. It's just an infallible, brilliant comedy that pushes the envelope just enough without going too far like some recent imitator movies of it have done.It's just nonstop laughs, incredible editing and pacing to never stop being funny, and once you think you've seen the funniest scenes, it just keeps getting funnier and delivering all the way up to the end and epilogue. This is imo easily the funniest movie ever made, and nothing really comes close to it. It's hard to believe, but it actually has a good, coherent backstory plot too, which also allows the supporting cast to shine in their minor comedy roles as well while making the story actually make sense. It never gets old.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Incredibly stupid and crude...but also, at times, pretty funny.","""Dumb and Dumber"" is a film that was fabulously successful. Although it cost $17,000,000, it ended up grossing $247,000,000!! Talk about a huge payoff for the Farrelly Brothers!The story is about Lloyd and Harold (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels)--two complete idiots who are roommates. When a passenger in Lloyd's limo leaves a briefcase behind, he vows to return it to her. There are two huge problems with this. First, this occurred in Rhode Island and she now is in Aspen! Second, although Lloyd thought she left it by accident, it was ransom money...and now he and Harold have it and mobsters are after them!Much of the humor was stupid--the sort of stuff middle school kids would love. However, I must admit that although much of the humor was awful, sometime is still made me laugh. Plus, the film ended well. So, I do recommend it BUT must point out that it is NOT for anyone wanting cleverness. Nope...crude humor, bad jokes and embarrassing moments...that's what you'll find and you, too, might laugh a bit like I did.By the way, for the love of God, do NOT watch the sequel ""Dumb and Dumberer"". None of the original writers, directors or actors are in it and it is a total bomb....and currently is on IMDB's notorious Bottom 100 list.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Lives up to its title and then some...,"I realize I'm in the minority by not being a gushing fan of potty humor and a lot of scatological and very graphic sound effects, but DUMB AND DUMBER is definitely a movie that clicked with its targeted audience. And I can't ignore the fact that JIM CARREY and JEFF DANIELS have the ability to mug with the best of them, both showing lots of dexterity with comic material that they play to the hilt.But the film is a series of sight and sound gags more than a tightly constructed plot and it's just a matter of time before the Beavis and Butt-head type of guys driving cross country to return a valuable suitcase to its pretty owner (LAUREN HOLLY) would drive any normal person insane with their stupidity.The joke with the state trooper is probably the low point of all the tasteless humor, but here too, I'm sure I'm in the minority. Seems to be the highlight for others inclined to view potty humor as nothing more than harmless fun.If this sort of low comedy appeals to you, it's a funfest of crude jokes and imbecilic humor. It's either a comic masterpiece or a dud of titanic proportions, depending on your point of view.Carrey won a ""Razzie"" award as worst new star--although I don't agree with that designation at all. He's obviously a hyperactive, manic personality who can give Robin Williams a run for his money--and Daniels, too, is a talented chap.

Funniest Farrley's Brother movie you will ever see...,"It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels team up as the not just odd, but strange, weird and mentally disabled couple.After losing both of their jobs on the same day, Lloyd (Carrey), who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal, encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.From their start in Rhode Island, until they arrive in Aspen, the kidnappers follow Harry (Daniels)and Lloyd, along the road. The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.Their are more than a few funny scenes, and the dialogue is always right-on.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies, or anyone who likes Jim Carrey.

"Utterly moronic, but very funny","I feel like an idiot for liking this movie, but I do. I normally can't stand brainless gross-out comedies, but this one I found just twisted and edgy enough to make me laugh.Unlike most fans, however, I didn't find Jim Carrey all that funny. As with ACE VENTURA (which I hated), he bugs his eyes, waves his arms, screams, flails, and seems to think he's simply hilarious, when he's actually little more than amusing (if not a tad annoying).The highlight of this movie is Jeff Daniels. He's done comedy before, but never this broad, as he usually plays the straight man to someone else. Here, though, he turns in a brilliant comic performance that blows Carrey off the screen. The infamous diarrhea scene could have simply been nothing more than a gross potty humor joke for eight year olds, but Daniels turns it into a slapstick masterpiece that would make Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards proud.Unfortunately, the success of this movie (and Daniels' newfound popularity because of it) led him to star in such lame-brained romps as TRIAL AND ERROR, 101 DALMATIONS and MY FAVORITE MARTIAN. Hopefully he'll get back on track and do some real acting again. But DUMB AND DUMBER, like it or not, will forever be one of his very best performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Surprisingly smart 'lowbrow' entertainment.,"Despite its title, 'Dumb And Dumber (1994)' is a surprisingly smart comedy that does admittedly have its fair share of 'stupid' and toilet-based humour but is by no means a 'no-brains' experience. It certainly took a lot of thought and a lot of craft, not least of all to convincingly create core characters as lovably and utterly 'dumb' yet unwittingly lucky without them being as consistently grating as the 'most annoying sound in the world'. Its the height of the Farrelly brothers' career, before they descended into crassness for the sake of crudity, and proves that they were able to produce some pretty highbrow lowbrow entertainment, perhaps despite their reputation. It also represents somewhat of a high point in both Carrey and Daniels' careers, proving that neither were unwilling to take a risk that could've resulted in them looking literally and figuratively foolish, though it is by no means either of their best work.

Played Strictly For Laughs,"It's hard to believe this was out over a decade ago, but it was another in a long line (past few decades) of crude comedies....BUT one of the better ones regarding some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.The ""classic"" of the funny scenes, at least to most men including me, is poor Jeff Daniels on the toilet. No need to go into details! As crazy as Jim Carrey got in some of his earlier movies (Ace Ventura, Liar, Liar, etc) he's actually lower-key than in some of the other stupid-guy roles he played, one reason because he's doesn't shout in here. I didn't find the female lead in here, Lauren Holley, to be appealing but that's just my opinion.In modern-day slapstick, it means one basic thing: gross out your audience, so that's what is attempted here. When it works, it's very funny, such as that bathroom scene.. One thing for sure: the language makes this an R-rated film, not PG-13. Speaking of jokes, that PG-13 rating has become a joke.Anyway, you should get a lot of laughs out this: at least I suspect males will more than females....and that's all it was meant for - laughs, and nothing else - so don't trash the film because it wasn't ""intelligent"" enough for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

With the year 2000 breathing down our necks, I think it's safe for me to give this movie the ""Best Comedy Of The 90's"" award. On a final note, this movie kinda makes you feel all good inside as well.  Think about it:  two dumb morons who are plagued by bad luck all throughout their life just say ""screw this"" and drive across the country to Aspen to give a beautiful girl back her briefcase while encountering many perils along the way.

Great Comedy,"Back in the 1990s, there was something called talent, and Jim Carrey had it for a while. Jeff Daniels had talent already, but wanted to try comedy, as he'd been in mostly dramas up to this point. But the two of them together made a great comedy duo. And the direction from Peter and Bobby Farrelly made Dumb and Dumber the hit that it is.If you've never seen this film, you're in for a treat and you'll laugh a lot. The antics and hijinks are hilarious. Essentially, Dumb and Dumber is a road movie, as Harry and Lloyd venture cross country in their van, a 1984 Sheep Dog! The costars and cameos make the film even better, with Victoria Rowell from Diagnosis Murder being the best and most memorable.If you have the chance, see this film and make sure you see the extended version.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"I liked it, others may not...","... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them.  No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors.  I personally found it refreshing that the movie asked no requirement of me other than that I be able to laugh.  This I did, loudly and frequently.A final note on who I consider to be the main star of the show.  It ain't Carrey.  Jim, of course, does what we expect him to do.  However, it is Daniels - in an achingly funny turn - who surprises, and in doing so effortlessly steals the movie from under the nose of the rubberfaced loon standing beside him.  It may have something to do with the fact that Harry is (marginally) the more subtle of the two characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Gross, quirky and weird","Now how does that sound? And I may not even have gotten all of the ""bad"" things one can say about this movie. But it is also hillarious and super funny! Which is a testament to the two main actors, who are actually anything close to not being intelligent! And both relish in their roles respectively. The sequel that came years later (the official one, not the prequel one) was funny too, but showed that you can't catch lightning in a bottle. I think that's the saying, right? Maybe not, but whatever the case is, this is a classic.Of course as with all comedies it is in the eye of the beholder. Some things here can be seen as annoying or unfunny (as the bird joke shows, which also is quite mean to say the least). I rewatched this recently and it holds up, if you let it just work its magic. Don't think too much, just enjoy the many memorable scenes and some of the quotes ... and how the movie perfectly ends ... the way it kind of began",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dumb Happens,"Hoping to return an abandoned briefcase to a beautiful woman he drove to the airport, a limousine driver takes his best friend on a cross country trip, unaware that he is being pursued by angry kidnappers in this comedy starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. As per the title, the running gag is that the friends are incredibly stupid - and oblivious to the fact that the briefcase contains a hefty ransom. The film gets its best laughs from the kidnappers coming to believe that the pair are highly trained assassins and criminal masterminds; their ignorance towards being pursued is also often funny with the pair leaving a note to the ""gas man"", which the kidnappers think is written to them and so on. What does not work so well are the simple scenes of the pair acting stupid. From blowing their noses on $100 bills to getting their tongues stuck on cold surfaces, it is all pretty groan-inducing stuff. There is an overabundance of toilet humour too (the cop taking a drink scene is very funny though). Daniels also gets far better laughs than Carrey. The way Daniels manages to keep a straight face while saying things like his pet bird's ""head fell off"" is far more amusing than Carrey's excessive mugging. Thorns and all though, this is entertaining stuff while it lasts. The gags may vary in effectiveness but the leads are always vibrant and full of energy with a very genuine chemistry between them.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fun for a while,"Dumb and Dumber is one of those films I watched when I was a kid. I watched it up until Lloyd was daydreaming at the wheel of the car about his dreamgirl, Mary and then shut it off. I liked it up until the state of events about the bumbling crooks, the suitcase full of money, etc. I didn't want the film to be about that. I wanted it to be about two idiots getting into trouble. Not all this serious crap going on.Now that it's been about eight years since I've seen it, I appreciate the film a bit more now. The first forty five minutes of the film are very entertaining and very funny. I laughed a lot in that time frame. Then once the film gets more and more about the crooks, and less about the antics of the two goofball leads I started to care less and less about the outcome.The plot: Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are two slackers who are trying to save enough money to go into business selling worm related novelties and ""worm-farms."" Lloyd is a limo driver, and Harry is a dog-groomer. One day, while taxiing a beautiful women to the airport (Holly), Lloyd noticed she leaves a suitcase on the ground (purposely). The suitcase was left for two henchman to have. Lloyd swoops in and retrieves the case much to the dismay of the henchman who now believe Lloyd works for someone who is planning to disrupt their plan.Lloyd and Harry aren't aware that they are prey to two dangerous henchman, so they now go on a trip from Rhode Island to Aspen to give the beautiful women her suitcase back. Which obviously leads to slapsticky antics by both of the leads.The jokes are hit or miss, but there are scenes like at the diner and when the guys get pulled over that I can help but laugh at. They are right up my alley those kind of scenes. My favorite line in the film is when Harry and Lloyd go to Nebraska instead of Aspen. Both are expecting to see The Rocky Mountains, but seeing Nebraska is flat as a board Jim Carrey states ""John Denver is full of s**t, man!"" Had me laughing out loud for minutes. Both Carrey and Daniels give surprisingly great performances. I say surprisingly because I'm rather not too fond of Jim Carrey because in many of his films he seems to be off his own medicine, or just running around like a dumbass for ninety minutes. In this film he does a rather humorous role, and is actually a pleasure to have on screen.I would give this film a better review it had been about the two trying to start their own business. I'm rather not too fond of the film's plot because I don't care about the goofs trying to flee from thugs. The whole joke is that they don't know they're prey, and are pretty much going with the flow on the whole trip. If the film would've played like a better comedy instead of throwing this ho-hum plot at us maybe I would've appreciated it more.Dumb and Dumber is good slapstick material, but it doesn't compete to slapstick gold like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Black Sheep is one of my favorite films, and has one of my favorite actors in it too, Chris Farley obviously. Dumb and Dumber was said to put The Farrelly Brothers on the map. This was followed by films like Me, Myself & Irene and There's Something About Mary. Who would've thought that a movie about two dopes would've gave two brothers a successful career. That is so dumb, fo' real.Starring: Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and Lauren Holly. Directed by: Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fitting Title,"Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as ""Yes Man"" and ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective."" While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Jim Carrey does his stuff like only he knows how, but it is Dumb, rather than Dumber, who takes the biggest plaudits. Jeff Daniels makes mince meat out of some of the scripts best lines (""She fed me some crap about not listening to her, I dunno, I wasn't really paying attention""). There are wonderful site gags (checkout Lloyd's plunge onto the airport floor) and magnificently delivered lines. Some of the material doesn't leave much in the way of subtlety (one moment involving a toilet and a laxative), but as crude humour goes, it's hard to fault. And unlike so many comedies before it, D & D manages to stay true to its material until the very end, eschewing soppy feel goods for dumb, and then some.

Moron bro-mance,"Slightly uneven, yet fitfully funny comedy about an inseparable pair of dimwits (Carrey and Daniels) who stumble upon a brief case full of tainted cash and then attempt to return it to its owner, living in Aspen. Pursued by mobsters, police and hindered by their own incompetence, the pair eventually find Aspen and the owner of the brief-case (Holly - with whom both men become enamoured) only to find themselves unwittingly the target of a murderous extortionist.There's some great scenes along the way, including the truck-stop bully at the diner, then again in the service station toilet, the patrol officer who takes an ill-advised swig from a tainted beer bottle and though entirely unrelated to the story, the immortal scene where a bus-load (literally) of bikini models offer the pair the dream job as oil-boys. Daniels is surprisingly humorous considering he's not essentially known as a comedian, while Carrey is, fortunately, more restrained than at times in other movies. Teri Garr, Felton Perry and Hank Brandt have minor supporting roles, adding some depth to the cast.A decent soundtrack developed by Todd Rundgren contains some memorable tunes, not least of all by The Cowsills and Rundgren himself, and the tone of the picture is generally pleasant and easy-going. Nothing too distasteful or gratuitous and so long as you watch it in the right frame of mind, should keep you entertained. There's plenty of conjecture over the tone of the ending - not the crowd-pleaser you might expect - and though frustrating, it's consistent with the narrative and probably just what needed to happen.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Carrey-d away....,"Did you ever get the feeling that sometimes an actor is so full of himself that he forgets the movie and kind of goes off on his own tangent, never to return?That's what I got from ""Dumb and Dumber"", which basically features Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, two men who are good actors and have been in some of may favorite movies, acting like complete idiots and somehow never getting institutionalized for their actions.I know, I know....  There are people who love this movie and think that Carrey can do no wrong and since bodily function humor is the soup du jour (so to speak), ""Dumb"" is their cup of tea (so to speak again).But in spite of some very inspired moments (an escalating fight in the snow between Daniels and Holly, the fantasy restaurant fight, the unfortunate demise of the hitman, the parakeet), there are more moments of just downright stupidity than anything else.And the scenes with the cop (you know the one) and the out-of-order toilet just are put there, I think, to make ones jaw drop at how far movies will go nowadays.  There's no real humor in what's going on and, in spite of their big following as ""the biggest laugh scenes of all time"", they kind of fall flat.  They happen then they're gone.As far as Carrey and Daniels, they basically just play two guys who act stupid and fail to use common sense.  No character traits, just stupidity.

Dumb with a capital 'B',"Hollywood has been accused of dumbing down comedy over the last couple of decades, and if anyone in particular could be held accountable for this trend it would be The Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter, who between them have been responsible for some of the most puerile, bad taste, gross out comedies ever made. All I can say is 'God bless 'em both', 'cos I'll take a good poo gag over dry wit or a clever play on words any day of the week.In Dumb and Dumber, the film that first brought the brothers' manic brand of inane humour to the public's attention, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play best pals Lloyd and Harry, a couple of morons who take a road trip to Aspen to return a briefcase to pretty socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), unaware that in doing so they are risking their lives.Although this might not be the best of the Farrelly's outrageous comedies (that honour would go to There's Something About Mary or Kingpin), it sure is the dumbest: the plot is dumb, the jokes are dumb, and the characters are dumb... and dumber. If jokes about blind children, boobies, gay truckers, and uncontrollable bowel movements make you bust a gut, then come on down... this'll give your chuckle muscles a more than satisfying workout! If, on the other hand, you find amusement from more sophisticated material, like those movies by neurotic New Yorker Woody Harrelson, then give Dumb and Dumber a wide berth, 'cos it is dumb with a capital 'B'.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A well-deserved sleeper hit,"Even after its huge success, I can still say this movie is not for all tastes.  But, like almost any Farrelly Brothers movie, the tastelessness factor gets elevated to a work of art.  Of course, it's hard to visualize anything involving Jeff Daniels accidentally taking a gulp of Turbo-Lax and having the worst case of diarrhea (which I believe is the pinnacle of the film, and will ALWAYS make me laugh again and again and again) art, but if you look at the word in a figurative sense and observe how the Farrelys handle each situation with perfect timing and delivery--you'll get what I'm saying.  The Farrelys are underrated geniuses in the comedy genre, who sometimes tend to overdose on the crudeness, but their style of humor is often effective.  Peter and Bobby (Farrely) are aware that these characters are dumb and don't use it as an excuse to have the audiences laughing at them, rather than with them.  Of course, there are moments--like the jalapeno scene where Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are squirting mustard and ketchup into their mouths--that are just plain...dumb.  But this is not a hit-or-miss comedy.  The misses happen only on occasion; the hits happen very often.  The plot is very original.  I'm sure the concept of two simple minds with almost nothing to live for is a concept that's been used before, but it's the way the concept is handled that makes it special.  Most of the time I was either laughing or laughing relentlessly.  Another memorable moment is the Harland Williams, urine-sipping cameo.  That is bound to make you laugh 'til you're senseless!One minor flaw I found was the soundtrack:  a compilation of melancholy, easy listening crap that would've been appropriate for a seventies melodrama.  I felt the music brought down the mood a tad.  Other than that, the combination of original writing, slick direction and a stellar cast (including some Farrely favorites) is quite a delight.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Fun but not funnier,"Dumb and Dumber is regarded as a classic of the stupid, simpleton type of comedies. Its unusual casting because although Jim Carrey was an upcoming comedy actor, his co-star Jeff Daniels was known for serious film roles.Despite the gross stupidity on display our two protagonists have heart.Lloyd (Jim Carrey) drives a woman to the airport and retrieves a bag she left at the terminal, with his friend Harry (Jeff Daniels) they go to Aspen to deliver it.However the woman was delivering a ransom as her husband was kidnapped and Lloyd took the bag just before the kidnappers could get it. The kidnappers follow our hapless heroes.Twenty years ago this was very funny and influential leading to a glut of similar but more gross comedies.

As it stands they`re both stupid , they both sport ridiculous hairstyles and they`re both in love with the same women and that`s about all the character naunces we get .

It is good to see that the Farrelly brothers improved this protagonist flaw with their next movie KINGPIN and hit the button with THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY by having the main characters play everything straight in comedy situationsAll in all DUMB AND DUMBER is a fairly good comedy ( A genre I usually despise ) let down somewhat with silliness .

"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""Dumb and Dumber""","Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are two very funny men and together create one of the Farrely brothers greatest hits. They take a great title and no concept and turn it into an adventure- comedy. The plot is well dumb, Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels) are two childhood friends who are struggling to open their pet store specializing in worms, that they will call I Got Worms. One day Lloyd takes a women named Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) to the airport so she can go to Aspen, Colorado. As soon as Lloyd sees her he falls madly in love with her. Little does he know that she has left some ransom money at the airport and Lloyd saves the day by picking up the money. Harry and Lloyd decide to go to Aspen on vacation and take the money back to her and on the road to Aspen, chaos ensues. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels make a great creative team along with the Farrely brothers and they play off of each other. As for Lauren Holly, she does great with what she is given. The movie kind of drags a little bit in the end, but ends well. All in all a comedy classic.2 1/2 out of 4 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Little does he know that she left it deliberately for a couple of kidnappers as ransom.This is the Farrelly brothers' first and possibly best hit. Over the years, I have seen this movie many times and every time I have gut busting laughs. The gags work no matter how many times you see it. Jim Carrey is at his hilarious best. And Jeff Daniels is surprising nimble with this outlandish material. The best part is their chemistry together. They have that playful friendship that allows the viewers to laugh at the ridiculousness.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I laughed a lot ... I face-palmed a lot more...,"At least the title is honest. ""Dumb and Dumber"" says what it says about the film, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) are grown-ups with the brains of sixth graders and are so incomparably stupid that there's no need to scratch your head to determine who's supposed to be dumber. Still, I'm partial to Harry being the lesser one because unlike Carrey, Daniels adds a subtle level of likability while Carrey is channelling the obnoxiousness of his Ace Ventura and the troll-attitude of the Mask. However, that Harry seems the most sensitive doesn't say much, he didn't invent hot water either.What the title also indicates is that there's no need to look for a plot, just plug yourself in the mind of an immature teenager and let the magic of stupid laughs operate. It takes time until we're embarked in that cross-country road trip to Aspen, and their stupidity gets more tolerable. So we get the usual halts in shabby motels, gas stations, altercations with blasé waitresses and hunky truck drivers, a stolen briefcase that reveals its secret at the right moment, later, we have a trip in one of Aspen's finest hotel, a dead owl, and one of the delights of the film is the way the bad guys (especially Mike Starr as Mental) believe they must be pros because no one can be that dumb.What the Farrelly brothers do is take very familiar material and use it as a clothesline to hang on it the dumbest stuff they could find. It's not much a plot than a pot where every improvisation is thrown into, an excuse for the lamest possible gag, reminding you of that kid who went as far as asking the prettiest girl in class to pull his finger and make his buddies laugh (even if it meant losing any possible chance with girls). It takes some guts to be that dumb and an extra level to base an entire movie premise on two irremediably stupid characters but that was a risk the brothers (in their film debut) were willing to take.Maybe it was a safe calculation after all, if you've got the best comedian of his generation who already proved to be bankable, how about letting him going in total control and see where it goes and if 60% of the gags must work, then throw as many gags as you can. They say quality matters more than quantity but not when you have that quantity : Harry and his mountain sheperd clad dog, Lloyd playing a lousy casanova as a limo driver, urinations on beer bottles, pranks involving mustard on burgers, fart jokes, toilet jokes, Bruce Lee imitations and so forth.There are so also many moments of gratuitous and unbearable noises that I felt like Mental being trapped between Harry and Lloyd, and started wondering who was the bad guy. These moments, as funny as they were, made me genuinely appreciate the quieter parts where they seemed to pull themselves together and stop acting like prankish children. But these moments never lasted long and I think it's fair to say that there's not one minute going in the film without at least three gags and three stupid things done, and at the very least, you get a grimace from Carrey's rubber-made face.But then again, Harry and Lloyd reach such heights of manic stupidity that I started to appreciate Jeff Daniels a little more not because I prefer him, but because Carrey is such an induspated talent who had nothing to prove after his ""Mask"" and ""Ace Ventura"" that it's a remarkable achievement to steal his thunder. Some of the funniest moments involve Daniels and I don't think he got the credit he deserves. And that might be the reason he tried to bring some sensitivity to the plot, as if it was the only way to compete with Carrey, being stupid in a touching way. And let's face it, the film is designed as a platform to let the machine Carrey go in total free style mode with as much imprvosation as he can afford but being touching wasn't his strongest suit, not yet, wait for ""Liar, Liar"" and ""The Truman Show"", for that.Indeed, it was still 1994 and Carrey's acting needed more polishing or better scripts. The problem with the 'stupid' angle is that it's so overplayed that I found myself facepalming more than laughing, chuckling more than laughing and some bits are so hilarious that other appear as totally uninspired. I wasn't too sure that Lauren Holly needed her skirt to be lifted by Jim Carrey. I'm not sure that the second appearance of Sea Bass was the Karmic comeback we expected. I'm not sure the urination gag had the best outcome. And I think the ending with the top models left me cringing more than laughing. The film relied too much on Carrey being carried away and Daniels following him that it didn't suspect that a little less could have been a little more, that a few reliefs were needed and that some of the best gags didn't involve any of the dumb and the dumber one.Ebert said he almost got hospitalized with the dead bird gag, I felt the same with the phone booth 'falcon' punch.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Possibly Jim Carrey's best movie,"Dumb and Dumber is such a funny movie. I love everything about this movie, from the performances to the directing. This movie always makes me laugh every time I watch it. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play off of each other amazingly. Their comedic moments shine so bright of every minute of the movie. The writing is also very good. The Farrelly Brothers did a very good job making their first movie, and it's one of their only good movies if I'm being honest. Dumb and Dumber is a great movie.

Wouldn't have been anything if it wasn't for Jim Carrey's amazing talent(s)...,"I have to say, this movie really would have been bad if it Jim Carrey hadn't been in it. Every single scene without him is hardly funny; Jeff Daniels if miles away from Jim talent-wise. Jim can make you laugh with a simple movement of his face, whereas Jeff hardly could make me laugh at all. The script does put the two in some pretty funny situations, but hadn't it been for Carrey, the movie would have been very bad. I especially thought the dream/fantasy sequences with Carrey very unbelievably funny; they really let him display his full talents, making extremely funny facial expressions and hilarious noises. This movie holds a few of the greatest moments with Carrey that's on film(in my not particularly humble opinion, at least), but apart from those few truly great scenes, the movie isn't all that funny; as mentioned earlier, especially the scenes with Daniels were usually barely funny at all. I would recommend any fan of Carrey to watch this, at least to watch the few very memorable, incredibly funny scenes in which he shows his potential. It has a lot of crude humor though, and a lot of it is downright disgusting, especially if you're not used to that sort of humor, but apart from that, it's just barely worth watching for any fan of Jim Carrey. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A classic!,"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star in this hilarious classic that launched the careers of Carrey and directors Peter & Bobby Farrelly. The gags are crude and tasteless, the comedic performances by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are great, the music is excellent, the dialogue is sharp, and throughout the entire 101 minute running time, the laughs never stop. It's part buddy road movie, part crime comedy, and part slapstick all rolled into one. Despite all these different elements, the film never feels uneven. This is one of the rare comedies that can be watched over and over again without getting old. There are so many jokes that I catch a few that I missed every time I watch it.

"Quite crude, but still laugh-out-loud funny.","That's right. Every day is a no-brainer for these two clutzesque clowns. Carrey is as funny as ever, this time playing a stupid rather than a sort of psycho wiseguy. His goofy appearance, including the masterpiece chipped tooth is enough of a cue for pants-wetting, floor-stamping laughter. If you can't decide whether or not to watch this film, trust me- just watch the first 30 seconds. You'll be hooked straight away. No probs. Jeff Daniels' performance is also faultless as Carrey's sidekick. The humour is sometimes crude and vulgar, however. There are a couple of token toilet humour scenes which definitely cross the line.The first half of the film is much better than the second, with the scenes in the guys' apartment really hitting the mark.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Yes!,"Basically, this films contains a certain brand of humour. And you either love it or you dont. I happen to love it and thus i find this film immensely funny.The main thing which makes it stand out from other comedies is the fact that it manages to sustain a consistently high level of humour throughout the film. At no time does it drag, as is often the case with most comedies thesedays. Films like Theres Something About Mary tend to have their funny, laugh-out-loud moments but they are few and far between.Carrey and Daniels play off each other very well. I think this film works extremely well for Carrey (a generally comedic actor) because its not all about him and he is not always relied upon to make the audience laugh, unlike in Ace Ventura where he is forced to be the constant source of humour which thus makes it harder to sustain such a high level of humour. Daniels has his fair share of one-liners and so this periodically helps to take the focus away from Carrey which is probably a good thing because his unique style of humour is not always to everyones taste!All in all, this is a very funny film which is extremely quotable and that is always the sign of a good film (one that sticks in your head).

"I thought the Rockies were a lot less flat? -- Me too.  That John Denver is full of sh*t, man!","I didn't like this one much when it came out, but I've changed my mind. It's a great, funny, very entertaining movie. That said, I'd still hold that it's not anywhere near being the ""best comedy ever"", as claimed by some fanboys here on IMDb, or even the best Farrelly Bros. movie. That would be asking too much, it being, after all, their first feature movie, and as a consequence still a bit rough around the edges. Namely the plot is a bit on the thin side in that it consists of little more than our two likable losers traveling halfway across the US of A (a nomial distance of 2,200 miles, which they manage to ratchet up to at least 3,000) to return a suitcase to a girl, because one of them has ""that old-fashioned feeling, where I'd do anything to bone her"", and then rampage through the city of Aspen.This is because the culmination of the plot, an elaborate kidnapping story, was more or less dumped unceremoniously from the final cut. A very wise choice, as the movie is now essentially a showcase for the perfect comedic duo, the gentle and laid-back Jeff Daniels and the obnoxious-aggressive Jim Carey, in their hilarious quest to cast aspersions on the definition of humans as a sentient species.Jim Carey went on to rise to greater comedic stardom, but Jeff Daniels is just as brilliant here, and a lot more likable.Just as a side note, I always marveled at Carey's brilliant ""chipped tooth prosthetic"", until I read here on IMDb that those are his real pearly whites -- he does actually have a chipped tooth and just took the cap off.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Overrated,"I never thought this was one of the funniest comedies ever, but I found the movie a lot funnier when I was a kid. The Farrelly Brothers are talented writer/directors who have made several funny flicks like ""Kingpin,"" ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Stuck on You."" Though ""Dumb and Dumber"" is probably second to ""Mary"" as far as popularity goes, I think it's one of their lesser flicks. The Farrellys are partially to blame, but I place most of the blame on Jim Carrey. Whoever decided this moron should be paid $25 million a movie should be shot in the head. Jeff Daniels, though less experienced in comedy, gives a much performance in my opinion. Unlike Carrey, he doesn't use the over-the-top, anything-for-a-laugh approach. Instead, he's more concerned with being true to the character. Why does Carrey have to do some goofy eye movement or vocal intonation with every line of dialogue he utters? I always say that the rule of comedy is to act normal in ridiculous situations. In Carrey's case, he prefers to act ridiculous in ridiculous situations. How anyone over the age of 10 can laugh uproariously at a fool like him is beyond me. The film contains its share of funny gags (like the famous toilet scene), but most of them are disgusting or stupid or a mixture of both. One of the most annoying scenes is one where Carrey and Daniels both eat these hot chili peppers. Their mouths start burning, so they squirt ketchup and mustard all over the place, trying to get some into their mouths. And of course, there are other gag-inducing moments, like a man hocking a loogie into someone's burger. I suggest that if you're over the age of 10 and not a sucker for Carrey's incessant mugging, you stay away from this flick. It's simply another overrated comedy.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
painfully funny,"When you're laughing so hard that you start to cry at this movie, when you're thinking about how bad you feel for laughing at this dumb stuff, when you admit to your friends that you liked this movie - hey, don't feel bad! This is funny stuff!! I really liked this movie. Sure, it's no classic (nor is it likely to become one), but if you want a good comedy with some good dialogue and sight gags that make your sides split, this is a good movie to rent.The ONE thing that I think this movie might have needed (and this is not a criticism, just something that could've made it even better) is a straight man to go along with Carrey and Daniels on their trip. Think about it - the scenes with Carrey and Daniels playing pranks on the kidnapper with gas are the funniest scenes of the movie, so if there was a third straight man the whole time, it would be even funnier! The result is that at times, one of the stars seems much dumber than the other, and at other times, vice versa. For example, Daniels is the smart one when Carrey can't read the newspaper, but Carrey is the smart one when he advises Daniels (who has just spilled salt) to throw salt over his shoulder for good luck, but Daniels throws the entire saltshaker. Just a suggestion, this was a very funny movie without the straight man anyway.I've never had so much fun laughing at a couple of brain-dead, perverse idiots.

OUR PETS HEADS ARE FALLING OFF!,"Dumb and Dumber, the uproarious 1994 comedy directed by the Farrelly Brothers, is an absolute riot that earns a solid 9/10 stars, thanks in large part to the unbridled comedic brilliance of Jim Carrey. Carrey's fearless willingness to go all out in his role as the endearingly clueless Lloyd Christmas elevates this film to iconic status. Jeff Daniels, not especially known for comedies, does a great job keeping up with Carrey, creating a comedy duo that no one would've expected to be this hilarious.From the opening scene to the credits, Carrey is an unstoppable force of nature, showcasing a level of physical comedy that is as astonishing as it is side-splitting. His commitment to the absurdity of Lloyd's character is unparalleled, with every exaggerated expression and over-the-top gesture adding layers to the film's hilarity.What sets Dumb and Dumber apart is Carrey's ability to inject genuine heart into the character. Amidst the slapstick humor, there's a pivotal scene where Carrey's comedic facade momentarily fades, revealing Lloyd's vulnerability and sincerity. It's in this unexpected moment that Carrey transcends the typical goofball comedy, showcasing his talent as a versatile actor capable of delivering more than just laughs.The Farrelly Brothers' screenplay provides a perfect canvas for Carrey's comedic prowess. The film's quotability is a testament to the memorable lines and outrageous scenarios that have become embedded in pop culture. Whether it's the unforgettable ""So you're telling me there's a chance?"" or the iconic ""I like it a lot,"" Dumb and Dumber's dialogue remains as fresh and hilarious as ever.The film's enduring popularity is a testament not only to its laugh-out-loud humor but also to Jim Carrey's and Jeff Daniels' indelible mark on the characters of Lloyd and Harry. With its perfect blend of outrageous humor, surprising heart, and unforgettable quotes, Dumb and Dumber stands as a timeless classic in the world of comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Crude, Low-Effort Laughs with an Energetic Headline Duo","The classic saga of two brain-dead numbskulls who undertake a cross country trek to return a ""lost"" ransom briefcase, having mindlessly intercepted it at the drop-off. En route, they blow through sleazy motels and truck stop bathrooms, swapping rides and crossing wires with all manner of similarly dim-witted, off-color characters.Ah man, it's such a Farrelly Brothers movie. Thick-headed humor, as easy and superficial as it comes, with an unrelenting time capsule for a soundtrack and a pair of lead performances so good they lift the whole mess into something that almost transcends mere stupidity. Almost. No two ways about it: this is the Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels show, start to finish. Who else could ad-lib ""the most annoying sound in the world"" into something that's still so funny after thirty years? I certainly can't imagine another duo pulling off those famously terrible peach-and-baby-blue tuxes. The whole film seems to exist as a vehicle for whatever the stars felt like doing or saying that day, with said Farrelly siblings more than happy to let the cameras roll, and we're all the richer for it. Even the throwaway quips are solid gold. Carrey was in the midst of an early career apex at the time, with Ace Ventura and The Mask having already topped the box office that same year, but Daniels is, unexpectedly, there with him every step of the way. It's a showcase of impressively loose, laugh-out-loud physical comedy from a guy who wasn't (and still isn't) known for that type of work.A not-insignificant number of jokes have curdled over time (wow, I did not remember so much homophobia) and there's no escaping the numbing, jaw-dropping idiocy of it all, but the key scenes still stand tall, the sheer force of personality is strong and there's no denying the amount of fun everyone was obviously having on-set.

"""Pills are good, Pills are good.""","With this being a comedy about two rock-stupid guys, I think the Farrelly brothers did a great job at writing out the characters in this movie. Of course, Harry and Lloyd are the stars of this movie, and especially with Lloyd, they're perfect as ""idiots"" in this movie. Like a movie with good character development, Lloyd and Harry have very distinct personalities, and this really makes the movie such a ball to watch. Harry is the least dumb of the two, and has a slightly bigger conscience than Lloyd (though he's capable of doing low things). Lloyd is not only the dumbest of the two, but has a pretty dark personality, since he sells Harry's dead parakeet, Petey, to a blind kid before embarking on their journey to Aspen. Harry and Lloyd are excellent counterparts to Beavis and Butthead. The Farrelly brothers executed the humor very well in this movie. Among the most notable achievements in this area is the fact that they pull off ""gross-out"" humor that's actually funny. I find this a very tricky feat since so much humor of this ilk is done only to gross people out rather than laugh.Mark Irwin's cinematography for this movie is quite superb. The shots of the mountains in Aspen, the somewhat run-down areas in Providence, and other locales in this movie look really good, which strangely go together well with the humor. Carrey's delivery always surpasses just funny or just professional and is subtle maniacal in perfection. There aren't many movies that can make your ribs hurt from laughing, and it takes a certain subtlety in the comedy to push you over the edge into hysterics, but that is exactly what you have in Dumb and Dumber. There were some parts that I had to rewind and watch again half a dozen times just to salvage the subtlety of Carrey's hilarious delivery. Carrey is certainly the focal point of the movie. The plot and his character's side-kick are really just props that Carrey uses to bring about painful laughter in anyone watching, (and I'm sure he is responsible for thousands of people choking on their drink whilst watching this movie). Carrey's partner in comedy is Jeff Daniels, and he matches Carry nearly scene for scene. The two together are fantastically funny. There are too many scenes to mention where they had me bend over laughing. The jokes come about every second minute, so if one does not get your funny bone, another zinger is on its way. There is so much to laugh at in this movie that your stomach muscles will get a good workout!Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A comedy of unmatched absurdity,"""Dumb and Dumber,"" directed by Peter Farrelly, is a quintessential '90s comedy that pairs Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as two of the most delightfully dimwitted characters in film history. Carrey plays Lloyd Christmas and Daniels plays Harry Dunne, two well-meaning but incredibly inept friends who embark on a cross-country road trip to return a briefcase full of money to its rightful owner, unaware of the danger that follows.The film thrives on its slapstick humor and the impeccable comedic timing of its leads. Carrey's over-the-top antics and Daniels' surprising adeptness at physical comedy create a dynamic that is both ridiculous and endearing. The movie is packed with iconic scenes and quotable lines that have cemented its status as a comedy classic.Despite its outlandish plot and sometimes juvenile humor, ""Dumb and Dumber"" manages to deliver genuine laughs and a surprisingly sweet story of friendship.

Well, let's just say they did, a lot of people didn't like this movie because they said it was DUMB. I got to tell you there are some DUMB parts in the movie, but they make the movie hilarious. We all know Harland Williams for his sense of humor, and yes, he does have a great part in the movie, loved his scene with the two lead actors.Jim Carrey plays a limo driver, who drives Lauren Holly to the airport, and he ends up having a crush on her. Lauren leaves a suitcase at the airport and the movie is about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels giving everything up so they can give the suitcase back to Lauren. Will the boys make it in time?

Carrey And Daniels Are Hilarious,"Certainly one of the funniest films of its time, ""Dumb and Dumber"" stars Jim Carrey as Lloyd and Jeff Daniels as Harry, two clueless fools who are friends. The story starts with both men losing their jobs, then becoming involved, unknowingly, in a high-stakes criminal matter.Carrey fills the scenes with his usual rubber-faced antics and impressions. Daniels is up to the challenge, portraying the one who is likely the ""dumber"" of the two. Laughs are plentiful, usually involving physical humor, visual humor, or the stupidity of characters.Lauren Holly plays Mary, the object of Lloyd's obsessions. (Holly and Carrey would later marry.)Much of the action involves a road trip, the setting for many other comedies. It doesn't disappoint. When they share the ride with a hitman, the results are hilarious.How dumb are these two? If you compare them to Steve Martin's ""The Jerk"", they are more juvenile. If you compare them to The Three Stooges, they are in the same ballpark, but they rely less on pratfalls and are less manic.If you are looking for laughs, this film definitely delivers.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Carey at his best,I remember the tender age of 13 when I first saw Dumb &Dumber. I love the way Rubberface plays a dumbass. This movie displays Mr. Carey's talent as a comedian and it's a film you can't help but laugh at. Check it out.,7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A reason to see comedies,"Dumb and Dumber is a hilarious look at two dummies who go across the country to return a briefcase.  During their escapades we see some of the most memorable and humorous scenes of the decade.  Including  a cop drinking a beer bottle full of pee, a blind kid getting a parrokeete without a head, Jeff Daniels taking a monster dump, and many, many other things.  The movie also introduced two film-makers who would also be remembered for There's Something About Mary- Peter and Bobby Farrelly.  They bring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels to the screen in a way I've never seen before, or probably won't again.  A+",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Has to be watched by everyone,"Dumb and Dumber (1994, Dir. Peter & Bobby Farrelly)Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are two lovable and friendly, but very stupid friends, who struggle with every aspect of life. Working as a limo driver, Lloyd drops off the beautiful Mary (Holly) at the airport and instantly falls in love with her. Watching Mary through a window, Lloyd witnesses her leave her case behind. Grabbing her case, Lloyd is too late, but soon thinks of the next best thing. Dragging Harry with him, Lloyd heads off to Aspen to deliver her personally the case. However, Holly isn't the only person after the case, as a pair of criminals are after the same case.Different but funny comedy which would be hailed a classic for years to come. Carrey and Daniels are perfect as the leads in a unpredictable road movie. The humour might not be to everyone's taste but it is still one comedy film that has to be watched by everyone.You know, on second thought, you might just want to run a comb through 'em.  Harry (Jeff Daniels)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very funny. Not just silly.,"I often cite this film as my favourite all time film. It took me time to watch it for the first time as it looked like a number of other films which are silly and claim to be hilarious but usually miss the point. This film nails it. The comedy is constant and is cleverly done with situations fitting nicely into the storyline which acts as the perfect vehicle for the perfect delivery of an amazing script. The Carrelly brothers other films are good too but usually have something uncomfortable in. Dumb and Dumber is their masterpiece. I can imagine them finishing it, then going over the script asking, ""what else can we add to this joke to make it funnier?"" A very difficult film to beat in comedy. I'm going to watch it again now.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny but.......,"...... it is great . You could enjoy in every scene . Maybe my grade is too low for this kind of critic . You can enjoy in stupid movements of Harry and Lloyd . Is it good ? Yeah, it is . Now why 7? This is maybe sometimes movie with empty soul and looks like it is centered only in humor . Everything is so funny and relaxing . Maybe because of it you can sometimes tell that it is stupid . I don't think that it is so hilarious but I liked the way how Jim Carey made this movie great . Jeff Daniels was too good but he wasn't in the same level with Jim .And is it for 7 ? Maybe I should watch it more once . So I will wait for its appearance You can see that it is must watch comedy and I am recommending it .",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This is clearly for children,"Dumb&Dumber is not a bad movie - if you are under 16, that is. If you are older than that, and still like it, you are probably not older, you just think you are. I see this one after other Jim Carry movies like Ace Ventura, The Mask, and so on. At that time, I was a great fan of JC - not any longer.Simply put, this movie is just primitive. It's all about toilet humor. Just see other comments, which wave about how funny was the ""toilet sound"" and so on. Is farting really that funny?? Do you enjoy a movie because someone is drinking urine in it? If you do, go see this movie. Otherwise, there are plenty of much more intelligent and funnier comedies around.While I am usually a fan of mainstream movies, and is not interested in character development, artistic values, moral messages and so on, this movie was just plain boring - especially because I was expecting much more. It was supposed to be funny, but - as I mentioned earlier - you have to be under-aged to really enjoy it. While it had some good points, it is probably the worst of all JC movies.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Brilliant stupidity,"Some 'dumb' comedies can take idiotic humour and elevate it to another level. This is one of those films.The story follows Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) as they trek cross-country, ostensibly to return a briefcase to Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) but equally motivated by Lloyd's desire to strike up a relationship with her. There is some inventiveness in the situations that the duo get themselves into but the story isn't exactly 'edge of your seat' material.The movie lives up to its name with the humour stemming from utter stupidity in most cases. Carrey & Daniels are adept at imbuing their characters with a sincerity that makes the idiotic comments they make endearing in a way.This is perhaps Jim Carrey's finest hour with his comic timing and rubber-faced mugging frequently drawing laughs. Jeff Daniels is a pretty good complement to Carrey's shenanigans though he isn't in the same league as him. The supporting cast is merely alright, with a memorable turn by Mike Starr, who's usually relegated to smaller roles.There's nothing worth remarking about in terms of direction but I will comment on the music. It's a mish-mash of then-hip alternative songs, featured prominently enough at times to seem like an advertisement for the soundtrack album. Remember Dead Eye Dick's hit ""New Age Girl""? Worse than the songs, though, are the (thankfully) brief snippets of a sort of love theme. On the other hand, there's an excellent use of The Cowsill's ""The Rain, the Park & Other Things"".This film isn't exactly awards material but it's a pretty pleasant diversion. Beware, though, that I've seen it butchered on television (even though it's actually quite tame), so your best bet is to stick with video/DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

... and totally redeem yourself!,"Two best friends take a road trip to Aspen.This is a good buddy road movie with some very funny moments.The comedy is generally silly and juvenile but it all works if you are in the right mood. The filmmakers employ a strong mix of humorous dialogue and sight-gags that are quite prolific and well timed throughout the running time.Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are a great double-act and make the best of the script. Toilet humour is not usually my preferred choice, but there are two scenes set in this type of location that are very well done. Carrey is awesome in a number of scenes, using his facial expressions and physical mannerisms fantastically well. I particularly love his reaction to seeing the girl of his dreams on a date with his best friend. Daniels plays the goofball well enough to hold the screen with Carrey's manic energy.I do not think the humour is likely to appeal to everyone, as it is mostly quite low brow, with some gross-out moments, and it takes pleasure in seeing certain individuals suffer physically and mentally. As always, comedy is in the eye of the beholder so if it is to your taste, you will likely have a ball.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Pure slapstick goodness,"As far as goofy comedies go, Dumb and Dumber is something of a classic. There's really not much to say about it other than watch it and enjoy yourself. This is pure comic relief.The film features Jim Carrey at the peak of his powers, ably assisted by his trusted sidekick Jeff Daniels.

Jim Carrey is cooler than the coolest...,"One thing i must admit is that i saw this movie only because of Jim Carrey. It's a reason enough to watch any comedy movie as Jim has carved a niche for himself in this category and this film ain't different; rather it strengthens his position of being the most loved and admired comic actor's of all times. Another great aspect of this film is Jim's co-partner in comedy, Jeff Daniels. He gives good company to Jim and adds more humour to already saturated comic situation's !!! The main plot revolves all around two lovable idiots and best friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) who can easily win the joint-crown for being two of the most foolish guys in probably the whole Universe !!! One fine day Lloyd meets a lady, Mary (Lauren Holly) in due course of his life and his heart-bells ring at once. And he finds a chance to meet Mary again : courtesy her suitcase which she forgets in the airport while boarding a plane to Aspen and which is picked up by our loverboy Lloyd (ofcourse..whom else can you expect to pick it up???). So from here takes off Lloyd's and Harry's adventure to return the lady her belonging and their experiences during this journey acts as the much needed fodder for the film. Jim Carrey is cool as usual. Can't have been better. He is so versatile, so fluid, so PERFECT...Does he realise that he is the best guy around who can use his face so well ?? It's amazing to watch him mould his face into thousand expressions in fraction of a moment !!! Jeff Daniels gels with Jim so well and both of them play the role of being the most imperfect guys in the most perfect manner...Jeff really is praise-worthy in his attempts of matching the skills of Jim, the comedian and gives him serious competition throughout. He makes you think sometimes that who is more funnier?? Also Lauren Holly's contribution of adding a glamorous look can't be ignored. You must watch this movie.It can make dead persons burst into loads of laughter. You can term it Jim Carrey's charisma or Jeff Daniels struggle to outsmart himself as a comic actor but what matters is that you shouldn't give this movie a miss until and unless you are blind!!! as even aliens would laugh at this movie no matter what language it is in... I would give it a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Obviously goofy and immature, but very funny for the right audiences","The Farrelly brothers (Peter and Bobby Farrelly) have successfully made a career of making crude comedies (often raising controversy with them), but it all started in 1994 with ""Dumb & Dumber"", a movie of this kind starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. I saw a good chunk of this movie years ago, when it came on TV one time, and can't remember exactly what I thought of it. It wasn't until fairly recently that I first saw the whole thing, and this time, I definitely found a good majority of the gags funny (some of them priceless), enough for me to have no problem watching it again, and once again having some great laughs!Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two very dimwitted individuals who live in Providence, Rhode Island. Lloyd is a taxi driver, and one day, he drives a young woman from Aspen, Colorado named Mary Swanson to the airport, immediately developing a crush on her. As Mary leaves for the flight, Lloyd sees that she has left a suitcase behind. Thinking she left it there accidentally, he attempts to get it back to her before the plane takes off, but is too late. After he and Harry lose their jobs on the same day, he convinces his friend to come on a long road trip to Aspen to return Mary's suitcase to her. However, what these two idiots don't realize is that Mary left that suitcase behind for a reason, and during their trip, they also don't realize that two criminals are following them!The Farrellys are known to make extremely silly, sick, raunchy movies, filled with toilet humour, slapstick, and sex jokes. ""Dumb & Dumber"" shows that it was like that from the beginning. The filth in this movie (along with the other movies from the Farrelly brothers) is obviously hated by some people, and those people should definitely avoid this movie at all costs! However, although the kind of humour that comes from the minds of the Farrelly brothers and other demented minds in the comedy business isn't for everyone, some people like it a lot. While ""Dumb & Dumber"" may not be an absolutely perfect film for those who have a sick sense of humour (like me), and like the kind of crude jokes that the Farrellys love to use, I would say it's well worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Carrey's presence and energy keeps the film watchable,"This spoof-style collection of silly gags and toilet humour may not have made much notice had it not coincided with and profited from Jim Carrey's meteoric rise to comedy stardom (he had released the hugely successful Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Mask that same year). Constructed as a buddy/road movie, Dumb and Dumber revolves around two halfwits (Carrey and Jeff Daniels) who unknowingly stumble upon a briefcase full of money and then decide to travel across the country in order to return it to its rightful owner, the beautiful Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), blissfully unaware of that they are being chased by various hit men and mobsters who are also after the money. The jokes along the way are hit or miss, to put it mildly, but Carrey's presence and energy keeps the film watchable in its drearier parts and wonderfully hilarious in a number of highlights, not least a brilliant daydream sequence with an absurd martial arts showdown which still stands as one of Carrey's best on-screen moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Hilariously Absurd Comedy Classic,"Dumb and Dumber is a sidesplitting slapstick extravaganza that will leave you gasping for air from laughter. The film follows the uproarious misadventures of Lloyd and Harry, two lovable dimwits with hearts of gold, as they embark on a cross-country journey to return a briefcase to its rightful owner. From the moment the film kicks off, it's a non-stop barrage of gut-busting gags, absurd antics, and cringe-worthy yet uproarious moments that will have you in stitches.Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels deliver performances that are nothing short of comedic genius, fully embracing their roles as the hapless duo. Their impeccable comedic timing and over-the-top physical comedy are the perfect ingredients for a laugh-out-loud experience. The film's humor is delightfully irreverent, with a blend of clever wordplay and outrageous, over-the-top scenarios that border on the absurd, yet remain utterly hilarious.Visually, the film is a riot of wacky, colorful characters and zany situations that add to the overall hilarity. The comedic set pieces are as memorable as they are outrageous, creating a world where the unexpected becomes the norm. The film's pacing keeps the laughs coming without missing a beat, ensuring that there's never a dull moment.Dumb and Dumber's unapologetic embrace of silliness and its refusal to take itself seriously are a refreshing departure from more conventional comedies. It revels in its own absurdity, and its relentless energy and enthusiasm are infectious, making it impossible not to get caught up in the madcap mayhem.In conclusion, Dumb and Dumber is a riotous, unapologetically silly comedy that has earned its place as a beloved classic. It's a nostalgic reminder of a time when outrageous humor reigned supreme, and a testament to the enduring appeal of good-natured, side-splitting silliness.

"How dumb can you be? Oh, you'd be surprised.","A lot of comedies are just plain dumb, while others are insulting. In fact, without the perfect elements for the movie, it can go south quickly. ""Dumb and Dumber"" has all the needed elements, plus a few extra - I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard in a movie. Indeed, it is very funny, very entertaining work, which, in essence, is just about the highest praise for these kinds of movies. This one delivers the goods; and that's more than can be said for about 80% of comedies. Jim Carrey, in his role here, is, I think, one of his best moments in his career, up there with ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". I did not particularly like ""The Mask"" and positively hated ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"". Here, he combines everything, and it all works.The completely jumbled plot follows two morons, Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). During a limo chauffeur day job that Jim Carrey occupies, a woman, who's heading for Aspen, Colorado, leaves her suitcase at the airport for a payday, which Lloyd thinks she left by accident. After a disastrous string of events, Lloyd and Harry decide to return the suitcase back to the woman in Aspen.To call it a masterpiece is an understatement. This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. It is genius - something of a storytelling mess, which totally helps it - it's incredibly jumbled and sloppily put together - just as it should be. This is one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. I've seen it multiple times now; it's too much fun to resist. See it - you may hate it, or you may love it. I love it dearly.

My favorite Farrelly brother comedy.,"Yes, I like this one a lot more than Something About Mary, which was pretty good, but this one was so much more funny to me.  Mary had great moments, but there were also quite a few slow stretches...these are, however, common in all the Farrelly brother movies.  Not this one though.  This is there only comedy where there virtually are no slow stretches...it is one gag after another, never slowing up for a moment at all.  Carrey and Daniels are great with each other, they have good chemistry...it is to bad the sequel will feature neither of them, which means the sequel will probably suck. The movie is simple enough to follow, as two men of lower intelligence embark on a quest to return a briefcase to a woman.  This woman, though, left the briefcase on purpose as it contained a ransom.  So the two dummies now have killers on their trail and run into a lot of other misadventures on their quest to return the case.

One Of My Few Truly Laugh-Out-Loud Comedies,"I take movies pretty seriously as an entertainment and art form. My 1000+ reviews on this site are a decent indication of that. As such, I often struggle with the comedy genre, as it--by definition--is the antithesis of seriousness. All of that being said, Dumb and Dumber is one of those films that is legitimately laugh-out-loud funny for me.For a very basic overview, the film focuses on two dim-witted best friends: Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). Despite being a few cards short of a full deck between them, they somehow find themselves in a plot involving kidnapping and ransom. As they travel across the country to return a briefcase to Mary (Lauren Holly) and are pursued by a gangster hitman (played by Mike Starr), they find themselves in any and every type of shenanigans one could possibly imagine.All told, I've seen Dumb and Dumber all the way through on many, many occasions. Over that time, I sort of liken the experience to watching The Three Stooges, also portrayers of slapstick or screwball comedy. Initially, one is drawn to the biggest presence on the screen (Curly/Carrey). In the early 90s, Carrey was the absolute king of comedy, and it shows here. His performance is one for the ages. However, much like stooge Larry's brilliance emerges from the background after repeated viewings, so does Daniels here. In his own way, he doesn't allow himself to be dominated or give an inch to Carrey. This duo makes every scene a comedic tour-de-force.One of the biggest criticisms of this movie is how juvenile the humor can be. I really have no retort to that, seeing as how one of its biggest gags involves a bathroom ""blowout"", so to speak. Yet, the film also has its share of intelligent humor too. In other words, it isn't just a crude-fest all the way through. The combination of smart writing and Carrey/Daniels chemistry & ad-lib ability is one-of-a-kind.Only helping this film's legacy? It is truly one of the most quotable pieces of cinema ever created. I can't even begin to count all the times I've used some of its most iconic lines. Again, this speaks to the writing of the Farrelly brothers.Overall, I consider Dumb and Dumber to be my favorite comedy of all time. It is able to break down all my film pretension and have me belly-laughing pretty much from start to finish no matter how many times I watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Painful to Watch,"I don't think this movie is clever or funny or fun to watch. It's one of the few movies I considered walking out of when I saw it in the theater. All the laughs come from stupid characteristics of the main characters. I know that's how it is supposed to be, but these characters weren't doing funny things. They were just doing annoying, gross or stupid things and they got on my nerves.The lead actors are very talented, but this movie is terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Jim has had much better movies, such as Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls","This movie to me, is very bad. I commented on Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls which is a lot better than this movie. I only compare these two movies because it is a heated argument in my school between a few of my friends. All the comedy in Dumb and Dumber is said as if it is stand-up material. So it's very simple to like a movie like this because they are basically telling you what is funny. I think you should have to think more to find the comedy in a movie. If they just tell you what is funny then to me it doesn't seem to be as funny. A line such as ""why are you going to the airport?...flying somewhere?"" is an example of what i mean by telling you the funny parts. With much of the movie like this i consider it obvious comedy, meaning they put 500 of these together and call it a movie. It could also be classified as stupid comedy because both Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels play retard roles basically, anyone can laugh at a retard, and they drive some sort of a dog. And then people say that Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls Jim also plays a retard. But i highly disagree with this, there are no parts in Ace Venture: Where Nature calls where he gets his tongue stuck on a pole or anything as dumb as Dumb and Dumber. He may make hilarious faces such as when the hot girl starts walking towards him at the campfire in the tribe dance. But my main point is Dumb and Dumber is dumb after 5 minutes, and gets dumber throughout the entire movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Two dumbs on the road,"Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are two brainless idiots in this very funny comedy called Dumb and Dumber.At the beginning Lloyd is a limo driver, who is giving a ride to a very attractive woman Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly).Mary is on her way to the airport 'bout to fly to Aspen.But she leaves her suitcase to the airport.So it is Lloyd's and Harry's mission to return the suitcase to the owner.And they hop to their doggy van and head to Aspen.Of course many dumb things happen to these dummies on the way.And they have bad guys following them who also want the bag.Later Lloyd and Harry find out that the suitcase is full of money so they decide to ""borrow"" a little money.Or not so little.They spend it all. Finally they get to Aspen and maybe Lloyd will get his chance with Mary.And he gets it.The chances of him with Mary are one out of million.So there still is a chance.Dumb and Dumber is a very funny comedy that really makes you laugh.If you have sense of humor.If you don't have one, then this movie isn't meant for you.You don't have to be a dumb to watch this movie.Just alittle crazy.The Farrelly brothers made a great comedy.They know how to make good comedy.Even a dumb knows how to make comedy, but if you want it to be good, you can call the Farrelly brothers to do that.Jim Carrey fits perfectly in this movie.He is like modern day's Jerry Lewis.Fool and funny.

"Comedy, par excellence.","Seeing Dumb and Dumber in in London of the Spring of 1995, has to be the best cinematic experience I have ever had. The story; two friends, marvelously portraited by Carrey and Daniels, make their way to return a suitcase to Carrey's love interest. Their ambivalent friendship is projected ingeniously, by excellent timing of jokes and completely absurd story development. D & D contains more boyish irrationality and less of the cheap under-the-belt humour found in ""There's Something About Mary"", also by the Farrelly brothers. I find it hard to believe that I will ever find a more complete movie than Dumb and Dumber: Comedy, par excellence!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Really stupid, pretty hilarious, terrible ending","There aren't a lot of movies dumber than Dumb and Dumber. I say that because the movie is purposefully dumb, but also just dumb dumb. It's the directorial debut of the Farrelly brothers who have gone on to create such comedic masterpieces as Stuck on You and Shallow Hal. Really, when you're going into a Farrelly brother movie you know what to expect. It's going to be stupid, but it might be good for a laugh or two. You can't expect much and you shouldn't plan on having the time of your life watching any of their movies.But I digress. Dumb and Dumber is the film that began their career and it stars Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels and Lloyd and Harry, respectively. They're two idiot best friends who drive across the country to return a briefcase to somebody that Lloyd met while working as a limo driver. They get themselves into a lot of trouble as soon as they pick up that briefcase, however, and end up getting a lot more than they bargained for during their misadventures across America.Dumb and Dumber is a comedy that is well aware of its own stupidity, and that's where it garners all of its laughs from, being completely brain dead. It's littered with poop and fart jokes, with a few intelligent quips thrown in here and there. It's story is all over the place and is incredibly convoluted for such a simple buddy comedy movie.Honestly, the script here doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are very funny together. They throw in a lot of their own humor and make the characters of Lloyd and Harry worthwhile. After reading a little bit I learned that some of the film's funniest moments were improvised by Carrey and Daniels which is ironically hilarious, but it makes the film itself that much worse.But, again, I can't be too harsh on this film. It's just another stupid comedy that has nothing more to offer than, as I said before, a laugh or two. In fact, I actually sort of enjoyed Dumb and Dumber. This brand of comedy isn't my thing but the movie entertained. However, it has the most pathetically thrown together and ridiculously abrupt ending I've ever seen in a comedy, and this really left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I was actually close to saying this was a pretty good film, but after it's awful ending I'm going to have to go with pretty bad instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If they'd only let themselves go and enjoy it, instead of turning their nose up at things that we ALL have done from time to time, then the film is great.

Greatest comedy film of all time!,"As a huge film buff, I have a personal connection with this film. I first saw it in the theater when I was 4 years old, thats right, 4! My parents knew I wasn't old enough to understand what was going on, I do however, still have vague memories of a few scenes from the theater. Ironically, this became my favorite comedy as. a youngster. Jim Carrey was my hero, and I must have watched Dumb and Dumber 100 times growing up. This may lead one to not trust my review of the film due to bias, however, with the many films that I grew up with, I am able to judge them based on everyone elses reactions to them, even if I still love them, I can understand why they are liked or disliked, or have not stood the test of time. With this film, it is every bit the film that I watched when I was a kid, rewatched as a teen and adult, and more. I can quote every line, I know every turn, and I still laugh out loud every time I watch it. Not only that, but I still catch things to this day, nearly 30 years after the release, that I have never noticed before. That to me, is the mark of a masterpiece.
That is exactly what this film is. A masterpiece. It has real depth, real emotion, real connections, real relationships, and its a comedy! The chemistry between Carrey and Daniels is off the charts. This is one of those rare films that lightning struck and everything was in the right place at the right time. The title of the film is Dumb and Dumber. Everything in the film revolves around two dumber than dirt characters, yet what makes this film a classic, is that it is incredibly smart. For me personally, its the greatest comedy film of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Celebrating the Sorry State of American Anti-intellectualism,"The movie wasn't funny. It made me angry. So, why such polarized reviews? I think it's a statement about the state of affairs in the US.The US has always been full of bone-deep anti-intellectuals. Anyone with an education is suspect. We've got a joke of a President because a certain segment were fed up with people with educations telling them to be more respectful of everyone and get over out-dated behaviors. But this goes further. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of the kind of societal failure that whips out of a parking lot in front of you, forcing you to brake heavily to avoid an accident, then drives painfully slow. That's the kind of person that finds this movie funny. The kind of person that will never achieve anything...except they can keep you from getting something done!So, what's wrong with a movie for people like that? Well, like the aforementioned crowd that worships the orange one, it's cruel! It's not just that aggressive anti-intellectualism is cool, so is being rude and cruel. ""What's wrong with pulling the wings off flies, you pointy headed intellectual!"" Yeah. It's on that level.Does that whole phenomenon anger you as well? Well, that's the one useful thing about this movie. Those people like to lie about their feelings and keep their ugliness behind closed doors with their buddies. This movie is a good way to ferret them out. And you can see the denial/projection in the reviews. ""Something wrong with you"". Just what I said. So, when reviews say, ""If you don't find this funny, there's something wrong with you"", it's just like all the other things that 1/3 minority is angry about. Someone not being like them. Someone knowing something that they never will. Someone acting like humans aren't naturally cruel and insensitive.Isn't that hilarious?!?And if you think there can't be enough people like that to account for the positive reviews, just look at the reviews for any of Tarantino's travesties of cinema.

Purely Genius In Its Pure Stupidity,"Harry and Lloyd of ""Dumb and Dumber"" are two now-iconic characters so inane, they're unaware of the gravities of their own surroundings. They're also brilliant character sketches, and for those exact same reasons.If you let go of your self-perceived intelligence long enough to give in to this film's wonderfully moronic gag-drivenness, you'll find ""Dumb and Dumber"" to be one of the great side-splitters from this era's brand of specific comedy. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels create a duo of imbeciles whose thick-headedness saves them from the same predicaments it also got them into. And it takes pure genius to conceive of something that stupid.At it heart, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a classic buddy film, and a comedy pairing for the ages. - WATCHED IT? THEN WATCHLIST: ""Airplane!

"The smartest ""dumb"" comedy","""I can't believe we drove around all day, and there's not a single job in this town. There is nothing, nada, zip!""""Yeah, unless you wanna work 40 hours a week!""Dumb and Dumber has far too many perfectly written and delivered jokes to ever be considered a truly ""dumb"" comedy. I've always maintained that this film is one of, if not the most, deceptively brilliant comedies ever made. I know it's easy for some people to look at a movie like Dumb and Dumber and just dismiss it as being another crude, low-brow comedy, but to see the brilliance of it, you gotta look a little deeper.Dumb and Dumber is a deconstruction of the classic comedy duo. Traditionally, a comedy duo would consist of an idiot character paired up with a straight-man character in order to create comedic conflict and funny situations with one another. The most classic example of this would be Abbott and Costello, or a more recent example would be Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.Now look at the duo of both Harry and Lloyd in Dumb and Dumber, there is no straight man to balance out the idiot character. They're both idiots, and that's why this movie is brilliant. It takes the classic narrative of two friends going on a road trip adventure, and because there is no rational-thinking person amongst the duo, the situations they get involved in are about ten times more absurd because of how stupid they both are.On top of that, you have some of the most quotable and hilarious lines in any comedy movie ever. Honestly, there are too many to mention.""Pullover!""
""No, it's a cardigan but thanks for noticing!""
""Yeah! Killer boots man!""I'll acknowledge that Dumb and Dumber is simply a movie that's not gonna be for everybody no matter how you look at it. People either really hate this movie or really love it. I'm one of the people who really loves it and I'll gladly defend it anytime because this is one of those great comedies where it doesn't matter how many times I re-watch it, I'll still get belly laughs from it.""Wait a minute......what was all that one in a million talk?'",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Why Dumb and Dumber is the Farrelly Brothers at their best.,"Dumb and Dumber is the Farrelly Brothers and Jim Carrey at their best. Even the new 'Me, Myself, and Irene' doesn't even come close to generating as many on-the-floor-laughings as I experienced with Dumb and Dumber.  I think the main reason is because since the main characters acted so stupid yet nice, you could kind of relate with them and feel closer to them, which means more laughs.

Dumb and Dumber, starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, is this critic's idea of the perfect film.Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, played by Carrey and Daniels respectively, are two dim-witted roommates residing in a dumpy Rhode Island apartment.

The last in the Jim Carrey 1994 trilogy,"Ironic though it may be, it takes a lot of talent to both write and perform dumb humor properly. If you don't have the right people both in front of and behind the camera, it can come off as juvenile and annoying. Thankfully, in the case of Dumb and Dumber, we get experts on both ends, making for an absolutely hilarious film. The jokes run the full gamut, from slapstick to raunchy jokes to gross out jokes, including easily the funniest toilet based sequence ever. And while not every joke lands (especially in the Unrated cut), the jokes that do so land so hard and at such a frequent rate that they don't just make up for the lame ones, they immediately make you forget about them. The film does attempt a serious-ish main plot, which would feel forced if the tonal whiplash we get from the sudden changes from comedy to drama and back wasn't in itself so funny. The film is also solidly shot and edited and has a great soundtrack.Following Ace Ventura and The Mask, Jim Carrey is three for three with this film. He's a little more restrained in his delivery here, but is no less energetic or committed to every bit, making them all the more hysterical. Meanwhile, Jeff Daniels, who I was surprised to learn after seeing him here mainly does dramatic roles, more than holds his own against Carrey; he matches his boundless energy perfectly. Some of the funniest moments in the film consist just of the two of them working off each other, with both clearly trying to out-dumb the other, including some fantastic improvisation, like the ""most annoying sound in the world"" scene. While the rest of the cast isn't as funny, they have their moments. Besides, the focus is primarily right where it's supposed to be: on our dimwitted heroes.Overall, Dumb and Dumber is yet another knockout from one of my favorite comedians. It never ceases to crack me up, no matter how many times I watch it. Though I haven't seen either the prequel or sequel, given their reputations, I imagine they don't hold a candle. That's fine though; I'm more than satisfied sticking with the original.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The Rated Version is better!,"I think this is a great Jim carry comedy and i don't know how anyone could say it was a bad comedy film because it wasn't, it was a masterpiece and sure it mainly used cheap toilet humour but this makes it even funnier to the younger audience like me, the rated version is better in every way and it is very exciting. It ain't the longest film in the world but no one like a huge movie do they? I just think the rated versions better because its more tidy and better acting, i don't know, I'm all for deleted scenes but unfortunately there are some scenes in the unrated version that just make you wanna shout out ""BORING!"" or ""EW!"", simply put this gets a 9/10 i really like them as a duo too.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Best film I have ever seen.,"I first went to see Dumb and Dumber, when it came to the cinemas, and brought my entire family along. I had already seen Jim Carrey in the Mask, and Ace Ventura, and loved him in those films. The review of the film was quite good, so I looked forward to this. My father wondered if it really was a movie in his taste... and then the movie started. I have never in my movie infested life had such a journey as I did that day. The atmosphere in the theathre was amazing. From the first moment (when you see Jim Carrey ask a lady about the way) to the final moment (the two dimwits walks away on the freeway), I cried of laughter. So did every member of my family. And every soul in that theathre. The humor was low, witty, crazy and, yes, dumb! This movie is on my top ten list and has deserved it ten times a round.Don't miss the following scenes: the Toilett scene, the beerdrinking scene, the one where Jim pours poop-potion in Jeff Daniels coffee (the result is seen in the toilett scene), and the final scene when the goofballs turns down an offering to become oilrubbers for beatiful models.

The humor's so dumb it's not funny,"Released in 1994, ""Dumb and Dumber"" stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as best friends and likable morons; one's a limo drive and the other a dog groomer who drives a silly dogmobile. The former falls in love with a client (Lauren Holly) and the duo chase her to Aspen, CO, to bring her a brief case that she (intentionally) left behind. Meanwhile, gangsters who want the briefcase follow them with intent to kill (Mike Starr and Karen Duffy). Teri Garr and Charles Rocket are also on hand.I was hoping for a funny and entertaining flick in the manner of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""The Mask,"" both released the same year as ""Dumb and Dumber,"" but, unfortunately, ""Dumb and Dumber"" just isn't that funny. There are a couple laugh-out-loud scenes, like the karate fight, but most of the jokes either fall flat or are so dumb they're not funny (and I'm speaking as one who likes dumb humor – GOOD dumb humor). Another thing that didn't appeal to me was the potty jokes, which also weren't funny. Thankfully, there are a few things that make the film worth checking out, like the camaraderie of the two protagonists, Holly's incredible beauty, the road-trip element and the great locations.The original film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Providence, Rhode Island; Pennsylvania; Nebraska; Utah; and Colorado. I haven't seen the unrated version and don't want to since it adds a bunch of tasteless or gross bits, like the guy spitting into the burger and worse.GRADE: Borderline C/C- (4.5 out of 10 Stars)",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A Hilarious Dumb Comedy,"Who thought a dumb comedy can actually be this entertaining? Dumb and Dumber is an extremely stupid movie, but stupid enough to be hilarious. It does its job as a comedy to make the story a lot engaging by featuring funny shenanigans as Lloyd and Harry are put to the test on a road trip without much money. This would help make the characters a hilarious cast, especially given from the hysterical performances. And the directing has one of the most genius editing for a comedy. I highly recommend watching this for those that are in the mood to watch a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and get a good laugh. This is definitely one of the most funniest movies of the 90s. Lloyd and Harry may be a couple of idiots, but they know how to make their personalities fun along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Watch it whenever you can!!,"A decent plot, good jokes, unbelievable scenes and two legendary actors - recipe for comedic success.The 'comedy' genre is way more difficult in movie business - both critically and commercially.

Beautiful,"This film does what it sets out to do, tickle your bone, the funny bone that is. It's a great comedy from the makers of ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Kingpin"". The thing about comedies from the Farrely brothers is that I can watch them numerous times and still think they're funny, it's the genius comedy that's in them that makes me watch again. Jim Carrey plays LloydChristmas who meets Lauren Holly's Character Mary Swanson when driving her to the airport. In the airport he watches as she leaves her briefcase in the airport, he goes and picks it up and runs. He meets up with Harry at their place and they decide to bring the briefcase back to Mary in Colorado, the adventure begins. All road trip flicks are cool as hell and this is no exception, I think Jeff Daniels steals the show as Harry, Lloyd's dumb friend. I recommend this flick to anyone who wants to chill, drink with a bunch of their friends and have fun. Cool flicks to go with it are ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Kingpin.""",,Anonymous,Comedy

Great Fun,"For some reason when this came out, I just didn't want to see it. I thought it looked, well, dumb more than it was funny. My perception proved to be wrong and I finally ended up watching this in 1997. It's one of my 5 favourite comedies of the decade.The plot admittedly is a bit thin and is more of a vehicle for the comedic situations more than anything, but the comedy here really does deliver. It's lowbrow for sure but sometimes you don't need anything more. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels did a great job here, and they were greatly helped by the superb writing by the Farelly Brothers on this project. It is smarter than it originally looks too. It's really rewatchable and never gets old really. Rather timeless in the whole scheme of things.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Dumb and Dumber: The perfect comedy that never gets old,"Dumb and Dumber 1994 is easily one of the funniest movies ever made. Lloyd and Harry are an iconic duo, and their chemistry is what makes this film so unforgettable. The Farrelly brothers created a comedic masterpiece here, with humor that's just as fresh today as it was in 1994. The jokes are timeless, ranging from slapstick to clever wordplay, and the absurd situations these two get themselves into are endlessly hilarious.What makes this film stand out is how the story cleverly weaves together two different narratives. On the surface, it's a ridiculous road trip adventure, but it's also a tale of two well-meaning idiots stumbling their way through a kidnapping scheme without ever realizing what's actually happening around them. Somehow, it works brilliantly, and the chaos that ensues is pure comedic genius.The entire cast delivers top-notch performances, with no weak links. From Jim Carrey's energetic, over-the-top Lloyd to Jeff Daniels' perfectly understated Harry, every actor hits the mark. You can tell that everyone involved in this film understood the absurdity of the premise and committed to it fully, making it one of the most enjoyable comedies ever.This is a movie that truly has something for everyone, whether you enjoy goofy slapstick humor or clever, well-timed jokes. Dumb and Dumber is, in my opinion, the definition of a perfect comedy. If you're looking for a film that will make you laugh out loud no matter how many times you've seen it, this is the one to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This Is A Dumb Movie.  I Loved It!,"First, let me make this abundantly clear.  ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a movie for guys.  That is, this is a really really bad date movie.  Girls just won't find it funny, in fact, they'll mostly just find it sick and tasteless. That's because it is sick and tasteless.  Then again, so is all really good guy humor.  Another reason not to see it with a girl is that you'll end up feeling guilty for laughing at it, simply because the girl is there.I'm a guy.  Still, I am a bit ashamed to say the honest truth:  I love ""Dumb and Dumber.""  And I don't mean that I kinda-sorta-maybe-a-little-bit liked it.  I thought it was hilarious from start to finish.For starters, it's dumb.  That much is obvious from the title at least. I'll try to get beyond that, even though it isn't easy with a movie like this.""Dumb and Dumber"" stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as complete idiots.  I'm not saying this to be mean or politically incorrect, but to be truthful. They're just dumb.  However, I also encourage you to rent ""Gettysburg"" and ""The Truman Show.""  Here are the same guys in intelligent roles, and they're still good.  This is the proof of great acting!  The fact that these intelligent men can act like idiots puts both of them on my top ten list of actors.Where do I go from there?  Well, the comedy is typical bathroom comedy, with bodily function jokes, sex jokes, and then more of both of the above.  Is it really funny?  You betcha.So, what am I really saying here?  Just this:  Guys, get a bunch of your guy friends together, get a pizza and a huge bottle of Coke.  Sit around for a while telling dirty jokes and stuffing your face, and then watch ""Dumb and Dumber.""  Be proud of your guy-ness, of your immaturity, of your testosterone!  Here's to guys!P.S.

Yet the bitter irony that this film doesen't get the recognition it deserves, it enough to say that Jim Carrey is easily one of the most blacklisted, underrated actors in ""hollywood"". His performance in this film was more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. That is, if anyone actually takes the ""Oscars"" seriously.It's because of this, that this movie will never be put upon the pedestal it so sorely deserves to be atop.

"A True ""Pure Comedy""","In an industry that puts out films that follow a strict guideline, that is the industry of Hollywood generally and comedies being no exception, there's a place that very few mainstream comedies can go to that feels right at home, one that doesn't take itself seriously at all, that genuinely lets loose entirely, and which spontaneous momentum isn't being contrived by rigid structure and academic rule. It's very, very dumb...but not so dumb it's just only dumb. It's dumb in a way that's efficient, and there's a very thin line between being just plain mindless random processed stupidity with no actual spirit behind the humor... and controlled chaos. This one is certainly the latter. It isn't trying hard, it isn't awkward. It's smooth and genuine, it's real, and has resonated as a cult classic because of that true genuine nature.From that very first scene with Jim Carrey at the back of the limo, to the very last bit of footage, it's pure nonstop action and gags and utter silliness with a purpose and liveliness. It never wanders into facile randomness, or never settles for riding its own self-complacency, every scene is fresh and original. Brand new. There's no time to get bored with the humor on display, it keeps coming back with a new angle, a new powerfully idiotic bang.It manages to actually tell a story, compelling on its own in fact, while being a gag reel all the way through, which is no easy feat technically.The directing, sound, and editing are superb in creating just the right conditions for the film to be resoundingly moronic and most efficient. It doesn't try hard; instead it knows exactly what it's doing.Finally: as in the title I call this a ""pure comedy"", because the entire focus of the whole picture is to make people laugh, entertain wildly through the craft of comedy, while most mainstream comedies are merely ""comedies"" in form but use that format in order to be a pleasant watch but really have a romantic or drama or moralistic motive and outcome in the end. Dumb and Dumber is comedy through and through, again, from that very first scene in the limo to that very last bit of film, the sole purpose is to make people laugh hard. There's no ""hidden agenda"" so to speak, it's comedy for the sake of comedy, and arguably, that's all comedy should ever be. A true, 'Pure Comedy', supremely inspired, carefully written, with an excellent spirit and momentum to it, and perfectly conducted from beginning to end.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels at their Absolute Finest,","Dumb & Dumber is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding comedic cast. The movie is without a doubt one of my favourite comedy films of all time, I have watched it on many, many occasions and it still has me in stitches whenever I rewatch it. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are both fantastic at playing idiots, they go through a lot of effort in both performance and appearance, Carrey even letting his bad buck tooth show off and, Jeff Daniels not grooming his hair once while filming to make their characters look more deranged.The movie is filled with many memorable quotes and is the feature film debut for the Farelly brothers. Despite the fact that they have gone on to do great films such as There's Something About Mary and Stuck On You, this is still their finest work, for me.Hilarious from start to finish with even a little sentimentality, I would highly recommend Dumb & Dumber to anyone looking for a great comedy.After a woman accidentally leaves her briefcase at the airport, idiotic best friends Llyod and Harry set off to find her, making one mistake after another along the way.Best Performance: Jim Carrey",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Not a good movie, 'technically', but one of my all-time favorite comedies.","I avoided ""Dumb and Dumber"" at its theatrical release because I 'knew' a film of this name could not possibly be good. Boy was I wrong. I've seen it now 3 or 4 times, most recently last night, and for me it never gets old. In the vein of good farces like ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Something About Mary"", this one manages to strike a good balance, carefully walking the line between belly laughs and actual gross-out.Like the scene where Lloyd (Jim Carrey) puts laxative in the coffee of Harry (Jeff Daniels)and, arriving at Mary's (Lauren Holly) house we start to hear abdominal gurgles. Frantic, Harry finds the bathroom, pulls down his pants, sits -- when we hear Mary say, ""Don't use the toilet, it doesn't flush."" Then we see Harry, pants down to his ankles, taking apart the back of the toilet to try and make it work.Or the scene where they are skiing and Harry, like a kid, touches his tongue to the frosty metal support. And later, as his tongue stretches, as mary pulls his head away. Or the last scene, where Lloyd and Harry direct the bus of bikini girls to the next town, instead of volunteering for the job of ""rubbing oil all over their bodies.""And, of course, the whole idea of trading their hound mobile for a small scooter because it 'makes 70 miles per gallon', then riding to Aspen, in the snow, over passes, and arriving with ice growing from their noses, as Lloyd gets off in Aspen, Harry is stuck to his back. Trying to throw Mary's briefcase into a lake, it opens, they see all the money, then spend it all on a $285,000 car, a hotel suite, fancy clothes, all the while leaving ""IOUs"" in the suitcase so they could pay her back eventually.Lauren Holly is a fine actress, but also one of the most strikingly beautiful. Here she was about 30 during filming, and at the absolute height of her beauty. No wonder Carrey married her, unfortunately it didn't last. Jeff Daniels is, to me, an even better comic than Jim Carrey, who is mostly ""over the top"" in his acting. Daniels is a more subtle, and funnier, comic.No message in this film, just good fun and laughs. The actual story doesn't matter. My wife cannot stand ""Dumb and Dumber"".

Jim Carrey at his best,"I love Jim Carrey. He is honestly one of my favorite comedic actors. And I heard so much about this movie, that I just had to see it, and I laughed up a storm.

I Wanted to Write My Paper That Was Worth 25% of My Grade in a Course At USC Cinama School Because I LOVE DUMB AND DUMBER!!!,"Postmodernism and Poop Jokes: Dumb and Dumber and the Collapse of ""High"" Art (abridged version)Ninety years ago Marcel Duchamp printed his name on a white porcelain urinal. In the winter of 2004 that urinal was named the most influential work of modern art by five-hundred of London's top art experts beating out Matisse, Andy Warhol and Picasso for the top spot. Naturally many found the decision, ""a bit of a shock"" but some came to realize that Duchamp's urinal, ""reflects the dynamic nature of art today and the idea that the creative process that goes into a work of art is the most important thing. The work itself can...take any form"" (World's Best..., 1). In 1917 critics and audiences alike were appalled by Duchamp's urinal, but today our culture embraces this postmodern fusion of ""high"" art with ""low"" art. The Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber (1994) could be considered the ""Duchamp urinal"" of the 1990's. Once again critics had a hard time embracing the Farrelly Bros.' use of ""low"" culture. They still saw cinema as an art-form that should represent a sort of sophisticated entertainment. Although many critics abhorred the film, the box office success and widespread pop-cultural acclaim of Dumb and Dumber suggest that postmodern films should be judged by the postmodern audience rather than the critics.In an interview with Mr. Daniels, Leon Harris asks, ""Is this your kind of humor? Is this the kind of thing you'd watch when you want to go out and see something funny?"" in an attempt to understand how such a qualified actor could sink so low (Daniels, 2). Daniels responds with, ""I know that I am ready for...an hour and a half of nothing but laughs, and if movies like Dumb and Dumber can do that, then I think that has value."" (Daniels, 2).Daniels defends his decision to star in the film and also questions the role of comedy in the artistic world. He recognizes that the Academy Awards tend to favor serious dramatic films that evoke deep thoughts rather than lowbrow comedies that simply cause laughter. He essentially exposes this bias that exists within the critical world that favors sophistication over anti-intellectualism. Does the fact that Dumb and Dumber won the MTV Movie Award in 1995 but was never considered for an Oscar nomination mean that it was a complete failure? Who is to say one human being's opinion is more valid than another's? While some might have seen Harry the dog groomer as a step down for Daniels, his involvement with both ""low"" and ""high"" forms of entertainment demonstrate this flexibility that the postmodern era embraces.Dumb and Dumber was released on December 16, 1994 and within a few days had become the second biggest December box office opening in Hollywood history (DeRosa, 1). Apparently though, there is quite a market for ""incredibly dumb"" comedies about two friends on a road trip to Aspen. The general audience had spoken and $127 million speaks louder than a handful of negative reviews.Headlines for online user comments read, ""Best Comedy Ever, Painfully Funny, Pure Laughter, Oh Admit it You Love This Movie, If You Don't Like This Movie You're an Insufferable Bore, etc."" (User Ratings, 1). Though there are some negative comments strewn about, it is nothing like the critical reviews in magazines and newspapers. Out of over thirty-five thousand user comments, there are only seven-thousand people that graded Dumb and Dumber as average or below (a score of 5 and below on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the best). This means that eighty percent of the people that voted scored Dumb and Dumber above average. Also, about one-third of the voters scored the film with either a nine or a ten. This data illustrates a vast difference between general audience member opinions and critical reviews. After the release of Dumb and Dumber, Bobby Farrelly said, ""We fully expect to get ripped apart by the critics, but we didn't make it for the critics"" (Dermody, 1). Again the question arises of whether or not a handful of critics know what is best for postmodern audiences.The human being is a complex organism that can enjoy an opera one moment and laugh at a fart joke the next. Recently the latter tendency has been capitalized upon, but the critic chooses to focus on the ""finer"" things in art and culture. Postmodernism attempts to blend these two spheres of the human mind into one while modernism denies its other half. If we follow the modernist assumption that science and technology will lead to a fuller understanding of life than we find ourselves in a bit of a bind. If we study Darwinism and the process of Evolution to find that we, the human species, the children of the Enlightenment are in reality children of apes, the idea that we should only respond to ""high"" culture and sophistication is absurd. Millions of years later we still have some of these animal instincts that tell us to laugh at Jim Carrey when he makes a funny face or attempts to wash his mouth out with ketchup and mustard. Some try to cover up these instincts and pretend that sophistication and intellectualism come naturally to humans. If this were the case babies would be born with calculators and paperback copies of Madame Bovary. This is not to say that we should all revert to living in caves and hunting with spears, but we should also remember that we are one chromosome away from being chimpanzees. If Dumb and Dumber does have a message, it is to never become so serious that you cannot laugh at yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie is the FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!,"This movie is the funniest freaking movie ever!!!! Jim Carey (Lloyd Christmas) did it again!!!! Even Jeff Daniels (Harry Dunn) was hilarious, even though hes not a comedian!! This movie had me laughing so hard from beginning to end. Some people might say its too childish and stupid, but i bet even they were laughing at some parts. I first saw this movie when i was like 5 so i didn't get all the jokes. But as I watched it countlessly throughout my childhood and into my teenage years, I understood ALL the jokes and found it even funnier every time!!! This movie is soooo funny, that i actually payed to see Dumb and Dumberer in 2003. THATS HOW FUNNY THIS MOVIE WAS!!! (Cuz Dumb and Dumberer was a complete disgrace to Dumb and Dumber) I definitely recommend this movie to all ages and will watch it every time i need a good laugh! THIS MOVIE IS HILARIOUS!

This movie was a total disaster, Harry and Loyd seem to be travelling together and not helping anybody, they both just mess things up and make it hard for others, well not just hard but complicated hard. I rate this a 10/10 because the humour, man is it crazy. I recommend you go see this but watch out, you're probably going to be like WHAT THE the whole way through because some parts are just, well very random. This movie is a lot funnier then the 2003 remake Dumb and Dumber, when Harry met Lloyd.

Maybe at least a chuckle.,"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star as dumb friends Harry and Lloyd who set out on a cross country trip to return a briefcase full of money to owner Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), and indirectly stumbles onto a criminal conspiracy which involves the mob and the FBI.In a nutshell, this is basically a movie full of misadventures of Harry and Lloyd during their road trip, providing us with some really dumb gags, silliness and slapstick humor that I've found only very mildly funny at most. The plot itself is simple to follow, but I didn't find the story to be exciting as it lacks suspense and action - just full of plain stupidity and mishaps.There are lots of really mindless moments and crude gags that may make you chuckle, but I've seen a lot more funnier and entertaining comedies than this.Grade D-",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Dumb Comedy with A lot of Brains,"Dumb and Dumber (1994)*** (out of 4)Idiots and best friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) travel from the East Coast to Aspen so that Lloyd can give a briefcase to the woman (Lauren Holly) he's fallen in love with. The two don't realize that they've just gotten involved in a kidnapping plot. DUMB AND DUMBER is obviously a pretty dumb movie with one dumb thing after another happening but it's also one of the smartest comedies in the past few decades. I think anyone could have made a movie about dumb people as they do it all the time but the writing here was just so perfect that you can't help but be drawn into Lloyd and Harry's world as they get into one problem after another. A large portion of the credit has to go to Carrey and Daniels for delivering two excellent performances. It's not easy playing dumb but these two do it so well that it would be impossible for any other actors to fit these roles. Carrey, the maniac, does a very good job at playing Lloyd for this moron who never knows when to give up. Daniels, I think the smarter of the two, manages to sometimes be ahead of his friend but the way the actor plays almost like a big brother was extremely fun. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and the majority of the jokes wouldn't work if they hadn't, one, nailed their performances and two, worked so well together. Holly does a good job looking pretty and playing it straight to the two idiots but I think Mike Starr is the one who gets overlooked. He's a wonderful character actor and has put his stamp on many great films but the comic timing here was just perfect and the scenes with him and boys are priceless and among the best in the picture. The one flaw with the picture is that it does run a bit too long and especially in its ""uncut"" version. These extra jokes really don't add enough to the film to warrant them be included. Still, DUMB AND DUMBER is one of the better comedies to come from the 90s.",,Anonymous,Comedy

My fave comedy film,"One of the greatest comedies ever made in my opinion. It's often described as a stupid movie, but I don't think it is. It can be very silly, but at its heart it's a movie about friendship and unrequited love.Jim Carrey puts in an amazing performance that's quite nuanced in its physicality. He's always very aware of where each point of his body is located, what what his face is doing. That might seem like a strange thing to say but an expression or stance or way of performing an action can make a big difference to a scene. There's a particular scene after he gets mugged by an old lady where he bursts through the door and crumples to the ground in agony. It's a small thing but I can't imagine any other actor performing the scene in that way, and there's plenty of other scenes where Carrey's unique physicality shines through.Jeff Daniels is suitably goofy in his role, and probably gets the biggest laugh with the toilet scene, which is crude and silly but very funny.I don't think Carrey or the Farrelly Brothers ever recaptured the greatness of this movie unfortunately.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Destined to be a classic,"Despite being shunned by many, DUMB & DUMBER is one of the brightest, funniest, and well-crafted comedies of the 1990's.Those who shun this film probably... 1) haven't seen it 2) have seen it only once 3) don't get the humorYes, the film has its share (and then some) of scatological humor, but the pure genius of the film is displayed through the intertwining of gags with plot, as opposed to a separation of the two, as evidenced in fodder such as THE WATERBOY and AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.  D&D uses humor as narrative and not as the sole reward of the film (i.e. the two examples I previously mentioned).Carrey's physical humor is very reminiscent of a Lloyd (Harold, that is, not Christmas! :) ) ... not to mention, the hard effort that Mr. Carrey put into his performance shows through and transfers to us.Perhaps when the next generation of film professors begin entering our university's halls, they will be presenting this film as a quintessential example of (well-designed) American comedy of the 1990's.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Pure,unadulterated comedy","This movie is special to me for the simple fact that it makes no pretense that it is anything BUT a comedy. Loaded with sight gags,verbal humor,toilet humor,pratfalls,cross-ups,mix-ups and perfect timing,this film employs just about every level of film comedy and makes practically all of them work.The story is almost pedantic and non-essential:two hopelessly half-witted buddies,Harry and Lloyd(the very adept Jeff Daniels and the very comfortable-in-the genre Jim Carrey)agree to travel cross country to return the briefcase that a fare who Lloyd(a chauffeur) taxied to the airport ""lost"" at the terminal. Of course,they are not aware that the briefcase was intended as a ""drop"" for a hostage situation where the fare,a lovely redhead named MAry(perennial straight woman Lauren Holly),was to ransom her kidnapped husband. Naturally,Lloyd and Harry's meddling throws the hostage development into chaos,but not before the dim-witted duo get into various forms of trouble along the way.ONe should have a strong stomach while viewing this,as was the case with most pre-""Shallow Hal"" Farrelly Brothers(who wrote and directed in tandem)films.

Worst of the Jim Carrey movies.,"Being a Jim Carrey fan myself, after having seeing this movie during it's theatrical release, I thought, he could've done a better movie than Dumb and Dumber.  In this one, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play these inept and incredibly stupid best friends who come across a suitcase and set out to Colorado to give it back to a woman (Lauren Holly) whom Lloyd eventually falls for.  And they get entangled in a kidnapping plot.I didn't like this movie because it was way too vulgar and lowbrow.  The worst part of all was when Lloyd spikes Harold's drink with a liquid laxative and later on Harold gets stuck in the bathroom for obvious reasons that are too ribald for me to explain.  This whole movie was a disgrace and an insult to such an advanced, talented, and charismatic comedian that Jim Carrey is.To add insult to injury: This movie, when it was out in theaters became the number one movie in America and the favorite Jim Carrey movie amongst fans.  Even my friends and co-workers thought this movie was funny.  I understand why someone would like this movie, and that's okay with me.  But I suggest some better Jim Carrey movies like Ace Ventura parts 1 & 2, Cable Guy, Batman Forever, Man on the Moon, Me, Myself, and Irene, and The Truman Show.  This movie is totally brainless, if you don't like vulgarity then my best advice is to skip it!  I give Dumb and Dumber 1 star.",,Anonymous,Comedy

"According to the Map, We've Only Gone About 4 Inches","Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest films ever made, and is truly my favorite comedy film. While soon after the initial release of the film, the audience and critic response wasn't very good at all. Having been played on television for roughly fifteen years now, the fan base and the overall grade of the film has drastically went upwards. I remember in the 1990s often seeing this film on television and watching it many many times. There was no watching it too much. The film flows so naturally and in my opinion there is never a dull scene, not a single one. The following is my review of Dumb and Dumber.The film was written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly, and Bennett Yellin. The Farrelly Brothers are also known for other hilarious films such as There's Something About Mary, and Me, Myself & Irene. This story follows two friends Harry(Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd(Jim Carrey) as they travel across country from Rhode Island to Aspen, Colorado where Lloyd returns a briefcase that a customer left in Lloyd's limousine he was driving. The silly happenings that occur on the way to Aspen are downright hilarious. This movie has so many quotable lines, that it was difficult to pick my favorite for the summary of my review. As I said in my first paragraph, this film flows smoothly, never a dull moment, never a moment when you ask yourself ""where are the laughs at?"". This film is non stop comedy and just an overall amazing joyride to watch. I sat down to watch the film again because they are finally making a true sequel to this amazing film. I've watched this film so many times over the years(easily 300 times if I had to put a number on it) and I can honestly say I still never get bored with this film. After 20 years that says a great deal about a film if it can have that effect on you. The Farrelly Brothers delivered a fabulous comedy on their first outing, and a film I will never forget.The film was also directed by The Farrelly Brothers. This was the Farrelly Brothers first outing directing a film, they had written some things in the past, but never directed. This duo was unstoppable in the 1990s, with not only this film but several others as well. The film was not very easy to get off the ground, and it actually took a few years because studios thought the script was garbage and that it would never sell. New Line Cinema came along and gave the film a chance, although still worried about the idea. The studio gave the directors a list of 25 actors who they wanted to see cast as Harry and Lloyd, but all of the actors said no. Finally, they went to Jim Carrey to ask about the role of Lloyd, and he did accept the role, but it wasn't until after his wildly popular Ace Ventura film was released, thus giving him much more money. They wanted someone a little less unknown for the other role of Harry and someone who could play nicely off of Carrey. In came Jeff Daniels, who is such a fantastic actor. Daniels was worried abut Carrey stealing the show, but then after reading the script realized that Harry is just as important as Lloyd if not more so. The rest is history, and we are left with two amazing performances from Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. They did in fact get along so much together, and made the film that much better. It is even said that Carrey ad libbed a great deal of his famous lines. For young first time directors to allow their cast to do this and have fun with the roles made the film that much better. The Farrelly Brothers set out to deliver fans some great laughs, and in the end turned out one of the greatest comedies ever made. Not many first time directors can say that.The soundtrack on this film is so amazing as well. Times have of coursed changed in the 20 years since the film first was released, but looking back hearing those great songs from artists like Apache Indian, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, The Proclaimers, Echobelly, and of course Crash Test Dummies is such a joy. The soundtrack added so much to this comedy classic, and should not be overlooked.In closing, Dumb and Dumber set out to deliver some laughs, but little did the Farrelly Brother know that their first feature length film would become so widely popular and known as a true comedy classic. Fans who want to get back to roots of real comedy instead of the phony comedy being pushed today, this is a fantastic film to start with. The comedy is witty and subtle, which even makes you stop and think at times. The joy this film will bring you is nearly unparalleled in this comedy genre. With the newest and first real sequel to the original Dumb and Dumber film set to release within hours of me writing this review, it is a must to see this classic film before going out to watch the sequel.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

What works for the film is the characters and the chemistry of both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. We understand their characters are dumb and the situations they are put into are silly, they do carry the film but as a whole the jokes aren't funny.

He really deserves some credit for this role, I don't think anyone is going to argue that Jim Carrey is the main draw for this film.  Jeff has to play someone that is going to be with Jim Carrey for the bulk of the film and will have to get just as many laughs as Jim.  ...And Jeff Daniels pulls it off!  He gets just as many laughs as Jim and was an excellent choice for the role. Lauren Holly, Teri Garr, Mike Starr, Charles Rocket, Karen Duffy, and everyone else does a great job with their roles as well.  The one other guy that I have to mention is Harland Williams.  This guy is excellent!  I was sad that he got so little screen time, but he plays the part perfectly (he's the cop that pulls over Harry and Lloyd and drinks the ""beer"").The story in this film is nothing terribly complicated, but it is very well done and well thought out.  Everything about this film is well done and very funny.

Funniest Film of the Century,"I have seen Dumb and Dumber over 20 times. It is in my opinion the Funniest Film of all time. I cant think of any other movie, that has made me laugh over and over again. This is a very intelligently made slapstick comedy from a great director. Jim Carrey delivers a Superbly entertaining performance, I really hope he makes more movies like this. We have seen Jim in many Funny movies including Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. This is his Funniest film out of the lot. Jeff Daniels gives another comic performance, in his Best film of his career. The movie is full of Jokes, it is impossible not to laugh. I have seen many films that made me laugh like Scary Movie, Hot Shots part deux, My cousion Vinny, Kung fu Hustle etc. If you haven't seen this movie and enjoy comedy, then no doubt this is a Must See.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Masterpiece!,"Farrelly Brothers are the Kings of Comedic Cinema, 'Dumb And Dumber' is the biggest example. 'Dumb And Dumber' is widely regarded as a cult film today, and personally speaking I've been in love with this one since the time I watched it, which was way back in 96 or 97.'Dumb And Dumber' is amongst the funniest films I've ever seen. My bros and my best friend remember watching this film right after coming back from school day after day. It was so funny then, so hilarious, and it remains to be in our all-time favorites. It's simply amazing, and for those who haven't seen this zany flick yet, I'd say watch it right now.In acting, Jim Carrey is Incredible. He's an actor who is yet to get his due, he deserves an Academy Award. Wake up JURY MEMBERS! Jeff Daniels is superb, who again happens to be a highly under-rated actor. When will these Magicians get their due? Lauren Holly is good.'Dumb And Dumber' is a Masterpiece! Twenty Thumbs Up!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Easily the funniest movie of all time,"I think that this is the funniest movie of all time. Every minute there is a joke in this film. This is the movie that made Jim Carrey what he is today. The jokes are so funny though. If you are having a bad day or if you are feeling upset, I recommend this movie. I rate it 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Jim Carrey right at home,"Jim Carrey is absolutely incredible at physical slapstick. I feel a bit more uneasy when Jim Carrey plays ""smart"" parts such as the Riddler or when he wears ""The Mask"" but in all out slapstick he is perfect and goes way beyond his ""inspriation"": Jerry Lewis.Jeff Daniels did a wonderful job because he is usually cast as a mild mannered likeable guy. He reminds me a bit of Daniel Stern in the ""Home alone"" series. Of course in both cases the ""likeable guy"" comes out a bit. And then again: why not?The parts involving the ""pretty girl"" are usually very painful to watch in these kind of movies. Something's just not right when we see romance and our ""heroes"" making fools of themselves at the same time. Maybe it's because many of us see themselves a bit in this situation. We can trace this problem back to ""Laurel and Hardy: Way out West"" and most likely even further back.I like the attention to detail: How come these two dumb guys can drive a Lamborghini that smoothly? They both are seen having jobs as drivers at the start. I also like the fact that the movie doesn't fall into romance near the end or any ""they have the heart of gold"" routine.I love the choice of clothes when they use up the money in the suitcase. Now that is really such a bad taste that it is way cool again :-)Great movie, as has been said before not for all tastes, but a great movie anyway.",,Anonymous,Comedy

If you ever wonder why Jim Carrey is so arrogant in real life, this film is his ticket. Let us not forget Jeff Daniels, whom, my deceased father like to remind us several times, that he is the only actor to go from the serious Col. Joshua L.

Dumb and Dumber,"This has got to be for me one of my favourite slap stick comedies. When I saw this initially I wasn't impressed at all and it was when I was forced to sit and watch for a second time whilst on holidays and it amused me slightly. By the sixth time it was downright hilarious. There was this camaraderie between Carrey and Daniels and they really look like they had a great time making this movie. This is a rare comedy where it's funny all the way through and doesn't die in the middle or get stale at the end because of Carreys and Daniels great ""chemistry"". These two although are never likely to earn anything from this movie except for a huge amount of money and laughs but thats okay because not all movies are award material. I am thankful for the fact that there has never been a dumb and dumber sequel because I don't think that it could have lived up to the original (which the prequel proved. The funniest parts for me are the travelling in the infamos wagon to Aspen from the meeting with the highway patrolman to the tough guys in the café (watching this scene should prove to anyone that these two are not as foolish as they appear to be) along with the chilli pepper scene.I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great slapstick comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Her name is Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) and she is going to Aspen. She leaves her bag in the airport-terminal. Lloyd and Harry decides to go to Aspen to return the bag.

hilarious,"This movie combines brilliant and thoughtful writing with near slapstick and definitely legendary comedy. Jim Carreys over the top demeanor matched with the experienced acting styles of Jeff Daniels makes for one of the best, if not the best, comedic combos of the past quarter century.

Jim Carrey's funniest movie !,"A very underrated movie. Both actors put on great performances for this movie. Of course the plot is ridiculous, but that's what makes it funny ! If you were to just look at the physical humor, and not pay attention to the little jokes, you would miss a great deal of why this is deceptively clever movie. Lloyd Christmas is a perfect character for Carrey's screwball type of comedy. That is because Carrey has you believing this character would actually do all the really stupid things he does in this movie. Very, very funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"For the luv of god, seek out and judge this for its theatrical cut!","The original version is perfect, cutting away for censorship reasons to get an all audiences rating i presume, but also cutting away at just the right times to leave things to our imaginations. We don't need an extended super gross spit vine hanging from some angry biker's mouth above one of our main character's burger! We were perfectly fine with just Sea Bass's incredible facial expressions when he finds Lloyd in the toilet booth. The duo's extended love hotel stay also did nothing to expand on the joy factor. Stupid, stupid, terrible additions in the director's cut. Take this advice seriously, you may HATE this movie if you don't watch it how it originally was at the movies, in which case you are gonna LOVE it.

The best....,"Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies of the '90's, at least, that I have ever seen!!!  Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels work together perfectly to make this movie earn a 10!!  Jim Carrey is the best actor in the world and one of these days, he has to be nominated for one of his works, he has done so much and has shown that he can do more than silly, toilet-humor comedies. Anyway, Dumb and Dumber is a must see for everyone (except for maybe little kiddies, their parents might want to think twice, but hey, I say, start the tykes early and show them what good humor is!) It's also educational for me, we watched it in high school two years in a row, now isn't that awesome?  Or maybe my school is just weird cause we watch Bill and Ted, too.  I think Dumb and Dumber is one of Jim Carrey's best works!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Jim Carrey is a genius....,"I first saw dumb & dumber a couple of years ago. That time I laughed so hard i almost lost my breath. I forgot the name of the film, but fortunately I found it again in a shop. I didn't expect much, because I was much younger back then. But I laughed just as hard the second time. Yes, the movie has its weaknesses such as when ""the gas man"" says after finding the note on the door. He says that they must have been watching him for weeks, but later in the film he hitchhikes with them. Its a small detail you wont notice the first time, but I've watched it a couple of times and I wonder how the Farrelly brothers could Miss this...But when the movie ends you must have had a good laugh, or something is seriously wrong. If Jim Carrey wasn't starring in this movie it wouldn't be as good as I think it is. But Jim Carrey is a Comedic genius. All in all, maybe the funniest movie i have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A fun road-trip theme compliments the movie, making it more fun and interesting. A somewhat dark and suspenseful plot for a comedic themed skit, but it certainly brings out the comedic charm the majority of the time. This will always be one of my most featured and watched movies that includes two of the most comedic and energetic clowns ever known.

Carey and Daniels do Dumb Well,"I just recently saw a trailer for Dumb and Dumber To and all of the fond memories of Dumb and Dumber came back. Jim Carey has done some amazing movies: Ace Ventura, The Mask and Liar Liar to name a few, but Dumb and Dumber is absolutely my favorite of them all. The humor is so sophomoric, juvenile and stupid... And yes I laughed my a** off.I saw it as a teenager so of course the movie appealed to every base teenage male molecule in my body. You would think that as an adult that humor would no longer appeal to me. True. Many times it doesn't. But, for some reason, Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels did that movie so well I can heartily laugh at that movie 20 years later. Their stupidity knew no limits and it just made for the most hilarious moments. As moronic as they were, they were never really vulgar or offensive, just plain dumb.I'll just conclude with this: I can't wait for the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Dumb and Dumber: The Farrely Brothers first movie.,"Dumb and Dumber is not only the first Farrely Brothers movie but also one of the first ones they made. The movie is about 2 guys who do not exactly have a high knowledge about, well anything. One day Lloyd Christmas drives Mary Swanson to the airport and when she leaves her bag behind he and his friend Harry go on a mission to give it back to him in nice sunny Aspen, not. The story makes you laugh from start to end for anyone who wants to laugh. This is the type of movie you can watch 100 times and still wanna watch another 100 and then another 100 and so on. Overall this movie is a spectacular movie thanks to the Farrely Brothers who show us their Genius in their movie. I rate this movie 84% for pure genius.

Probably the funniest movie of all-time,"This is one of those movies where you just sit there for an hour and a half, turn your mind off, and laugh your butt off! People who don't like this movie are either humourless or don't like some of the slapstick material. Jim Carey is his usual hilarious self, probably at his rubber-faced best in this movie, but it's Jeff Daniels as the extremely moronic Harry that steals the movie. Whether it is putting a carrot and two cotton balls on a snow man at his ''waist'' instead of as a nose and two eyes or whether it is lighting himself on fire, Harry will make you laugh as hard as you ever have.

One of the greatest comedies ever made,"This is a film where I watched it and thought of how brilliant the writers had to be to create two such stupid characters. This film stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as two lower class buddies from Rhode Island who just cannot seem to get anything right. One day, Jim Carrey's character meets a beautiful woman(Lauren Holley) while driving her to the airport(he is a chauffeur). Holley leaves a briefcase at the airport and Jim Carrey is determined to get it back to her. He convinces Jeff Daniels to travel with him to Aspen, Colorado, to bring the briefcase back to Holley.What is terrific about this film is that unlike some other inferior buddy comedies, the two main characters are distinguishable from each other. Jim Carrey is the really ""dumb"" character, while Daniels plays the more practical ""dumb"" buddy and something of a straight character. The jokes and slapstick comedy in this film are second to none and what really allows this film to work is the fact that neither of these two guys have any idea how ridiculous their behavior is.

A true comedy classic!,"It was through a brief mention in one strip of a Big Nate book, that I first heard of the Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber. Eventually, a bunch of years ago, I first watched it after getting it out of the library on DVD. And it truly is one of the best comedies of all time.Dumb and Dumber centers on two incredibly idiotic best friends, Harry Dunne (played by Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey), who live together in a ratty apartment in Providence, Rhode Island, and whose stupidity gets them both fired from their respective jobs as a dog-groomer and a limousine driver. However, one day, just before losing his job, Lloyd develops a crush on Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), a lady he drives to the airport, and witnesses her leave a briefcase behind in the terminal. Lloyd retrieves the briefcase, and he and Harry set out on a cross-country road trip to Mary's home in Aspen, Colorado, to return it to her, not knowing that she left it on purpose, as it contains ransom money for a kidnapping. As Harry and Lloyd progress toward Aspen, unaware of thugs J. P. Shay (Karen Duffy) and Joe ""Mental"" Mentalino (Mike Starr), as well as the police, on their tail, they soon begin to have both their brains and their friendship tested.The acting in this movie is just top-notch. Jim Carrey, as usual, is supremely hilarious as Lloyd. He just doesn't fail to make me laugh. Likewise, Jeff Daniels is a pure delight as Harry. Prior to this movie, he was mostly known for playing more serious, demanding roles (more akin to his role in Fly Away Home two years later). He's got astounding range! And their comedic chemistry is on-point. Lauren Holly is terrific as Mary. She's very levelheaded, kind and patient with Harry and Lloyd's antics. Charles Rocket, however, is PHENOMINAL as Nicholas Andre, Mary's alleged friend, who turns out to be the kidnapper. He plays him completely straight, which really makes him a terrific villain, and an intimidating presence in the movie. Karen Duffy and Mike Starr are also great as Shay and Mental, respectively.The writing, likewise, is terrific. This movie is packed with delightful comedy, especially through Harry and Lloyd's idiotic antics. But in my opinion, most of it comes from Lloyd. In particular, I really love his tirade before deciding he and Harry should go to Aspen: ""Oh, that's it. I've HAD it with this dump! We've got no food, we've got no jobs. Our pets' HEADS ARE FALLING OFF!!!!!!!"" HA! Or perhaps, this gem that Jim Carrey ad-libbed: ""Hey, wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world? AAAAAAAAEEEEEEEHHHH!!!!"" Or better still, him practicing what to say to Mary, only for it to come out completely wrong. But Harry provides some great humor, too. For instance, him trying to introduce himself to Mary, and of course, the famous scene of him unloading violently in Mary's broken toilet after Lloyd pranks him with laxative for lying about getting him a date with Mary! Part of what makes some of this humor funny is the sharp editing in the theatrical cut. In the unrated cut, some gags (the toilet scene included) drag out too long, or show too much, causing them to come off as just awkward and not funny. So stick with the theatrical cut!And then we've got the music! Todd Rundgren's score for this movie is very shrewd, and often accentuates the comedy, as well as Lloyd's crush on Mary. And the song choices, likewise, are terrific. You've got ""Boom Shak-A-Lak"" by Apache Indian as the opening song. You've got ""Crash"" by The Primitives when Lloyd takes a wrong turn. You've got ""Red Right Hand"" by Nick Cave; a dark, ominous song, used very comically in this movie. There's more where that came from!All things considered, Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies of the 1990's, perhaps of all time. If you don't believe me, watch for yourself!!! I don't think you'll be disappointed!And one more thing: ""FOR GOD'S SAKES, JUST GIMME THE DAMN NUMBER!!!!!!!"" :)",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I have seen this movie probably 20+ times. I don't care what anyone says, this is the funniest movie ever. Some may say Animal House or Airplane or Caddyshack but I say Dumb and Dumber. Some people would say that the greatest pair in movie history would be Wayne and Garth or Bill and Tedd but I say Harry and Lloyd.

Great fun,"Dumb and Dumber would not be one of those movies destined to fit in the classics. Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the high-caliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still, Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd (Jim Carey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). Both are inept, moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called ""I Got Worms."" Good luck not only on raising the money, but even more on getting the loan. In any case, both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman, Mary (Lauren Holly), to the airport in his limousine, and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen, Colorado with the help of Harry. However, the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea, but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary, and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges, Marx Brothers, or Abbot and Costello movie. However, with these guys, there is no straight man, nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put, the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the gross-out comedy. Looking back, the gross-outs in this one were not over-the-top. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again, we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances, nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults. Both ages can have fun with this movie--which is what I often watch on a snow day. Finally, let it be known that truth in stranger than fiction. I knew a guy in graduate school named Mike. In college I knew a guy named Jim. Put them together, you have Dumb and Dumber. However, I think they would have been smart enough to get on the bus at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The definitive comedy of the 90's,"Dumb and Dumber, the tale of two dimwits who go on a cross country road trip to Aspen, is nothing short of a comedy classic. And it's nothing short of well, dumb. But if a movie is to be judged on how well it achieves it's desired goals, then this comedy is a roaring success. Because being dumb is the whole point. But besides featuring top-notch stupid humor, the film has what other ""dumb"" comedies such as ""Freddy Got Fingered"" and ""Half Baked"" lack. Charm and even some touching aspects. Dimensions that bring the purpose of the story full circle. Pedomorphic protagonists Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) make their journey to Aspen with the noble intent to return what they think is a lost briefcase to wealthy socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) and pursue Lloyd's on-the-spot infatuation with her. In their stupidity however, never truly seem to understand the real circumstances surrounding the attaché and the trouble it could cause.Even if this movie is what you believe to be ""not your thing"", as is the mentality many have toward ""stupid comedies"", at least give it a try. Sit back, put a laxative in your tea, and just go with it. And don't get up to go to the bathroom once. You may just miss a great moment in one of the funniest and at the same time most heart-warming comedies since ""Revenge of the Nerds"". Pee in a beer bottle instead.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The best comedy of the nineties.,"1994 was quite a year for Jim Carrey. Coming right on the back of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Mask came this comic masterpiece. Dumb & Dumber tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two idiots from Providence, Rhode Island, who get caught up in a cross-country kidnapping plot after Lloyd falls in love. Lloyd is a more down-to-earth character than those Carrey played in his previous two movies, but still posses the same slightly manic, almost childlike humour for which Carrey was now world famous. I found 'loveable loser' Lloyd Christmas a much more endearing and engaging character than Ace Ventura. Additionally, Dumb & Dumber was more story-driven and was instrumental in Carrey's development as a character actor, rather than just a comic-actor. Though Carrey was the star of the movie for most people, it would be hugely unfair to allow him to overshadow what was an excellent performance from Jeff Daniels. Proving his versatility as an actor, Daniels, who normally plays fairly serious or family roles, showed what a good comic actor he could be. Though Harry was by no means the straight-guy, his more laid back character, and occasional moment of clarity was just enough to keep their adventure on the road. Easily one of the best comedies of the nineties and, in my opinion, definitely Jim Carrey's best film of that decade.My favourite moment: When Lloyd attempts to board a plane that isn't there and spirals off the end of the skyway.My favourite quote: ""The first time I set eyes on Mary Swanson, I just got that old fashioned romantic feeling...where I'd do anything to bone her.""Worth a mention: The late Joe Baker as Bernard.

"I Like It, And I Don't Care","Dumb and Dumber is one of the best comedy ever created and I can say it oh so proudly. I don't care what people say and how it was called stupid and comedy with toilet joke. It is supposed to be stupid and dumb, the name already suggests that and if you're still saying that it is stupid you are dumber than I thought.Staring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as Lloyd and Harry; the two best friends are on the road trip to see Lloyd dream girl Mary; along the way they face many adventures.This is without doubt one of the funniest movie, involving almost everything  kidnapping, stupidity, love triangle, friendship, road trip, girl, murderer and twisted joke. The cast is brilliant, I don't think it can be any better; Jim and Jeff are superbly funny and their acting is second to none. And the joke and the situation is a killer, the movie is consistently funny throughout the movie.Everything in this movie seems to be well thought and is a great flow and balance. And though the directing and all the technical work are averagely done it doesn't stop Jim and Jeff to delivered all that humor.I still can remember when it first came out in '94s and how hard I laugh the first time I watch it. I still laugh at it even 12 years later. That is brilliant.My Verdict: Get Yourself A DVD.Reason To Watch: Jim and Jeff In The Top Class Humor Comedy.Reason Not To: Stupid Enough To Think It Is A Moron Movie.Rating: 9/10 (Grade: A+)",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hilarious Stupidity! A ten!,"Yes, I have seen all the bad reviews and all the film critics and ""experts"" have ripped it to shreds, but who cares!  Of course they would because it is based on the slapstick, pottymouth humor of the Farrelly Brothers. Basically if you like this kind of humor and can appreciate the depth of the movie, it might be the best movie you've ever seen.  It really is amazing though how much effort must have gone into the writing of the lines for this movie.  While the story is not going to win an Academy Award, every line that is spoken in this movie is part of a joke, NO FILLER!  This means there are few parts where it slows down enough to let your stomach rest from laughing.  Some of the jokes I am still figuring out or hearing after seeing it multiple times (I bet she'll invite us in for some tea and strumpets (prostitutes).  I am both a movie fan and a fan of this type of comedy so I can appreciate it from both angles and I love it.  No matter how many times I watch this movie, it is still funny.

A Funny 90's Classic!,"Dumb and Dumber is a actually a pretty funny movie despite my intentions of not seeing this. This is not the movie that will win any Academy Awards, but if you want a drop in I.Q or you're just bored and want to see some comedy, this is the movie to see.This is one of the movies from 1994 that made Jim Carrey famous. The others were The Mask and Ace Ventura. Carrey plays Lloyd Christmas. He is a loser limo driver who fell in love with a passenger. She goes to the airport and leaves her briefcase. Along with his best pal Harry, Lloyd decides to go from Rhode Island to Colorado to return the case.It took me many years to see this movie because it looked ridiciously stupid. It is in a good way.

Hilarious Stupidity,"There are two kinds of people in this world-you either love Jim Carrey or you hate him. If you hate him, you definitely hate this movie. But if you love him like I do, there is no better example of comedic genius than this gem. Pretty much every line in this movie makes me laugh, even the stupid throw away comments. But even though Jim Carrey is hilarious in this, Jeff Daniels almost steals the show. There were many other comedies to follow this during the decade of the 90's, but it still reigns as the funniest comedy of the decade. Unfortunately, comedies such as these will never get any credit from ""real"" critics because it isn't sophisticated enough for their taste.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"it's just funny, that's all that matters","Dumb and Dumber is just one of those funny movies that doesn't require you to think much. That's not to say only the simple-minded will find this entertaining. It's just a picture about two ridiculously dumb guys that gets its comedy from their stupidity. Some people may consider that sophmoric but in this case for the most part it is very well written, and is executed beautifully by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the ONLY 2 who could have done it that way (not a smart move making a sequel/prequel with 2 completely different and unknown actors). The jokes are consistant throughout the entire movie and the events all fall into place nicely, and the plot for the movie was original. It's a comedy, and as long as it's funny, it's done it's job and this movie doesn't have to go to ridiculous lengths or screw up the plot as an excuse to get laughs, it just does it easily and smoothly.In my opinion this is one of Jim Carrey's best comedys and Jeff Daniels does a great job as well. I understand some people prefer more sophisticated or intelligent comedys or just more advanced ones and I respect that, but if you're just looking for a good funny movie that you can just chill and laugh to, you can't go wrong with this true comedy.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Two odd balls inadvertently get into trouble while traveling across the country.,"If you like humor you don't have to think about, this movie is pretty close to the perfect comedy. The first time I saw this movie I cracked up the entire time. Some movies start out funny and then die down as they try to fill the plot with bad jokes, but this movie doesn't disappoint. Jim Carrey's role in this movie is the perfect fit for him and Jeff Daniels is surprisingly funny as well. Their characters' lack of social skills and general knowledge (hence the name dumb and dumber) keep you entertained throughout. Also, this movie contains one of the funniest bathroom humor scenes I've ever seen. If you haven't seen this movie and you're a fan of comedies, you have to put this one at the top of your ""to see"" list.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie makes me laugh even if I am not watching it...,"I personally am not all that shocked to see that there are some people who thought this movie was childish and stupid.  I personally do not agree, but this still remains the only Farrely Brothers movie that I did not completely hate. Kingpin sucked.  Something about Mary sucked.  Even Me, Myself, and Irene was pretty terrible.  But Dumb and Dumber rose above those movies by never claiming to be intelligent. It took two stupid guys (What's the soup de jour?  It's the soup of the day.  Mmm.  That sounds good. I'll have that) and gives them a reason to really display their lack of intelligence.This movie transcends all comedies and will remain a classic amongst true comedy lovers.  Those of you who hated this movie probably think that The Piano WAS a really great movie, and are way too intelligent to like a movie like this.  Those of us who enjoy the movie look beyond the relative stupidity of the script and enjoy it for what it is:  a true, unadulterated comedy.Mock. Yeah. Ing. Yeah. Bird. Yeah. Yeah.

High Comedy.,"Oh goodness ""Dumb & Dumber"" is one of those films that is just crazed out of its mind. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star as two dimwits who go cross-country to Aspen, Colorado to find a beautiful woman (Lauren Holly) who left a briefcase full of money in an East Coast airport to pay kidnappers to get her husband back. Of course, Carrey does not know this and thinks she left the briefcase by accident so he takes the money unwittingly. Carrey also has an obsession with Holly to complicate manners. Throughout Carrey and Daniels dominate the action and the strangest coincidences occur as the bad guys think that Carrey and Daniels are after them and the good guys try to figure out the duo's connection with the kidnappers. In short this is one of those films that is just outstanding and serves its demented purpose to the paramount. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Hilarious,"Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Llyod (Jim Carrey)are two low-life Providence men with nothing going for them. Llyod is assigned to drive a beautiful woman named Mary (Lauren Holly) to the airport. After Mary 'accidentaly' leaves her briefcase in the terminal, Harry and Llyod go on a cross-country trip to Aspen to return the briefcase.Carrey is put in the film for more of the goofy comedy. He is off-the-wall funny and always says something stupid that almost sounds right. Nevertheless Carrey puts a lot of thought behind his character and creates good chemistry between himself and Daniels.Daniels surprised me the most. After seeing his work in such films as Gettysburg and Speed you'd never think the guy could do comedy. WRONG! Daniels is brilliant, again. He's put opposite of Carrey for some of the serious humor but soon his role too falls into the goofy side. One scene especially involving a toilet stands out on how good his acting was.Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies every seen with the interaction of Daniels and Carrey. After the movie you try to wonder who really was the dumber one. Some of the gags are just ingenious from Seabass, who was going to kill Harry in a truck stop ends up being gay or Harry licking the frost on the lift and getting stuck to it.Dumb and Dumber.

Greatest comedy ever,"Very few comedy films can provide such quality laughs so consistently. In my opinion a great comedy should not be all about the jokes, the actors chemistry is a pivotal part in making the film work. Dumb and Dumber has this and then some. Carrey and Daniels are a fantastic duo and really make this film what it is. Whether it be Carrey's priceless facial expressions, Daniels great one liners or the sheer stupidity of both characters, this film has it all. The plot is not the greatest but the acting and comedy makes up for it. With comet being my favourite genre, I struggle to think of a single film that compares to this genius piece of cinema. The soundtrack is also massively enjoyable and the supporting actors contribute towards the humour. And like all great comedy films, the amount of quotable lines are endless. Other films like Harold and Kumar try and adopt a similar approach but even though I massively enjoy the first two Harold and Kumar movies, none of them come close to Dumb and Dumber.

Fuuny,"Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles (though viewers may find themselves debating which is which) in this genially low-brow comedy. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place; the guys also have a certain problem (not difficult to understand) holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight (though not for lack of trying). Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog (to promote his failing dog-grooming business), and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. Incidentally, Lloyd's chipped front tooth happens to be real; while Jim Carrey had the injured tooth capped many years ago, he thought a broken smile would suit Lloyd's character and had the cap removed for the duration of filming. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

BEST MOVIE EVER,"To keep it simple... this movie is the best ever.  Every single line is quoteable and memorable.  Lloyd Christmas will go down in history as one of the all time greatest characters!  This movie left me only inches away from dawning an Orange Tux to my senior prom.  There may be no better line in any movie than when Lloyd goes, ""Why you goin' to the airport?... Flying somewhere?""  Jeff Daniels is better in this than in any other movie.  I have watched this film at least 20 times and it seems to get funnier every time!

I'm telling you Jim Carrey is hilarious in this movie, so if you need a good laugh, get this movie and watch it. This is a comedy classic. You will not be disappointed. I guarantee it!

"""I can get 80 miles a gallon on this hawk""","Or was it ""hog?""  In any case, I had a great time watching this movie.  I saw it with my Dad and my brother, and I laughed so hard I felt like I was going to choke.  We all did.  You know, I wonder whether a sense of humor can be correlated to individual courage.  There are people who don't find this movie, or lots of funny stuff, funny. I wonder if they are living and acting and having a personal style that they don't really like, just to conform or please someone else.  I wonder if that sort of self-prison keeps them from finding much of anything spontaneously funny. There was a pony-tailed pseudo-intellectual type sitting behind us in the theater.  I heard him in the parking lot afterward, telling his friends that he just didn't see what was so funny or how anybody could laugh at Dumb and Dumber. Well, I laughed because the stuff was funny, and I wasn't busy trying to act or dress or sit some way that I thought someone wanted me to act or dress or sit.  Doing things my way allows me to laugh at a lot of things (and not laugh at a lot of things).  Maybe I won't have a heart attack, either, or miss great moments in life everyday.  I guess I won't be able to impress guys with pony tails and no sense of humor, but I can handle that.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An absolute classic.,"Never in my life have I ever laughed so many times at a movie after having seen it many times before. Amung my community this film was (and still is) a classic comedy, a cult classic if you will. Clearly it isn't widely accepted by you ""mature"" people who laugh at people in awkward relationship situations involving someones mother walking in on two people talking about sex (Now THAT'S classy comedy!), but this movie offers (to those who don't pay to see every Tom Green movie) a hilariously stupid comedy about two morons who go on a messed up adventure.The writing of this movie is (suprisingly) clever. The jokes aren't just people farting every four seconds, they actually have some style to them (if you can call it style...). The movie is fluent, fast paced, and funny all the way through, which is really a rarity in many wannabe comedies.It's the kind of movie you should see drunk with your friends, or even on your own. Do NOT EVER WATCH THIS WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS! That would be a mistake. Basically, what I'm saying is it's a movie for people with the ability to be immature for 2 hours of their life, or for anyone who just wants to let their guard down and laugh at a vulgar yet hilarious film.So of course I'm going to give this movie a 10. It deserves it. Kudos on a suburb comedy that will be passed down from generation to generation. Those kids are as corrupt as it is... might as well give them what they want.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Like they think that everyone ELSE is so stupid. And the toilet scene is the funniest. There's just too many funny moments about this movie to list. I think that people either love this movie, or hate it; it really depends on the person's sense of humor.

Ridiculous.,"After watching Dumb & Dumber, I felt the overwhelming need to wash my eyes out with soap. Once the burning sensation died down, I immediately stormed over to my computer to write this review.First, the prevalence of unfunny ""humor"" only serves to deflect attention from the hackneyed, cliche-ridden plot. Obviously, only unintelligent mental midgets would laugh at the juvenile gags that are strewn throughout this infantile piece of trash. I won't even comment on the ridiculous, nonsensical kidnapping story that the story centers around.Next, there are no Hispanics in this film. Obviously, this movie is incredibly racist. And the only gay character is a brute, macho, closeted homosexual. How homophobic! Obviously, the only movies worth watching are done by Stanley Kubrick and Roman Polanski. This is not, so it gets no stars. Pshaw.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
All time great,"And it's not nostalgia, because I watched it recently and I still laughed quite a lot, even knowing exactly what was going to happen. And that's because the performances from Carrey and Daniels are impossibly good, lifting a still pretty great script with constant amount of jokes, into a masterpiece. I don't even really like peak Carrey's comedies like ""Ace Ventura"" or ""The Mask"", but here, he was reigned in and ""unleashed"" in enough doses to make the movie better for it and not just his sideshow.And that's because the script allows it, with incessant jokes and gags, while naturally developing the story at the same time, filling the gaps with scenes with heart that counter balance the darker ones. Because the humor comes from how these two idiots see the world and how poorly they interpret what is happening to them, even situations that mostly help to advance the plot are made in a really hilarious way. Yes there is a plot, even if thin.One more thing. For a movie from 1994, is quite surprising how it's not that offensive, without recurring to cheap sexist and racist jokes all the time, like the more lazy or inept writers often do (see, Adam Sandler movies).",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A critique on the film's techniques.,"The film is a comedy that keeps the viewer laughing and well entertained for the entire film. Jokes are abundant and often subtle; watching the film multiple times does not bore the viewer, it often makes it more enjoyable. The laughs start in the opening scene and don't end till the credits are rolling. The cast is lead by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Their interactions with one another and the supporting cast make for a memorable comedy. The film takes across the United States, from Rhode Island to Colorado. The soundtrack in the film is very fitting for the gestalt of the movie as a whole. The film doesn't employ many special effects but a wide range of shots, including crane, close-up, and zoom are used. My rational for giving the film a rating of 9 is that a few parts break from the comedic tone and become to serious. Despite that, the movie is great to watch alone, with friends, or with family of all ages. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good genuine laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Jeff Daniels did his part O.K. too. And yet we must not forget super-sexy Lauren Holly who fitted perfectly for her role. If there will be a little less ""Hollywood-movie-style"" involved, than this movie will certainly  be marked as one of the best comedies ever.But, none the less, it's just two hour of pure laughing and some memorable jokes, for which you gladly remember this movie and that's why a great rate of9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It is an excellent comedy that hasn't been so true to the genre in years. Another good thing is that it is one of the longer comedies.

Another good thing is the choice of actors. Jim Carrey was great for this. Not only is he one of my favorite actors, but he is just plain funny.

Possibly the best buddy flick ever made along with being Jim Carrey's finest hour,"There have been many movies that made me laugh during my youth, but none haven't made me spray milk out of my nose with the exception of ""Dumb and Dumber"" which is possibly the most gut busting laugh fest ever made with ""Scary Movie"" coming behind in second place.Dumb and Dumber is about two of the most idiotic characters in cinema history with Jim Carrey as the role of Lloyd Christmas, a simple minded but nice guy who can't seem to hold a job before holding a position of a limo driver where he falls in love with a passenger girl name Mary (Lauren Holly)before dropping her off at the airport. Lloyd's best friend and companion is Harry Dunn, played by Jeff Daniels, in which like Lloyd, Harry is a loser in his own way. The scruffy hair buddy drives dogs on the way to the dog shows for which his van is detail of one like a dog with giant ears on the side. Both friends lose their jobs until Harry sees that Lloyd is carrying an unknown briefcase that belonged to Mary from the airport in which the two of them embark in a journey where mishaps and misery are engaged to those that get near Harry and Lloyd together.The film is a high mark for Jim Carrey who already succeeded box office gold with Ace Venture: Pet Detective at the time, but instead of butt jokes it's all about the pranks and gags from the comic. Jeff Daniels took me by surprise where instead of playing a normal guy in such films as Speed and Arachnophobia, he shows that he can place his acting chops into comedy.

A modern day Three Stooges,"Dumb and Dumber (1994) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows two fairly unsuccessful men, one who drives a traveling animal grooming center and the other that drives a limousine. When the limousine driver sees a passenger, he is smitten with drop her bag before getting on a flight he runs in, retrieves the bag and decides to set out to Aspen to return it to her. His friend travels with him. What ensues is a series of hijinks like you've never seen before.This movie is directed by Peter Farrelly (Kingpin) in his directorial debut and stars Jim Carey (Ace Ventura), Jeff Daniels (Arachnophobia), Lauren Holly (What Women Want), Mike Starr (Summer of Sam) and Teri Garr (Young Frankenstein).The writing for this movie and the execution by Carey and Daniels is out of this world, truly a modern day Three Stooges performance. The circumstances, attire, props, look and feel of every scene is perfect. Every aspect of the movie felt naturally stupid and not forced. There are so many classic scenes in this, it would be impossible to name them all.Overall, this is an all time comedic genre masterpiece that is an absolute must see.

Vacation with Beavis & Butt-Head,"Dumb and Dumber is just that, a stupid movie without purpose.  Dr. Strangelove mixes a message with its parodizing view of the world.  The Breakfast Club combines an adolescent fantasy world of detention with the stereotypical self-discovery element.  Monty Python has an edge due to the typical Python wit, that's all I can say about it.Dumb & Dumber is no more than an enhanced, live-action Beavis & Butt-Head cartoon.  All the same pitfalls and baloney circumstances you'd expect from them are here.  Also, the movie goes too long for its own good and winds up being what I call a 'watch checker', wherein you are checking your watch every 45 seconds while thinking ""Is this EVER going to end?""  As much as I enjoy Jim Carrey in Liar Liar and The Mask, his work here is too annoying to be fun (he couldn't POSSIBLY intend on being this annoying).  Jeff Daniels gets my sympathies for getting cast into this movie, I guess there was nothing he could do other than live off the profits from SPEED.Overall, save yourself some time and just rent episodes of Beavis & Butt-Head or National Lampoon's Vacation for the same effect in your brain. The movie tries too hard to be funny and stupid and, as the saying goes: ""The harder you try, the dumber you look.""  The ending was the only high point because it solidified how self-centered and incompetent our 'heroes' are.  1.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Comedy

Just as I thought I had managed to regain composure, he (Daniels) lets out this little squeaky fart and there's a look of ultimate bliss on his face. Well, I just lost it all over again.

An absolute classic! One of my favorites of all time!,"This was one of the first movies I ever saw, and NASA couldn't count how many times I've seen it since I was four years old. I have this movie 99% memorized, though I can't remember what it is I don't remember in this. Ironically, this movie never loses it's hilarity, and I laugh endlessly whenever I watch it for the hundredth time.The title explains it all. Two insanely dumb buddies (you can't really tell who's dumb and who's dumber), Lloyd (Jim Carrey), and Harry (Jeff Daniels), who's lives are going nowhere for obvious reasons. One day, Lloyd drives the beautiful Mary (Lauren Holly) to the airport while working as a limo driver. Mary drops off a briefcase full of ransom money at the airport, and Lloyd, thinking she forgot it, swipes the case, and he and Harry set off on a cross country journey to return it to her in Aspen, oblivious to the fact that they have kidnappers on their trail, intending to kill them and claim the money. Of course, the two idiots have a knack for getting out of danger and/or defeating bad guys without ever knowing they were in danger, so everyone who crosses them is in for a humiliating surprise.This is the kind of movie that you can NOT leave running while you take a bathroom break. You are bound to miss an abundant amount of classic lines. I don't know a movie that I've spent more time in my life quoting than this. The plot of the movie is nothing more than a setup for an endless stream of hysterical jokes, gags, and rampant silliness. And the talented Farrelly brothers do not waste a second. Every chance they get for a clever gag, they take it.The movie actually runs longer than you'd expect. It could have easily been one of those crappy, 80 minute movies where the characters qualify as retarded, and every other character is just as dumb as they are. Well, let me just say that for a dumb comedy, this movie is surprisingly intelligent. The two main characters are EXTREMELY dumb, no question, but are far more realistic and convincing than any of those other retards such as the characters from Dude, Where's My Car. The movie resists any temptation to stoop to the pure stupidity of that crapfest. Instead of everyone being as dumb as the title characters, the title characters are the dumb ones, and the supporting cast, while quirky, are far more mentally stable, and are constantly affected the the ridiculous antics of Lloyd and Harry. When there isn't some riotous line being spoken, or outrageous slapstick being inflicted, the supporting cast is reacting to it.This movie is a tradition in my family, and is still tied with There's Something About Mary the funniest of the Farrelly brothers work. I know nobody who's seen this who doesn't think the movie is great. I probably have the most sympathy for it, however. I give this movie my fullest recommendation of 10/10.It is rated PG-13 for Sexual Content, Crude Humor, Some Violence, and Language. Sex: 5/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 4/10 Drugs: 3/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
laughs and more,"One of the best comedies of all time. The story is a bit patchy and besides the acting of Daniels and Carrey the movie totally suck. I like the movie because it has classic slapstick Farelly comedy but this was one of the first movies where Jim Carrey showed he has a dramatic side. It is few and far between but the scene where Lloyd convinces Harry to go to Aspen actually has quite a bit of drama. When Harry gets shot in the hotel room we also see a dramatic scene from Carrey. Most importantly to remember though is that so many people passed on this movie and when it was released no one really expected too much. This movie along with Ace Ventura made Jim Carrey into the 20 million a movie actor he is today. NOTESLauren Holly's one and only decent film. Yes it is stupid, yes it is easy to follow, but what makes it simple is what makes it good. If you don't enjoy this flick than you must not like to laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the funniest films ever made..,"Picking a top ten list of the best comedy films ever made is a lot more difficult than, say, picking the best Science Fiction films, War films, Westerns, or many other genres.  Comedy ain't easy to do.  It's tough to sustain a level of hilarity for over an hour and a half, but Dumb and Dumber ranks right up there with the best comedies ever put on film.  It is consistantly hilarious from beginning to end.  A non-stop romp ""buddy"" film in which just as you think it couldn't possibly get any more absurd, it does.Asked my favorite comedy of all time, it'd still probably be Planes, Trains and Automobiles, oddly enough, another buddy film.  Dumb and Dumber would be in my top three.  Why?  Well, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are simply superb. Carrey has built his entire career on portraying rubber-faced idiots. Daniels, however, has a much more eclectic body of work, but as an idiot, this is absolutely his finest hour.This film is rude, crude, obnoxious, loud, uproarious, and if you don't find yourself with tears of laughter streaming down your face at some point, then you're probably either unconscious or asleep.Daniels graces us with what is the single best toilet scene ever put to film.  In the grand scheme of things, that may not be saying a lot, but compare it to other similar scenes like the one in ""American Pie"" or the farting scene in ""Blazing Saddles"" and you'll get what I'm talking about. If his experience after unknowingly gulping down a bottle of ""Turbo Lax"" doesn't have you howling, then there's something seriously wrong with you.A very very VERY funny film.  One of the best comedies of all time.  Highly recommended.  Twelve thumbs up.",,Anonymous,Comedy

So funny it should carry a laxative warning,"If humour is simply a way of coping with the overriding misery of existence then Dumb & Dumber emerges like a cure for cancer. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are the knuckle-headed losers road-trippin' their way to the sunny climes of Aspen to deliver a lost briefcase to the mysterious Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly). (Lloyd fell in love with her, you see, while he drove her to the airport.) Along the way they steal from a blind kid, poison a hit-man, and give a motorbike cop a swig of moonshine he'll never forget... And that's before they've even reached Colorado.Writers and directors the Farrelly Brothers forego the cutesy angst that blunted There's Something About Mary and go flat-out on the sick and the scatological. It's puerile, of course, but Carrey's clown has never had a better home, and Jeff Daniels shows expert comic timing to add to his impressive dramatic range. The script they share is sharp as a shiv, as well as being endlessly quotable. Does the gag count sink ever so slightly in the final reel? Perhaps. But just wait for the epilogue: probably the funniest comedy pay-off since Some Like It Hot.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

This and SCARY MOVIE are two of the funniest films ever made!,"Whatever happened during the making of this film has been captured for all time within its images - the thing just gets funnier however many times you watch it - even if you can recite the entire flick in sync with the actors. Some years ago two of my daughters then 11 and 15, put together without prompting, the entire scene in the restaurant when Lloyd dupes Sea Bass into paying for their meals. Their performance was as good as Carrey's and Daniels. I mention this to show the influence this film has had on kids even that age.With the passage of time and fifty or sixty viewings, even the crude edges have worn away, leaving a dearly loved film and a comedy I can't see anyone ever topping. It wasn't just funny in places but simply right the way through it. When I saw the original karate sequence when Carrey is wining and dining Lauren Holly, I cracked up in the theater like I have never done before or since..and it takes a lot for me to lose it!Jeff Daniels, you realise more-so after multiple viewings, has contributed equally to the film in a role totally alien to him, yet the two of them are simply brilliant together. Add to this one of the best soundtracks backing up any film I can recall and you have a grade A winner.If you don't find this funny, you have no sense of unrestrained humor and I would suggest an immediate cat-scan!",,Anonymous,Comedy
Good comedy,"Good comedy. I had very different thoughts about Carrey. He plays his role as a simpleminded, innocent schmuck in his movie to perfection. Plus, he isn't a shouting screeching moron as in the Ace Ventura films or Cable Guy or a ""serious"" person as in Liar Liar or The Truman Show. Being a huge fan of ""older"" comedy movies (pre-1990s) a lot of the funny films today just don't compare to the ones of the past but this film is a HUGE exception. With the year 2000 breathing down our necks, I think it's safe for me to give this movie the ""Best Comedy Of The 90's"" award. On a final note, this movie kinda makes you feel all good inside as well. Think about it: two dumb morons who are plagued by bad luck all throughout their life just say ""screw this"" and drive across the country to Aspen to give a beautiful girl back her briefcase while encountering many perils along the way. Once in Aspen, the perils and the fortunes just keep piling up.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Dumb and Dumber - in bad taste but very, very funny","I would have to agree with other reviewers which have Dumb and Dumber up there with one of the funniest movies of all time. This is a hysterical movie.The best thing about this movie is that it starts funny and keeps the laughs coming for the duration of the movie. I often find that comedy movies will have a few funny bits (which usually feature in the promotional clip) and very little else.While the humour in Dumb and Dumber is always in pretty bad taste, it is very hard not to laugh. The best parts of the movie for me were the restaurant scene which turns into a bloodthirsty kung fu fight and the scene where Harry and Mary are playing in the snow together and decide to make a snowman. There are plenty of other highlights - for example eating chilli dogs with the hit-man, the collection of outfits Lloyd and Harry wear, particularly to the fund raising event.One interesting aspect of the movie is that it does not make any attempt to teach any sort of moral. Often humorous movies will try to teach a moral, maybe in some vain attempt by the director to justify having made the movie in the first place. However no such attempt is made in Dumb and Dumber - the two central characters start the movie as shallow, bitter weirdo's and that is exactly how they finish up.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny movie with raunchy content,"In my opinion, this is a funny movie with raunchy content. The one thing that made me feel uneasy was when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) did something really vulgar. I don't want to say what it is, though. If you ask me, this movie had very funny humor, even though it was vulgar at times. Another raunchy part was when Harry (Jeff Daniels) was in the toilet. The things I liked most were the feelings that Lloyd and Harry had for Mary (Lauren Holly). Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If I ever have kids of my own, I'm not going to let them see this movie until they're at least teenagers."" Now, in conclusion, I'd like to say, ""Parents, don't let your children see this until they're at least teenagers!""",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The quintessential culmination of varying comedy,"Made up of slapstick humour, raunchy humour, toilet humour, and everything in between, Dumb and Dumber is absolutely, gut-wrenchingly funny.Road trip comedies tend to be the best kind, giving numerous hilarious circumstances for characters to work through and this movie is no different. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels prove to be an extremely capable comedic duo, with some of the biggest laughs coming from just their chemistry. The supporting cast are all pretty one note, but none really fall flat or come off as boring. The story, as with most comedies, doesn't matter too much but makes enough sense in the events of the movie. Not one line of dialogue falls flat in this movie. The soundtrack hilariously backs up the scenery with some outlandish songs and a decent score.I tend to not be the biggest fan of toilet humour and see it as the lowest form of comedy, but somehow the actors just sell it all flawlessly. Also, for some people some aspects may not work for them and other aspects may not work for others.Overall, Dumb and Dumber is a relentlessly funny movie that will make its audience laugh with its great co-leads and their raw chemistry.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's pretty innovated if you think about it.,"Dumb & Dumber is a movie I pop in and see about two or three times a year. It never gets old and it still holds up to this day.Dumber & Dumber also happens to be in my top five comedies. Ever. It's well titled film and for the film's purpose, it succeeds. It's a stupid movie and it knows it is, and that's why it's so great.First of all the two leads are charming, despite their child-like nature and lack of common sense. Jim Carrey, as Jeff Daniels once put it, is a tornado of comedic wit and timing. Speaking of Jeff Daniels, his character Harry is very good contrast to Jim Carrey's character Lloyd. Carrey is energetic and it's a performance full of power, while Daniels is a bit more mellow and a teeny tiny bit smarter than Lloyd, just a little bit and plays off Carrey, which works well because he's not competing with his performance against Jim, he's just following along. They play off each other very well, and it's just damn funny.The plot is pretty basic and simple, but it's the situations they get into that are real gold. Granted I haven't seen every movie out there or every comedy movie ever made, but with that being said, there are only a couple of films that have made me laugh with tears coming out of my eyes, and there are, not just one, or two but three moments that do exactly that, one of them is the infamous scene toilet scene.The film slightly drags near the ending and gets a bit dull, but the supporting cast is good, including Lauren Holly who plays Mary Sawnson, the love interest of both Lloyd and Harry, mainly Lloyd who considered her the love of his life after he drives her to the airport as his job as a limo driver. She is the reason why the dimwits decide to take a road trip to see her after she purposefully leaves her briefcase at the airport. Mike Starr is also a bright spot and has humorous moments with Carrey and Daniels.I firmly believe this film is a comedic gem and absolutely deserves to in the Hall of Fame of all time great comedies or at least be mentioned or in the conversation. For film to be this stupid, but to also be so funny with all the gags clicking and everything firing in right cylinders, it is impossible to resist. It's one of Jim Carrey's best film's as well as Jeff Daniels.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It's the perfect vehicle for showcasing Jim Carrey's substantial comedic talents, and Jeff Daniels delivers an impressive performance as well. I've seen this movie at least thirty times and it makes me laugh out loud every single time. Yes, the characters are stupid (hence the title), but the comedy is genius.The dialog and layers of comedic devices render silly visual and verbal jokes into sublime hilarity. This movie is like a treatise on comedy--employing irony, satire, slapstick, scatological humor, puns, mistaken identity, and double entendre. Sometimes they come in rapid succession and sometimes they are used simultaneously. This is why the movie is so re-watchable...you can pick up on new layers of jokes with every viewing.If you love movies like Old School(2003), The Big Lebowski(1998), There's Something About Mary(1998), This is Spinal Tap(1984), or The Jerk(1979) then you can't help but love Dumb & Dumber!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Gotta say it.....Greatest comedy ever,"I've never had an easier time giving a 10/10 rating to a movie then this one. After all, when I approach a site that asks my favorite movie...I don't have to think twice......Dumb and Dumber. I guess the truth is, you have to LOVE comedy to truly appreciate this movie. Sure, there are other great comedy movies, but I just feel like no movie really uses every second to other second to make you laugh like Dumb and Dumber does. You have to see the true art of being able to make a pun or underlying joke out of any simple phrase....""Big gulps, huh?"".If you want to see a clever, well-educated, plot heavy, witty comedy.....go see a Woody Allen movie. If you want to exercise your right to let go, relax, not think too hard about everything, and just LAUGH... this is it. I've been quoting this movie since I was 15, and probably will till I'm at least 50. Anchorman is the closest I've seen to a movie like this that's purely quotable and makes you want to pause the movie just so you can finish laughing before something else makes you feel like you'll throw up from laughter.I say any movie can really be depressing and dramatic and friggin win an Oscar.....but comedy is an under-appreciated art form. One that makes you feel good. Makes you want to be a fun person. Makes you want to soak up life and take it a little less serious. Since when has an award winning movie like ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" provoked such joyful feelings in a person. The only thing it gave me was an unhealthy interest in Asian women.This movie is solid gold. There's a reason why nearly every Farrely Brothers movie that comes out uses the tag line ""From the guys who brought you Dumb and Dumber""......cause it set the bar for comedy in a whole new way and those guys are still trying to pull that off again.

Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,"This movie to me is the exact opposite of what the title and the plot suggest. It is hysterically funny, but it's not so much the jokes that make you laugh, but the wicked and wildly optimistic humor they are rooted in.We see two guys acting totally stupid all of the time. Why doesn't it become boring after five minutes? Because all this dumbness is not shown to generate cheap laughs. The jokes point to something deeper, something more substantial and important for our lives. The final scene, which left me gasping for breath, makes it totally clear: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Which may be translated into our daily lives as: relax, and trust yourself to find your individual path to happiness - so what, if you look dumb to your fellow men! I love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Popular 90's film lives up to it's hype a decade later,"If you lived in the 90's and rode the Jim Carrey train of comedy movies, you definitely loved this movie when it came out. It still plays regularly on TV and is probably regarded by a good number of teen-aimed comedies as a legendary duo/road trip film. It's chock full of childish, awkward, visual humor where catch phrases are key. Jeff Daniels' Harry is such a good pairing with Jim Carrey's cartoonish Lloyd that you can't go wrong. The soundtrack was an alt-rock hit in the 90's and featured a lot of one-hit wonders that were solely known for their music for this film. I recommend it you like the other screwball comedies of Carrey's earlier works (Ace Ventura, The Mask) or even other buddy comedies of the time, like Tommy Boy. I enjoyed this one much more than the later ""prequel"" made for back-stories of Harry and Lloyd.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Comedic Genius!,"Though I only give an 8, this is probably one of my absolute favorite movies. From start to finish the humor is gold and endlessly quotable. The humor also comes through without too much crassness; showing true creativity rather than just shock laughs and crassness, which seems to be the norm now.As far as the technical aspects are concerned, it isn't anything special; no innovative camera angles, or well crafted score (though I do appreciate a wonderful 90s soundtrack). And there are a few noticeable continuity errors.Nevertheless, it all comes together somehow, along with some spectacular (or just plain goofy, I'm not sure) acting, to deliver one of the best comedies of all time. Not to mention a tribute to true friendship that endures. Speaking of endurance; this movie is 20 years old and still kicking!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Dumb like a fox, baby!!!!!","This is probably my favorite comedy of all-time. The dialog is hilarious, utterly hilarious, but the real reason this film is such a gem is faces the characters make in-between the dialog. I have to mostly attribute this to Jim Carrey and his brilliance in his early career. I can still laugh at jokes I've heard a hundred times before because I will notice subtle nuances I never noticed before in Jim's face. For a film focusing on the dumb, it is intelligently written. Yeah, there is the usually toilet-humor (hilarious nonetheless) but there are very intelligent jokes happening to mix things up. The pacing of this film makes it seem to fly by and it's story is interesting to boot. I like it, I like it a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
The clue is in the title,"I remember when Jeff Daniels was doing interviews for 'Dumb and Dumber,' he stated that he had to mentally 'dumb himself down' when preparing himself for the role of Harry. I think that's what anyone contemplating watching Dumb and Dumber needs to do in order to appreciate it.Okay, so Jim Carey is the star (Lloyd) and he and his equally-clueless best mate Harry set off on a road trip across America in order to return what he thinks is a missing briefcase to its rightful owner. So, basically it's a 'road movie.' Now, by definition road movies are pretty 'low on plot.' The 'story' is simply the two dumb guys moving from one daft setting to the next. Yes, it is low on story. But it is pretty damn funny. And isn't that the main thing? It was made at the height of Jim Carey's fame, therefore he was somehow still fresh. If you're looking for low-brow humour then you'll find what you're looking for here. Yes, it won't tax you mentally and, by the time the credits roll, you may actually be thinking with a few less IQ points. However, if you're prepared to trade a few brain cells in for a lot of laughs then you've come to the right place.Best dead bird laughs since Monty Python's parrot.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
When all the world knew how amazing is Carrey,"""Dumb and Dumber"" is a silly and crazy comedy about to goofy and slow-minded average men, Lloyd and Harry, that one day need to embark in an absurd journey to return a case full of money to a wealthy woman, Mary, who lost it at the airport. They will tackle clueless all of their adventure, surprisingly survive everything, and show everyone that they're even dumber than you thought.A light-hearted demented comedy that offers you the chance to laugh even after a hard day and witness the Carrey's mastery in comedy and also an entire awesome cast. Definitely the '90s have been an amazing time for movies and actors that nowadays we miss the most. Exquisite film!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Perfect comedy.,"This is Jim Carrey at his peak and will not be, since it is very much him doing what is completely HIM, to everyone's taste. But you are surely the one person who has made a mistake if you've watched this film and disliked it without realising it's called ""Dumb and Dumber""?. I will TRY and keep this brief (impossible), but this is one of my all-time favourite films and for good reason. The same way I have given Lord of the Rings the title of my favourite fantasy adventure movie, Star Wars the Sci-Fi favourite, and so on and so on, is the same way I put this among my top-ten of comedies ever. The duo of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels is one of the best comedy match-ups since John Candy and Steve Martin. Both are dumb as each other in equally dumb ways but this truly is NOT a ""dumb"" movie. It's heart-warming, ridiculous and it's a proper journey of friendship and male-bonding. I won't go into the plot, but imagine the best road trip you could ever go on with your best mate, filled with memories you will never soon forget (for better or worse). THAT is this film.The comedic timing is perfect. The choreography captures the scenery beautifully as they trawl from Rhode Island to Aspen, and I don't think the Farrelly brothers have ever made a film as great as this. I mean, the humour is perfect. The crass and gross moments aren't tastelessly done like in something like American Pie or some teen flick, this is smart yet incredibly thick! If you don't cry laughing at the kind of scrapes these two get themselves into, you've dislocated your funny bone. And serious applause is due to Daniels who isn't overshadowed by Carrey. As a big Carrey fan, I've never found anyone as funny or able to pull off dumb and wacky humour the way he is, but Daniels is the only person I've ever seen who works in perfect harmony with him, and with Jim being the big man of comedy himself, that is no easy feat. Daniels, I truly commend you for that. He confessed he never did a film like this, ever. And for someone I will always remember for Arachnophobia, he was outstanding and I could not imagine a better casting choice. A real shocker of a role for him, but acted flawlessly. The laughs just keep coming, and it tugs at your heartstrings at just the right moments.As a side note, the soundtrack is also a great selection of memorable tracks that suit each mood accurately and work very well with the action on screen.There's really not a bad thing I can say about this film. If you haven't seen it, well... You're dumber than dumb.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"The best comedy ever, great cross-country adventure","Dumb and Dumber is very likely the greatest comedy ever. It may not be the funniest (like for example The Naked Gun or so), but it wasn't meant to be all about laughter.It has excellently written story that simply makes the movie so good and never boring. Even after many, many times of watching, it always remains interesting and funny.I always liked cross-country adventures, and this is one of the greatest, not only because it shows great scenery, but because it's also funny.It is supported with the very good soundtrack that fits excellently into the plot.It's an all round movie for the whole family. Just an amazing achievement. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie ever made!,"*Dumb and Dumber* (1994) is a comedic masterpiece that delivers gut-busting laughs from start to finish, cementing its place as one of the funniest movies ever made. Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, the film stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as two lovable yet hopelessly clueless friends, Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, whose misadventures take them on a cross-country journey. The duo's comedic chemistry is unparalleled, with Carrey's over-the-top physical humor perfectly complemented by Daniels' deadpan absurdity.What makes *Dumb and Dumber* so enduringly hilarious is its relentless commitment to absurdity. The dialogue is packed with quotable one-liners, and the gags-like the iconic ""most annoying sound in the world"" scene or Harry and Lloyd's misguided antics with the briefcase-are laugh-out-loud funny no matter how many times you've seen them. Beneath the slapstick humor is a surprising sweetness, as the film celebrates the innocence and loyalty of its two lead characters despite their outrageous stupidity.The film also excels with its impeccable timing and creative setups, ensuring there's never a dull moment. The Farrelly Brothers crafted a comedy that appeals to a wide audience, blending physical comedy, wordplay, and clever absurdity in a way that feels effortless. It's a rare comedy that has remained as fresh and funny nearly 30 years later, solidifying its place as a cultural touchstone in the world of humor.For fans of comedy, *Dumb and Dumber* isn't just a film-it's an experience. Its genius lies in its ability to make you laugh uncontrollably while rooting for its two foolish heroes, proving that sometimes, dumb can be downright brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you want to laugh....watch this film?,"I just watched this on DVD after a few years and it still delivers in spades! I was watching it at 3:00 a.m. and I had to laugh into a towel so I wouldn't wake up the people in my Apt. building. To those who don't find it funny, I understand. If you don't like certain actors or comedians, you can't enjoy any film they're in. For me it's Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and David Spade. I won't even watch their films. That said, I think Dumb & Dumber is one of the funniest, laugh-out- loud movies of all time! Yet it wasn't even recognized by the AFI on their ludicrous List of 100 Greatest Comedies. They listed Laurel & Hardy at #99. What a bunch of snobs! Getting back to D&D, Jim Carrey is at his best. Jeff Daniels actually keeps pace with the frenetic Mr. Carrey. He wondered if this would be a bad career move. This performance compared with his previous role in ""Gettysburg"" just shows his range as an actor. They're on opposite ends of the spectrum and both are equally great in their genres. I'll admit that a few of the ""gross out"" jokes are a bit much, but all in all this movie is hilarious! Yes, it's stupid and dumb but what do you want in a comedy...Shakespeare? I highly recommend this film to anyone with a great sense of humor.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Simply the best comedy ever!,"I find it hard to believe that some people actually hate this film and show it by giving the movie a score of only 1.It is true that every single person is different and very few have the same opinions... but only 1!? It's dumb to say this movie is stupid, because it's exactly about two stupid friends and it's even dumber to pretend that it insults your intelligence.The movie works on both levels for those who like good jokes, and for those who like childish fart humor. Not to mention, it also includes sarcasm and socially funny, unusual and awkward moments. So what more could you ask for?What makes this comedy so perfect is the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. If Daniels isn't funny...Carrey makes you laugh instead, and if Carrey isn't funny (which I doubt people think)...Daniels is there to ensure laughter. But I never felt that either of them was not funny. They both carried out their roles perfectly.If this comedy won't make you laugh for some reason or even just smile...Your sense of humor must be strange.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie of all time!,"Dumb and Dumber came out the year I was born so even after 18 years it is still the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. This movie has the potential to be the funniest movie I will ever see and one of the best movies in general. I have seen this many many MANY times at least 20 even if you have seen it before it is still just as funny as the first time you see it. Every line is quotable and fun to bring up with friends. You can watch this movie with anybody and have a fantastic time laughing together. I recommend this movie to everybody looking to laugh out loud! I give ""Dumb and Dumber"" a perfect 10 out of 10!~Joe",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Smartly Written Film,"Jim Carrey had quite a year in 1994. In the same year he came out with his 3 biggest, most iconic movies. He had ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"", ""The Mask"" and finally this film, ""Dumb and Dumber"". All three of these films were big box office hits, made Jim Carrey over 20 million dollars, had their own crummy sequels and animated series. But of Carrey's 3 hits of that year, this one is the funniest and has held up the best over time.Comedy is a very subjective thing, what I think is funny, may not be all that amusing for you. But I can say that this is MY FAVORITE COMEDY MOVIE.With a lot of comedies, there needs to be some sacrifice between genuine storytelling and comedic energy. This film balances both perfectly. If you watch a comedy like, ""Shallow Hal"", by the ending it stops being funny and just becomes sentimental. Or if you watch ""Monty Python's Holy Grail"" the ending is funny but undermines any narrative it had going. ""Dumb and Dumber"" is funny from beginning to end.The movie is very clever with its jokes. It is no wonder that the writers/directors would go on to win Oscars for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Screenplay"". Likewise, the acting on display is incredible. People do not give enough respect to the talent it takes to sell this type of comedy. Once again, it is no wonder that the two leads would go on to win Golden Globes and Emmys, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are great actors and they work perfectly off each other.Don't be stupid, watch ""Dumb and Dumber"".",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest Film ever made,"Dumb and Dumber is the funniest movie ever made.  No matter how many times I watch it, it stills funnier.  Jim Carey does an awesome job playing his part.  Many of the funny things in the movie are hidden in the words.  This makes the movie even more funny because it may take you a couple times to hear everything that is funny in the film.This movie is a masterpiece and I will still watch this movie years from now.  Many generations will watch this movie and think that it is absolutely hilarious.",,Anonymous,Comedy
A new genre???,"Until I saw Dumb and Dumber I thought of Jim Carrey as blatantly obnoxious. Cable Guy,Ace Ventura,Truman Show-Yuck! I watched this movie with my kids as a favor to them long after the film had left the theatres. I think I've seen it around seven times now and have to say that Carrey has joined the ranks of the great comedians. Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy,Peter Sellers,Jerry Lewis,Don Knotts,Cary Grant these and many more knew the secret of making us laugh. They each had a niche in the broad genre we call comedy.Hi-brow,low-brow,ineptitude,slapstick, farce,black humor, we like it all for one reason. It makes us laugh. I can remember tears coming down my cheeks when I watched Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush. That same thing has happened in not nearly enough other comedies I've seen over the years. It's happened every time I've watched Dumb and Dumber. What a great way to end the first century of film-making. D and D will endure like all the great comedies before. Dumb and Dumber is well written and well acted. I can't say that I condone the spirit of crassness that defines so much of our present culture. I think we've suffered as a culture for giving in to cheap laughs too often. There are definitely elements of that in Dumb and Dumber but it transcends even those. There are moments of sheer brilliance both in writing and performance. The timing of many of the gags was also a major driving force. What you end up with is a film that at some point or another has to make even the most jaded film-goer laugh out loud at least once. 6.2 is an insult to this film. Look deeper. Give it the ten it deserves.",,Anonymous,Comedy
