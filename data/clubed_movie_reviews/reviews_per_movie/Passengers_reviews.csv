Haunting and beautiful,"I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Long way to go,"I heard the critics too. And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).We do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that's life and that's how people work sometime ... Really good character piece surrounded by Science Fiction, but only watch it if you like human drama mixed with it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A highly enjoyable ride that unfortunately got rolled over by the Critics.,"After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was their disappointment.People need to be aware that this movie is an ADVENTURE/ROMANCE and a bit SCI-FI. NOT A SCI-FI 2001:SPACE ODYSSEY KIND OF MOVIE.I will start giving my own honest review of this movie. First of all, The acting in this movie is phenomenal, of course when you get 2 great actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence you know it would work in any kind of role, and it's true, the chemistry between both of them just works flawlessly and it's very gorgeous as they're both very handsome and it's just nice to see them on screen.Then comes the VISUALS, which i consider to be this year's best ( Along with Dr.Strange ), The best way to watch this movie is at a theater with a huge screen and definitely better to catch the 3D version. I really don't know where to start with the visuals because the whole movie is just beautifully shot and the CINEMATOGRAPHY of this film is perfectly done, probably each scene in this movie is Iconic.The Plot wasn't as good as the other factors but still it managed to keep the pacing of the movie going and I was definitely not bored, even though the ending wasn't spectacular but again this isn't Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this is just a movie about 2 lovers surviving on a spaceship alone.The best way to describe this film is to say that it's Titanic all over again but in space and it's beautifully shot, emotional, and overall an exciting experience.It's really sad that people misunderstood the point of this film and were going for a complex space/time plot instead of a simple good-looking love story, but I know that moviegoers will definitely like this film. Give it a try and if not for the story then just for Wonderful scenes and for the link between the 2 main charactersConclusion: Great, Simple, Gorgeous and Highly Entertaining are the four things you'll be saying after watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance and sci-fi in outer space,"Although 'Passengers' had one of the most unique concepts of any film in recent years, had talented actors on board and the production values looked wonderful from the advertising, the critical reception (not just from critics but also from those who dislike Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence and immediately saying the film would be terrible, not being ignorant this actually happened) was a turn off.Seeing it with my flatmate last night, who had seen the film before, really liked it and had recommended it to me, 'Passengers' turned out to be a much better film than expected. It's not perfect and can see where some of the criticisms are coming from, but it was to me a beautiful and thought-provoking film that raised some interesting questions and thoughts. Unlike a lot of people on the internet and particularly on IMDb, critics get a lot of respect from me and often we are on the same page. There have been a fair share of times where our opinions have been different, when a praised film didn't do much for me and a panned one surprised me in a good way. 'Passengers' is one of the latter examples and a lot of the problem with its less than enthusiastic critical response is to do with advertising which didn't indicate that it would be as unconventional as it was.For one thing 'Passengers' looks wonderful, the advertising didn't lie in this regard. It's beautifully shot and crisply edited while the lighting and sets have a lot of atmosphere and are imaginative in their scope, showing the beauty, wonder and mysteriousness of outer space. It is easy to see why the production design garnered an Oscar nomination The special effects at their best make the jaw drop.Don't think that Thomas Newman's score has been talked about enough despite being nominated for an Oscar (losing out to 'La La Land'), it's understated and hauntingly beautiful in a distinctive Newman. 'La La Land' deserved the win but of the other Best Original Score nominees (which included 'Jackie', which should never have been nominated) 'Passengers' for me was one of the better ones.There are many moments where 'Passengers' provokes a lot of thought and is intriguing, raising some very interesting questions and ideas. The story on the most part didn't lose me, while it is not your conventional thrilling sci-fi film with lots of special effects and action it has its fair share of poignancy and intrigue. The initial fiery animosity turning into a beautiful love story was convincing thanks to the chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence. The direction isn't mind-blowing but is competent before not knowing what to do with itself in the final quarter or so.Pratt is more understated than usual, in a cast against type dramatic role for an actor better known for comedy. He handles it very well and commands the screen. Lawrence gets a lot of hate here, but to me she is one of the better actresses today under 30 (her acting actually has a beyond her years feel to it). Here she is luminous and touching. Believed these two as lovers and found myself caring for their love story due to their success in keeping it alive. It's not just them though, Michael Sheen is amusing as Arthur and while his screen time is short (too short) Laurence Fishburne gives his characters pathos and dignity.On the other hand, 'Passengers' doesn't live up to full potential. Its biggest flaw is the last 30 minutes, it would have worked better as something more suspense or action-oriented but instead felt like a tacked on logic-free anti-climax where too many things felt unresolved and it was too over-the-top and ridiculous.While the writing did intrigue and provoked a lot of thought, it didn't always work. Some of it did get confusingly over-complicated, with things needing to be made clearer and less vague, and other parts were forced. Pacing also could have tightened in places, the beginning while interesting in what was explored takes a little long to get going but the film really gets going properly once Lawrence's character wakes up.In conclusion, was not sure what to expect but got a well above-average, to me it was good despite a few problems. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A decent sci-fi rental that plays it too safe.,"I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not.Pros - The production is immaculate. The cinematography, set design, CGI, all of it is top notch, as expected from a movie starring two of the most popular current actors. - Although I'm not crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, and I only really like Chris Pratt as Starlord, I will go ahead and list them as a pro, since they did a good job with these characters. Michael Sheen is also welcome in any movie.Cons - The science of the movie is a bit slinky at times, obviously to serve narrative motives. Other reviewers have detailed these inaccuracies, so I won't get into it, here. - The movie mostly leans toward a romantic drama vibe, and I personally think there should have been more of a sense of dread and danger throughout the movie, not just near the end. - Given the high profile status of the leads, the sex scenes are predictably tame and brief. Along with the lack of danger, the lack of eroticism is another way in which the movie plays it too safe. - The catharsis at the end that stems from the main moral dilemma (which I won't spoil) does not occur satisfactorily in my opinion. It didn't move me at all, and made it feel like it was never that important to begin with.In summary, this is an entertaining, but light sci-fi romance. It feels like a 70's sci-thriller that has been thoroughly processed for a general audience. It makes a good rental, but I couldn't help but lament that it wasn't the riskier, edgier film that it wanted to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romancing the vastness of space,"I dislike reviews that summarize the plot or discuss the plot unless the latter is done to support an opinion. So, I will not do this in this review. Here are my thoughts and impressions.This film that was a very pleasant surprise. I had no expectations and enjoyed seeing the two actors (Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence) in a genre film and role I hadn't seen them in before. My only previous experience of seeing these two on the screen previously were 5 year engagement (which I LOVE) and hunger games (meh, its okay).These two are great in this film. There is a great chemistry and given the romantic turn this film takes, it works.The plot is great too--I like how the film explores the nature of space travel and the realistic challenges that it creates in the life of mere mortal humans. I also enjoyed seeing these characters grapple with some very serious predicaments that forced some decisions that could be viewed as selfish and suddenly turns to be completely unselfish.This film is not a run of the mill film--it has some great ideas and perhaps even themes (if you give it some thought) that are explored exceptionally well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Epic yet thoughtful,"When do bad decisions turn out to be the best?Constantly this film puts this question out there. Simply without the bad decisions the ship and crew would not survive.This is a glorious Sci Fi epic. Beautiful in every way with deep character development.Time is given to explore and enjoy the simplicity of the story and ultimately the dilemma that is thrust upon both characters.My favourite leftover from the movie is the thought, what would I do?Maybe a better question would be what would Robinson Crusoe do? This surely is an update of that classic taleI do not want to spoil this movie for anyone so please, enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very original, beautifully made.","Passengers is a truly brilliant movie, it's hard to place it into a genre, but it is very much a sci fi love story. The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it's the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.Attention to the detail to this film was first rate, huge credit to all those behind the scenes.It's not often the case that I wish a film wouldn't end, but after fifteen minutes or so, I was captivated, and really didn't want it to end.Fabulous film, 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Passengers (2016),"Two of Hollywood's current top stars finally come together in this sci-fi adventure from Morten Tyldum. Its not a name that rolls right off the tongue or is too familiar but I have seen his previous effort, The Imitation Game. While it was a technically well made biopic about an important man, it wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers for Passengers as it looked like a cookie cutter sci-fi film coming in a time where these types of films are really popular.The film is basically what I had feared that it would be. First, let me talk about the positives. I had no problems with the effects in the film. I thought the space scenes looked good and the set and production design was excellent. The spaceship looked sleek, modern, and alluring. The score was also nice. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together and put in good performances. I think Lawrence overacts in the really emotional moments but its fine because she's good elsewhere here.The film suffers from pauses and lagging for the first hour or so. Its repetitive at times ad just seems really inconsequential. Nothing goes on for a majority of the film and it drags a slight bit. I did not feel like the film really explored amazingly new ground. Films like Interstellar and Moon covered similar concepts and in a much better way. Its easy to question and scratch your head at some of the motivations of the characters (and androids). About an hour in I was really struggling to continue with the film but soldiered through.If you are a fan of Pratt or J-Law you may want to check this out. If you are like me and an avid sci-fi/space film fan you may be sorely disappointed by the generic and familiar nature of a film that should have really dazzled with the stakes that the film seemed to offer. Still, I guess you could find some enjoyment out of this film despite it being pretty flawed. Not every film is going to be a masterpiece, I just expected this film to offer something better and more engaging.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moderately Engaging SF Romance That Needed Darker Elements,"The trailers to this film gives the impression that it's something of a weepy romance set aboard a spaceship . Guess what ? If nothing else at least the trailers are being relatively honest and to be honest I almost gave the movie a miss due to its predictable content , but decided to give it a chance to find it perhaps wasn't as predictable as I predicted it to be . Even so I still came away thinking it was a missed opportunityLet me explain . The pivotal plot element of ""Person waking up prematurely while in hyper-space"" is not only a good one but had been done earlier in the first season of SPACE 1999 which led to one of the most shocking endings I have seen in a TV show . Here however it really only exists to set up a story which will involve two people falling in love . Hey don't report me for giving away the story because this is exactly what happens . To its credit PASSENGERS does include a couple of twists involving obsession , betrayal of sorts and redemption and being something of an angst ridden tortured poet myself I did find myself being swept along to a degree as to the character interaction between Jim and Aurora and more specifically as to if Jim will be found outIt's hardly the most complicated film of 2016 and I found myself wishing for a more complex and darker type of movie . As you can imagine - and imagination is in short supply from the Hollywood studios - you can't have this type of film without two good looking leads . The truth is Chris Pratt is maybe a little too handsome and hunky . How about a scenario where Jim is played by Robert Carlyle or Andy Serkis ? In other words someone who it's slightly difficult to fall in love with ? Love like life itself is a horrible , really horrible thing but not if it's featured in a Hollywood movie it seems",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Critics -- wrong again,"Did you read Robinson Crusoe? Did you ever see a quaint Sci-fi movie called Robinson Crusoe on Mars.How many lost at sea movies have you seen?I like this one best of all. No it is not perfection and the errors shine through if you watch it often.For my money it could have been longer. I would have savored more development of our two lead characters. As pure science fiction this is not an example of Hard-Sci-Fi. Far more technical details would have bored most viewers to tears.My thinking is that the two leads are suffering from an abundance of enthusiasm for some of their other efforts that might come off as cartoonish, a bit thin or pale.This will be one of those that ages well and becomes a fan/cult favorite. { somebody is going to expand this into a short series }I would dearly love to argue the merits of this film with any critic. I watch this at least once a year. An eclectic fellow I have explored many areas of inquiry. Far and away I have exposed myself to more Science Fiction than anything besides work and sleep.Cinematically it is a real contender, deserving.As a foray into Sci-Fi it does really well.As a romance it might be iffy but every romance has some challenges to overcome before the third act.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ignore the critics- a great movie with lots of suspense,"I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing mind blowing but a very enjoyable film!!,"I felt inclined to come home from the cinema to write a review for this film, me and my friend could not decide to see this or not due to all the bad reviews online.....

The only thing that was a let down was the cinema we saw it in!!. There is a moment in the film where your heart really sinks, and this was due to great acting I only wish that the 3rd actor had a bit more screen time, only because I think hes great. Not a lot else I can say without giving any of the movie away. Take a chance on this movie its not going to be anything mind blowing, but its a decent enough story that I cant wait to watch again!!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Robinson Crusoe in Space,"While traveling to the colony Homestead II with 5000 colonists and 258 crewmembers in hibernation pods in a 120-year voyage, the spaceship Avatar is hit by a huge asteroid that causes malfunctioning in one sector. The immediate consequence is the opening of the pod of the engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) 90 years before the destination. Jim unsuccessfully seeks a means to repair his pod and to communicate with Earth and soon he realizes that he is alone with the company of the android bartender Arthur (Michel Sheen). Along one year of isolation, Jim almost goes crazy and he feels attracted by the gorgeous passenger Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and he learns that she is a writer. Jim lives moral dilemma but one day he awakes Aurora and claims that her pod had malfunctioning like his. Aurora is devastated but after period she decides to write a book about her experience in Avatar. Jim and Aurora become lovers and while celebrating her anniversary, Jim tells Arthur that they have no secrets and Arthur understands that he may comment to Aurora that Jim had awakened her. Aurora becomes angry with Jim even physically attacking him. But when the pod of the Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso (Laurence Fishburne) has malfunctioning and awakes him, they learn that Avatar has failures in several systems and may blow-up. But Gus is terminal since the malfunctioning of his pod caused more than 600 problems in his boy. What will happen to the Avatar?""Passengers"" is an attractive romance with the storyline of Robinson Crusoe in a spaceship. The special effects are top-notch and the sets are magnificent. The lead couple is charming, but Michael Sheen steals the show in the role of a bartender android. Andy Garcia only gives name to the credits with a cameo of a few seconds. The story with a commercial happy ending is absolutely predictable and it is hard to see Jim exposed to a nuclear reactor fire without any consequence. But the plot is entertaining and better and better than the overrated and boring ""Arrival"". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Passageiros"" (""Passengers"")",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Guilt Trip,"""Passengers"" is not a film that you can really talk about in much depth without straying into spoiler territory: so this is the shortened non- spoiler version. (If you have seen the film and want the fuller discussion of the contentious points, go to bob-the-movie-man.com). , soThe backdrop for ""Passengers"" is the spaceship ""Avalon"", on a 120 year trip taking Earth colonists to the new world of ""Homestead 2"". Following an 'incident' the story finds two individuals – Jim Preston, played by Chris ""Jurassic World"" Pratt, and Jennifer ""Joy"" Lawrence – as the only passengers awake on the automated ship among 5000+ other slumbering souls. It rather goes without saying that with two attractive and bankable Hollywood stars and nothing else to do, the two 'get it on'. With things on the ship going from bad to worse, the two must work as a team to try to save the ship, crew and fellow passengers from disaster.As a fan of sci-fi, I'll start with a positive that the Avalon is a gloriously rendered spacecraft, and many of the scenes of space walking present beautiful cinematography (by Rodrigo Prieto of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Argo""). Many of the other special effects in the film – led by special effects supervisor Daniel Sudick, of the Marvel franchise – are spectacularly good, especially one which demonstrates why the lifeguards closed the pool on the International Space Station!The overall premise of the film is also original and well-conceived, setting up the backdrop for some serious post-watch ethical debate (see the spoiler section on bob-the-movie-man.com).Where the wheels came off for me though is with the script by Jon Spaihts (""Prometheus"", ""Doctor Strange""). Some of the dialogue is just appallingly trite, and some of the supposed capabilities of our hero, Preston, are laughable. For example, he possesses an uncanny ability as ""an engineer"" to open a cabinet of electronics, scan the circuits and say ""Nope – that all looks fine"": the next time my washing machine controller packs in, he's going to be on my speed-dial for sure! And (cue trite line – ""every component on the ship has a spare"") Preston immediately finds the required part (curiously, it's right next to the failing component and not in Bay 67 on cargo deck 327!) and knows how to plug and play it as required.But, for me, there was one particularly dire point in the script where Spaihts obviously forgets which film he's writing the scene for and 'goes superhero': oh, hang on, Preston doesn't HAVE any superhero powers! For me, any goodwill the story had built up through to that point get vented into space.The director is Morten Tyldum, whose ""Headhunters"" I really enjoyed but who is probably more famous for ""The Imitation Game"". Not overawed by the production's scale, he does a great job of getting good performances out of the rather wooden action hunk that is Chris Pratt and the reliable Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence who (apart from one dramatic and emotional scene) the script doesn't really stretch. Michael Sheen is also a great watch as the witty and dry android bar-tender.In summary, this was a nice premise with great special effects and gorgeous production design, but frustratingly let down with a weak screenplay. With a better script and another 10% of tweaking, this could have been a real sci-fi classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A visually impressive Sci-Fi romance,"It's not hard to see what Passengers could've been, but this big budgeted and much hyped Sci-Fi romance starring two of the worlds most well-liked Hollywood stars is one of the more curiously forgotten-about spectacles of the increasingly busy end of year releases. Really, though, this largely critically panned feature is not half as bad as many have called it out to be.Very far from the Titanic in space it was looking to become, Passengers is still a polished and visually arresting tale of love and survival on human transport ship Starship Avalon that allows everyone's new favorite good guy Chris Pratt a chance to show his solid leading man credentials and The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum a chance to go wild with the possibilities of imagining what life would be like aboard a ship designed and catered to delivering such valuable cargo on a 100 plus year voyage.From themed restaurants, spacesuit adventures, swimming pools right through to a manned bar, Passengers design of Avalon is a sight to behold and provides a point of difference to our average movie space ship that is often grum and lifeless while the film's often lighter tone is highlighted by Pratt's turn as the unfortunately early awoken Jim Preston.To say that Passengers doesn't go to dark places however would be a disservice to a film that perhaps goes too dark for some people's tastes, but it feels as though Tyldum and his team can't do these element's full justice and some of the films 'big questions' don't get fully formed answers, while the films 4th act is a particular letdown, especially after the movie's impressively captivating opening stanza.The other rather glaring problem that stops Passengers from becoming the sum of it's parts is the introduction of Jennifer Lawrence's Aurora Lane who plays a true support turn to Pratt's Jim, but while the two likable actors clearly get on like a house on fire (as evidenced by the press tour) the budding romance of Jim and Aurora as they come to grips with their situation on Avalon never really comes out trumps.Had the duos off-screen rapport been better utilized between the pair it's likely that much more of Passengers more corny dialogue and underdeveloped situations could've come off a little smoother, while the sometimes uneasy relationship the film develops between it's lighter and darker moment's would've felt much more fluent.Heading into Passengers with an open mind and willing attitude will allow the viewer to experience a fun deep space adventure filled with enough romance to keep the Hallmark crowd well and truly happy and Sci-Fi fans intrigued by the imagination on show. By no means a Sci-Fi classic, Passengers is still a journey worth jumping on board for.3 and a half pesky security doors out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I cannot understand all those bad reviews of Passengers,"The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore the ship design).The pacing was a little bit too fast at the end but not that noticeable.Rating: 9/10Sometime a simple movie with simple plot is better than s**t like Batman vs Superman because there are less space for mistakes.

Passengers: The Beautiful People Movie,"I was highly skeptical of Passengers, though I liked the concept I simply couldn't see past the studio literally picking the two ""Hottest"" young current stars as the leads. It all seemed so forced, right down to their criminally photoshopped cover images.Not anything against them, they are a talented pair. But their chemistry wasn't there and that's something you'd think would be a problem with the creators not something to be ignored for the purpose of ratings. I mean they did have a $110 million budget to make back.Heavily promoted, this is one I couldn't avoid if I wanted to so I eventually took the dive and found myself torn with the results.First off as you'd expect for a movie of that budget it all looks great, polished to near perfection the film is a visual treat no doubt.Trouble is the movie is your standard Hollywood formula, predictable, clichéd & shiny. Though the premise is solid, the creators clearly didn't know how to fully utilize this so the movie fell short.Top that off with me thinking Pratt should stick to comedy and being poorly cast here and the movie was littered with flaws.But again it's big and it's shiny and Lawrence looks beautiful as always so it's very easy to be distracted by the fact that the movie isn't actually very good.The ending I found questionable but overall this could have been a complete garbage fire, yet avoided this and resulted in a watchable effort if you can get through the overbearing Hollywood tropes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Every little detail is perfect.Negatives:Stockholm syndrome GALORE, that tries to make Jim likeable but fails.Some of the in-world contrivances that are needed to raise the stakes of the movie could have been entirely preventable, if the people in Passengers' universe knew how to design basic things and make things easily repairable.It would have worked so much better as a thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Passengers was fantastic!,"Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they absolutely love.

A moral problem beautifully presented and executed.,"I enjoyed Passengers a lot. It's not perfect though. The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen's android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren't dumb the story wouldn't work.The only part of the film that doesn't really work is the bit in the middle with Laurence Fishburne. I could see three reasons why his character was needed, but it all felt very contrived. He has one important line though, so I can forgive it (just about). I just wish the writers had thought about that part a bit more, as the rest of the film was really great.

Good Sci-fi Romance (NOT ACTION/THRILLER),"I enjoyed this movie. Great chemistry between possibly the two most in-demand and popular actors alive, visually brilliant and an okay story.I desperately want to mention though, the trailers portrayed the film as something different from what it is. Watching the trailers makes it look like a thriller or action film in space with romance but it is basically opposite, a romance in space with about 20 minutes of action. I'd be totally okay with this, if I hadn't be led to believe it was something else.On the story, it isn't super interesting but builds at a good pace and unfortunately unravels a bit too fast.

I was duped,"My initial thoughts after first seeing the trailer for Passengers was that it was a gross excuse to put Hollywood's two hottest actors on screen together. I saw that the critics had given this abysmal reviews and I wasn't surprised. I was however surprised to see that user reviews contradicted what critics had to say. Reviews contained descriptors like unexpected, great acting, suspense and the like. Well let me tell you this film was none of those. Passengers was forgettable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it just was. Like I said, nothing more than an excuse to have studly guy and sexy girl on screen and cash some cheques while they were at it. The visuals were meh, the acting was passable, the script was something a fourth grader could have written. I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times in some different form. I'm only writing this to detract from the other user reviews that say to ignore what the critics are saying. Though it's not terrible it DEFINITELY isn't worth going out to see.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Starship Avalon,"Folks the Starship Avalon has to be the most beautiful ship of all time. This ship is incredible.It's clearly one of the best space backdrops I've ever seen. I almost passed on this movie because I thought it was a love romantic kinda thing. I couldn't have been more wrong. It clearly opened up my mind on what I would do given the same ordeal. The acting was spot on and really fit their roles. I have over 8000 dvd/Blu-ray's and this one is up there in my short list. I always loved the idea of space travel one day. Even as a kid.

Very Enjoyable SciFi Movie,"Forget some of the lackluster reviews - this is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it worth the trip to the big screen.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are enjoyable to watch and the story is not as far fetched as it may seem to some reviewers. Traveling through space, alone, figuring out how to live life in such a lonesome environment.Early on, I had the impression that Jennifer Lawrence may not have been fully involved; but, after her first scene or two, that feeling disappeared and she delivered her usual excellence.Head to the theater, get a big tub of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy a couple of hours of good escapism.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ignore the overly biased reviews, this is what it is:","CGI - 8.5/10. Acting - 7/10. Script - 6.5/10.No Spoilers.Well first things first, the trailer revealed far too much and was a total misrepresentation of the films pace - the action sequences are confined to the last 35 or so minutes, but this isn't a bad thing at ALL. The previous hour and 10 mins is exploration of the situation our characters find themselves in, the human condition, and decent character development. I'd describe this film as a romance action drama with undertones of suspense, set in space.CGI -- The amount of money spent on the CGI almost tricks you into thinking that you're watching an action movie from start to finish, it's incredibly well done! Polished and presented beautifully, with enough detail to transport you right onto the star-ship, and keep you there. Some great external shots with two particularly awe-inspiring moments.ACTING -- The acting was good throughout. I say 7/10 because I know that both actors are capable of more (aimed toward Chris Pratt more than Jennifer Lawrence). Whilst the script also held them back somewhat, there was still room for them both to shine at different points - two very specific scenes stand out, rising above the clichés that we're normally fed. But unfortunately, there were also clichés...THE SCRIPT -- It ALMOST escapes that intellectually removed dark void of Hollywood influence, and is indeed buried nicely under pretty pictures, pretty actors and pretty action, but it does drip through in a few places. So we get an occasionally cheesy romance drama in space, rather than anything *truly* deep and meaningful, like Interstellar gave us. The redemption to this is an intriguing moral dilemma that most of the good scenes are attributed with, and the first 20 mins of the film which I can't describe without spoilers.KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING -- It's definitely not as terrible as some reviewers are implying, you just need to understand what you're going to be watching (which, again, was misrepresented by the trailer and likely the cause for most poor reviews). It IS good for what it is. It succeeds at making you question a thing or two, laugh a few times and has enjoyable characters, but not a huge amount more. Also, it may be set in space but seen through the eyes of a true Sci-Fi aficionado, absoluteellyyyy nothing of significant grandiosity occurs. The trade off is that a Sci-Fi fan will still enjoy this film for it's CGI and futuristic setting, but it's also open for the typical girlfriend-boyfriend movie night.CONCLUSION THEN... -- Overall, Passengers works, doing almost everything it seemed to try and do. You should see it at the cinema if you have the chance. The CGI alone make it worth it - the ship was like an extra character in the film, somewhat literally! Just try and understand what this film is first.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

While it's not loaded with 'blow em up' action, the movie is filled with tension and does have some great action scenes.

A solid film that was sadly trampled by early critic reviews,"I believe that this was a good film, the performances were solid and the visuals were quite good too. The best performance probably from Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur.Despite all the comments on how this film does not utilize the idea of isolation and confinement well and that the romance in this film overtakes the more important theme of this film I enjoyed it, here's why. I thought that Passengers discusses a very important and age long question, the question of sacrificing your own well being or to sacrifice another's in order to fulfill your own. It's a very deep and thought provoking question that I believe the film possess very well.I thought that the themes of isolation and the romance between the characters were not overpowering each other and were well balanced by splitting it by acts. The film was suspenseful as our characters unravel the causes to the mysterious malfunctioning of the film and the empty atmosphere created by the film was really well realised as well.I felt that the characters were sympathetic and they made very rational and reasonable decisions unlike what early reviews have described as, ""creepy"".Of Course it lacked in some parts in terms of its rationality but this is always a thing that bugs some and doesn't at all bother others. I can be either of those people at times and I did find that certain points in this film were irrational in my opinion however are points that can be gotten over with.So I recognise that there are flaws in this film but it is a solid entry and an enjoyable watch that has been trampled over by the critics.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The story flows really well, the CGI is not overdone, the setting is great, and the acting is what makes it all ""fit"", both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job, they absolutely nailed their characters and the charisma to make a story like this believable.Yes, this movie is not for everyone, especially if you expected a ""proper"" sci-fi, but it has that ""feel good"" vibe to it and the pacing is great, not once did I feel like it was getting boring or wasting my time.All in all it's a great movie, it had some convenient things here and there, but it didn't take away from the experience.

Worthwhile but short of expectations,"WHAT'S PASSENGERS ABOUT? A man and woman wake up from cryo-sleep on a futuristic space flight decades before the other passengers.IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: C+) On paper, talented and attractive Hollywood stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt should make for an ideal on screen romance. Indeed, one reason Passengers works as well as it does it their ability to elevate the material. Their chemistry suffers, however, from a under-cooked screenplay that hinges on deus ex- machina plot conveniences, laughable dialogue, and questionable ethics that give the romance a bit of a creepy vibe. Still, the visuals are phenomenal, the impressive sets alone are worth the price of a matinée, the stars are solid (Michael Sheen nearly steals the show as an android bartender), and the ending is emotionally-satisfying. Passengers is worth seeing if you're a fan of sci-fi, romance, or the actors, but it fails to meet its potential.IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Passengers is rated PG-13. It features one f-word and several moderate profanities. We see a man's naked rear end as he walks around a spaceship. A woman wears a revealing swimsuit. There's two sex scenes (one right after the other), one of which features obscured nudity. There are intense moments of peril.ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES? Lies and dishonesty always come to light and damage trust in relationships. Accountability and vulnerability draw people close. You may not control your circumstances, but you can control your response and attitude.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Contrived but fascinating space movie with a moral conundrum at its centre,"It's very disappointing to remember the reception accorded to Passengers. From what I can gather, the movie was a commercial success, which is always the main thing in Hollywood. Yet, it garnered quite a lot of opprobrium from critics and social media fusspots. It was almost as if the critics could not separate the actors' decision to do this movie from the choices made by the characters they play in it. I wonder if it isn't a bit like Janet Jackson's nipple-slip at the Super Bowl halftime show. One American journalist told British Tv, I woke the next morning to find out my country had lost its collective mind. Strange the things that can create a moral panic.I don't suppose there's ever been an attempt to remake in Hollywood, for example, Almodóvar's movie Habla con ella. How would the fragile egos of the California set, and their agents, cope with such a story plot development as the one that happens there?It's even more disconcerting that Jennifer Lawrence basically disavowed the movie, in the light of negative feedback. How many headlines were there about her regrets? One must almost hope that she was being publicity pragmatic, and not sincere, because Passengers is a fascinating film, with a great moral dilemma at its centre. One that should encourage the truly challenging task of empathy. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), a passenger on a ship headed into deep space, bound for a colony settlement on a remote planet, wakes up from hibernation 90 or so years too soon, due to a malfunction. He can't do anything to reverse this, and finds himself alone with automated talking computer programs and no humans. The only remotely human presence, and curiously the only thing capable of apparently learning from their interactions, is the robot bartender, Arthur (Michael Sheen). A lot of the computer voices seem to have English accents, which given the escalating malfunctionings of the ship is rather disconcerting for British industry.Jim's predicament cannot help but remind Brits of the predicament of Dave Lister in sci-fi comedy, Red Dwarf. Both go a little nuts, finding themselves alone on a huge spaceship far from Earth. Both contemplate suicide. But neither one is completely alone, as it turns out. And given what happens, it is enormously important that Jim woke up early. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.This movie doesn't only invite us to consider and think over Jim's fateful decision, we also need to think about the motivation and behaviour of his fellow passenger, Aurora (J-Law). Not so much what she does on the ship but what she did to get there in the first place. Many commentators got hung up on Jim's big decision, but Aurora's is no less deserving of circumspection.Aside from that stuff, their developing relationship is often very sweet, and the environment of the space ship wholly enveloping and convincing on its own terms. And Michael Sheen makes a wonderful supporting presence as Arthur the robot bartender. Really, this is a far smarter career choice, in terms of artistic merit, tham J-Law's recent nonsense, No Hard Feelings.Recommended with a good deal of enthusiasm.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The stars are for the visuals. I respect all four actors, but the story is pathetic and even more so if this is how real people deal with being totally alone!","Everyone else has said what they think of this movie, but none of the dozens of reviews I've read mention just how the idea of being perfectly healthy with nearly anything and everything you could wish more at your disposal (no idea there is a major problem with the ship yet) causes a man or had it been a woman to be in such despair the person wants to commit suicide all because he/she would have to love a life totally alone as the ship travels through the wonderess vastness of space. I can understand looking at peoples video files. I can understand being lonely as I've been thrust into a life of utter aloneness since 2013. It's now almost 2019 and although I speak to no one, go fishing in my backyard almost daily, have no one to assist me with my pain. No one to cuddle up with. No one to even speak to, etc. I've been suffering several major health issues and NO ONE IS HELPING ME OR DO I HAVE ALL I COULD EVER WANT FOR FREE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. And my view outside is no where near as incredible as seen by just looking out a window in this movie.What I find most hard to believe is anyone so weak willed, so lacking in personal fortitude, that they seriously think about suicide when they're in perfect health with all the food, water, entertainment they could want except the contact with another human being. The movie also proved... had these people met in a real life setting, she would have never given him a second thought because she is rich. Plus, let's add to my list of pathetic things...his total selfishness in deciding to condemn another person to his fate just so he won't be alone. How about this Hollywood... What would have made a REAL good story in this setting is as follows....She gets so pissed at his actions, she kills him and SHE lives out the rest of her life alone or until the ship blows up or gets to be put into the medical stasis pod?. And just one more thought. Most shows/movies when a man and woman have sex, they never use protection or contraception and nearly always the woman gets pregnant. So why didn't these two lovers have a child or three to leave behind to finish the voyage to the new planet in their place and leave a legacy of their existence behind?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Crusoe and Girl Friday.,"Pretty much reviled by professional critics, Passengers has overcome that to hold affection with a good portion of the sci-fi loving public. More safe sci-fi footings than anything remotely ground breaking, it ends up a a tidy romantic piece that's laced with pertinent questions involving man and his/her reactions to extraordinary scenario's.Although the viewer is for the most part hankering for action to explode off the screen, it's only when - in the film's last quarter - you realise that it was actually working fine as a character study without the fireworks.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have bunches of charisma, in fact more than enough to carry the story through its more shaky elements. They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.The effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.Newcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Typical Sci Fi Movie With Emphasis,"18 March 2017. Visually on the spaceship, one could be reminded of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) including a phone call, Alien (1979) and hibernation chambers, and even a robot from The First Spaceship on Venus (1960). Unfortunately there are no real interesting twists one might expect and the sci fi script plays more like a toned down Gravity (2013) with a relationship angle. What makes this sci fi movie a bit better than the average outer space adventure is the personal character development and moral dilemma that was given good screen time. Even so the American nature of romantic drama abounds in this movie. Entertaining, though slow at times, and could have been better. The ending scene, however, was a nice touch and almost redeemed the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

He is faced with being alone for the rest of his life unless he can find a way to get back to sleep.I must admit I went in to this with some preconceptions, asuming it would target a young female audience. I was pleasantly surprised.The story is very simple, don't expect too much in the way of plot twists, this is mainly about how the characters deal with their situation.As the title suggest -and the characters admit- on a fully automated system human beings really are just passengers. Chris Pratt's contribution to the problem is solved in my house by a small, wooden wedge. The writers, not daring to have a passive female character, give Jennifer Lawrence a ridiculous task that could have been better accomplished by a well trained labrador.The affects are good, the story is OK but is padded out to fill the time. But it was done well and I enjoyed this.It may have been a nice change to make Jenifer the engineer and change the roles up a bit - I expect the writers were afraid that a female audience wouldn't stomach a sulky Chris Pratt.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Frustrating. Great premise, many well done parts, laziest script ever","The film look great. Lots of excellent special effects to make it convincing. Excellent cast. Compelling story. Very funny parody of what life may be like in the future. But boy does it ever fall flat as a board towards the end. And the ending is rushed, lame, pitiful and quite unbelievable.The first hour is set up in a little quickly but it works, in spite of some stilted dialogue and scenes that should have been redone so that they didn't feel as if they were scripted and unnatural. But that's a minor quibble given how much I liked the premise and much of where the story was going. Pratt plays a man on a 120 year or so trip to another colony in space to live in luxury. This premise is completely absurd for many reasons (such as what you'll see in the movie.) During the journey he awakens very early after an asteroid strikes the ship and causes a malfunction. And he can't go back into hibernation (why... good question. Perhaps they thought the ship would never suffer the problem.) And he finds himself alone... very alone. And as a result he must make some difficult choices.Jennifer Lawrence obviously appears in the film. She does a great job with what she's been handed. Michael Sheen as the bartender is perfectly cast although very little is done with him. The real problems are contrivance that begin to work their way into being positively annoying and dumb when ""the twist"" happens during the film that changes the course of everything. It's the kind of mistake that shouldn't have been made because the character wouldn't make such a mistake. And from there the film ends up traveling at light speed towards phony. It never recovers from that fatal misstep.It's unfortunate that a film with the potential for so many great directions falls so flat in the second half. And for this reason I've given the film a very generous 6. You may really enjoy the atmosphere and the premise. But when it fails you may feel cheated by a very lazy effort. It's disappointing.

"Attention-catching and unique, but a bit droll","Passengers has a good story line, acceptable acting, decent direction, and absolutely incredible sets and CGI. The movie is both slow paced and fast paced in just the right amounts, with the pace fitting the context of the script. It is entertaining, exciting and draws the viewer quickly into the plot and holds us there.The downside is an anticlimactic plot element. Neither the director nor the actors make the resolution of the film believable. At the end I found myself wondering about different ways they could have ended it better... and that's never good.Mind you, how they ended it was okay, just kind of... lacking that certain something that makes a person say ""Wow, that was a great film."" It's an interesting film. But if not for the spectacular sets there isn't much here that would set it apart from class-B scifi with good CGI.The sets are incredible. THIS is a generation ship in all its glory. The only thing that could have made them better would have been 3 or 4 more sets just as grandiose. The set design was unique, creative, and fine. The bar-- a central area to both ship and plot-- is a great bar, with a very pleasant android (no spoiler there... shown in the commercials) that is both well-acted and essential to the plot.Neither actor really brought out the emotion one would expect in the situations presented. Whether this was poor casting or poor directing is difficult to tell, but imo neither part is pulled off well. They came across like actors playing a part; this is one film in which unknowns might have been better cast as the leads. The characters are almost static, expected and predictable all the way through. In truth, there's only one scene in the film that one might consider unexpected, and it's at the very end. The rest of it, although brilliantly presented and filmed, is somewhat cliché.One of the biggest problems of the film was a plot device. When one of the characters does something morally and ethically questionable, the film just never seems to succeed in overcoming that. Nothing that happens thereafter succeeds in overcoming that major hurdle. It tries, and provides a particularly good ""illustration"" in attempt to resolve the matter (no spoilers!)... but in whole it just falls flat by creating a non-sympathetic character.Overall this show is well worth seeing. There are good moments in it. It's just that at the end one feels that the spaceship was the real star of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good watch.,"A spaceship on a 120 year voyage to a planet like earth transporting 5000+ people for a new beginning with one person awake from hibernation with 90 more years to go. Well this movie has it all, it has technology, it has a story, it has romance, it has trouble, it has a suspense. A win win combination.I was thrilled to see the Science and technology in this movie, a star ship which has all the facilities like a cruise liner. The efforts put in this movie are tremendous and are well seen.A pretty movie for both Sci-Fi and Romantic fans. The only thing that bugged me was its ending. The movie was great but in my opinion it should've had a better climax. Its the unsatisfying climax that lead to critics disliking the movie. I am not criticizing its just what I think. Otherwise Chris and JLaw were fab! Not to forget Michael Sheen too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Works (sort of) as a romance movie, but fails as a sci-fi action movie","""Passengers"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of the Starship Avalon, ""Destination: Space Colony Homestead II"", we are reminded at the beginning of the movie. The 5,000+ passengers aboard are in hibernation for the 120 year journey. But when the spaceship run into a large meteorite, the hibernation pod of one of the passengers malfunctions, and wakes up a guy named Jim Preston. Alone on the giant spaceship (but for a robot bartender named Arthur), Jim tries to fix the pod (to no avail) and seems resigned to just wither away. Then he has an idea... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second Hollywood movie from Danish director Morten Tyldum, who brought us the brilliant ""Headhunters"" some 4-5 years ago and soon thereafter was signed to direct ""The Imitation Game"". Here he brings us a sci-fi movie in the disguise of a romance (or perhaps it's the other way around). The best part of the movie is the first 30 min. when Jim (played by Chris Pratt) adjusts to his lonesome existence on the giant spaceship. When eventually Aurora (played by Jennifer Lawrence) joins him (sorry, can't spoil how that happens exactly), the movie becomes an outright romantic affair, a courtship set in space. ""For two unlucky people, we sure got lucky"", says Aurora at some point. It isn't until the last 30 min. that the movie tries to make itself into a sci-fi action movie, but in my opinion fails to do so credibly (too many holes in the script the size of Manhattan). Michael Sheen is a pure delight as the robot bartender. The last character (played by Lawrence Fishburn) enters the plot too late to have any significant impact. On the plus side, the set and production design is top-notch, it's clear no expenses were spared (the movie sports a reported production cost of $110 million). Kudos also to Thomas Newman for the fantastic film score, which plays quasi non-stop (Imagine Dragons also contribute a new song ""Levitate"" which plays over the movie's end titles). Bottom line: if you have seen the movie's trailer and are expecting an action-packed space movie, you are sure to be disappointed, as this is not that kind of movie at all.""Passengers"" opened wide on Wednesday of this week. Having seen the trailer, I couldn't wait to see it. The Wednesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. Given the onslaught of new releases as usual at the year-end, I'm guessing ""Passenger"" is going to have a difficult time finding an audience. If you really want to see a space action movie, stick with ""Rogue One"". If on the other hand you are in the mood for a romantic movie, this might well do the trick for you, up to a certain level.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Sci Fi missing the Sci,"This was a substantial disappointment; it's not often I walk out of a cinema baffled as to the point of what I've just seen. Put simply, it is a creepy romance first and a sci fi... only in the marketing. What little science there is, is wrong (others have commented on sudden episodes of zero g, sounds in space etc) and there is just nothing to inspire the imagination which characterises good sci fi. With 3 human characters, there is also absolutely no threat nor tension. At one point in the film, an allusion is made to being stranded on a desert island and this is the point in a nutshell: with a little rewriting, this story could have been set in the middle of the Pacific with a volcano as the present danger. There was no need for a futuristic setting which would have done away with the jarring technical errors and plot holes.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sit tight and enjoy the ride,A malfunction in a spacepod causes one of the passengers by the name of Jim Preseton to wake up early. After feeling lonely he wakes up another passenger called Aurora Lane. Which the cause thing to get super complicated later.The film was definitely a very fun ride.The acting by both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was excellent. Alongside Lawrence Fishbume.

"A Story of Emotion - With Mystery, Suspense and Excitement","As it began, this was a story that could have left one with the strange feelings of isolation, but it went into a different direction.This was a romance/love story that follows that path for a while, then veers off in the opposite direction.This was a mystery, to a degree, that effectively starts when one sees the advertisement, that tells us something has gone wrong.Mostly this is sci-fi adventure that has a lot of tense moments, as it builds to a pretty strong climax.I am not going to write about the acting here. I do not know about acting. I like many people do not recognize good or bad acting and I even took a long time to recognize a movie plot that revolves around acting talent (See the 1991 movie ""Career Opportunities"" with Frank Whaley and Jennifer Connelly and figure out what famous town that movie will wind up in). Besides it is difficult to determine the difference between good acting and good direction/editing. Bad directing, that's another story.But this as a whole was a good movie, and more powerful than I expected.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent movie, but the trailer was misleading - SPOILER ALERT!","WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! The movie was excellent, being perhaps the first real combo romance-science fiction movie ever made. It did so with mostly plausible events, as good as most science fiction writing. I never expected Hollywood to do as well as ""real"" written science fiction. And Jennifer Lawrence was superb, as can only be expected, and so were the special effects and the space-ship itself.But the trailer was misleading. At the end of the official Trailer, Chris Pratt says, ""there was a reason we woke up early"" which makes it sound like there was some kind of a conspiracy, or perhaps aliens on board wreaking havoc, or a corporation cutting corners. This led us to think that something ""more"" was going to happen on the ship. Instead, the cause of them waking up early was simply a prosaic accident of nature. My wife was very disappointed because she expected something a lot more treacherous cause (human or alien life form) than there was, due to this misleading trailer.There were at least two other major events which were scientifically impossible too, but I am willing to forgive those since it was necessary for the sake of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A thinker,"For a SF film, Passengers is on the calm side, yet still evocative. It's about two people together in space under far from ideal great circumstances. Its plot centers around a moral choice that is as inevitable as it is impossible, which gives this relatively romantic movie an underlying tension throughout. And that's all I can say without spoilers.Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in the acting category and Chris Pratt knows his place by giving her the limelight, which is the mark of a great actor. Others (no spoilers) compliment perfectly. The plot however is a little predictable. You can really see some story beats coming miles away. Although later, the tempo and twist become more interesting.The music is quite bad and cliched but the atmosphere, filming and art direction are strong throughout. And the central premise is so good that you can't help thinking: what would I do?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Small movie concept in a big movie budget,"Passengers is a movie with a very simple concept. A spaceship is on a journey that will take 120 years to reach its destination and all of its passengers and crew are in hibernation. Along the way two people wake up far too early and have to decide how to go on with their lives.When the movie sticks to this concept, it's very successful. It conveys the loneliness of being the only human(s) around at the moment, along with the knowledge that they will die prior to reaching their destination and won't make further human contact. Jennifer Lawrence and, even more-so, Christ Pratt convey the emotions their characters must be going through.It's the third act which knocks a few points off for me as the movie moves outside of the realm of character study and into slightly more sci-fi areas. The script at that point gets very generic, and is less character focused. fortunately, the movie does get back to point before the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Okay, it's not flawless, and if you are looking for a convincing ""scientifically correct"" fiction you will get annoyed.

Now the critics put up so much negative information then people just give up. So sad. Critics rarely like ANY Sci-Fi films and we know the academy doesn't. Bottom line does this movie entertain you.

Jen and Chris pay homage to Kubrick,"I admit that Morten Tyldum's ""Passengers"" isn't any sort of masterpiece, but it's nonetheless an impressive piece of work. Aside from the main plot, I liked the tributes to Stanley Kubrick's movies (setting in outer space, talking computers, the bar scenes, trying to chop through a door; just add a Beethoven soundtrack and you'd have a clean sweep).Like a number of movies, the movie warns us about over-reliance on technology, with lots of suspense to keep things going.

I wonder if we'll ever have commercial space travel.Anyway, it's an enjoyable movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Passangers,"An interesting concept.This film although simple in theory actually has a lot of secret meanings and elements to it that make it more than just an ordinary space movie.

Simplicity is something humans have forgotten, with the new technology and parts of life that we've added have changed it forever and sometimes we forget how simple it really is and how little you need to thrive.

To me writers like Asimov, Heinlein and Van Vogt are masters of the trade. When I first read about the story line I thought it would be a movie in their tradition. It is clearly not. I cannot go into details why not, because I could (would?) spoil other people's enjoyable evening. As a love story it is not that bad.

All Aboard For Interstellar Romance and Visuals,"Space! The final frontierand the setting for so many movies in this day and age. Welcome to another Robbie K movie review. Tonight's focus is on Passengers starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as they voyage the stars in a pretty cool (albeit odd) looking ship. Based on the trailers this science fiction adventure looks to have romance, drama and mystery, but is this the case? Can these two mega stars bring a love story to life? As always read on to hear my take on Passengers!LIKES:  Fantastic Acting  The love story component  Beautiful visuals  Beautiful scoreNo surprise here, the acting is one of the leading components in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence's edgy mood is very welcome in this setting, painting a character that is vulnerable yet strong when faced with the dilemmas. Her emotions are so well-balanced in this film, painting a realistic character that many will anchor too. Yes, her cracking voice is getting a little stale, and she is playing similar characters, but it works so well. As for Pratt, again the man impresses me with dynamic characters. Pratt substitutes his normally silly persona for a more serious nature, and it works well. He sells his idolization of companionship, radiates misery from the isolation and betrayal, and still manages to come off heroic at parts. And the chemistry between these two is a reaction gone well. Pratt and Lawrence sell their passion for one another, almost as if they are actually in love with each other. Not easy considering Hollywood relationships these days. Speaking of the love story, Passengers' strongest story component has to be the relationship of the characters. It's a very dramatic tale packed with emotion that fluctuates between blissful happiness and heartbreaking revelations. As stated, the actors' chemistry helps sell the story, but the writers did a nice job designing this tale to be not only passionate, but believable. Yes, my friends, Passengers isn't a Nicholas Sparks fairy tale, but actually highlights the work involved with a relationship, nice work guys. And for those who want passionate love making scenes, it's got a few to spice up the film, but not so much to fall into the overdone (or pornographic realms). Well done guys, well done! Yet my favorite component has to be the beautiful visuals and music score that was designed for this film. Hollywood certainly knows how to create eccentric looking ships on the outside, but seldom do they create a large world within. The attention to detail is astonishing, each section meticulously designed to fit with the theme of the station. Even the engineering components have a logical explanation in regards to their purpose in the ship. And these settings are further amplified by the orchestral score that accompanies it. While many symphony tracks sound the same, Passengers adds a little something to help it stand out, especially during the spacewalk scenes where the music established both the beauty and spirit of adventure.DISLIKES:  Slow at the beginning  No mystery  The science fiction dilemma is semi rushed  Fourth character almost unnecessaryWe know some movies take time to build steam, but Passengers certainly struggles to get its ion drives going. The opening sequences are devoid of any edge, serving to introduce the ship and the dilemma involving one of our characters. However, this montage probably could have been cut down a bit to get to the exciting parts of the story (and cut down on the run time). In addition, the boring opening could be due to the lack of the mystery. Despite the teaser line put in the trailer, you'll get 95% of the answers in the first twenty minutes of the film. I had so looked forward to uncovering a conspiracy regarding their abrupt waking, but sadly the explanations are lackluster. The only mystery that remains is the technical explanations for what happens, which most viewers will not give a darn about.In regards to the science fiction component, Passengers is both good and bad in this category. The good is the ship, the technical jargon, and the looming threat of insanity in the void of space. However, the bad far overshadows the good for me. Passengers dilemma starts out pretty low key and remains low key for much of the film. Then at the drop of a hat things escalate to danger levels in mere minutes, a solution comes even faster, and the resolve is predictable and quite corny at parts. Even the introduction of a fourth character played by Lawrence Fishburne can't save the rushed plot development. Fishburne's role is touching at points, but the writers diluted his role to merely providing quick answers and a trinket to get the job done. Such a shame that the mystery and dilemma could not have shined like the love story.The VERDICT:Passengers surprised me by how much I enjoyed watching the movie. While a bit slow at the beginning, I enjoyed the love story and sense of adventure our characters shared as they hurtled through space. In addition, the beautiful visuals and strong attention to detail further impressed me, designing a set worthy of special effects awards at the Oscars. Outside the love story though, I was disappointed with the lack of mystery and rushed dilemma they placed in this movie. For once, I think the movie needed to be longer, to help make a more suspenseful film and get a little more kick to the relationship. This film is worth a scope for romantic audiences and those who like beautiful visuals. However, in regards to story over all, save this one home viewing.My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Excellent film for Sci-Fi fans,"Firstly, let me get this out of the way.. was it just me or did this film seem massively inspired by 'Red Dwarf'? You have your Lister character, your Kochanski character, your Kryten character.. and even the 'Skutters' and the manic vending machines! And the opening line '3 million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf' seems similar to the situation faced on the Avalon in rather a lot of ways!To say there is a large 'Red Dwarf' theme though is not a bad thing. In fact seeing how a serious grown up version of Red Dwarf might have been was quite refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable in what will be quite familiar territory to a lot of fans. Add that to some great acting and some truly spectacular sets and CGI, and you've got a really good film. The sets are certainly on a par with the likes of 'Oblivion'.Some people have reviewed the intricacies of the characters and interactions and found it somewhat lacking. But to be honest, as a Sci-Fi fan I didn't really notice any of that as there was too much going on in what was generally very pleasing film to watch. I felt the characters played their roles really well, and the chemistry between them seemed believable to me.If you're not a Sci-Fi or action fan then you may not get as much from it as others. I can't see my wife massively enjoying it for example! But what I will say is.. watch the trailer, and if you like the look of it then I'm certain you'll enjoy the actual film.I can't wait to watch it again!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unassuming,"Not a bad movie, but not great.Chris Pratt is good, as is Jennifer Lawrence, the direction, special effects and editing are good, but the storyline is a bit lame, too many coincidences, too many timely (or untimely) problems, always escaping at the last moment or just after the last moment, during the venting of the power source burn Chris Pratt should either have been burnt up or got radiation and died quickly, ok he had an improvised heat shield for his body, but what about his legs? Its a bit formulaic and has several very unlikely scenarios. The sex angle is a bit of putting as well, ok they are man & woman so this will happen, but do we really need to have this in a sci-fi drama. This is a case of Hollywood trying to push all the buttons and cross all the dots to make a film that will appeal to as many people as possible, rather than to create a classic sci-fi film, money is again getting in the way of a good story.There are those on here that diss this film, why ? After all it is well made and acted, and then there are those that think it is great/fantastic, have they not seen other sci-fi movies, many which are much better.It reminds me about 'Gravity' with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, but at least in that they did not include the sex aspect and the storyline did not pander too much to crossing all the ticks of Hollywood, just a bit. So that was better than this.For me this is average, maybe just above for the quality of the film, so I give it a 6, if I was going on the story maybe I would only give it a 3.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A 120yr hibernation journey on the star ship Avalon to the colony planet Homestead II.,"The sci-fi action film Passengers was released December 21, 2016 and directed by Morten Tyldum. I say the film itself has a beautiful scenery, and excellent costume design. The theme of Passengers very well should be ""Do not worry to much about the future,"" ""and enjoy what is in front of you."" Often times we get caught up what we want to do, instead of what we can do at the moment. The overall content of the film was intriguing, surprising, and very heartwarming. I rally liked the chemistry between Jim Preston(Chris Pratt), Arthur(Michael Sheen), and Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence). Both of them had an excellent portrayal of their characters thoughts, feelings, feelings, and actions from the beginning of the movie to the end. The context was pretty good too I thought. Especially, between Jim and Arthur when Jim explains his feelings to bartender to try to cope with his loneliness. There was not really anything that I did not like about Passengers at all. In closing, I say Passengers is a must see for ages thirteen and older. Just about everyone can get something out of seeing it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love the ship and the entire premise of colonizing space, excellent.
Love the plot. Although in the middle more should have been done to clarify his faith in his actions beyond mere infatuation.
Jennifer Lawrence was great. Michael Sheen was too. Chris Pratt however in the scenes where he was meant to be the doting lover or show real emotion was hilariously bad.

"Amazing first half, disappointing second half","*Contains Spoilers*This is a really difficult review to write actually. I watched the first half of Passengers the other day and was absolutely hooked. Couldn't stop thinking about it for the next two days and couldn't wait to get the chance to watch the rest, which I did with my partner, and I was so disappointed by the second half, it felt almost like a completely different film to me.So regarding to the first half, I absolutely loved the idea and the personal dilemma the main character is going through. It's a plausible issue as well, and it's very well acted by Chris Pratt. I thought this film had a lot of potential and could potentially have gone into a very interesting direction. Instead, it then does a little bit of a U-turn and went about as mainstream as it gets. And I'm not saying this because I hate mainstream films and need twists and turns every second, or because I only watch super arty films which I don't, but because it got so utterly predictable and cheesy that I found it hard to watch after a while.Overall Passengers was definitely not a waste of time and very entertaining in parts, but being a filmmaker myself I just couldn't stop thinking about the immense potential this film had and all the ways they could have gone with it, apart from choosing a very very stereotypical, Hollywood romance route.Bonus points though for acting on both sides, for stunning cinematography and effects and for the bar scenes which really reminded me of ""The Shining"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

While this movie is an excellent Sci-Fi flick with an amazing story, photography and visuals of space – while it's extremely well done on that front - the 'misunderstanding' may be that this is another slam-bam science-fiction flick like the latest star wars. However Passengers is also a great love story and worth seeing for the relationship that develops, being well written and for its surprising plot twists.

"Katniss Everdeen and Star Lord in love and in space? What could go wrong? Well, a few things...","I recorded this movie on FX and watched it today. It was pretty much what I expected. Not bad, and gorgeous to look at. Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up from hibernation 30 years early on board of a spaceship that's transporting thousands of people to another planet. He's the only one who is awake and doesn't know why. It's just him and a robotic bartender (Michael Sheen, who was amazing in Frost/Nixon). So he's the only awake human on the ship until a woman named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) wakes up too. After that, they become friends, and then more. You'll know how she came to be awakened right away. I won't spoil that. Later on though, the ship they're on starts having a ton of issues. And that's when things get real bad, and progressively get worse. That's pretty much the sum of the movie's parts, aside from what I didn't say. But I enjoyed this movie. It did drag a little at times but picked up once Jim finds his way into some other areas, and even more when Aurora wakes up. The VFX are really good, and the overall production design is outstanding and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. I thought the score was fine, with some pieces better to me than others (also Oscar-nominated). Pratt and Lawrence are really good in this movie. I feel like they had real chemistry between each other, and in general gave strong acting efforts. And I liked Michael Sheen as Arthur, the bartender. And also, another actor eventually shows up. You'll recognize him when you see him (you actually hear his voice first). At the very end of the film, for maybe 10-15 seconds another actor appears. He's literally an extra. But overall it's a decent movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is everybody going on about? This was a great movie,"Maybe it's because I came into the theater expecting to see pretty much what the movie ended up delivering, but I really liked this movie, in spite of not being a fan of sony after the string of crap they've put out the last couple of years (the smurfs, the interview, ghostbusters and whatnot).The movie was drenched in cynicism about the cult of corporations, and automation taking over our lives. We are more and more serviced by machines and are completely on our own with no help from our fellow humans if something goes wrong, I thought this story, beyond the usual romantic comedy formula (complete with the reveal of the false pretense and the guy having to re-earn the girl's love by redeeming himself) was a nice echo to that fact. Seeing that I saw the movie in a theater that was near-fully automated, it was almost poetic.The acting was fine, even jennifer lawrence's, the ship design was great, the world that was hinted at beyond the story seemed to be interesting.. The movie hit a good balance between characters and action (even if maybe it could have used a bit more urgency in the second act).. In summary, as with several movies I've seen recently, I wonder if I saw the same movie that everyone seems to hate? I really had a good time and don't understand the ratings nor the critics, although everyone is of course entitled to their opinion. All I ask from a movie is escapism, and that it makes sense from beginning to end, and it delivered, much more than the endless treadmill of 'comic book movies with 1 hour of city destruction in the middle for no reason at all'If you expect a pratt/lawrence vehicle that's mostly a romantic dramedy with some scifi backdrop and a cynical view of our modern corporate life (think weyland-yutani in aliens) then don't miss out on this movie, I think you'll have a good time as I did.

Worth a Watch,"Passengers (2016) directed by Morten Tylom, written by Jon Spaihts is a very interesting concept. It looks at how space travel communication is limited and that in order to reach places there is a large amount of time that has to pass to reach far away places in space. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Prat as passengers on a spaceship where they are supposed to be asleep but they wake up. The film does a great job of showing the problems when doing deep space voyages. But the film's plot never really seemed to pick up and was very stagnant throughout the film. The acting was excellent but the execution of the plot was ok at best. There were stunning cinematic shots that showed space and the ship, this helped the film by adding an element of beauty in the harsh reality of space. The science and some of the action in the movie is nowhere near accurate but it worked in the film to have big moments and be considered a science fiction film.

Passengers(2016)-Movie review,"Passengers is the story of Starship Avalon, who´s making a 120 year voyage to the Homestead Colony.One of the passengers happens to wake up 90 years early, the movie follows his life, and the life of another passenger during that period.
Passengers is a romantic sci-fi feature that has an interesting premisse for a story, however it is weighted down by a poorly written and developed script, the movie never manages to be as interesting as it could be.
Visually however the movie is great, the visual effects, the cinematography, and the production design really help to give the movie a reallistic feel.
The cast is good, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have a chemistry that works, there are good moments to be found with these two.
The movie has also some problems with the genre, it is a times a romance, a sci-fi, a comedy, and a thriller too, but it ends up just being a mess.
Passengers has an original premisse for a movie, a good cast, and it is beautfiull to look, however it is also poorly written, developed, directed and suffers from an inconsistent tone.Wasted potential unfortunately.6.4/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Phenomenal acting & a decent story,"Passengers sets the bar high with its high powered cast and flashy special effects...and it doesn't disappoint. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence knock this story out of the park with incredible chemistry. The story is surprising original, although it does carry some of the clichés that go along with romantic movies. The movie itself is far more than the trailer shows...and that's as far as I'll go into that. I personally have some issues with the last scene of the film, which prevents me from giving it a higher score. But I can overlook that when thinking about the relative cohesiveness with the rest of the plot. I recommend going to see this film based purely on the cast, and the emotion. The acting alone was enough to keep me engaged. Don't expect it to be the next Titantic, but it's definitely an excellent date movie. Ladies will love the love story and the emotion and Chris Pratt, guys...it's J- Law and it's in space (c'mon). Solid 8-9 movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than expected, would recommend","I went to one of the first showing of this movie where I live. I didn't have any high expectations before seeing the movie, the trailer left me wondering if there was much to the movie.I have to say I was positively surprised about how it turned out. There are some nice twist in the movie and the characters develop well in my opinion.I felt some of the things in this movie are a bit overdone but for me this also ""broke up"" the seriousness a bit. Some parts felt a little rushed and I'm hoping there will be an extended version sometime in the future. It does have its funny moments and/or lines and I think there is something for everyone in there.Personally I think the acting for most characters was good, although I can't say anything about that on a professional level other than just watching movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good way for entertainment,"Although it wasn't particularly an awesome movie, it's entertaining to watch it on a lazy saturday. The plot is original and gives something to think about.

Sci-fi for generation stupid,"This film is bad. Its not bad in a funny way, its just bad.There are elements from past sci-fi films in Passengers DNA that make you hope that the film will pick up in pace, or quality, which sadly never happens.This film is flat, dull, with flat characters that you probably do not care for.I feel bad for larry fishburne who has seen better roles in his career. Giant snoozefest, not recommended, despite all the bought positive reviews on this page.Better luck next time!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good space adventure,"On the Avalon spaceship, traveling to a new planet for 120 years, a passenger is awaken 90 years before time. After realizing there is nothing he can do to in terms of long term sleeping, he starts enjoying himself as the only awaken passenger, but loneliness will soon affect his thoughts, as well as an imminent ship failure.It's an interesting story with some incredible visuals, which simply amaze you with every occasion. The plot is quite linear and simplistic, thus predictable, but it does its job well in drawing the viewer into the surreal scenery.It's a pleasant watch and a good movie overall but nothing groundbreaking unfortunately, while the worst part of it is the fact that you don't get to care about the characters and their fate. I'm sure that it will catch many eyes with its visuals but the slow paced plot could have been a lot better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great movie the complexities of the human experience.,"This is a great movie. Its pacing is immaculate with nearly zero wasted screen space, but without leaving any primary character or plot object incomplete. It is excellently shot and acted with moments of perfect tension and resolution...I am not going to spoil anything, but my primary thought after leaving the theater was to feel sorrow for many professional reviewers.By their politics/philosophy they have lost the ability to empathize with other humans. Are the main characters moral paragons? Absolutely not, but the writing that captures their characters is truly human. They are good people put into very poor circumstances, and to the writer's credit show it.I have read many of the negative ""professional reviews"". Do not allow people who are dead inside deter you from one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh-not anything like I hoped. Take your girl friend movie.,"I gave this movie 5.9. I was excited. Previews looked intense and just finished Star Wars so I had high expectations. After sitting down and making about 20 minutes into it.....meh. OK guys it's not a thriller, conspiracy-movie like I hoped-rather a love drama. There's a lot of romance and scantly clad J-law; for the girls: there's a lot of Chris Pratt's ""posterior"" end (some comedy too). There's a cool design and plot it's centered around without much in terms of fleshing it out. It gives up on being realistic and using challenging science or rational explanations to give license to more emotional tension between the two characters. The movie peaks about 3/5 through the film then finishes all down hill with fake, couldn't happen, ""impossible"" stuff occurring for plot and story sake and it's rushed. For me, way too much sexy, romance, crappy sci-fi playing out and not a lot of real life space thriller. It's an entertaining film but not something I'd go see if you had other good options. See Star Wars or if you want more J-law and Pratt rewatch Jurassic Park or Hunger games, both way better films and stories.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not like all the other movies set in space.,"Passengers tells the story of Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence) & Jim Preston(Chris Pratt). Jim & Aurora are two out of thousands of people, traveling on a spaceship, that is taking them to a new planet. An unforeseen breakdown causes Jim & Aurora's hibernation pods to open too early. Now, Jim & Aurora are the only people awake on a spaceship, that still needs 90 years to reach its destination.Passengers is an excellent film. The best part about this movie is that, it doesn't have a similar story to all other films set in space. The script by John Spaihts is unique. Director Morten Tyldum has successfully brought to life Spaihts' one of a kind story, to the big screen. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D works for the most part of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular as Aurora Lane. Chris Pratt is outstanding as Jim Preston. The sizzling chemistry between Pratt & Lawrence, is the highlight of the film. Michael Sheen is great as Arthur. Laurence Fishburne is brilliant as Gus Mancuso. Passengers is a must watch, for everyone who loves sci-fi movies with romance in them.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A decent mix of romance, thrills and Sci-fi with Stanley Kubrick thrown in.","5,000 passengers and 258 staff, including Jennifer Lawrence, as writer Aurora Lane, and Chris Pratt, as mechanic Jim Preston, are on a 120 year journey on the commercial spaceship, Starship Avalon, to a distant earthlike colony called Homeland.A meteor storm causes havoc though when it leads to mechanical damage and the unlocking of Preston's cryogenic pod. Instead of a four month luxury approach to Homeland that's now extended to 80 years with no way of getting back into his pod.For over a year, with only an Android barman, played by Michael Sheen (in a brilliant nod to Kubrik's Overlook Hotel bar in The Shining) for company, what follows is a study in mental health, romance and danger.Dubbed Titanic in Space it's easy to see why.It's a yarn with quite a nice romantic tale in reel two between Lawrence and Pratt that's entirely well judged.The third reel, when it all (inevitably) goes a bit Pete Tong, has echoes of Gravity but overall, to my taste, this is a far more engaging film throughout.Some of the sic-fi is a bit bonkers. There's a great set piece in a swimming pool (the ultimate infinity pool) that has riled techno-geeks but, for me, it was clever and quite thrilling.Months from now this movie will be receding into my memory quite significantly, but as a 'don't take it too seriously romance/action movie' it hits all the buttons.Decent escapism.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Non-Spoiler Review,"Passengers is a delight to watch and get wrapped up in. Pratt and Lawrence give the best performances of their career and go beyond the limits delivering a performance that ends up being truly extraordinary to the highest form of art. The story itself won't let you go till it's over and your eyes glued to the screen, wanting to see what awaits each and every turn. It more than deserves praise for Pratt and Lawrence pushing themselves beyond the outer limits into what is deemed extraordinary. People should give this movie a chance and be transformed by the highest form of art I've ever seen in my life. I can see the Oscar nominations in the future. And it's two people you certainly wouldn't mind spending 90 years on a ship alone with. You get enraptured and end up caring about Jim and Aurora's journey with one of the greatest third acts I've ever seen for a film. Truly art. You truly end up falling in love with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. It has a phenomenal narrative putting yourself in Jim's shoes what would you do?

Disappointment,"Wow what a horrible movie. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was a good actress until I saw this movie. Hard to tell if it was her performance or if the movie was just that bad that no one could pull this one off. Chris Pratt was what I expected, mediocre at best. I thought Arthur was probably the best character in the whole movie. I thought the story was going to get better when Larry Fishburne was introduced. His character was not really necessary for the story-line as he didn't last long and did not provide anything to the movie; wasted of time. I'm still trying to figure out what story the movie was trying to tell. With good editing the movie could have been shortened to about 45 minutes and still been just as bad. I do have to admit the visual effects were very cool.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
It Could Have Been Better,"Passengers is a movie I enjoyed watching it with narrowing my mind and neglecting the mistakes which weren't few.I liked some things in the movie like how the ship was designed the idea of the whole movie but I hated how it was made. you feel so many time, it is not real, not in the sci-fiction side but in the mind and realistic side, it could have been better.But we can't deny that there was some amazing scenes, in which the graphics were fabulous, but when I think about them again i feel like they could have been much better, because the main idea is great but the doing isn't that good.Can't say that Morten Tyldum have failed but I hoped he had done better because he could have.Both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt had few scenes to show the acting capability and they both succeeded but not for an award. Didn't like Michael Sheen and didn't know if I liked Laurence Fishburne or not.But overall it is a nice movie with which I enjoyed my time in the cinema and my rating is 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
rather underrated,"Visually stylish, quite beautiful space scenery, good acting by the leads. The critics are generally wrong in their negative reviews. Well worth seeing. Its only flaw is the somewhat abrupt and pat ending (heavens, Andy Garcia is only on screen for 3 seconds). Expanding the implications of that ending would have provided a better sense of closure. The central moral dilemma is intriguing. One character is confronted with a choice-- his own psychological survival at the cost of someone else's life. That dilemma is made moot by later plot developments, softening the darkest implications of his crime. As a literature prof, I'm a good judge of good stories, and this is one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Cannot Ask For More,"To the writers, actors, director, Special Effects people, everyone who had a hand in producing this film: Thank you all!

In NO place, in NO way, and at NO time did this film skip one beat, miss one mark, or drop one ball.

Galatic romance that's a little thought provoking.,"The mysterious trailer doesn't really give too much away and is possibly a little misleading, as the unravels an intriguing twist of fate being less than what the trailer suggests but then more so in other departments.The Imitation Game director, Morten Tyldum gives us quite an impressive visual of a deep space journey that goes not so horribly wrong. A couple of passengers on an auto-piloted, interstellar cruise liner awaken some ninety years before reaching their destination.Chris Pratt playing mechanical engineer, Jim Preston who's real life challenge is to step out of Star-Lord and the rest of his comical characters showing a different side to his acting, however, he can't seem to lose that sarcasm he does so well. He does a fine performance but it does lack believability at certain times.Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane, an aspiring journalist on quite the quest to write the novel not ever written before. She actually appears stupid or floppy, over dramatic, but that's what makes her acting so more realistic. It's precisely what one would expect in real life and not a graceful outburst that's been obviously scripted. She's an absolute natural however I can't see this giving her another Oscar let alone any nominations. That goes for Pratt as well.The final character is the ship herself. Going from being benevolent to then being ominous, like something lurking however watching; reminded be of Event Horizon for some reason. There's an assortment of voices used for different elements of the ship but surprisingly no Sigourney Weaver, however there's a familiar voice I couldn't place until reading it belonged to Emma Clarke, who's voice has been used for countless things including the iconic ""Mind The Gap"" on London's underground. Michael Sheen is brilliant as Arthur the android bartender, being quite uncomfortable, polite yet not entirely helpful. He breaks a major rule of bartending proving that robots can't ever replace humans.As mentioned before, there's a couple of twists that the trailer hints at, which people should figure out quite quickly enough, but it doesn't take anything away from the shock or the disappointment in the characters you might feel. It's paced well considered the time the story spans, it's does allow for elements to sink in making you question what would you do if you were either character.The technology is impressive with some neat ideas that isn't so heavy it becomes unbelievable. But it feels borrowed from other movies like Prometheus, Sunshine and even WALLE. The CGI and special effect are incredibly gorgeous. It's amazing how much can someone dress space up giving it quite the glorious, powerful yet dangerous and intimidating image. But it's nothing we haven't seen before.There's a few minor errors like getting the maths wrong and some really unnecessary bits which I can only assume was part of a different edit, maybe a longer or elaborate ending. One part in particular becomes nothing more than a tease and I'm not talking about JLaw. Something of note here is the hype leading up to this movie, interestingly discussing the mild sex scene between the characters. For those of you expecting to perv over the beautiful JLaw, you might be disappointed. Just tell yourself it's a 12A, how saucy can it be? But you're not going to watch it for that are you? Right?Thomas Newman does a good score, not quite his usual but certainly bears the Newman style. Like the films genre mix, there's a varied sound throughout the score, never having a central theme. No two tracks are the same and differ some from each other, tracks like ""Sugarcoat the Galaxy"", ""Starlit"" and ""Cascade Failure"" as examples.Is it a sci-fi? No. Is it a romance or a drama, possibly a thriller? It's dips into all of these genres without actually committing to any of them, making the film quite undecided about itself and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. It certainly makes you think, judge and ponder the intentions weighing in the balance of selfishness and solitude. It's like an interstellar Titanic with bits of Cast Away and Solaris. A weird romance set on board on science fiction voyage.Running Time: 8 The Cast: 7 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 069% 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
CW's Passengers,"Marked by all kinds of promotional hype, whether the high profile lead couple, the steamy sex scenes, the gargantuous budget and the dismal reviews met upon release, ""Passengers"" shall not be, in the end, remembered by any of the above.Talk about missed opportunities, Passengers had the potential to be a relevant piece of the modern revamp of the sci-fi genre would it commit to a single approach to the premise, instead of a diverse crowd pleaser. Fresh out of the success of The Imitation Game, Morten Tyldum embarrassingly helms a mammoth project evidently lacking experience or provocativeness it requires. The film never quite decides what it is or what it wants to be because evidently more time was spent on fancying up the production values rather than covering up Spaiths' plot holes. I found myself rather intrigued by the story, predictable as it is though, being a definite fan of the genre, never quite minding the clichéd lines, the almost unbearably loud and out of place score by Thomas Newman or the all around CW TV show look, because some films are just meant to be enjoyed as Sunday afternoon entertainment or a late night escape.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A interesting idea that falters a bit in execution,"Passengers is a interesting tale about a man named Jim who wakes up early on a space ship and has to live a life alone in solitude on it. Sadly though he just hates being alone and makes the worst decision of his life by waking of Jennifer Lawrence's character named Auora, and from there that is how the story continues on.Passengers is a very beautiful looking movie with a lot of great visuals. The ship that they are on looking really amazing and very cool and was one of the first things that captivated me about this film. It was so interesting just to look at. Everything about it felt lived in and part of this bigger world. This was something I found that I loved about the movie from start to finish and was defiantly its best feature.This is also a movie with a lot of neat concepts going on in it. From the way solitude can affect us, and the decisions that we make and how they affect others around us. Sadly though the film doesn't go as far enough in those concepts as you would wish and instead tries to take a more safer route instead making for a slightly less interesting film with a narrative that feels a bit more flat and standard.This feels like a good film that has a really great film that is trying to break free from within it. There are so many parts of the film that are still good and kept me interested as I was never bored within it, but I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something too. Something that was more thought provoking.As it stands I do thing Passengers is a OK film to watch, but not one you need to rush out to see unless you just really want to look at the pretty visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than Expected, in Unexpected Ways","After seeing many lukewarm or negative reviews, I watched Passengers with low expectations. Having seen it, I'm aware of its logical shortcomings. But overall, I liked it a lot - for reasons I really never expected.At its core, this is not an adventure - it's a very unusual love story. It's about a love born of disaster, desperation and even heinous selfishness. And yet, it's a love that we come to appreciate as the story slowly unfolds. This film works remarkably well on a dramatic level. The two stars are extremely likable, and do a fine job of presenting a wide range of emotions, despite the limited scope of the story. (There are also a few smaller parts that work very well - notably the mechanized bartender.)Even more surprisingly, Passengers succeeds in evoking that bona fide SF 'sense of wonder,' as we contemplate the lives of two people living alone on a huge starship, while 5,000 others remain inaccessible in hibernation. It's a fascinating vision, depicted quite powerfully.On a purely mechanical level, the results are somewhat more mixed. The film does look terrific. The starship is elegant and believable. But the film's respect for real-world physics, on the other hand, hits both highs and lows.On the up side, there are several maneuvers in zero gravity that are really quite clever, handled infinitely better than we've seen in such critically-acclaimed dreck as Gravity (which also lacked the powerful emotional side of Passengers). On the down side, we have a ship that loses centrifugal gravity by suddenly ceasing to spin. Not only is there no reason for it to stop spinning, we don't see the horrible carnage that inertia would create inside the ship after a sudden stop. There's also a scene with fusion plasma that's needlessly implausible, not so much because of poor physics, as because of lazy writing.On balance, however, the scientific underpinnings are more than adequate to carry the film's genuinely compelling drama. Ignore the few inevitable quibbles, and Passnegers works really well as both SF and romance. It leaves you with some novel insights into human nature, and a genuinely haunting central image.I have to deduct a point or two on the technical side, but even so I give the film a very strong recommendation. It's entertaining, likable and thought-provoking, and I will definitely watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Critics don't know ....,"Passengers is a great example of why I pay zero attention to anything film critics have to say. Most critics are pretentious, wannabe theater snobs and are completely out of touch with what the average person enjoys or wants.Passengers is a refreshingly new movie, not based on sequels with a strong cast, albeit very few in numbers and a very strong story/plot line.Pay no attention to those who will say the story is morally reprehensible (I've seen some comparing the story line to date rape) those who make this claim are simply trying to make cancel culture brownie points. There is a tough moral question involved but one in which in certain circumstances could be seen as justifiable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as bad as the critics say,"Passengers stars Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, they along with 5,000 others are currently en route to inhabit Planet Homestead II. Suddenly the corkscrewing vessel goes through an asteroid field shorting out his cryo-pod and waking him too early. He becomes distraught to discover he's got 90 years left of his journey. He eventually accepts his fate, but after a while he gets lonely to the brink of suicide. So after browsing through her video blogs, he decides to wake up Aurora played by Lawrence. Gradually as the film goes on they start falling for each other and by this point, it does start to feel like Titanic in space.Director Morten Tyldum does his best with Prometheus' John Spaihts script (which was on Hollywoods Blacklist for 10 years) He keeps the film eerie and atmospheric with the sterile lighting of the interior, and the sometimes haunting music score by Thomas Newman. It tones down on the overused comedic acting we are so accustomed to from the two lead actors, especially Pratt. There is some good chemistry between the two leads and the visual effects look great.However It does have its flaws, one being the fact that it lacks originality. It doesn't quite reach the tension levels of the films it's inspired by from Moon, The Shinning and Alien just to name a few. Martin Sheens android has a scene where he malfunctions which is very reminiscent to Alien. The obvious one of course is 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the rotating corridors and the overall set designs. The first half is great, the middle section is okay and the third act falls flat leaving you waiting for more as it wraps up too suddenly. Overall Passengers is a good way to pass 2 hours of your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

7/10,"Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is a mechanic on board of the Avalon spaceship, voyaging in space from Earth to Homestead II in 120 years, carrying 5000 humans looking to colonize a new planet. Everybody is in hibernation when still 90 years away from Homestead II, Jim is mistakenly awakened. Not knowing what caused this malfunction and not being able to put himself back to sleep, Jim has to face his life inside the ship and resist the urge of waking up other passengers, one in particular who he has taken an interest for: Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence).Being a gigantic Sci-Fi fan you could say that it is hard to get a better packaged movie than this: two great A-list actors, a good director, a blacklist script and a fu**ing amazing premise. I was very excited for the film and as usual had not watched or read any promotional material so when I entered the theater I was surprised to get a film that I really did not expect, one that was hugely problematic, but had such a beautiful grit to it hat I could not resist it.""Passengers"" is one of the most strange filmmaking efforts I have ever seen. I don't mean tonally or stylistically, I mean from the perspective of filmmaking itself: it gave me a mixture of feelings that I rarely have ever had watching a film. This film is flawed and deeply so and I mean it, it has some really, really bad stuff in it, but what really shocked me about it is just how it managed to keep me interested and attached to the narrative no matter how many left turns it took, I was always absorbed by it despite the really heavy problems that weigh it down.Talking about those, the plot really has some issues. It is tonally unbalanced and switches from one scenario to the other way too quickly. Moreover, it is handled terribly, with the chain of the events spiraling way to conveniently for its own good. It manages to fill many holes by heavy exposition scenes, yet you can't help but see a flaw in the structure. I won't go in to spoilers, but there's a detail in the film that adds even more to the weak mechanics of this plot that moves forward very unconvincingly, even though I'll say that it manages to give the film a pace that no matter how strange brings it to an interesting climax and an overall exponential chain of events.I mean lets look at the editing of this film now. It is truly something abysmal, I was left wordless to see such bad editing in a professional 100 million dollar Hollywood picture. I mean when they're having a conversation it is borderline fine switching from shot to reverse shot, but I was aghast seeing how they put together sequences. There are scenes that have absolutely zero continuity to them, switching form moving shot to steady and back again another two times without having any sense in it. The way it jump cuts at times actually hurt my eye as it was done so poorly. And probably worst of all is the editing on a macroscopic scale: the montages are absolutely disorientating, they switch back and forth at times with scenes for time slots of 30 seconds each and it starts giving you a headache. Moreover, how the film jumps from one location to the other is baffling to say the least, it makes cuts that are truly disgusting and have no place in a professional film like this. I was truly amazed at what I saw.Still, none of the weirdly gargantuan problems above managed to overcome what is a beautiful story about two people falling in love in the most unique conditions. More and more as I review and watch films I discover the value of novelty and originality and the film's premise is just too genius for me not to be constantly interested, especially because it keeps you on your toes, I can confidently say that I was always uncertain of what was going to happen next and that made for a gratifying watch.If the film partially fails on plot it does not on story. There might be different elements that scream ""Studio-Tampering"" here and bother the continuity, but the the story managers to overcome those, one again showing its power, and it never looses its charm. The characters are really interesting and their situation is even more so.Pratt and Lawrence have to be really commended for portraying a romance that is so believable I got lost in it. You buy so much into their chemistry, their dynamic, their unique situation you get swallowed by a portrayal of a relationship that is raw and beautiful in smallest moments. I don't know if my romantic side is just exaggerating, but as much as I wanted to let this film go because of its continuous annoying and frustrating problems, I simply could not. I was captivated by the characters and their journey, it was never repetitive and always gave you something new to chew on. I left the theater really feeling something and being touched by the emotional relationship that was established. There is a point towards the end of the film that really made me realize how much I had actually liked it, it is a line of Aurora and it was representative of all of the character change these two people go through and really made me reflect upon themes that the film looks at.""Passengers"" is a beautiful love story set in space, an original film that wastes some potential and frustrates you repeatedly because of its huge flaws, but one whose sheer power in storytelling and charm manages to overcome the problems and give you a satisfying experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
We'd all do the same thing,"So apparently a lot of people were SO offended by what's going on in this movie. Some said that 'it's not stalking if he's hot'. Looks like they missed out on some things in life, to say the least. This one is actually a no-brainer: no, it's not stalking if he's hot, well, let's say in 99% of cases. The thing is, this is how courting works. A guy who's interested in you tries to get your attention. At first you may not like him, and it doesn't matter if he's objectively attractive or not (here the critics of the movie claim that Chris Pratt is hot to everyone, which is definitely not true, so that kind of renders their argument void), but then you get to know him and you see that he's actually cool so you change your mind about him. Oh, and sometimes the guy may even be the total opposite of your type but he won't leave you alone, and you hate him for it, and then somehow as if magically he manages to make you fall in love with him. I'm sure everyone knows a story like that or two. But that's not what happens in this movie because here the characters are clearly into each other. So enough of the Stockholm Syndrome whining because 'Passengers' doesn't deserve all the hate. And yes, I'm a woman. But I grew up before people started going crazy about all this feminist/sexist/misogynist/chauvinist/perverse/stalker stuff that most of the time they only pretend to understand.There, I got it out of my system. Now on to the review. I give this movie a solid 7 for being a warm, pretty love story. I didn't expect it to be some great sci fi flick so I didn't feel cheated when it turned out to be a romantic drama. The story could've been a bit more fleshed out because there was potential there, and then, with all the special effects, it would've been amazing. I thought for a moment that this could be like 'Titanic' in space, but there wasn't enough substance. Still, the movie is interesting and definitely worth a watch. And even though we don't really see how hard life was on the ship for Jim when he was alone, we can infer enough from what we do see. And anyone who's seen 'The Martian' or 'Moon' can compare and imagine what it's like to be alone, having no one to talk to and nothing to do. What do you do once you've played a little basketball and done a little dancing? What is Jim supposed to be doing for the next 90 years? What reason could he possibly have to go on living?The movie does show very well how bad he feels when he has to wake Aurora up, and she does hate him, and that part of the story is pretty damn straightforward: he stole her life from her, sort of murdered her. But perhaps these two were meant to meet like that and make the most of what they got. If he didn't wake her up, their lives wouldn't be the same. And I don't think any of this needs explaining, really. When you watch the movie, you can understand all the human reasons for why they do what they do - why he doesn't want to live anymore, why he wakes her, why they fall in love, why she hates him but then forgives him. Seriously, this is so plain and simple. Like I said in the title of this review: we'd all do the same thing. Just imagine living alone in a place like this for a MONTH. I challenge you to survive that long without thinking of killing yourself at least once when you know it's all there is, that's all you've got, this big empty ship and 90 years of solitude and utter, mind-scrambling boredom. You'd be banging your head against walls all the time. So don't blame Jim for looking for a reason to live.I quite enjoyed this movie and I hope that the critics get a grip and get a life. This isn't a story about a stalker. If Jim is a stalker then Jack from the 'Titanic' is also a stalker, and so is Christian Grey (OK, that one is a bit of a weirdo), and so is Richard Gere's character in 'Pretty Woman'. Not every guy chasing after a chick is a pervert (or a chick chasing after a guy, just think of Scarlett O'Hara 'stalking' her dear Ashley). These are movies, meant for our enjoyment. Let's not get political about every freakin' story we see on the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifully shot, well made, extremely engrossing - surely a contender for Best Production Design?","Passengers - another film that in my view seems to be getting a bit of an unfair kicking from the press, so I am pleased to see many others like myself agree this is a great film. It certainly deserves to be, stuck as it has been in development hell for several years with different actors and directors coming and going.Its the future (You know, the place you want to live in yourself one day, but sadly ain't going to be around for...) and we're on board the Starship Avalon, a vessel owned by the Homestead Corporation who makes billions of dollars transporting Colonists to new worlds (Don't tell Trump it will give him ideas) around the galaxy and plan do so with the 5000 colonists on board here. The ship is automated and everyone is in hyper sleep including the crew. (A bit like flying on Ryan Air) Everyone will only awaken when the ship is one month out from the destination but unfortunately a large asteroid storm does some damage to the vessel and a pod activates early belonging to young Jim Peston (Pratt, probably his best performance yet) a lowly mechanic who can only access the cheap meals option at the breakfast canteen and has the low budget accommodations (Air BnB) options on board. When Jim realises he has woken 90 years early and cannot wake any other crew who are behind a security sealed door he knows he will die on the ship alone. A year passes before he considers an alternative way of living. His only other company is a bar serving agreeable talking Android called Arthur (Michael Sheen on perfect form as always) In time Jim comes to know the biographies of his fellow passengers and one in particular, a writer not uneasy on the eye, Aurora (Lawrence) gets his attention. Jim learns everything about her from her own diaries and discovers she plans to write a book about her journey to the new world. Jim soon learns he has the ability to wake other passengers up and is faced with a dilemma, wake the girl of his dreams so he is not cosigned to his fate alone or die lonely in space before ever reaching his destination. I guess he could have searched for someone with really good computer skills so he could find the code for that door and wake up the crew, but sadly this thought escapes him or perhaps the new world has no computers?Passengers had me gripped from the word go, from its sleek production design to Pratt's restrained but charming performance there was much to enjoy here. The ship and the dilemma facing Jim seemed all too believable. It felt as though this was the sort of thing one could experience while trying to correct your mobile phone provider and eventually your forced to make a difficult decision. It would not be the first time in history man kind had paid for the choice of cost effectiveness over safety simply because nothing had gone wrong in the past (Like no staff in your cinema screen to tell that bloody girl to get off her mobile phone) but this aside it is the crux of the morale dilemma that faced Jim Preston that really made the film great. I found myself asking how would I deal with the same situation? This is what Passengers asks of you. Jennifer Lawrence is on fine form in the film as well in the role of Aurora and Sheen adds an appropriate level of humour in his role as the dumb waiter of the piece but it is Chris Pratt who really stole the film for me. An actor normally associated with comical quips and nods to camera for Parks and Recreation he really shows his emotional depths and range here.As the characters deal with the additional problems facing them, other dilemmas present themselves and again I found myself asking the same questions as were asked of the characters as the story progressed. This is a sure sign of both clever writing and film making.Another mention must also go to the outstanding production design. Certainly there is some use of CGI here, but the sets and the CGI design of the star ship are simply incredible and blend perfectly together. The Avalon felt like a real ship that must be out there somewhere. Everything seemed so real and the space walk scenes were as dramatically tense as one would expect the real thing to be.I really enjoyed this film and as others have stated it is suitable for those of all ages though the younger children may find it a little wanting due to lack of action but I was rarely if ever bored.Lawrence Fishburne has a nice cameo in the film, but to explain who or how would be to give a spoiler away. I thought this film would benefit too from being seen on the big screen and I was right. The vastness of the empty locations of the ghostly star ship are very much enhanced by the cinema experience.My compliments to the whole team on this production. The price tag for the film seemed a little on the high side but it certainly looks the part and the cast gave it there all (So they should for 50K a minute)Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
1/3 of a great Movie,"First of all, the settings, visual effects and design are great. After watching the trailer i was afraid that the movie would look and feel artificial. But luckily, this isn't the case. You actually felt like being in this situation on a gorgeous spaceship with actual purpose and function.This is also were the story has it's strength. The movie had a classical three-part structure and i really enjoyed the feel and handling of the first part. The more romantic second and action-pact third part are more falling apart. The story follows a more convenient path from there on.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are very good in their charisma and acting. I believed their characters decisions and motivations for the most part of the movie. The supporting cast is also quite good.After all Norwegian director Morten Tyldum delivers a good, entertaining and terrific looking fun-ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely Worth Seeing,"I think it take really good actors to be able to carry a movie as basically the only people in it. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do just that...really well.This might have been billed as a Sci-Fi as other reviewers have stated, but it is definitely romance, adventure and drama, with a little suspense thrown in.I saw this without reading any reviews and loved it straight away, so much so that I watched it again within a few days. It is one of those movies that can be watched over and over without becoming boring.When I read some of the critics reviews after watching it, I really thought they had the wrong movie.My recommendation is if you like romance movies you will like this one, it is that simple.8/10 for me and it could easily score higher, but I am being conservative.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Space Flick,"Despite the negative reviews, Passengers provided an entertaining journey with a nice little love story mixed in.Passengers isn't breaking any new ground with the theme of a space crew aboard a ship riddled with problems and it felt somewhat reminiscent of Pandorum minus the space monsters plus the love story.Chris Pratt (Jim) awakens prematurely with 90 years left on his journey to a planet that promises a new beginning. After some long contemplation he decides to awaken another passenger (Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora) to help make his years more bearable.This is where the real story of Passengers begins and shows the evolution of Jim and Aurora's relationship as well as the turmoils they face as passengers.The visuals and score of this film are outstanding and help really reinforce the emotions of certain scenes.If you're looking for a space flick with a decent story and heart, Passengers is a great choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Flawed, but Beautiful.","Shoulda been a 9 or higher at IMDb and 90%+ at Rotten Tomatoes, but....There was a handful of small flaws and an effing big one. This probably cost them 50-points at RT and cut box office by 80%.I won't tell what that is. What I will do is warn you that it's there and suggest you forgive it ahead of time, so that you'll actually buy a ticket. I promise, you'll get your $12 worth, and probably rent it from RedBox to watch again.This movie is everything they promise in the trailers.You already know that the scenery is awesome. Beyond the very scenic JLaw and CPratt, the big Space Cruise Liner is imagined and executed exactly as promised in the trailers. Which is to say beautifully.JLaw and CPratt carry the whole film and they totally deliver. Better than you have any reason to expect, except that HEY! it's JLaw and CPratt!Both characters look into the abyss at different times, and each makes fate-filled decisions that drive the movie.The WTF of that big effing flaw is a mystery to me. Any kid who got a ""C"" in 8th grade science will spot it, which means at least 500 of the 1,000 or so folks who worked this movie would have mentioned it to the director Morton Tyldom. He left it in. I won't tell you what it sets up, which is kinda cool, but it does NOT drive the plot, and should have been cut for ""Deleted Scenes"" on the DVD releaseSUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sci-fi asks us to suspend some disbelief, but the director never gets a blank check. Once a film creates a universe with its own rules, the director is responsible for maintaining those rules. Failure to do so, drops the viewer out of suspended disbelief, insulting our intelligence along the way. This is both wrong and expensive. It's painful to the audience, it's also painful to the movie's box-office earnings.Sorry about the rant, I did like the movie and do recommend it. Wish I could give it a 9 or 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Original story, excellent actors, breathtaking visual effects - Better get your ticket soon!","If you want to spend two hours of your life in an exciting yet mind- blowing atmosphere, this movie is definitely a way to go!This movie will definitely change the whole picture you get when someone mentions Sci-Fi movies. While setting plot in the outer space, far away from home, the movie doesn't necessarily deal completely with extraterrestrial things, rather it deals with person's inner conflicts and questions of one's ability to live independently, far away from any traces of human civilization.While having breathtaking visual effects and amazing plot with just enough action, the movie is also very sentimental and emotional. There are scenes which will bring tears to your face, both sad and happy tears. In any case, this movie doesn't disappoint when it comes to emotions. However, this is not to say that the whole movie is focused on a romance between two people. There is a lot of action and tension that you will often forget about it, after which you will be rewarded with few emotional scenes.Special praise goes to tension-building heart-racing moments and wonderful cast. Jennifer Lawrence showed us who's the boss when it comes to actresses.All in all, definitely a movie to see. At least twice.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good Movie - I think it could have been slightly better,"I think it was much better than critics give it credit for. That being said, I can understand, i think, why some didn't like it. We all bring our own biases into films. It was clear to me, from reading some of the professional critical reviews that they would have rated it higher if the events had transpired closer to their personal expectations. I cannot articulate why that is without spoilers, so here goes.**Spoilers**Much of the controversy revolves around Jim's decision to short- circuit Aurora's (Jennifer Lawrence) pod. In the film, Jim has been woken up by a subtle malfunction, caused by a tiny fragment of meteor getting past the ships deflection technology. Jim (Chris Pratt) is awake and finds he was woken up 90 years prior to the arrival at their destination, which means he is trapped on the ship, alone, for the remainder of his life.Jim goes through a series of stages, similar to the film Groundhog Day. He tries to wake the crew, but cannot get through the protective firewall that guards their sleeping compartment. He tries to engineer his pod to put him back to sleep, but that does work, and through research, realizes he can't go back to sleep. So Jim, after meeting a robot bartender, goes through these psychological milestones. Grief, acceptance, etc. After a year, however, he is in complete despair. He considers suicide, but talks himself out of it. Then he sees one of the other passengers in her pod. Aurora (Yes, as in Disney's Aurora).At first Aurora's unconscious form plays the part of Wilson in the film Castaway. Someone for Jim to talk to. She's a novelist, and a writer for a New York magazine back on Earth. Through exposure to her books and her interviews, he starts to feel an attraction to her. For months he convinces himself that he cannot wake her up, rationalizing his feelings away over and over until he can't any longer. So then does, what to many, is the unthinkable.From that point we go through a romance subplot built on a lie. For some critics, they would have rather this had played out as a psychological thriller, wherein Jim is becomes the antagonist. It could have easily have been made this way. Instead the romance goes on for a while until the Robot bartender, due to a mistake by Jim, gives away the secret that Jim woke her up. She is, naturally, enraged.The next act is spent with Jim trying to apologize to her. We can understand why she would be reluctant, and to keep her distance, which she does. But then the ship starts to break down due to a chain reaction that started two years earlier, and what had triggered Jim's pod to malfunction. The malfunctions begin to cascade and wake up a member of the crew, Gus. Gus figures out what Jim did, but there is too much work to do to fix the ship for moral condemnation. Later Aurora looks to commiserate with Gus about what a horrible thing Jim did. Gus agrees, but says it was an understandable human reaction to his situation.Unfortunately Gus wasn't woken up as safely as Jim had been, and his abrupt discharge from hyper-sleep has severally damaged his internal organs. As he begins his death throws he gives his ID badge to Jim and tells the couple to take care of each other, and to fix the ship. Reluctantly Aurora helps Jim find the major problem with the gravity drive, and the movie turns into a Titanic style disaster film. This seemed to be another sore subject with critics, in that movie abruptly shifted gears.In the end Jim offers to sacrifice himself to save the ship, but Aurora begins to realize that finality of that. It isn't articulated, but maybe she suddenly had the inkling that she would be desperately alone. It is one thing to refuse to forgive someone who is right there, and you can always forgive at your leisure, it is another to realize you'll be facing the same desperate decision Jim did. In the end Aurora performs a heroic act to save him.Afterwards Jim finds a way to put Aurora back to sleep using a medical machine, but he would have to activate it from the outside. He offers her the life he stole from her, and in return, she chooses to stay by his side. I thought it was a nice ending, but many others were not satisfied with the happily ever after concept.Overall I think the execution could have been better in some places, and that is a valid criticism. Still I think it is well worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not what I expected from the preview,"The preview gave me the suggestion this movie would be a science fiction thriller. Instead I got a scientific romance. Bummer!Nevertheless the main premise of the movie was promising, making you wonder ""what would I do in the situation"". But unfortunately the focus was on the romantic development instead of psychology.Special effects were great. A bonus point for introducing the concept of space-vertigo! If you are pedantic you could argue about some plot holes/illogical events in the movie, but hey it's a movie. If everything made sense, it would have been even more boring. Overall the movie is a missed opportunity to be something better.6/10 because you get to watch hot Jennifer Lawrence for 2 hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Story is simple and starts slowly but it works. I do understand the critics. I always suspect that half of them are paid off and other half probably ventilating their own issues. I think they did not understand the movie or to be more precise they were expecting something else. They were expecting hardcore sci-fi with complex story line. They did get Titanic in space. Go and see for yourself. It is one of the few movies worth to see it in cinema with your other half.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Romantic Drama in Space,"I did honestly enjoy this movie but it did seem to be a bit slow getting going and felt like they crammed all the action into the last 30mins. Some interesting ideas are raised but not truly explored and some of the characters didn't get a lot of build up or background, just kind of came and went. The special effects were top notch, some good exploration of Zero-G. Overall it was a visually stunning movie that sits well within the Sci-Fi genre, a good performance from Jennifer Lawrence, would of been nice to see more of Lawrence Fishburne though. I'm no scientist myself but the science seemed to be pretty solid in most parts of the film. While watching it quickly became apparent that the film was made with a small cast and a big special effects budget.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic Film! (Spoiler Free),"Here is my spoiler free review of Passengers: Passengers turned out to be very different from what I expected based on it's promotion. But, that it not necessarily a bad thing at all. All I can say is that a REALLY liked Passengers. The pacing was great and towards the middle of the movie it got so good! The acting from Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt was INCREDIBLE. Also, the special effects were amazing, along with all of the other visuals. It was not a predicable movie at all.

"Good, but feels plagiarized","Have you watched a lot of Science Fiction?Have you ever seen a movie that felt like you had seen it before, more than once even?Do you like the feeling that the writer may have read a few of your favorite lesser known scripts and just borrowed the better parts?If so, then this is the movie for you..Not to say it was bad, it was actually decent.. but.. I have seen the same narrative done before and way better.When we first decided to see the movie, i tried to clear my head of any predetermined expectations. I wanted to enjoy it, I did, despite the critics.As always, the things it was criticized for were overblown, but instead I found other issues. Primarily the script was lazy, the subject and event have been done many times before and for such a high budget, i guess I expected something that would look more impressive.My wife loved it, the other people who were with us all seemed to enjoy it.

"If you can handle an absurd setup, this film delivers on many levels","Passengers is almost a set piece given how few characters inhabit the screen at any time. Only JLaw's ""Hunger Games"" histrionics jarred me (she always seems to be shouting with the same intensity and with the same facial expressions)...but otherwise she was spot-on. I found the acting, especially by Chris Pratt, very believable. Chris Pratt has some absurd facial prosthetics which are rather laughable, but he has a very natural demeanor though a bit too teary-eyed at times. He plays a hunk who's not self-aware of his hunkiness. // Anyway, what truly bothered me throughout the movie was the total ridiculousness of the setup that propels the story forward. You have to buy an absurd premise for the rest of the movie to make any sense. Very annoying and shows, IMHO, lazy script writing. BTW, beautiful special effects throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"It is not Star Wars or Gravity, it is a human story and a romantic drama which happens to be set in space. Intellectually and emotionally interesting and enjoyable.","I think this film has a lot of bad reviews because it is not what people were expecting. The first hour is 'slow' and has none of the grandiose action of Star Wars or Gravity etc. It is a very human story tackling an interesting moral dilemma. It is largely a drama that happens to be set on a spaceship. It takes a while to understand which direction the film is going. But this is not an issue per se as the build up is fairly enjoyable.However, though the bad reviews are from disappointed expectations, it is not to necessarily say that I think it is worthy of good reviews. I for one had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised that it provided a fair bit to think about and was emotionally and intellectually interesting. However, it really wasn't that deep and does have some action in the last half of the film so it is targeted really at a mass market audience. It is a little confused perhaps about what it wanted to be and particularly how to market itself. But overall it gave me some things to think about and was a positive and enjoyable romantic drama on top. The two leads have bundles of charisma and clear on screen chemistry. This would have probably fallen very flat without this.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
People who 'didn't like the ending' weren't paying attention,"""Passengers"" is not intellectual scifi. As some have described it, thinking they were being insulting, it's ""just a love story in space."" But if you suspend disbelief and just go with it, it's actually a pretty good love story in space. It reminds me of some of the great classic scifi of the 1950s and 1960s, many of which, if you'll remember, were also ""just"" love stories in space.The visuals were excellent, verging on stunningly beautiful. I read on the Trivia page that there was a time when Keanu Reeves was attached to this film to play the lead. He had to drop out, for some unspecified reason. Good. He would have ruined it. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, brought a truly human touch to being a human stranded in space. And although I am not always a fan (I *loathed* ""Joy""), I thought Jennifer Lawrence was tremendous as well.As for the ending, well in my opinion it was perfect. Each of them got what they set out looking for.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Film left stranded by the writing,There are some things about this film which are impressive. The interior shots are all fantastic - I usually couldn't tell what was set and what was CGI. The performances from Pratt and Lawrence are good considering what they had to work with. It's probably the best performance I've seen from Chris Pratt.Unfortunately the storyline is incredibly predictable (you could work out virtually all the story beats from the premise of the film) and the characters are underdeveloped.If you want to watch two very attractive people attempt to emote their way through space then go for it. There are worse ways to spend an evening. But don't worry that you're missing out on a future classic.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
At least Boxing Helena was honest,"This is a rape fantasy masked as a sci-fi romance. Don't poison your mind or the minds of your children by watching this movie.Passengers should have been marketed as a rape culture horror or perhaps a thriller set it space with the monster being the ubiquitous idea that every woman today has to deal with daily:The idea that if a man stalks a woman long enough and sneakily enough that he will get to have sex with her and she will love him because he is ""one of the good guys"". No, just no. This isn't a ""good guy"" role no matter how much he sees himself as the hero.The saddest thing, Passenger could have been an excellent film exploring this predatory and objectifying mentality by simply cutting some of the scenes and changing the musical score to something more ominous.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A beautiful film that got snubbed by politically correct critics.,"--SPOILER FREE--The 'critics' are completely off their rockers here and like other audience reviewers have stated-- if the genders were reversed the guy would have been considered LUCKY. Beyond lucky if modern culture is to be taken seriously-- which is always right and never wrong about anything. *SARCASM* for the uninitiated morons who can't understand humour. Get triggered somewhere else!I had to get that bit out of the way first because this film is an absolutely fantastic watch. Its balanced, takes its time, sets up the characters smoothly, and doesn't jump around to different locations at whim like so many films are doing now.Speaking of characters there really aren't that many-- and I think it works in the film's advantage. There never is a sense of confusion or the plot tripping over itself trying to stay relevant. Martin Sheen's role is one of comic relief and suave android bartender (not a spoiler, watch the trailer). Loved nearly every second of his screen time. The rest of the roles are obvious-- although I must say Chris Pratt absolutely carries this film and delivers an emotional depth that a lot of A-listers aren't these days. He is truly the next Harrison Ford or Christian Bale. Jennifer is... well... Jennifer. She does her thing, which isn't terrible but I didn't find it particularly inspired. I think the correct word is 'serviceable'.The visual design is nothing short of post-modern perfection. Sprawling smooth metal textured silver vistas leading to glass windows blanket the ship's interior, giving a view into the beautiful blue hued nebulae of space. The artistic vision of space is not realistic but it certainly is authentic and fantastic to look at-- it doesn't require a suspension of belief to enjoy it unlike many recent space films.The sound design throughout the film is also excellent. The music throughout is incredibly moving and well composed. Not on the level of Hanz Zimmer but still great.There are a few technical issues that might stick out to the more scientifically minded but it never disrupts the flow or enjoyment of the film in my opinion. It all simply works.If you're a sci-fi fantasy fan or just want to escape for a couple hours please support this film-- we need more like it. The critics need to step back and re-evaluate audience responses. They've lost touch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great surprise,"Having seen the reviews ahead of time I was fully prepared for disappointment. This most likely factored in my score as I was pleasantly surprised. I'm also a sucker for isolation movies and books so I was an easy target. I thought the pacing was just right. Whenever I felt like a chapter had run its course, another one would pick right up. Chris Pratt was much more reserved in this role compared to others, making it easier to get invested. Jennifer Lawrence didn't quite hit with me right away, but grew on me as the movie progressed. There are some glaring points of absolute convenience, a couple inconsistencies, and a little cheesiness, but it was a fun ride nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The perfect date movie,"PASSENGERS is your textbook romantic film surrounded by breathtaking sci-fi. After so many survival films about one man only or one woman only, on an island or in space or against a shark, it's nice to see a survival film with two people and nobody else for a change. And with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as the leads, this is a glossy adventure you can't keep your eyes off of.The story is set onboard a spaceship transporting thousands of lives to a new life on another planet, it's supposed to be a 120-year journey but a malfunction happens that causes Chris Pratt's character, Jim's hibernation pod opening prematurely. Having spent a year all by himself there, Jim decides to intentionally get a woman to wake up as well, that woman is Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). As they begin to unravel the mystery behind the malfunction, they fall in love, but when certain truths come to surface, they find their spaceship and their lives fall apart.This is a sweet, sleek, romantic film, boy meets girl in a pod, boy wakes girl up, boy falls for girl, o and there's a bartender in a setting that looks kinda like the bar in the overlook hotel in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" And just the million and one things that the spaceship can do is enough to make any sci-fi fan go, 'Whoah, that's super cool.'When I was screening ""Passengers,"" I was trying hard to find whether or not the film has some kind of underlying point that I may have been missing but really it's just a story about relationship, can it survive the cosmic ordeals at hand and can it also survive the lies. It is really essentially a romantic drama set in space, it doesn't get much simpler than that. Our future ambitions can't compare to our fear of loneliness.To this day, I'm glad that writer/director James Gunn gambled on Chris Pratt as Star-Lord in his ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" movie because otherwise we probably wouldn't have known that hidden gem, that leading man everyman quality that Pratt has, and it shows in this latest character, Jim. And Jennifer Lawrence is just as beautiful and sharp as ever, her quick spot on reactions, how she's there for the moment, is unparalleled. Yes it's got thrills, mystery, and spectacular imagery but when you strip it away, what you have is ""Passengers"" as this season's perfect date movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Solid Sci-Fi - Passengers,"Buckle up, its going to be a bumpy ride. The three lead actors make this a very entertaining film, and one could even say the bartender steals the film. The film is well-directed, and the production values are impressive. The story about a colony going off into space on a trip that takes over 100 years is interesting, and even more interesting is when a malfunction causes one of the passengers to awake just a bit prematurely; about 90 years prematurely.

"Critics have a point, but don't tell the whole story","This movie has its faults; it's predictable, cliché, and at times seems like it's a trailer for a Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt sex tape (not necessarily complaining). However, it is so much more than just that. This movie is original, witty, and beautiful. The chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is undeniable; they play off each other effortlessly. The story is also remarkably original. In an age filled with space expeditions and tales of new worlds, this movie manages to make something new and refreshing. In addition to being emotionally moving, Passengers is also visually stunning. It's possible that there were a few too many shots of the Avalon with nebulae and galaxies in the background, but who can complain when the view is as spectacular as it is. Passengers is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Both Pratt and Lawrence are near perfect fits for their roles, the entire film is beautiful, and action and drama fit seamlessly together. You might be able to predict what will happen next, but that doesn't mean this film is unenjoyable. The critics are far too harsh on this film; trust me, you'll like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Little Something for BOTH sexes!,"Great date night movie. Probably will not be what you expect. I hate science fiction but this movie is much more than just some silly flick with spaceships and outer space. The plot is fresh, surprising, and unique.Jennifer Lawrence ,as always, is on point and gives the viewer their moneys worth. Phenomenal ""Star Wars"" quality sets and special effects. I imagine the majority of the movie's budget went towards special effects, computerization and props. This flick probably just reset the standards.Take a chance on this flick. You will be glad that you did and it might just make your list of favorites!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrifically performances/chemistry and top of the range visuals distract from questionable narrative,"Sold on the concept of 'Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in space', the film excels based on their sensational chemistry and performances and the pair manage to command every moment of the runtime. Despite being largely a two-hander - with Michael Sheen popping in every now and then as Arthur the Android and serving his purpose - Lawrence and Pratt make such a compelling duo that no one else is needed; we care deeply for these characters and sympathise with their plight and, without too many spoilers, understand their actions even when they are morally flawed and/or questionable. Sci-fi can often come across as cold and technology-centered, but Passengers is very character-driven at its core, thus making it far more emotionally resonant than is expected of the genre typically. Lawrence's character is afforded some solid character building through her 'character profile' while Pratt's Jim is a little more complicated (more on that later...) but their chemistry - almost a third character in its own right - is the strongest here. Their performances, particularly Lawrence as she is rewarded more range to work with, is spectacular enough to make this film worth a watch and journey out on these cold nights.FULL REVIEW - goo.gl/o92njh",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wish there was a real driving force for this sci-fi romance.,"An attempt to get two of Hollywood's biggest actors together, Passengers is a romantic sci-fi where a colonisation ship is traveling to its destination when a hibernation pod fails and wakes someone up...90 years before it reaches Homestead II. But is this destiny? Is there a greater meaning to this? Or are these questions actually pointless as the film does not explore them at all? I can tell you the last question is correct. Whilst this does boast an impressive cast and director, the script and story lets it down. I shall start off by saying that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are perfect in this film. They both have charisma, charm and plenty of humour and the chemistry between them is believable. Michael Sheen plays an android bartender and is the comic relief, his British wit was much needed. Laurence Fishburne is also in the film, but I shan't spoil his character...though what I will say is that when he appears, the film turns around and says ""I bring you...plot conveniences!"". Honestly, the storyline was just filled with so many conveniences that it infuriated me, not to mention the last act of the film that was just ridiculous. Chris Pratt's character is a convenience, the ship malfunctioning is a convenience...I would even say the conveniences have convenience. There could've been so much purpose to this, a far more poignant ending and the critics would've loved this. In fairness though, I did enjoy this somewhat. Morten Tyldum did a great job directing with plenty of wide camera shots and nice still panning shots, it made the Avalon (the colonisation ship) look majestic. This brings me onto production, the design of the Avalon and the computers, holograms...heck even the robots, it all looked fantastic! Some great creativity was used, it's just unfortunate that the film will only be remembered for that. Thomas Newman composing though, euphoric! Possibly one of the best soundtracks for a 2016 film, I loved it. I mean don't get me wrong, this film is enjoyable. The romance is what people want to see and I became invested in them, I believed that they would make a good couple and even with a heart breaking revelation, I still wanted them to be together. The script even dabbled into themes of loneliness and solitude, it just wasn't explored thoroughly enough. Overall, Passengers has two great actors and great production, but the flawed story that's full of plot conveniences makes this rather boring at times. The soundtrack however, I would give full marks!Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Spontaneous Space Survival Film,This is a spectacular film for everyone to watch. I enjoyed watching it. Cosmology has always been a life fascination of mine. The storyline was outstanding.

Fantastic movie - ignore the critics and watch in 3D,"Reluctantly I went to see this movie in 3D, usually, this makes me ill, and I never really saw the point - however the effects appear to have been improved to prevent this, and I felt it really benefited the movie.Despite the negative critic reviews I really enjoyed this movie. Chris Pratt's acting was very sensitive and well played - a departure from his normal acting style, similarly Jenifer Lawrence gave an unusually emotional and varied performance; once again a departure from her usual monosyllabic acting style.I think that the chemistry between the two actors was fantastic and although a sci-fi movie, the underlying story of being happy no matter where you are, as long as you have the right person was well portrayed. Both individuals unhappy with their lives back home on earth find love in unusual circumstances and make a utopia for themselves.Lots of reviews seem to focus on inconsistencies with the sci-fi angle, why would they send colonies on 200-year missions etc etc, most sci-fi films can have holes picked in the plots, it's just an easy medium to express a deeper story.anyway i loved this movie - watch it in 3D if you can",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

J.Law & C.Pratt pulled a classic joke (on us),"I was highly disappointed by this movie. Passengers was a movie with a lot of potential, but it ended up in a plot which even I could have written better. And I'm not a writer, neither have I a creative mind.Jim's character could have really been expanded into more detail. When Aurora said: ""We wouldn't have end up together in real life""; I couldn't agree more; Jim is such a bore.All the action parts of the movie were highly predictable and over exploited. It almost seemed like it was a cheap knock-off of Titanic.The acting skills of both of the lead actors were alright, same as usual. Visuals were okay. Music could've been better, and the end could've been more tragic. Even the predictability was predictable at the end.In the end, I don't regret seeing this movie, because I had such a laugh.

A mesmerising exploration of how spaceflight might challenge our essential human drives,"The movie starts with stunning visuals of spaceflight and you find yourself aboard a breathtakingly realistic-looking Starship Avalon. Minutes later you follow Chris Pratt's captivating portrayal of a down-to-earth engineer Jim, finding his way through a first layer of the ship's futuristic intricacies. Add an impressive performance by Michael Sheen as an android and you're hooked on the potential on this movie. By the time that Jennifer Lawrence's charismatic performance, as an ambitious journalistic writer Aurora Lane, took the movie to yet another level of immersion, I became aware I was witnessing a completely original story that felt humanly as real as it gets in a movie theatre.Besides the mesmerising chemistry between the two main protagonists, one of the thrills of this movie that stood out for me was that most of the scenarios they were facing were completely realistic, within the context of the story, even by our pre-futuristic spaceflight standards. This allowed me to deeply identify with both of their individual plights, and consequently to fully root for them to find some kind of positive outcome to the increasingly dramatic situation on the ship.I won't reveal what the surprising twists are that make this movie unique and so fascinating to watch, but I can safely hint at what it is that tipped the scales for me regarding rating Passengers as high as a full 10/10.Surely most of us here on IMDb love movies that are still percolating in our minds hours after we have left the movie theatre, and this is definitely one of those exceptional movies for me. Have you ever imagined how would your core human drives play out on a spaceflight during a long-term dramatic situation with uncertain outcomes for both awake and hibernated passengers? The excellent acting performances in this movie gave me a visceral experience of what I myself might be intensely struggling with if I were facing those same moral dilemmas that Jim and Aurora were trying to cope with. And I hope that the movie's beautifully delivered take-home message, a reminder of one of the essential building blocks of being truly alive, will stay with me for good.As for the more technical filmmaking considerations, I have only spotted one very minor technical oversight, and realised, only upon later reflection, that there might have been one potential minor plot hole. That wouldn't make me budge from wanting to rate this film 10/10, if it weren't for what felt like a rushed story development at one or two points in the movie.But what is a critical review of a film good to either a filmmaker or the audience if it doesn't take into account the reality of filmmaking? I know, from my practical experience with directing and editing on my filmmaking university course, how difficult it can be to make things flow in the edit, without losing momentum or stretching the story to unreasonable length. And so, taking this and all of the above into account, I feel that overall I can honestly give Passengers 10/10 rating for its original story, incredible production design and visual effects, great thought-provoking directing, and mesmerising performances.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The rest of the time, the man and the woman fall in love and lounge around the bar, the restaurant, the bedroom...etc...

I found the premise of colonization through conventional animation believable, and the two main characters are completely believable in their roles. The addition of Laurence Fishburne gave an extra seriousness and dimension to the human aspects of the film. The scenery is very imaginative, the lighting is superb, the growing pace of the relationship between the two main characters against the growing threat of what is happening to the ship is a fine performance.

"Story seems to extract many elements from ""The Void Captain's Tale""","While watching the movie I couldn't help but recall a 1983 SY novel by Norman Spinrad called ""The Void Captains Tale"". This is especially true when the two characters decide to take an exterior ship walk while traveling at half the speed of light.The Void Captain's Tale begins with a nice description of the infancy of warp space drive in which the only persons foolhardy enough to attempt such travel, are the lifestyles of the rich and famous. It is also the pent ultimate in ""heroics"" as it symbolizes human mastery over the universe that is forever expanding. It is Humanity's shining hour; it is humanity's Raison d'etre. Genro, the Captain of the pleasure and luxury liner, has erroneously met his Void Pilot in dry dock, which turns out to be his undoing, as the Void Pilots are always the unknown members of the complement. Their job, is to be literally inserted into the circuit that will allow the ship to jump x number of warps, making interstellar travel possible.

"Cute, but not very Scientific!","This has been playing a few times on TV lately, so I've watched it a couple of times and have noticed things I didn't see the first time around.Everyone has commented on the romantic aspects of it, and Pratt and Lawrence deliver. I wish Fishburne had been in there longer, he pretty much blows the other two actors out of the water.Now the nitpicking: The damage that occurred should have registered in more than one place. It shouldn't have been something that would be invisible. Where are all the cameras? There should have been a camera in the engineering around to record the collision.Why is it that Fishburne's character wakes up, and does have some medical diagnostic done ASAP. And no explanation as to WHY he had so many problems.All those power shortages, wouldn't those have taken people out of suspension? Shouldn't everyone have died while they slept.The whole space walk thing was silly. They've got such an advanced ship, yet they can only use tethers to the outside, and crawl around? No space pods, or suits with jets?! And as someone pointed out, only one automatic med device for the whole ship? And it requires medical clearance to use? What happens if the nurses and/or doctors died?How did the trees and plants grow like that, was there something watering them after the two had long died?!Okay, that's enough nitpicking. It's a good little afternoon movie if there's nothing else to watch. I wonder how many picked up on the Shining reference, with the bartender and bar?

Decent Popcorn Flick,"Yet another polarizing movie from the year 2016, Passengers is neither as horrible as the critics say it is, nor as wonderful as Pratt/Lawrence fanboys/fangirls will go around telling their teenage friends.The movie does have a lot of pros, actually. The visual effects and set design are both wonderful, particularly the spaceship's exterior, and a beautiful swimming pool featured in several scenes (made all the more beautiful with Jennifer Lawrence's presence). The acting is pretty good overall, however Lawrence can be as bland as she is hot at times. Pratt plays the same character he always does, the likable every-man, but I can't say I've tired of it yet. The end credits song, by Imagine Dragons, is reliably good, even if it's not their best by a long shot. Finally, I can't say I was ever bored by the film... irritated and disappointed, yes, but never bored.The cons are more extensive than I wish they were. The movie borrows from so many other films, including Cast Away, Titanic, Gravity, and The Shining, just to name a few. And there are so many missed opportunities to make really great, original twists that are never utilized. There's also a certain actor that makes an appearance that doesn't really have much purpose... The second act drags a bit, and is less interesting than the other two acts, particularly the first one. Oh, and I can't forget to mention that Pratt makes a decision in the movie that will throw half of the film's viewers into a state of rebellion...Overall, Passengers was a decent use of $6.00 and an afternoon with friends, but not one you need to rush out and see, particularly when compared with other space films of late, such as Rogue One and Star Trek: Beyond. However, fans of sci-fi, such as myself, will probably be moderately entertained for a couple hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic Disaster in Space,"The trailer for 'Passengers' promises mystery and suspense, but the finished product is just a luke-warm romance spiced up with some tepid thrills at the conclusion. Its threadbare plot kicks off several hundred years in the future, with a spaceship encountering comet debris a quarter way through its 120 year journey to another solar system. The vessel sustains damage and starts to malfunction, awakening one of the 5000 hibernating colonists aboard. With no way to put himself back to sleep, this unlucky Jim faces the dismal prospect of spending the rest of his life alone on the vessel. Unaware of a growing crisis in the ship's vitals, Jim passes the next year discussing his dilemma with a supercilious android bartender, playing solo basketball and unsuccessfully trying to break into the sleeping crew's quarters to seek help. Eventually he decides to wake another colonist - an airhead journalist called Aurora - for some company and romance.After this so-so set-up, it's soon clear screenwriter Spaihts has nowhere to go, and his script's most appropriate destination would have been the Black Hole of a producer's waste-bin. The 'Prometheus' debacle should have purged Spaihts of his obsession with interstellar basketball and smug androids, but apparently not, because Jim and Aurora's embarrassing flirtations are portrayed through extra basketball practice and more chats with the Jeeves-bot bartender. After some disco-dancing classes, the ship's system failures become impossible to ignore, and this juvenile melodrama limps into its half-baked climax.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It wasn't terrible, it wasn't amazing. It just...was.","Passengers stars Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as two passengers who have woken up from hibernation on a ship traveling across space to a new planet, they are the only two who have woken up, however, with about nine decades to go before the ship reaches the destination. I've been looking forward to this for a while; I'd heard about the popularity of the unmade script and the synopsis got me interested, I resisted reading the script but as bits of news trickled in, I kept interested, especially when Pratt and Lawrence were attached as I enjoy their work.I'll start, as always, with what I enjoy and number one for me with that is the visuals. The design of the ship, both exterior and interior are amazing. It's a place I would love to visit, from the information interfaces to the architecture, I really enjoyed seeing that. The CGI is top-notch, I don't remember seeing any iffy effects so on that front it's great; they blended it well with real things as well, especially in a sequence (which was in the trailer) concerning a swimming pool and gravity, I thought it was a tense and well-done sequence. So all together I'd say that Passengers was, in general, a good-looking film.What adds to that, of course, are its main leads. Chris Pratt doesn't do dramatic often but here he had to pull off some emotional scenes and I can't say he managed all of them successfully but he gave them a good shot and delivered some quite unexpected compelling series of events in the first act of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence appears alongside and she does just as you'd expect, she's a great actor, looks great, she did just fine in her role. She and Pratt had good chemistry, I thought and enjoyed seeing them together. An extra cast member includes Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur, and he was one of the best parts of the film for me. He was the source of the majority of humor and his constant positive personality was very entertaining.Plot-wise, I felt there were three defined parts to it. The first act, was my favorite, it gave off a cast-away vibe and you could feel the isolation, perhaps if they'd have stuck with that a bit longer it would've been a bit more impactful but it was certainly the best part of the film for me. The second act slowed down a little, it was exactly what I expected from the film, going in; Pratt and Lawrence being a couple on screen and all that entails from flirting to getting-to-know-each-other and all that. Some plot developments did occur, though, and it started to get going again and I was genuinely surprised at one point and enjoyed a certain aspect which I won't spoil here. The third act though happened so suddenly, it was actually quite jarring. There was nothing wrong with it itself, just quite quick and almost predictable.And that's the thing with Passengers, it's not a bad movie by any stretch, but it isn't mind-blowing either. We've seen almost every element before. It felt clean, it felt safe. It was innocuous. There were some twists and turns but you realize the trailer spoils a lot when you're watching the film. All-in-all, Passengers was just OK, and that's it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jennifer Lawrence rocked it with some good acting when her boyfriend came back to life, very expressive and dramatic. ""Passengers"" was too sappy, though. It was mostly about their relationship. There wasn't enough action, or mind-bending scifi creativity. Chris Pratt acted well. It was courageous of him to grow the long beard, get drunk, and show how depressed he was.

A Maddening Sci-Fi with Nothing to Say,"Science Fiction is supposed to be about big ideas. It's supposed to utilize our highest aspirations, exhibit our biggest accomplishments, perhaps exploit our biggest fears. When we venture to a long time ago in a galaxy far away, go where no man has gone before or stumble into another edition of Thunderdome, it's expected that in these fantastical worlds, there's something important worth saying. Passengers seems to be saying anything, and I mean anything, is justified in the name of romance. Oh goody, a space adventure with the mentality of a mid-nineties romantic comedy. Bring on the creepy.Chris Pratt plays...well he plays Chris Pratt, there's no point spelling out names because you won't remember them but you will remember two of the hottest stars in Hollywood today getting freaky amid lustrous starlight. Chris wakes up 90 years too early on a 120 year mission to a distant planet colony. Jennifer Lawrence joins him later and the two struggle to adjust to the prospect of living their entire adult lives in isolation and solitude.Your opinion of this space adventure, glitches and all, is dependent on whether you can stomach one fateful decision on the part of Chris Pratt. That one decision colors the entire movie and can either force an audience member to actively rationalize everything afterward or squirm uncomfortably as things slowly fall apart. If you're the forgiving type, keep in mind that you will have to excuse a gauntlet of romantic and sci-fi clichés, propped up by funhouse mirror versions of everything you've seen before, splattered against the two most cardboard characters since Adam and Eve.If you're a squirmer like me, you will not be enthused by the rudimentary character dynamics, forced sci-fi pablum and syrupy verbal diarrhea that bursts forth with the intensity of an oncoming meteor. Nor will you be happy by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence, an actress famous for playing a host of strong independent women, is stuck playing a space-age pinup whose big climax should come with a Schubert aria. To say nothing of Laurence Fishburne's character who speaks fluent exposition and, likely sizing up the room, decides to leave the movie without so much as a goodbye.Make no mistake, you're stuck with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence for almost the entirety of this movie. And unlike one-man shows like Cast Away (2000) and Moon (2009), Passengers has absolutely nothing important to say about anything. It's a sleek-looking but dull and infuriatingly brainless movie that amazingly thinks the solution to every complex human relationship is live in the present, and the solution to every technical problem is, turn it off and turn it back on again.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Passengers"" Is Diminished By Misguided Attempts of Jon Spaihts","Worthy of the third place among the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood (Black List); nine years ago (2007), ""Passengers"" sign was just a basic preliminary version predisposing to find a studio to financing its making with $35 million initial cost and possibly starring multi-nominated Keanu Reeves and Emily Blunt. Eventually, Sony Pictures got IP rights and fortunately signed Morten Tyldum up in the direction to materialize it with $110 million extraordinary production budget with the fabulous signing of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as leaders of the ambitious project. Today, they present us an already assembled film, aesthetically superb, with unimaginable argumentative potentials and a harmonious chemistry between its main leads, however, its biggest point break is specifically in the screenplay, which diverges tirelessly from that original version established it among the best unrealized projects.In the adjacent future, mankind is able to emigrate from overpopulated and ruined Earth for leaving and seek for habitable spaces abroad. The starship Avalon is transporting 5,000 passengers and over 200 crew members in a cryogenic sleep for a journey that takes 120 years in order to arrive in Homestead II, the new planet Earth. Although everything seems to indicate that the cyclopean experiment will be satisfactory, the spaceship collides hardly against a meteorite, which stirs up the breakdown of one sleep chamber, Jim Paterson's, our protagonist. Each person in the ship has a unique and substantial occupation around the population of the new colony: doctors, microbiologists, nurses, machinists, law specialists, etc. Jim is a young mechanical engineer, who quickly becomes aware that he has awakened 90 years early the official advent, contemplating ethical and moral dilemmas as intrinsic as outer space where the story runs. After one year of being in a techno-transitory paradise, he finally concludes to awaken to one traveler and keeping in mind that it would practically be to immolate her, male protagonist's elections are deeply objectionable. The sudden new member of the spaceship is named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), a writer from New York who aims to write a book about her personal experience in the new world and return to the planet Earth with the most amazing story. Nevertheless, failure accumulation of the huge ship and different narrative confidences push them to the edge of space, literally.The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is incredibly absorbent, it's imposing accompanied by dazzling production design, where prevails snowy and dreary tones which divinely adapt to prelude in order to connect with main character's isolation. As it progresses, induced the arrival of the new human being attracts slightly more grace with immaculate pools, high-quality restaurants and a journey as cynical as captivating around the selfsame outer space. Moreover, visual effects are at the height of many Hollywood products, it's equivalent and even superior to some of the most outstanding sci-fi works in recent times. Some twists in the script allow for acclaiming it spectacularly, such as the scenes of gravity loss, the final stretch or external shots of the Avalon flowing by the great Milky Way, wonderful. The key new technologies for the development of the story are visually provocative and somewhat so realistic that make us aspire one gold class breakfast through our bracelet.The film's cardinal mission is spectators must put oneself in Jim's shoes, it suggests them convoluted dilemmas of the character and deleterious corollaries drive by the silence demon. Chris Patt's charisma in the first few minutes as survivor into a technological spaceship is enough to keep it afloat, he wanders naked with a— superfluously—long beard, formulating himself moral matters such as suicide, a death foretold and unbearable solitude. Although many people didn't realize, The decision of Jim must be worthy of debate and more worthy must be its subsequent actions. In the middle of the film, when love starts to flow between lovers, Stockholm syndrome is patent and the protagonist can be stealthily described as a harasser. However, this scene is covered with Tyldum's direction, who focused on other banalities.With the arrival of Aurora, the fascinating concepts raised in the first hour of the sci-fi movie take their place at the end of the list, since it opts for conceiving a bland affair, a romance as sporadic as tedious. Go from there, the movie breaks down and loses the land he was harvested beside ""Gravity"", ""Interstellar"" or the more recent ""Arrival"". Although it works excellently as a romantic film, it is the third act which affects decisively its prestige. Its unsatisfactory ending, although we haven't lately seen a drastic end in commercial cinema, it wasn't the most pertinent for concluding this futuristic story which began by clouds and terminated with fewer forces. Even though, it isn't a blunder of the acclaimed director who had to stick to the default settings of the story, story re-written by Jon Spaihts, who deplorably decided to distance from the original ending.Frustrating, a missed opportunity. For those who attend to a movie theater without having depths and inconsistencies in mind, ""Passengers"" is the favorite candy for mass audiences. For us who inherently love films and we're as severe as objectives, ""Passengers"" is an irregular movie, but essentially spoiled. This one is a true sign that the nature of the seventh art is to narrate a story, a tightly structured story, not mere visual beauty. With a first part which puts in manifest our deepest human questions; the exciting and controversial issues are imperceptibly mitigated into a surplus drama-romance and a typical Hollywood final sequence, which could be circumstantially sublime hugging the original one. It makes us think that it's another corporate product, but inside us, we know that Sony dropped a film which be aiming for the top between its hands.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An enjoyable movie with some flaws,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was very excited. For a good reason, the CGI looked amazing and it has Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in it. And a HUGE budget.Now to the film.The first part of the film before Aurora(Jennifer Lawrence) was introduced was pretty boring. It felt a bit rushed.I feel like the main character Jim(Chris Pratt) should have been more interesting, although Chris Pratt does a great job in making a feel to this character.When Aurora is introduced, this film becomes more of a romance movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have great chemistry with each other and make the characters very enjoyable and real.When we get to know that there are problems with the spaceship, the film gets more intense, but the last part also feels rushed. We don't get to feel for the characters that much. The film gets unoriginal. It just feels like some action film I have watched before.I must say that the visuals in this film are BEAUTIFUL. The ship design and the technology looks amazing.Michael Sheen does great as a robot in this film, and portraits the mind of a robot very well.The first part is a good introduction to the characters, but feels a little slow. The pacing was too fast at the end, but makes it intense.Overall this is an enjoyable film with great chemistry and great acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt and Michael Sheen. It also has a good romance, and the dialogue feels real.Rating 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sure footed film that could have come across as stilted or too chaptery if not for Thomas Newman's score and Tyldum's solid direction.,"When I read the script on the blacklist years ago it played much like a chunky little B-movie, but with some star power and some budget it turned into something else, something I really didn't like on first watch, but here and now I really enjoyed for the pulpy, glossy sci-fi drama it is. Strangely I found this one of Chris Pratt's best performances, gentle and subdued and emotional.
The plot contains some difficult morals but a castaway film always would and human nature and loneliness is a strange beast and I think is examined perfectly fine here and anyone's issues with it seem a little bandwagony instead of taking it as a film on its merits and it's genre.
The 3D wasn't powerful at first, however once it settled, the deep close ups were powerful and added a lot to the movie, crisp, weighty shots against the commercial gloss of the set design.
Overall it's a film that could have done more with its ideas but chose to settle with some Hollywood gloss, but as it goes, it's pretty solid, consistent stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty good space opera,"OK, full disclosure first. I love science fiction stuff. I grew up reading Heinlein and Asimov, among others. And now that CGI means that filmmakers don't have to put up with super-cheesy special effects, I love the spectacle that sci-fi movies can offer. The effects in ""Passengers"" were magnificent. Yes, there will always be quibbles about accuracy when it comes gravity, micro- and otherwise. There were some other plot holes, but what movie doesn't have those?Chris Pratt has come a long way from playing the doofus on ""Parks and Recreation"". He is adequate, but his story is a cautionary tale to any actor who considers giving up. Apparently anyone can get lucky and end up with a career as an action-film hero. Jennifer Lawrence was fine (and VERY fetching) and I do not understand all of the criticism of her acting on this film. I think she got the most out the material. The crux of the middle third of the movie is the ethical dilemma faced (and failed) by one of the characters, and this was proper for such an enormous decision.Overall, this film was enjoyable, but not destined to be a classic. Well worth a look, especially if you are a sci-fi movie fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Passengers - A Re-imagined Sleeping Beauty,"This film was certainly different to anything I'd ever seen before. Set in space - brilliant. Good looking guy doing some heavy lifting - why not. Beautiful girl lying down, unmoving - isn't that how we all like our women? A threat to thousands of unsuspecting, very unhelpful people - if you don't have that, do you even have a movie? As you can see all very unique and completely new aspects of film-making, really pushing the film industry in a new direction. Opening minds. Broadening horizons.You may have heard of some of our main mans films, Bride Wars, Jennifer's Body, Five-Year Engagement, and his most famous part to date, a little television series, that I believe picked up quite a following, known simply as Parks and Recreation. Christ Pratt may seem a like a foreign name to you now, but mark my words young children, this man could be something, if only some movie director would give him a chance, in say a Marvel superhero movie. But hey, that's just my uneducated opinion.The unmoving girl referred to earlier, is played by that chick who, I want to say, was in that movie where everyone had to kill each other? The one with all the weapons. You know which one I'm talking about. It was directed by Quentin Tarentino? No? Then she was definitely in that film with the guy who was in The Godfather and that other guy who was in those stupid Hangover movies. (Speaking of the Hangover movies, if you haven't seen Obama on Between Two Ferns pop onto The Youtube and educate yourself.) You know the one I'm talking about. He's always in all those Jennifer Lawrence films. Argh, for the life of me, I just can't seem to think of her name.Moving right along then. I'm surprised more people haven't caught on that Passengers is basically a re-imagined Sleeping Beauty. Aurora (Lawrence) is woken up by Jim (Pratt), and they are hurtling through space at horrific speeds upon the spaceship, Avalon, a name for a Disney kingdom if ever I heard one, and a kingdom they sure do make. The catalyst that sends them on their journey to save the entire unsuspecting, still sleeping, inhabitants of the ship should've been named Maleficent. Even though it's portrayal of the evil fairy wasn't nearly as good as Angelina Jolie's, at least it gave it the good old college try.The character development throughout the film was a bit so-so, even though the whole time Pratt and Lawrence's characters were playing out their love story I couldn't help thinking; 'But he's with Anna Farris! That makes him unqualified to be with her.' (See what I did there? Do you see it?)You do however, get to see the motive behind their reasoning for being on the ship, and the film does introduce some interesting prospects of the future for the human race. And even though the differences and struggles between classes is played in a humorous light, it does however, suggest that perhaps we, as a species, will always struggle with class hierarchy and the implications that money brings into the conversation of class structure and entitlements. Or perhaps, like a high-school English teacher, I'm reading too much into it and the references to differences in class is simply to make it more relatable to the intended audience.The supporting acts were played brilliantly, especially the robot barman, Arthur, whose brilliant conversation drove the film when it could very easily have been quite boring. The question left to ask is: where do I get myself one of those?The film was throwing the popcorn in the general direction of your mouth and missing good. The suspense really had you on the edge of your seat, and the love story and following conflict between such a small central cast was displayed brilliantly and certainly showed off each actors ability to lie to large audiences. And don't even get me started on the cinematography. It was vastly, brilliantly and universally wonderful. Pun most definitely intended.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Broadening the appeal of Sci-Fi,"Passengers (2016)
Very credible Sci-Fi. It's asking an enormous, enormous amount for 2 (3) actors to carry a two hour movie and this is its biggest triumph. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence are eminently engaging and endlessly watchable.
The space and science are largely believable. The dialogue and interactions work. The structure and tonal balance work.
It asks plenty of questions among others just why did anyone get on board and questions of humanity.
The film rests upon their relationship and its up to you whether this examination survives the duration but it did....just...for me, or at least I could buy it.
I felt he last 3 or 4 minutes could have been explored differently or to be honest, just explored, but maybe short and sweet was for the best rather than further ""work(ing) the problem"".
It's not its fault that it isn't the searing Sci-Fi of Arrival, the all things to everyone of The Martian or have the peril of say Gravity.
I think it's a genuine feat that this movie will acceptably cross genres and have a greater appeal than one could imagine. Broadening the appeal of a setting I love can't be a bad thing.

"A flawed, but excellent film.","This film seems to have had more than it's fair share of critics, and whilst some of it is justified to an extent, I don't think it stops this being one of the best sci fi films of the decade.Let's start with the plot. It is a highly original story that I've never really seen before. It has got bags of drama, twists and character development and moves at the perfect pace with no wasted scenes. The dilemma that Jim faces is compelling and thought provoking and is set up extremely well.The cast is obviously limited to four people and none of them disappoint. Pratt and Lawrence are both excellent and sell their respective roles perfectly. Micheal Sheen is his usual excellent self also. Laurence Fishburne's character is a little more superfluous to the story than the others but he's always solid.Where this film really shines though is the set design and visual effects. The space scenes are stunning, the film really gives you the feeling of being in deep space, years from anything and it really helps this movie. The Avalon space ship is an absolutely gorgeous place - each set wether it's the bar, the main lobby, restaurant or people's quarters are all fantastic, utterly futuristic yet still believable and grounded in reality. It's just top drawer and is a feast for the eyes.Does this film have flaws? Sure it does. For the amount of advanced technology on display here it's a bit of a stretch to believe there's no failsafe if the sleeping pods malfunction and zero way of waking the crew or the ability to put themselves back to sleep.Ultimately though this film is so slick, so entertaining, hell, so unique in it's storytelling (how many sci fi love stories can you mention?) that it doesn't matter in the end. I'd give this 9 out of ten all day long.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Asks some good moral questions.,"'PASSENGERS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi romantic thriller, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. It was directed by Morten Tyldum (who also directed the 2014 critically acclaimed hit 'THE IMITATION GAME'), and it was scripted by Jon Spaihts (who also co-wrote the sci-fi hits 'PROMETHEUS' and 'DOCTOR STRANGE'). The movie tells the story of two passengers; that awaken 90-years early from induced hibernation, on a 120-year space flight to another planet. The film also costars Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also under-performed at the Box Office. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy everything with Jennifer Lawrence in it.The story takes place sometime in the near future, aboard the spacecraft Avalon. The Avalon is transporting 5,000 colonists to a planet called Homestead II (from Earth), and it's supposed to take 120-years for it to get there. Since the trip takes so long, the colonists are cryogenically frozen (for the duration of the flight). Two passengers unexpectedly wake up early, 90-years too early, and they also discover there's something seriously wrong with the ship.The film asks some good moral questions, the kind that can create some great conversations (and good debates); like all good science fiction should. It's definitely not a perfect film; I blame most of it's flaws on Tyldum's direction though (I had similar problems with 'THE IMITATION GAME'). I do think it's a good story, and a great concept, and the two lead actors are both good in it (Lawrence is much better though). It's also great to see a woman star getting top billing, in an adventure film like this, and also getting paid $8 million more than the male lead; even though he has quite a bit more screen time (and is arguably the central character of the movie). I think Lawrence definitely deserves it; she's a huge star, and this is a pretty entertaining vehicle for her.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Bm1uDreRMGU",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This story has nothing to do with sci fi. It does not work as a Sci Fi movie, nor thriller, nor drama, nor romance.I agree with other people who have slammed the script writer. What was he thinking? The whole story was mad up from the most lame clichés of the Hollywood movies of the last decade, such as Bruce Willis save-the world heroes, and the tear jerking romantic movies.

I hate how this movie gets hate for viewers mistake,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was excited. It was an interesting love story with some action (probably towards the end). In no way did I think it was sci-fy just because it takes place in outer space.The idea was great, people traveling 120 years to get to a new planet and start a new life. Two passengers waking up 90 years early and trying to fix it and then realizing there's really nothing that can be done. There was a great twist in the beginning which was not expected by the trailer and the chemistry between Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal. I am a huge fan of Jennifer and she player this role perfectly.The people who are hating on this film were expecting a different movie. Less love and more sci-fy, but when more than half of the trailer is their blossoming love story rather than the action packed ending its pretty clear what the movie will be about. It is the perfect futuristic love story that makes you sad, happy, scared and on the edge of your seat for parts.I would recommend this movie to anyone as long as they realize this is NOT a sci-fy movie but a romantic comedy with some action at the end.

"Not Bad, But Not Great","Three things about how I review...1) I'm okay with fantasy. I'll be lenient on a movie if it lacks realism. After all, it is a movie.2) I'm a sucker for romance.3) Storyline, dialog, and editing are key for me. They are the backbone for any movie.I'm not a hater. I'm not criticizing this movie, but I'm also not praising it either.I really wanted to like this movie, because it has a lot of potential on the surface - Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Sci-Fi, and Romance.But... I realize what it is... We weren't given enough to support the story line, and as much as I wanted Jennifer to deliver, her dialog and direction was just... off.There were a few zingers that in some cases exposed her slight tendency to overact. This, is not entirely her fault. Directors are responsible for getting the actor to sell the scene, but in some instances, you can almost see where Jennifer is almost forcing her lines and emotions. I know she is capable of not doing this, as you can see in Silver Lining. The hard thing is that we don't see the directors directing in a scene. When you see what she has done in the past, versus in Passengers, you can tell the difference in how she was being directed.I think this affected Chris as well. I'm one of his biggest fans, especially in Parks and Recreation. But, there are some subtle moments where he appears to have delivered a line multiple times (aka takes).This definitely had all the right ingredients. It's just the cook (director), didn't make his best dish with what he had to work with.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Graphics is good, music is the soft side of the film. it can be much more atmospheric and maybe the rating is much more higher than now. the concept is genius although it is not emotionally deep enough. It is a fantastic creepy start, and while Lawrence and he undeniably possess the magic spark of screen chemistry, the basic creepiness of this cute extinguishes what the producers presumably are hoping is a warm fuzzy glow of sparky interaction. Stalking tactics bolstering romantic comedies are by no means new, and over the decades, Producers have proved adept at somehow planing down world nastiness, but here it's gruesomely inescapable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Passengers ShowMeTheMovies Review,"showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-passengers.htmlWith its' limited cast and seemingly cliché story, Passengers surprisingly succeeds in its' depiction of a moving tale of loneliness, morality and belonging.When I first caught wind of Passengers, I pictured an atypical, unimaginative love story only made slightly more interesting by its' sci-fi setting; Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt the lucky A-listers brought in to up-sell a bland, poorly-scripted movie that's' only discernibly interesting concept has been stretched out over a two-hour substance-less picture. Proof that you should never judge a book by its' cover.Giving the movie a chance to prove me wrong, I found not only a well-written story with underlying themes but excellent casting in the form of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Being the predominant (and almost only) characters, Aurora Lane (Lawrence) and Jim Preston (Pratt) had clear chemistry and an ability to command the attention of the audience in a rather unique way.The film primarily follows Jim Preston, a passenger on the spacecraft 'Avalon', on an intergalactic, 120-year-long journey to a new colony. After waking up in his cryogenic sleep chamber years too early, Jim finds himself alone (all bar (!) an android named Arthur - played fascinatingly by Michael Sheen) and unable to force his way back to sleep, despite multiple attempts and methods. Eventually, on the advice of barman-turned-confidant Arthur, Jim accepts his fate and decides to make use of all the spaceships' facilities for the time he has left - cue video-games, swimming pools and first-class cabins.Despite previously resigning himself to a life devoid of social interaction, Jims' loneliness, desperation and understandable depression slowly begins to drive him mad (a nod to The Shining, anyone?!) and he contemplates suicide by opening an airlock without wearing a spacesuit. The decision to exclude a large cast becomes apparent (and appropriate) here, where one can empathise with Jim's isolation and his longing for new faces.Enter: Aurora Lane. Thought-provoking and filled with moral dilemmas, Aurora and Jim hit it off from the start, and Jim shines to Aurora almost instantly after managing human contact for the first time in over a year. After hearing his story, Aurora is sympathetic towards Jim, and though doomed to perish years before anyone discovers what has happened to them, their dynamics make way for a seemingly good life. Unaware of the dangers that befall them, the circumstances surrounding how both Jim and Aurora woke up then becomes apparent, and the spaceship begins to experience severe failures that have to be solved in order for the passengers and crew aboard (all still asleep) to be saved.What I can absolutely commend about Passengers is how very economical it is with its' hidden meanings aside from its main concepts, and how it flawlessly takes the plot where it needs to go, at a reasonable pace for the viewer. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't appear until the film has properly set the scene - and whilst Pratt carries at least the opening act alone, it doesn't feel like 'The Chris Pratt Show'; it remains entertaining throughout.The acting quality is superb all around; Martin Sheen will likely be overlooked this awards season, but deserves an honourable mention - the presence of Arthur (a representation of the viewer), allows the thoughts, feelings and troubles of the leads to be known - the unemotional voice between character and movie-goer.My one real criticism stems down to the charming-yet-essentially-predictable romance between Aurora and Jim - though the writers' clearly self-aware. I would have preferred a story that focuses on a boy-meets-girl turned friendship than blatant, unnecessary cheese - though the relationship itself entirely integral to the plot. Though easily foreseeable, Passengers did not suffer as a result.Visually, the film is professional, the spaceship itself looked incredible - and the soundtrack had some great choices in it including a well-used Bob Dylan track and a made-for-movie Imagine Dragons tune. Passengers is an overall great film, a sci-fi-come-romance that achieves the best of both worlds; an enjoyable presentation, very compelling to watch. Don't be fooled by the trailers, it isn't that bland, I promise.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It stays with you.I've watched this movie twice now and both times I found myself pondering life's purpose afterwards.

"Passengers is like a ""3 in 1 box"" that contains excellent visual image, sexy love story and romance and breathtaking action moments.","Firstly, I highly recommend to watch Passengers in a Cinema with huge screen and Dolby Atmos audio, you're gonna be thrilled.As I mentioned in a title it is a pack of 3 - the visual image of that story is the most exciting you've had ever seen, trust me. Every part of the starship Avalon is gorgeously beautiful and based on genuine scientific theories so the movie gives you a feeling like everything you see is really possible in a near future. The effects, voices and the the visualization of the space makes you think like you're in there and gives you a huge dose of excitement all over your body, it just feels electric.The Romance between Jim and Aurora is really kind of interesting because they are like the best friends having fun everywhere, yet they help each other overcome the reality they live in and that creates a real relationship between them. They both suite each other and look very sexy together creating the most handsome couple in the universe.When you're watching this movie, you at least once think about how dangerous it would be to appear in situations portrayed in the movie. The thing I like about the whole story is that you have no idea how it's gonna all end up. There are so many life dangerous scenes which give you a lot of vibration and you really like to watch that kind of action.Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie, it is different, Characters are played in a really awesome way and the entire movie is just a masterpiece among the space movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Best at its darkest, average at its brightest","I assumed the highlight of this movie would be the chemistry between the two (hyper)charismatic leads, but surprisingly the best part of the movie was it's exploration of complete isolation and loneliness. While it's not much of a spoiler, I will not reveal anything specific about what happens, other than that one character faces a very interesting moral dilemma, and that this is a major part of the film.But somehow, this is not the major plot point of the movie. The latter part of the film is about a different problem faced by the protagonists, and is more blockbuster-like and less interesting. It's not bad, it's still a good movie, but it feels like the cop out on a cool idea (the moral dilemma) because they feel obliged to have lots of action and peril.I liked the setting and the scenario, and I would not feel bad recommending this movie as a light scifi-watch, but in it there's a much more interesting movie in the moral dilemma.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gravity scenes were excellent!!!,"A spaceship is traveling to Homestead II, a new planet and it transports over 5000 passengers on a journey that takes 120 years to complete. All the passengers and crew are in a separate sleep pod and due to some malfunction Jim wakes up and he finds out that 90 years is still remaining to reach the destination. The chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is one of the key factor of the movie. The spaceship structure was also likable and got a fine music. The expectations will be high because of the cast and Morten Tyldum, the director of 'The Imitation Game'. The special effects and visuals keeps the movie interesting, especially the swimming pool scene. Overall, it's a watchable sci-fi movie and somehow I enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

This was an excellent movie!,"I was very disappointed with the critic reviews! In fact I almost did not go to see this movie because of those reviews. I am happy that I did go because it was a great movie. My Son and Grandson were with me and they loved it too! Don't believe the harsh reviews. This is worth seeing! Overall the acting was fantastic! The special effects were extremely well done. This is a movie that is worth seeing for the space scenes alone. However, the chemistry between Chris Pratt and Jenifer Lawrence kept the movie interesting. The bartender provided a comedic aspect which made the movie feel fresh.

Very pretty film with great special effects and acting,"Passengers received rather mixed reviews when first released, which I think is a bit unfair. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen all do well in their roles and there's definitely good chemistry between Lawrence and Pratt. The plot is rather inventive too exploring the ideas of companionship and if you're left alone would and isolated would you take someone along with you even if it too made them isolated, very human decisions.7/10: The film could have been handled in a better way but it's good for what it is and even though some scenes may go on a bit longer than they should it is still a great film",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Discard professional critics: Highly enjoyable movie, perfect for a family/friends plan","First of all, please apologize my poor English. It's not my native language and I won't be able to explain in detail and with a rich vocabulary my feelings after watching this movie. I will try my best:I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I had read several ""professional"" negative reviews and was a bit reluctant to see it but I decided to follow my instincts and give it a try. So glad I did.To anyone reading this, please trust me, this is probably the best experience you'll have if you go to the theater this winter. Great cinematography, fantastic GGI effects (digital effects are just the right amount,and really well put), original design, beautiful ost, engaging story (you're never bored) and great acting.I have to particularly praise Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen's work. She's absolutely magnetic, fantastic performance. I've been following her work since she was only an adolescent on The Burning Plain and she's grown in her indubitable natural talent. She can portray any type of character (sexy, strong, weak, hurt, anguished, happy, enraged)and be an outstanding role in any type of film genre: action, drama, comedy, everything. She'll probably be a classic, having the perfect combination of looks and acting skills. Michael Sheen doesn't have much screen time but he does a great work at portraying the android Arthur, he's a really good actor, always serious and committed. British academy actors are rarely a disappointment. Chris Pratt delivers and he's a very likable and attractive man, but lacks of expression and tension in his face/eyes. His dramatic moments in the film are a little bit underwhelming.Wrap-up: GO SEE THIS IN BIG SCREEN. DEFINITELY WORTH IT.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sci-fic and romance makes it interesting,I really enjoyed it even though I am not a fan of sci-fi movie but this one really caught my attention.

Enjoyable yet not too special.,Passengers is a sci-fi film about two passengers who wake up from hibernation 90 years early. The film includes large fractions of romance and action due to malfunctions aboard the ship. Chris Pratt who plays an engineer from his previous life on Earth begins the film with a great feeling of fearing being stranded that was very shocking through his tremendous acting on how he starts to lose grip of humanity. It gave a slight similarity to the film Castaway starring Tom Hanks which i thought was great. Jennifer Lawrence later appears as a higher class passenger and creates great acting chemistry with Chris Pratt. I would certainly like to see these two in another film.This film did have a fair share negativity to it such as lacking originality as it felt like a big mash up of films we've seen in the past. Some scenes seemed a little unrealistic particularly to do with the romance side yet this didn't effect the main plot in the film. Michael Sheen who played a robotic bartender was my favorite addition to this movie as he lifted humor into scenes that were becoming very dark and depressing and generally seemed to fill gaps in this movie. To conclude this i would say passengers was an enjoyable film to watch once but not again and didn't show anything ridiculously amazing.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Existentialism in space,"The movie has received rather poor professional reviews which claim that the concept is superficial and the romance misogynistic. For me, the movie was excellent study on what makes us human; the social relationships or the idea of right and wrong. It is about the choices we make when forced into an absurd and profoundly hopeless situation. It is about the fear of death,both the fear of empty and meaningless life and the fear of immediate death. Of course there is a romance plot, but for me, the movie had a strange existentialist feeling that touched me deeply. The movie is highly underrated as most reviewers see it as a shallow and strange ""date movie"". The movie is shot in a beautiful and breathtaking way, the actors were excellent and the slow pace is justified: It gives you time to think. What would you do in the situation? What would be your choice? I recommend this philosophical movie disguised as a romance for everybody who are ready to challenge the opinion of professional reviewers.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could have been better,"Passengers was good but not great. The potential was there, the film was trolling along it was equal parts funny, romantic, space travel and then they don't show the ending.

Actually quite good...,"For some reason I never got around to watching this 2016 sci-fi movie from writer Jon Spaihts and director Morten Tyldum before now in 2023. I guess I just never got around to it, as it didn't really seem like all that interesting a movie. Then again, I am not overly keen on sci-fi in general, so there is that too.But I had the opportunity to watch ""Passengers"" here in 2023, and so I did. And I have to say that I had actually been missing out on an entertaining movie. While the synopsis for ""Passengers"" makes the movie seem somewhat bland in its contents, writer Jon Spaihts really put together a storyline and script that actually had me captivated throughout the entire 116 minutes that the movie ran for.The acting performances in ""Passengers"" were good. It was mostly Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt on the screen, but they carried the movie quite well. The movie also have the likes of Michael Sheen, Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia on the cast list.It should also be noted that ""Passengers"" turned out to be so enjoyable not just because of the storyline, but most certainly also for the characters and the character development throughout the course of the movie. There are some rather profound and big decisions to be made along the way for Jim Preston (played by Chris Pratt) and Aurora Lane (played by Jennifer Lawrence).Visually then ""Passengers"" is quite good. It feels and looks like a proper space movie, without all the lasers and space dogfights. The atmosphere aboard the starship Avalon was quite nicely done and had that distinct futuristic feel to it. Thumbs up on the visual effects and props departments. Also to the wardrobe department.I was genuinely entertained by ""Passengers"", and it is a movie that I can warmly recommend. And even as not being a particular sci-fi buff, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie for the narrative and how well-written it is.My rating of ""Passengers"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The acting was amazing, the visual were better than i had hoped and the chemistry between the protagonists made it even more worthwhile. This isn't a basic space movie where they go off to another planet and live a new life or even come in contact with aliens. Nope, it has an original plot that makes you question your own moral compass. The beginning of the movie was pretty slow but it started to climax at a very nice pace.

the romance is not the main theme luckily,"When my teen daughter asked me to go watch this flick i agreed on therms that it wasn't going to be a love story which is for me the kind of thing I don't want to see. Have seen the trailer it looked okay so I gave it a try.And in the beginning I did like it a lot, pure sci-fi which I thought was okay. But I was afraid once Jennifer Lawrence (Aurora) would come into this pure sci-fi it would quickly turn into a love story, which finally did. But did it bother me, not at all, because there were jokes mixed into the story which made me forget about the love between Aurora and Jim (Chris Pratt). And of course I did know that the bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) did have a naughty side.Luckily the love came on the second side because the space ship needed to be rescued. Naturally this kind of flicks don't have blood or real action going on but there are a few moments that makes you want to see what will happen.On part of the effects used they are really stunning. The gravitation being removed in the spaceship does things with aurora in a swimming pool and that is really a must see. So having extreme good effects, a bit of jokes here and there and a good story made it all watchable even for an old fart as me.I hated 'The 5th Wave (2016)' for so man reasons but Passengers, well, I did like it.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A true sci-fi story of the kind I used to read as a kid, done beautifully and convincingly","The whole idea of traveling between stars has been contemplated for a long time. There are huge obstacles that would have scared off most scriptwriters, but not Jon Spaihts, or the director, Morten Tyldum. Not sure who had the most guts, perhaps both, but the result is spectacular and engrossing. Truth be told there are a couple of plot gimmicks employed to liven up the drama, but I was so wrapped up in the story I hardly noticed.What if you woke up before everyone else on a ship not due to make landfall for 90 years? What might you do out of desperation?Imagining what might happen in a plausible way is either going to fall short or seem magical. This treatment is definitely the latter. The look and feel of the starship is fresh and impressive. And both Lawrence and Pratt do more than what is required by the story, they not only make it all believable, they make it poignant and emotional too. I could see Jennifer's part going to some stunning starlet, a younger Megan Fox, perhaps, but the movie would have lacked the emotional impact it gets from a pro like Jennifer, who gets more alluring with every picture.Rogue One seems pretty childish in comparison.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

This was an amazing piece of art that was also so truly romantic.,"This was an amazing piece of art that was also so truly romantic. While I understand it will not appeal to much of the audience who is looking for meaningless violence and bullets flying everywhere this movie has an incredibly deep touch of the human mind and soul, looking within ourselves and trying to define concepts that transcend time and distance all wrapped up in a space opera rendered in extraordinary colors.I went into the theater with my girlfriend at my request and she was ready for a good nap while I was ready for yet another star wars like disappointment. And boy was I wrong... I was so surprised to see this type of movie that goes into the rich and amazing ideas of old giant sci-fi writers such as Stanislav Lem or Asimov. It all reminded me of a very old book from my childhood called ""Magellanic cloud"" by Stanislav Lem.I have been connected with this movie on so many levels as this story depicts the human soul in all its loneliness, craving for companionship in the vast empty void of space. While the main story line is somehow predictable and not much is happening action-wise the true magic of the movie happens in the background, provided that your soul is sensible enough to cope with the very subtle nuances that question our very own existence.The concepts unraveled here are so vast and deep that you simply end up thinking about it all days after you saw it.

"Entertaining edge of the seat sci-fi, lacks a strong theme","The plot of this film will keep you on the edge of the seat, and the depiction of how interstellar travel might happen at some point in the future is very entertaining. However I didn't feel like the movie contained any well developed theme or any message. The most interesting theme was the notion that we have very little control over our lives. The two passengers have their own hopes and dreams about the future, but ultimately they have little control over making these dreams a reality, instead they are just ""passengers"", and must simply make the best of what they have. I think this theme gets drowned out by the exploration of the ship's luxurious facilities, and the romance between Lawrence and Pratt.As a sucker for anything to do with sci-fi and space travel, I did enjoy it.

A romance with 'glimpse at future' background.,"From the first few moments of the movie Passengers, make sure to fasten your seat belt as this will seem like a journey into the future you'll love to take.What's appealing about Morten Tyldum latest outerspace drama, besides the bona fide original story, is the huge practical sets. These are real sets with 8 miles of LED lighting built into the ship and not some green screen work. You can sense the aim of the director being achieved through the performances of the actors and their interaction with the world surrounding them.Now for those who're going into theater hoping for an extended look at how the future of space travel will be, Passengers will unfortunately have few answers. The movie is based on an idea which is actually feasible from a scientific perspective, but one thing you should keep in mind while watching the dramatic adventure Sci-Fi is that it's a Starshipboard Romance. There is more concentration on Pratt and Lawrence's characters experiencing emotions of desperation, solitude, love, and hope.Passenger's script was one of the major flaws which didn't much help both actors. There were reports that its story was still being edited as late as last couple of months, so perhaps its release should have been postponed.

The Full Package of What Makes A Great Film!,"Passengers is an amazing sci-fi romance thriller film that includes an all-star cast! Jennifer Lawrence as always, delivers a stellar performance that allows viewers to really feel the intensity of the film through her character as Aurora Lane.

Passengers - excellent start but final act spoils it,"Jim is a technical engineer aboard the spaceship Avalon, which is on its way to colony planet Homestead II. A journey that will take roughly 120 years. About 30 years in, Jim wakes up from his hibernation, due to a technical failure. With 90 years to go, and no way to get back into hibernation, Jim is condemned to spend the remainder of his life alone, traveling, but never arriving. Depressed Jim discovers a fellow passenger, the beautiful Aurora, who is an inspired writer and journalist. Jim falls in love and decides to wake her up. From here on, many more things go wrong with the ship and Jim and Aurora must find a way to rescue themselves and the 5,000 other passengers aboard the Avalon, while juggling their own unfortunate fate.Going into this movie, I was somewhat on the fence, because I had high hopes for it, but the reviews were pretty terrible. Having seen the movie, I can understand why the reviews are so bad, but I am glad to report the movie isn't as bad as the experts make us believe. There is just one very big issue that's hard to overcome. But I will get to that in a minute.First the good stuff. The movie starts out really well. It contains critique on the over-commercializing that's been taking over nearly everything (in the movie even space travel). Ironic, really, coming from a big budget Hollywood flick, but interesting nonetheless. Jim's tough decision whether to wake up Aurora, condemning her to the same fate as his, or leaving her in hibernation and facing loneliness for the rest of his days was also well done. Pratt does well to show the emotional depth of the character (much to my surprise, because apart from being funny, Pratt's acting had never been all that impressive). He can't compete with Lawrence, though. She dominates every scene she's in. Sheen plays the android Arthur very well, too. Finally, as you would expect from a movie with such a large budget, the visuals are absolutely stunning.So far, so good, I thought, but towards the end, the movie makers unfortunately decided that fast pacing was more important than emotional investment. The last third of the movie felt very rushed, and I just wasn't as invested when the finale came along. The decisions of the characters made little sense because they weren't foreshadowed well enough, and the parts that should have made me go wild actually didn't feel all that exciting anymore. This is sad, since they had done so well to take their time in the first bit of the movie, and then somehow forgot how important that was later on. Basically, they took a good idea, started out well, and then messed it up by going all Hollywood in the end. Oops.Should you watch it? If you like Hollywood-boom-boom turbo flicks, then no. The first bit is quite slow and character-driven. If you like Sci-Fi and don't mind slower movies, then yes, but do keep in mind the ending will not be as good as you want it to be. Just enjoy the first and second act, and of course the visuals. And Jennifer Lawrence is good. Very good.Verdict: 6.0 - Could have been great, but a rushed Hollywood ending spoils the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Worth seeing!,"My wife & I hesitated going to see this movie, as the few reviews we read were not that positive. But we decided to go anyway, and we are glad we did. The movie was very good & well worth seeing. It isn't just a simple, comic book plot nor some ridiculous space alien story. It does have good special effects that support the plot instead of overwhelming it. The story line was well written and characters well developed, people you end up caring about instead of just ""bodies"" like many movies have had lately. It does touch on situations a lot of people (especially young people) might have difficulty identifying with. As others have mentioned, I don't understand why some of the reviewers couldn't seem to understand the plot, instead getting side-tracked on some of the things that happened and reading into what they think it meant in the story-line.If you are mature enough to understand a decently written plot, you should enjoy this movie and appreciate the situations it presents.I encourage you to go see this movie. The scenes in space are worth seeing at the theater on a larger screen. And the movie itself is worth seeing to begin with. Ignore the negative reviewers. They are wrong in my opinion. See for yourself.Or just wait for the next version of some remake of the next comic book superhero, with its overwhelming CGI effects and typical fighting & violence, which is apparently what most people think is required to work things out with others, solve the worlds problems and vanquish the various forms of evil.(While I can enjoy these types of movies too, it is nice to see a movie & story that present something new & somewhat different. At least I didn't feel like I watched yet another episode of the same thing yet again!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Factual errors,OK we know its a movie and it does not necessarily have to be 100 percent factually accurate but when the whole concept is around a 100 year journey the writers should at least do some basic research. The spaceship slingshots around Antares which is around 620 light years from earth. We are told that the spaceship is travelling at half light speed which would mean it would take at least 1240 years to get to Antares. As if that is not bad enough the idea of flying past a red super giant star and having a casual gaze down on it is simply ridiculous. I don't think any spacecraft could withstand the gravitational forces and immense heat and radiation it would be subjected to. I don't mind that these movies don't really care about these things but please treat the audience with a bit more respect when it comes to their intelligence.,,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun, until you start thinking about the flaws","I kind of enjoyed this movie for the sheer fantasy of it. It's one of those movies where you can imagine yourself in place of the actor and ask yourself ""what would I do?"" The problem is that what you think you would do is probably much more exciting than what the film delivers.Mainly though, it's just fun to think about being alone in space with Jennifer Lawrence.The plot is simple, and the action is standard. This film unfortunately offers no real surprises. It is utterly formulaic. It's the kind of film where you guess what's going to happen next, and that's exactly what happens - and you wish it hadn't, because you really, really want to like it and have it take you on a journey.It's a pretty film, but not a very smart one. Kind of like Chris Pratt.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flawed beyond repair,"Simply put, Morten Tyldum's Passengers is flawed beyond repair. Featuring two of Hollywood's most beloved stars and an interesting sci-fi concept and setting, the hopes for an entertaining and thought-provoking experience were relatively high. Sadly, when Passengers attempted to be any more than a disposable sci-fi romance flick, it became startlingly clear that the overall messages are not only morally askew, but downright disturbing.Political and philosophical themes of morality are explored throughout the generally linear story, and while the principles surrounding the overall situation can be fun to discuss afterwards, it seems the film didn't know what to do with it's moral dilemmas as they come up in the narrative. The overall themes and messages that the film portrays are quite disturbing. Moments of sadistically disregarding human life are brushed aside to make way for lovey-dovey scenes of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. It's not the overall wrong message that this film portrays that I find sloppy, but the way that the film stumbles over itself attempting to display it's philosophies.Despite this rather glaring issue, there is some enjoyment to be found here. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do share some interesting chemistry and, while they weren't given much to work with emotionally, each of their performances generated some character. And while the aspects of romance were, quite literally, forced, the interactions and tension between Pratt's and Lawrence's characters were easily the most enjoyable parts of the film. Its not until the film's action and thrill sequences where the lack of substance is most noticeable. These scenes lack any essence of a punch and the laughably poor dramatic acting from Pratt only helps accentuate the goofiness of the situation. The special effects are decent and the set design is luscious and clean, but none of these qualities help to repair the overall empty feel of the throwaway story or the equally awful ending.To be fair, Passengers is harmless. It's dumb throwaway entertainment that I could find some enjoyment in. There are some interesting uses of special effects and some fun interactions between the film's leads, but when Passengers makes attempts at a philosophical and morality-questioning experience, it only comes off as amateurish. I'm not quite sure what the intentions of Passengers' messages were, but it was painfully obvious when the film was banking on the star-power of Pratt and Lawrence to excuse it's own bumbling narrative.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredibly enjoyable and moving,"I was looking for a great sci-fi story, hoping for a good drama/romance, and got all of it. This movie was incredibly enjoyable. It was easy to put yourself in the story, wondering what decisions you'd make if you were there. The situations were developed to allow you to really feel it. The chemistry of Pratt and Lawrence was a catalyst for tangible tones of romance, conflict, and survival in this space of nothingness. The movie really portrayed the immenseness of the setting, and made you wonder what it would be like. You'll walk away loving this, and yet still, again, wondering what you would do.... I'll see it again:)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not bad at all,"I try to go to a movie on federal holidays, sort of my own way to celebrate. I used to do this for a long time except for the last few years because there really hasn't been anything out there I want to see--even at the $2.25 theater. But a girlfriend & I decided to take a chance on this movie on New Year's Day. Had to pay $12 because the only showing that fitted into our schedules was 3-D, which really irritated me. Never again! Anyway, ""Passengers"" was not a bad movie. I felt really bad for Chris Pratt & prayed Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't find out why she ""woke up"" ahead of schedule. You can't blame her for being furious! This was a good movie, though, and I only wish I had waited until it came to the cheap theater. I don't feel as if I've wasted a bunch of money if I don't like the movie (plus I can wander the hallway and find another movie to watch so my $2.25 isn't totally wasted).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What could have been a great sci-fi ends up a rom-com space opera mashup.,"The term mashup is not usually a compliment. It means mixing different genres in a way that looks interesting, gets a laugh, or makes a mess. It is unlikely the sci-fi rom-com melodrama Passengers (2016) intended to be a mashup but that is the result. If it stayed on-track as sci-fi, all the ingredients are present for an outstanding film but box-office considerations require a love story with a moral dilemma so the film ends up a mess.We are aboard an intergalactic spacecraft for a 120-year voyage as part of a commercial outer- world migration venture. The ship's set and digital effects are some of the best seen on film in years, conveying an enormity of scale and futuristic design that is mesmerising. Five thousand volunteers are ensconced in hibernation pods en route to capitalism's version of eternal paradise when one traveller, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 90 years too soon. Travelling through space with every conceivable luxury at your fingertips, worry-free for the rest of your life, sounds appealing but the problem is that he gets lonely and conversation is very limited with an android bartender. After a year of flying solo he is on the verge of flushing himself into the cosmos, when suddenly he becomes obsessed with sleeping beauty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and believes he has found true love.Of course true love is never that simple. He first must grapple with the moral horrors of his predicament: does let her sleep in peace for another 90 years so she can live in paradise with the 4,998 other passengers or does he do what the male species has been known to do sometimes and wake her up for some fun. The film trailers make the answer obvious, but when Aurora finds out that Jim was being selfish, she throws a galactic hissy-fit and the film turns into a domestic melodrama with more flashing stars than outer space. She refuses his every advance until the spaceship's gizmos turn wobbly. Forget feminism: a girl needs a guy when things get toughbut let's not go there.All the potential evident in the early part of the film is frittered away in a silly 'romance on the rocks' space opera, where it becomes a philosophical debate on which gender is capable of the greater quantum of selfishness. Pratt and Lawrence are really quite watchable in spite of the script, the filming is very entertaining, and the whole love scenario would have been interesting in someone's earthly kitchen but not on the most advanced galactic odyssey ever undertaken. But if you enjoy turbulent romance in unusual places this is your film.AUTHOR: www.cinemusefilms.com",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Finally real thought provoking sci-fi, not just non-stop action","I finally viewed this film I remember being intrigued by the previews when it first came out, I never did get a around to watching it till late last night, it kept me up till 2am, and that's meaningful, I'm usually out by 11:30 pm :). I've been a big sci-fi fan since I was a boy, seems like in recent years most sci-fi movies I see are in your face non-stop action and more often than not superheroes ... seemingly the more of these elements the better people like it, I'm tired of that. This film was not one of those, it was refreshing to view and held my interest, I found it well acted, thought provoking, romantic, and intelligent with just the right amount of action. The ending was also very satisfying. I highly recommend this movie to all those who love real sci-fi and not just action films. I rate it 8 out of 10 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
Very good. I would have been fine with it going even longer,"Even at two hours I felt it was just a little too rushed. I understand the caution with making it run too long but it felt like an extra half hour would have gone a long way to show the significant length of time the characters spent in such solitude. They did a good job of it but a few extra minutes could have been well spent to create the feeling of loneliness first of just Jim and then both Jim and Aurora. I did feel the chemistry between Chris Pratt as Jim and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora was extremely convincing. Both actors put forth very convincing and enjoyable performances, not to mention an excellent however brief appearance by Laurence Fishburne. The tension was well played throughout the film both between the characters and with external events. However some of the emotion seemed to be cut short where I felt it needed to linger just a little longer in several scenes and series of scenes particularly later in the film. They also needed to spend just a little more time with the two of them at the end. It felt like they just ran out of time filming and had to end it right away. Overall a very enjoyable film that could even be extended further. This could possibly make for a good directors cut in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not quite a sci-fi classic, but good fun","'Passengers' is an interesting sci-fi film, in that it doesn't involve aliens in any way! It has more in common with 'WALL-E', than it does with 'Alien' or 'Event Horizon', as it follows the spaceship Avalon (cool helix design, basically a giant cruise ship) on its way to Homestead II, starting a new colony 120 years from Earth. It's approximately 30min of 'Cast Away' (man trapped alone), 45min of love story and then 40min of 'Deepwater Horizon' (survival film)! No time period is given, but I assume it's ~100 years in the future.What works well is the casting - two boring people could not sustain this film, but by casting Hollywood's two best & brightest, it works wonders. Jim (Pratt) is accidentally awoken from his hibernation 90 years early and tries everything to get back to sleep and/or find a solution. Because he's a passenger and not crew, his options are limited. Eventually, Jim wakes up Aurora (Lawrence), which is handled well, and the two of them falling in love is as interesting as the shots of the galaxy outside the windows. Arthur (Sheen) as the android bartender is also a nice touch. The only other person to get some screen time near the end is Gus (Fishburne), who finally figures out what's wrong and kick-starts the final stanza.It's not hard to watch when you have Jennifer Lawrence is a pool - but as well as being extremely attractive, it helps that both her and Pratt are very charismatic and able to carry out the tender moments and the exciting ones. The shots of the ship in motion and the galaxy in the background are fantastic, and while a bit of it is predictable, it's a decent ride. Solid ending too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could have become a new modern classic,"This slick and extremely atmospheric sci-fi yarn is directed with more consideration for the filmatic and literary science fiction tradition, or should I say nostalgia, than for the heavy moral and existential questions the script raises. The plot: A starship headed for the earth-like planet Homestead II with 5,000 hibernated colonists from earth crashes into an asteroid field and suffers unknown damages that causes one of the hibernation pods to malfunction, waking up one of the passengers, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) after only 30 years of the 120 year long journey. He can roam the premises and use the ship's facilities, including befriending the android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen), but he cannot reactivate his pod, and he faces no other prospect than living out his life alone on the ship. That is, until he discovers a passenger named Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence).During the first third of Passengers, our inevitable questions around Jim's situation are heard and treated with respect by the filmmakers; we get to experience his alternating loneliness, wonder, desperation, and small glimpses of hope as he works in high-gear to fully assess his situation and what he is able to do about it. The film portrays quite effectively how one would go through different phases of despair before finally coming to terms with one's destiny. And the starship Avalon is among the most attractive and best-established in movie history - you really get the spatial feel of the ship. Unfortunately, Passengers gradually starts losing focus and finds itself Hollywoodized as Jim turns his attention to Aurora Lane. And don't get me wrong, this is not the Aurora character or Jennifer Lawrence's fault, but rather director Morten Tyldum's inability to keep his direction clean and unsullied by shortcuts and romanticized notions. The ethical dilemmas raised by the protagonists' choices are discussed and help keep the film constantly interesting, but they are eventually brushed aside by far too standardized hyperbole action which not only replaces, but also threatens to negate the far more interesting and authentic observational style established in the film's first part, effectively ruining any chance Passengers had of becoming a new modern classic. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence both do well with their parts when Tyldum lets them, but Lawrence's part is too restricted, and Pratt doesn't have the presence to single-handedly save the film from its partial self-destruction towards the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visual Candy,"Must be seen big screen - or at least a really big screen in your man cave. Great sci-fi and sets. More plot holes than Swiss cheese. People have pointed out the science nonsense, so I won't, but there is lots. Just suspend (everything) and enjoy. I read that Jennifer Lawrence made almost twice as much as Chris Pratt. She earned that percentage. When he sticks to action, like Jurassic World, it works. Here, he has to act and justify his emotional reactions... nope. Odd staring passes for acting I guess. To me he came off more as a stalker or just creepy than as a hero. It doesn't matter that his selfish choices turned out to be irrelevant in the end.Plot: 5200 people on a 120 year suspended animation flight to colonize a new planet. Two wake up.

The hidden story of Passengers Movie.,"This article tackles the hidden approaches of the movie:Aurora and Jim are a representation of Adam and Eve. In the first scene there is no one but Jim as if when the god created Adam alone. and tells the story that no one can lives alone and show how human can be selfish concerning himself though followed his instinct of needing someone next to him. (life purpose) the movie expose the issue of robot life, and shows a relationship with a robot and gives an impression of useless communication concerning emotions because after a while Jim go mad and couldn't stand the life alone. The theme is seemed to be Utopian because the setting of the movie is no where, in the middle of an unknown galaxy. everything looked fine and perfect before something comes and breaks the the normality.

"Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian and another nice space movie","Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian. These are all great outer space movies made in last couple of years. They were all nominated for Oscars and I wouldn't be surprised if even the newest space theme movie Passengers would receive a nomination for best achievement in visual effects. They are just stunning. But definitely no other nominations would be deserved.The movies runs for 2 hours but in reality something is happening only in last 30 minutes. Everything else is much more like a space travel documentary. But a really good one. There is not much action or dialogue but it still manages to entertain you and I enjoyed every minute of it.

Unexpectedly brilliant,"If you ask the question ""What is Sci-Fi ?"", you'll get several answers depending on the age and personalities of the people you ask. It is a genre that is continually changing, morphing to the social comment that the influential collective is thinking about at the moment.In the '60s it was all about exploration; short skirts, heavy hairdo's and quick witted, plucky captains. It went through the drugged '70s, the business '80s, the internet connected '90s and the opinionated 2K's to the current ""let's do it better than before"", with retries (called ""re-imaginings"", LOL) in film of everything Sci-Fi.I was expecting the same formulaic ""let's tell an old story again"" attitude in this film but found something else completely. It is an assembly of the best parts of all the eras, not only in Sci-Fi but also in other genres; a seamless mash-up of drama, suspense, romance and , of course, Sci-Fi, created by a mastermind and executed by a talented team.I would recommend this film as it proved to me that something new can be made from parts of something old - and it can be brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
If they were divorced couples,"The movie's script can be better, if changed to this plot：The man in the spacecraft was accidentally awakened, who had been divorced for some reason. However, he awakened his ex-wife due to loneliness and refused feelings. after all, It is about 88 years that the whole journey need to take to the destination, which is equal to ruin the woman's life. Because of the past contradictions, they were quarreling and fighting with each other. At the time when calming down, they were considering whether to wake up their two 10-year-olds. Then the problem arose. Waking them up, it is would equal to the destruction of two children's life. When they will be in adulthood, the two children may hate their parents in the spacecraft over their lives. Not waking them up, the two children may hate their parents because parents did not wake them during the journey and other children go to their homes in new world. This situation has risen to the philosophical choice, which needs the parents to choose. After solving the problem, this movie can follow the original script to carried out.If this 90-year journey is really to achieve, I suggest the system of rotation。During the whole journey, no one control the spacecraft when the crew has been hibernating. This situation is not consistent with common sense. If the entire spacecraft is fully automatic running, it would possibly have no way to automatically repair itself when errors occurred. In this case, the spacecraft should have been arranged to take turns on duty staff. For example, 10 crew members are on duty in each decade when the rest of the crew are hibernating. When this 10 years' job is over, the 10 crew members must return to the cabin aiming to hibernation. At the time, the other 10 crews will be on duty.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Entertainment that even leaves you thinking about it,The premise on which this movie is build on is rather interesting. But after watching the trailer I just thought that this would be like any other action Blockbuster. Yes you have your action sequence at the end and yes some parts of the story are very predictable. BUT! Not all of them. I was totally taken aback by one major plot twist. I won't say anything more because I want to keep this review spoiler free. But this movie has got so much more depth than you might expect from the Trailer. Sadly the movie casts this over board a little bit to quickly in exchange for a action climax with happy ending. Which fits perfectly in the story line and all but it just gets very predictable. Thats why there are two stars missing. I think its unnecessary to say that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do a real good job keeping you interested in everything that's going on between the two. Perfect Chemnistry.My Fazit: Go watch it. Not a masterpiece but sometimes all you need is good entertainment and that's what you get.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Was he right? Discuss amongst yourselves.You shouldn't have even paused. Of course he was completely wrong. If this were a true life situation he would be prosecuted.That would kill off the story, though. What's wrong for Jim, is right for the plot. How things work out is what the movie's about.If you enjoy a good space thriller, you are certain to like this one.

Only that the spacecraft won't hit a banal iceberg and those two turtledoves won't be standing on the bow of the ship while embracing each other intimately with a cosmic wind rustles through their hair. Or maybe a modern version of ""Loveboat"" (only the dwarf dressed up in a futuristic garb is missing). All in all the romantic drool section wasn't such a big of a deal. And to my surprise it was more a visual SciFi spectacle than a love story about two remaining passengers spending the rest of their days on a luxurious spacecraft.To be honest, the first part was both fascinating and wonderfully humorous. The spaceship looked impressive. The first images of the huge dormitory where all pods are standing in which thousands of passengers are sleeping an artificial sleep, were mind blowing. They are on their way, along with a few hundred crew members, to a better place to found a new colony. When a comet storm throws a spanner in the works, it's Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) who first wakes up. Unfortunately for him it'll still take 90 years before they reach their final destination. That's the beginning of the more humorous part. Not high quality humor, but still good enough for a few chuckle moments. The way Jim spends his free time and his entertaining conversations with Arthur (Michael Sheen), a robotic bartender, provide some funny moments. And all this takes place in beautifully constructed sets and breathtaking interiors. One thing is certain, they spared no expense when designing this gigantic spaceship.Of course, gradually the excitement disappears and is replaced by a more profound atmosphere, wherein feelings of loneliness surface and doubts arise about the meaning of a further solitary existence. Time to provide Jim with a feminine counterbalance. That's when Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) enters the scene. In terms of good looks, both of them belong together Tinder-wise. Them having beautiful children is written in the stars. Well, this is the beginning of the romantic chapter in which both start to scan each other meticulously and carefully, start to know each other better and finally in terms of intimacy are a perfect match. Despite my fear, the romance part remained fairly limited. The only thing I noticed is that Jennifer Lawrence hasn't only grown what acting concerns. Either there were some hormonal changes or there has been a medical intervention. Something I noticed immediately. However, her acting part was rather limited. It seemed as if they gave Jim the most sensual female toy from the entire crew. Of course an obligated pool scene had to be included I guess. Although, it looked extremely spectacular (and no I'm not talking about the feminine curves of J. Lawrence) due to a malfunctioning artificial gravity.And then it's time to start the action-packed part with also a short performance by Laurence Fishburne and some impressive CGI sequences. Sometimes it made me think of ""Gravity"" and ""The Martian"", but that didn't really bother me. You see, it's kind of a mixture of different genres. The most vulnerable part of the film is the limited cast (ultimately it's only Jim and Aurora you'll see). To be honest, nothing wrong can be said about their performances and indeed there's a chemistry between the two protagonists. The only thing I was disappointed about is the way the moral issue is swept under the table in a cheap and easy way. The moment this became a problematic and delicate subject, they increased the action and it disappeared into the background. What a shame because this moral issue was more interesting than the clichéd action section. Would he have done this to me, I would have kicked his ass into infinite space for sure. But despite this chapter full of moderate, predictable action and a romanticized ending, this movie appealed to me. I'm glad I didn't wait to see it on the small screen, but now I could enjoy its greatness in the cinema. And no, I'm not talking about J. Lawrence again!More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Half baked science fiction so thoughtlessly conceived people understood something was wrong even if they couldn't articulate it.,"Nothing about this film makes sense and that undermines any story they were trying to tell. A 120 year one way journey brings up all sorts of questions, and instead they fixate on the dumbest one. The conceit is that the main character of the mechanic is paying his way to a new colony through his indentured servitude. His skills 120 years out of date by the time he arrives, what corporate waits 120 years for a return, let alone 240 years for their ship to return home with what exactly to pay for this? Space taxes? A 240 year old ship would be obsolete scrap making the round trip pointless. Every crew member on that ship may as well exist outside of normal time, returning home to everyone they know being dead for 240 years at a time, their skills also being 240 years out of date, how are they to continue in their careers. They further dig the hole into self defeating absurdity by demonstrating they have AI on the level of having moral concerns, able to deceive when necessary, and this is what they install on a nothing bot, this level of tech renders the entire crew obsolete, and makes the empty ship unable to interact or help him all the more absurd. Nothing about this world they constructed makes sense, people may have not been able to articulate it, but they felt it. It deserves the low rating it got. I mean seriously, why would anyone build a luxury cruise liner level ship for vacations where if you ever got home everyone you know would be long dead. It was a goodbye forever ship, and they turned it into a silly Jennifer Lawrence vehicle.
It kind of says everything that the mainstream media reviewers fixated on the silly politics of ""wage gaps"" rather than the massive holes in the plot and just overall botched conception of the future when discussing this film. It could have been fixed so easily, just make them space Mormons, now they have a motivation which makes sense, and a moral and spiritual conflict to explore. Instead they took the easy route and explored nothing.",,Anonymous,Romance
A love story in space that is based on classic ideas of romance - refreshing in today's times,"This love story in space plays a lot with melancholy thoughts, but does not forget, like Christopher Nolan's cold, inflated film ""Interstellar"", that it is humanity that people are looking for in the cinematic art form. It is refreshing to see how love plays the leading role in this film and not ecological martyrdom or cold-blooded obsession with technology. Quietly and often in impressive images, a love story is told here that defies all adversities - and with this the film hits the mark of classic cinematic romance. The acting is really good, not Oscar-worthy, but really good. All in all, some things are a bit predictable and of course the plot could have had completely different, more dramatic or gloomy outcomes, but that should not be a point of criticism here - because in times of hedonistic enjoyment of isolation stories, a happy ending is like in this film, but really refreshing and welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I really enjoyed watching,"An entertaining but somewhat sentimental romantic sci-fi drama about two people (Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt).There are plenty of sci-fi movies featuring in space but this one is different. There are no complications of wars between galaxies or superheroes in space. Instead, it's simply about a man and a woman bound by helplessness and hope.If you wanna see a fantasy love story movie in space, then you must watch this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Evokes a sense of real fear, not manufactured horror","Maybe it's because this movie was talked down so much, but I enjoyed Passengers.

About 500 years from now a colony ship takes a 120-year trip to a new land.,"My wife and I watched this movie on DVD from our public library.OK, this is science fiction, a very large space ship designed by movie-makers, and not all the time and speed references add up. Because it is fiction. If that overly bothers anyone they just shouldn't watch the movie.But it is more a human interest ""what would you do?"" theme, and after we see what they did what do we think of it? In the grand scheme of humanity, human relations, and right vs wrong in a poorly defined situation.According to the filmmakers this takes place about 500 years in the future, the Earth is overcrowded, a company has started colonizing new worlds. In this story a ship of 258 crew members and 5000 passengers are placed in a hibernation mode for the totally automatic 120-year trip at about half the speed of light. To a world about 60 light years away. That makes back-and-forth communication impractical.An unexpected incident occurs, one passenger, a man, is awakened after only 30 years. He quickly realizes that he is still 90 years away from the destination, he won't live that long. Should he wake up someone else so that he will have company? Of course doing so would short-circuit all her plans and in essence deliver a death sentence. What is the moral thing to do?Jennifer Lawrence is the female as Aurora Lane and the male is Chris Pratt as Jim Preston. The third main character is Michael Sheen as the andriod Arthur who also happens to be the bartender. He doesn't judge, he just serves the drinks and dispenses friendly bartender advice.We enjoyed it, one of the more entertaining movies we have seen recently. The set designs and special effects, as well as the soundtrack, are really great too.",,Anonymous,Romance
Love Story...in space????,"The critics are just wrong when it comes to Passengers. It's not action filled or has a plethora of alienswhat is does have is a unique love story and a moral dilemma. Of course it IS essentially a love story but it is set in space. Chris Pratt is Jim, one of the 5000 passengers on a giant spaceship traveling to a distant new colony that will take 120 years. His sleeping pod malfunctions and he wakes up 90 years too soon. He finds out that he can't go back into suspended animation.so what is he to do? I won't go into details so as not to spoil the story. What I will say is that the critics are wrong: go see for yourself. The visuals are stunning and the acting is quite awesome. Of course you have the gorgeous and talented Jennifer Lawrence and the always adorable Chris Pratt as the two leads.....and Michael Sheen as the bartender is quite entertaining! I really enjoyed this film and I would tell people to just take a chance and go see it.it's more than a love story. What would you do if you were in Jim's place?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Strengths and weaknesses,"The movie is entertaining with an interesting and rare setting. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is compelling, though the resolution feels somewhat underwhelming.The cast delivers solid performances, as you'd expect, but nothing truly stands out as exceptional. The film boasts impressive special effects, which enhance the visual experience.However, the story has some significant flaws, particularly towards the end. The final act leans on a dramatic twist that has been done many times before, and often better. I would have appreciated more originality to match the unique setting.Beyond the initial moral dilemma, the storyline lacks depth and coherence. The focus on the relationship between the two main characters is the film's strongest aspect and where it shines most.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loneliness & Living the life you have - A great little Sci-Fi Gem,"Passengers is a Science Fiction Film with a small cast but some big questions. Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston, a Passenger on the Star ship Avalon on it's way to a new world with 5000 odd people looking for a new life away from Earth. Unfortunately, the ship encounters a large meteor storm which damages it's reactor and things start to go wrong. Jim Preston's pod malfunctions - waking him 90 years TOO EARLY. He is not able to go back into stasis, so finds himself wandering a huge ship, totally alone, knowing that he may spend the rest of his life in this position. With only an Android Barman for company (an excellent Michael Sheen) Preston slowly becomes obsessed with a fellow Passenger - Aurora - played by the always watchable Jennifer Lawrence. He COULD wake her also BUT SHOULD he?? She would then also be stuck in the same dire predicament? The morals and decisions made are always questionable but Preston's longing for a REAL human to interact with overcomes his deep knowledge that what he is doing is so wrong.The Film is much more a study of the characters - the two leads having a romance that is charming but also - for the audience - leaving questions - would the obviously high-flying educated Aurora in other circumstances even notice Jim Preston at all?The second half of the film introduces Gus - Laurence Fishburne - a crewmember whose pod has also failed and who now finds that the damage to the ship will soon become fatal - unless he and the two Passengers can fix the problem..
The two leads are extremely engaging, especially Lawrence whose outrage at learning she was deliberately awakened is palpable. Pratt is also good and having to challenge himself more as an actor than usual.The Special effects are beautifully done and the sheer magnificence of the cosmos along with the design of the Avalon make for a very satisfying visual palette.Having read some critical Reviews before watching this film, I am beginning to understand why many people are turning their backs on so-called Film Critics. In this instance I found their Reviews misleading, badly thought out and ultimately unrepresentative of what Passengers is all about.For people who like Science Fiction but want a more human and personal story, Passengers is for you. A tiny but great Cast will take you on this journey which I found very uplifting.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Sci-Fi story.,"So if I was suddenly awoken from hyper sleep 90 years before my journey was complete and had no way to get back to sleep and I was stuck on the ship alone with Jenifer Lawrence to keep me company, that would not be the worse case scenario.Chris Pratt definitely agrees as he plays Jim who was put in that situation as a bit of a nod to the film Silent Running, as he wakes up all alone and attempts to get back into hyper sleep with all his failures leading to depression, until a bar tender gives him the advice of taking advantage of his situation on the ultimate star ship cruse liner by tempering with some functions to upgrade his room stay and some other perks, which I think loosened him up a bit to make a decision most lonely men in his situation would most likely do.It is a very inactive Sci-Fi film that actually test the charm of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as with the exception of a few scenes from Micheal Shannon as a robot bartender and Lawrence Fishbure as a crew member awoken on a glitch, it's pretty much those two for almost Two hours. Though I think I preferred watching Matt Damon for that length of time stranded on Mars, Chris Pratt is very likable, and I have to be honest J-Law is very cute. I could not even tell you if I liked her character or not all I could tell you is that there were moments when she looked crazy hot and in those moments it enhanced my like of Chris Pratt's character whose lucky enough to be stranded with her.It was a beautifully made Sci-Fi film with the visual effects creating an amazing ship.While the film does explore some interesting ideas in Sci-Fi it's mostly done with talk, which is ironic as the movie looks like it cost a lot and there is far too much talk for it to cost that much dough.Had great potential to be a great Sci-Fi film (and get people kissing it's booty like they are Arrival) but your love of the movie does fully count on how much you like Pratt and Lawrencehttp://cinemagardens.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance?,"Romance? Stalking, kidnapping, attempted murder leavened with some romantic Stockholm Syndrome. Nice ship and a few effective exterior scenes. Otherwise essentially a silly business culminating in fancy FX footwork and a 'Perils of Pauline' resolution. ""Winter's Bone"" is still Jennifer Lawrence's high point for me and now that she has become a glamorpuss, deservedly, I keep wanting to fault her for being too pretty to be a good actress, but I can't. She hasn't proved it yet. Here, as usual, she delivers. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, has no weight, gravity or not. He delivers cotton candy. The tactic of casting 'pretty and popular' was only 50% successful.Notice how good Laurence Fishburne was? Imagine if it had been he that woke her up. Yeah, creepy, I know, but it would have been much deeper. And I would have cared, instead of wishing some 'eat 'em one by one' alien would've shown up.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A pleasant sci-fi that suggests more than it broadcasts.,"""You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are."" Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence)Where they are in Passengers is almost to the end of years of suspended animation getting to a planet that will receive a second settlement of 5,000 travelers. The real interest of this pleasant and interesting sci-fi is in the romance of two travelers awakening too soon from their animation (Aurora, played by Jennifer Lawrence, and Jim by Chris Pratt).After the audience struggles with his arguably unethical decision to awaken her, the usual sci-fi tropes kick in about the strategies to avoid boredom, to avoid damage to the ship, and to avoid romantic complications. Of course, one look at the out-of-this-world -attractive principals, and you know the romantic part will be a certainty.The more interesting challenge of beating boredom for 90 or so years is the decisions that determine how the years will go, such as constantly assessing the outcome and working to subvert it by taking over command of the self-propelling ship. Along the way the two befriend an android bartender, Arthur, played smoothly and ingratiatingly by so-cool Michael Sheen, confirming the intent of the film to scrutinize humanity in a microcosm rather than technology. Even the bot has human-like attributes.Yes, the movie may rely too heavily on the romance, as some critics have pointed out, ignoring the rich thematic possibilities of monogamy. Because the heroes rely on themselves completely, a case seems also to be made by writer Jon Spaihts for the virtue of a couple's isolation in the pursuit of happiness.These possibilities are my own speculation because the film itself does not explore them except by inference. Regardless, anyone appreciating the allegories of 2001 and Twilight Zone will be delighted by the rich possibilities of Passengers, albeit with a little work to extract the meanings:""Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed."" ― Stanisław Lem, Solaris",,Anonymous,Romance
Another reason to ignore metascore,"This movie is simple, fun and easy to watch. It provides good time while giving some food to think about. JLaw and Chris Pratt work as a couple.

Not a giant blockbuster space opera,"I'm surprised how harsh the critics have been on this movie. I enjoyed the character development, story and chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence. Some good humor mixed in especially the scenes with Sheen. It is not a giant blockbuster space opera if that is what you are expecting. It exposes the fear and tough choices you might be faced with in a crisis and the human side of interstellar travel.

Beautiful; let down by the marketing,"This movie is an underrated gem that was unfortunately let down by the marketing.I've seen a number of criticisms that the movie is 'boring' and 'nothing happens', and from what I remember the trailers did promise a suspenseful, action-packed sci-fi adventure.That's not what this movie is about.Passengers is a beautiful, slow-paced story about a man who is facing a lifetime of total isolation. It takes its time exploring his desperation, distractions and despair before sidestepping into a love story between two characters who are surprisingly genuine, and who manage to be sympathetic even when they're being immoral.The movie is atmospheric above all else with fantastic acting and a haunting score, but I never felt that it dragged, and I was invested in the story from beginning to end.I'm so glad that I ignored the critics and gave this movie a chance - it's so much better than I expected.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
