Powerful performance by Daniel Day-Lewis,"Gangs of New York was is an epic historical crime movie directed by Martin Scorsese and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Brendon Gleeson, Stephen Graham and Liam Neeson in a special appearance.The movie is a must watch classic which displays the birth of America and yes through bloody violence and brawls.The movie displays the greatnesses of Martin Scorsese and his imagination and scope to take out the best from a simple revenge plot.Acting should be appreciated by all the characters but Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show by his brutal violence in a gentle way.The screenplay of the movie is slow but captivating and hold the viewers. Location of 1840 America is amazing and background music is good. It wouldn't be wrong to say that this is one of the finest piece of work by Martin Scorsese and a must watch for the viewers who like periodic movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Daniel Day-Lewis is just amazing,"It's so true what people say, that Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't act. He *becomes* the characters he portrays. It's simply astounding to see an interview with the soft-spoken, somewhat effeminate actor and then watch him as the terrifying, dominating Butcher in this, or Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Watch Gangs of New York for his performance alone and you won't be disappointed. That isn't to say the story isn't intriguing (it is) or Leo isn't good (he is) but really, Day-Lewis stole the show outright.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Blood Stays on the Knife,"""Gangs of New York"" takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.  Those who felt they were ""native"" Americans did not want immigrants to enter their great country, spawning hatred between groups all over the city where many of them landed.  In the story we see how much of the town is run by one man, with William Cutting (""Bill the Butcher,"" played marvelously by Daniel Day-Lewis) being the most feared and well-respected man of the ""five Points.""Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who as a boy watched Bill the Butcher kill his father in one of the Points' great battles.  Now a grown man, he returns to the Points to find Bill pretty much running the show.  He gets on Bill's good side and eventually becomes his number one man, all the while still plotting for his father's revenge.While there is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore, the film does an excellent job portraying life as it was in New York.  You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you don't need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.I've never been a big DiCaprio fan, but his effort here (along with his performance from ""Catch Me If You Can"") have made my opinion start to waver a little.  He is good as Amsterdam, and believable in his actions and expressions.  Daniel Day-Lewis is simply phenomenal as Bill the Butcher and really should have won the Best Actor Oscar.  Overall, I feel this was the best film of 2002 and really was robbed at the Academy Awards.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrific Entertainment!,"Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas, Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang.It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage `Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic Bill terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody Bill. Amsterdam, however, has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass, all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots.Daniel Day-Lewis is marvelous as Bill the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore, moustache-twirling villain. Day-Lewis strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach Day-Lewis' level is Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed. Broadbent is Tweed's spitting image and he makes the grasping old pirate so winning we find ourselves rooting for Tweed against the gaggle of reformers that infest his domain.  Though Leonardo DiCaprio is the nominal lead of the picture he is overshadowed by his co-stars.  Large, slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking, DiCaprio is physically perfect for Amsterdam.  While he could have used some of the fire and rage of a young James Cagney, DiCaprio's acting is superior throughout the movie. The problem is that Amsterdam just isn't as flashy a role as Bill or Tweed and, as good as DiCaprio is; Day-Lewis operates on a whole other level. Cameron Diaz as the beautiful pickpocket Jenny,  never convinces that she is a product of the slums. Despite having considerable screen time, Diaz fades into the background when compared to her more powerful co-stars.Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen. The amazing old New York set has an air of lived in reality that you could cut with a knife. You can almost smell the vermin. Gangs is entirely free of the embalmed feeling you get from most modern period movies.  The cast handles the period argot as if it were their true speech and wear their costumes like lived-in clothing. You come away convinced that this is how the world looked and sounded in 1862.Scorsese does eschew all nuance and subtlety in Gangs. Instead he tells his tale in wide, bold, exploitive and melodramatic strokes that make the movies two and a half hours fly by. Be warned that if you are waiting to see Gangs on DVD you are making a huge mistake. Gangs has to be seen at the theater. The detail and scope of the film cries out to be viewed in all its wide screen glory.  This movie is a fantastic achievement.",,Anonymous,Crime
"A Great Movie, Worth The Wait","For about three months now, I have (on an almost daily basis) passed a movie theatre not far from my home. On the side of this movie theatre is a huge poster advertising the movie ""Gangs of New York"". Meanwhile, all I heard about on television was the buzz about the upcoming ""Gangs of New York"". So, when this highly publicized movie finally opened, I went and saw it.I went to the theatre, I bought my ticket, I found a seat in a very crowded theatre and I sat. For three hours I sat in that dark theatre and I watched what was one of the most amazing movies I have ever had privilege to see.It is hard to even begin to explain why this movie was amazing, but it was. The way it was shot is brilliant. The cinematography is spectacular. The story is completely enthralling.Although the movie was just shy of three hours long, it was not at all boring to watch. The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end (because, after all, it is a movie based on a true-ish story), it was incredible to watch how it got that end.Above all, the movie was beautiful to watch. I have to admit to those who have not yet seen it that ""Gangs"" is quite violent. However, the violence was well shot and it was fairly necessary to the story.All of the actors put in extremely good performances. Leonardo DiCaprio really proved that he's not just a pretty face and that he does actually have a great deal of talent (which can also be seen in his other movie of the season, ""Catch Me If You Can""). Cameron Diaz' performace also proves that she can do much more than the standard romantic comedy. Also, after hearing reports of Daniel Day Lewis' REALLY getting into his character, I admit that it was completely worth it. His character (William Cutting/Bill the Butcher) is so complex and although you know you hate him, you can't decide why (for there are so many reasons).In conclusion, if you have not seen this movie yet, go. Go now. See it. This is one of the epic movies of our time. I heard that Scorcese has been conceptualizing this movie for over twenty years; I could tell. The story this movie tells is one  that I had never heard and the way in which it was told makes it seem very important for us to know. The message that is conveyed, although not an entirely wholesome one, is an important one to learn and, if considered, is very relevant to our time. However, my only message to you is this: see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Daniel Day-Lewis: Spectacular Performance,"Daniel Day-Lewis elevates this film from just ""good"" to ""very good"" or even ""excellent."" He is absolutely riveting, one of the most interesting ""villains"" I have ever seen on film. I am sorry Day-Lewis didn't win the Academy Award for his performance. He was just outstanding to watch. His facial expressions alone cracked me up!Day-Lewis played ""Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting"" he is one nasty dude. However, there are no real ""good guys"" in this story. The supposed hero, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a revenge-seeking man with a ton of flaws himself. The rest of the characters are either thieves, gang members, corrupt politicians or corrupt policeman. Ah yes, another family-oriented film from that kindly director Martin Scorcese.What Scorcese lacks in family values, he comes close to making up for in style. This is another fascinating visual film with great sets, costumes, color and camera-work. Other typical Scorcese touches are in here: Catholic-bashing and brutal language. (I question whether the f-word was used back in the days this film takes place.)All in all, a tough film that could be too unpleasant to watch but for Lewis' outstanding performance and the spectacular visuals.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Suppressed History Finally Surfaces,"I am a Civil War ""buff,"" so I wanted to see this movie the moment I heard it was being made.  Yes, the New York Draft Riots did happen, just two weeks AFTER the Northern victory at Gettysburg, demonstrating that the outcome of the War was anything but certain, even after Lee had been forced to retreat to the south bank of the Potomac River.  Today, many would find this surprising.The movie did take some license, however.  There was no wholesale firing on civilians by Union soldiers.  In fact, reported deaths after three days of rioting were less than one-hundred.  Many of the dead were randomly selected blacks, who were hanged and mutilated (which was accurately depicted in the film).  Today, many would also find this surprising, because the schools teach that the North was good, and the South was bad.  The truth is that blacks were subjected to inhumane treatment everywhere, especially in the Nothern cities.There was also no firing by offshore naval vessels.  That was artistic license.  (My source for all of the above is a doctoral dissertation that was published about ten years ago titled ""The New York City Draft Riots."")The movie makes the important point that the North had run out of ""home grown"" manpower to fight the South.  Had it not been for Irish and German volunteers through 1863, and black volunteers in 1864, the North would have sued for peace.  The 1864 Democratic Platform promised to bring the War to a swift and speedy conclusion.Bravo to Scorsese for bringing all of this to light.  In the meantime, the movie is about twenty minutes to long.  The brothel scenes, the ""uptown"" scenes, and some of the scenes in the catacombs struck me as slow and superfluous.  On the other hand, the street scenes and the scenes of the random gangs (of which I wish there were more) were glorious.One thing Scorsese left out, however:  The mountains of animal and human waste in the streets!  Not long after his movie was released, the History Channel produced a documentary on the Five Points area, and it is staggering to consider the tons and tons of animal and human waste piling up in the streets, and the thousands of gallons of urine running in the gutters. There were old photos of waste in the streets stacked six feet high. Needless to say, infant mortality in such a fetid environment was about 50%. Scorsese leaves this out, and there is scarcely a horse in the movie.Day-Lewis does a superb job with a character that is unevenly developed.  He is a homicidal thug in the beginning, a menacing, but somewhat benign, presence in the middle, and a psychotic killer in the end.  It isn't really clear why he vacillates the way he does.  Bi-polar, I guess.  DiCaprio proves he can act, and he exudes a manliness he did not possess in earlier films.  Diaz turns in a creditable performance.  The cast of thousands adds a nice touch to the film.I would never say this is a ""great"" film, but it certainly is worth a look. Kudos to Scorsese for the herculean effort, and a tip of the kepi for the poetic ending, which reminded me of the ending in 1936's ""San Francisco.""",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gangs Of New York A Solid Action Crime Drama,"Gangs Of New York is a solid action crime drama from director Martin Scorcese who continues to show his skill as a filmmaker with this film. The cast are admirable in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon a man seeking revenge against the one who killed his father. DiCaprio may not have the flashier role like Day Lewis but he's still believable as the hero bringing that intensity he's been know for to the character. Daniel Day Lewis gives a knock out performance as Billy ""The Butcher"" Cutting a psychotic gangland kingpin who killed Amsterdams father. Day Lewis is terrific in the role of a man whose willing to kill anyone without hesitation. The people are either with him or against him there is no middle ground. Cameron Diaz is good as Jenny Everdeane a woman willing to do almost anything to survive and a potential love interest for DiCaprio's Amsterdam. John C Reilly, Jim Broadbent, Bredan Gleason, Henry Thomas, and a brief appearance by Liam Neeson are effective as the supporting characters but most of them don't have much to do and aren't in it much either. All of them still turn in solid performances none the less in their limited screen time. Most of the movie takes place in New York during 1863 when one of the worst riots in American history took place. The fact that this really did happen gave the movie a realistic fool especially the location where they chose to have this film take place giving audiences a look at what it could've been like back then in New York. The action sequences which mostly involve people getting beat up in brutal ways are well executed especially the riots at the end. The showdown between Amsertdam and Bill was a bit of a letdown but it was fitting for the movie. The film was a bit long with a running time of 167 minutes. The pacing was a little slow at times but the performances by the cast make it worth watching anyway. Despite some flaws Gangs Of New York is still a well made crime drama with enough action, some suspense, a little humor and romance. So if you can get past the long running time Gangs Of New York is definitely worth watching and most of that besides what I already mentioned is because of the exceptional performances (especially Day Lewis and DiCaprio) by the lead actors and the amazing talent of Scorcese who continues to prove himself as a gifted filmmaker with this movie. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""It's a funny feeling being taken under the wings of a dragon  it's warmer than you think.""","So narrates Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) standing by the boss Bill the Butcher's side (Daniel Day-Lewis) at the height of his hard-boiled reign over New York City in the mid-1800's. Amsterdam saw the Butcher brutally kill his father in a gang-war when he was just a little boy, and he's sworn revenge ever since. But in order to get his vengeance, he must infiltrate the Butcher's gang, and ends up becoming something of a son to him.That ""Gangs of New York"" is such a good film is a mystery because it breaks the fundamental rule of good film-making: you have to care for the central character, and DiCaprio's Amsterdam is an unlikeable young man. He is surly and unkind, walking around in a bubble of hesitation and scattered thoughts of revenge. He moodily snarls at the one woman he likes (Cameron Diaz). It is inconceivable how someone as dynamic, likable and strong as the Butcher would ever take this brat in, but that's film for you.The above is an unfortunate miss; the lead character has to be strong or else the film will weigh him down. Juxtaposing Dicaprio with Day-Lewis has got to be the worst idea that's ever popped into Scorsese's mind because it is evident within minutes of the film that they are of very different acting fibre and the former will look even WORSE when paired with one of the best working actors in the world today. But these are mere casting flaws (but still harmful), so onto the overall direction:A friend of mine once said that Martin Scorsese is only capable of half a film before it turns into a mess and that stuck with me when I watched ""Gangs of New York"", because it was true. This is a relatively straightforward story of revenge but it is diluted by detours in Irish traditions  there's singing, dancing, bareknuckled fighting, drinking and debauchery--for 2 and a half hours. These detours may be well sewn-together by a patient Scorsese narrative flow (I'm thinking ""Casino"") told by Amsterdam, but is unnecessary to go to such lengths to get the Irish-immigrant setting and mood. We already got it, so move on and give us more substance.However it cannot be denied that many of these detours make the film and setting  they are beautifully illustrated by lush colours that seem to bleed off screenprimary colours to suit primary, instinct-driven and hard-boiled men. The cinematography is just staggering. New York City is gritty, corrupt, bloody and bare-knuckled. I mean, I have seen Tarantino, Stone, Kramer and Cronenberg but this is by far the most violent and gory film I have ever watched. Such poignant, effective fights.It is a shame the rest of the film is not as poignant, but desperately diluted. What saves it is Day-Lewis' magnificent presence on-screen as the brutal Butcher Bill, the occasional portrayals of gang-culture and the almost all-star ensemble cast that pop up in supporting roles throughout. A good film (just barely), but nothing more. ""7"" may be too generous, but hey...7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Intense, disturbing and powerful","Well, I just got back from seeing ""Gangs of New York"" at the theater, and I have many positive things to say about this film.  It's easily the most powerful film I've seen this year, even topping the excellent ""White Oleander"".  I have never seen a film portray poverty in the 1800's as well as this film did.  It also made me feel like I was there, witnessing the poverty and brutality.  It's a film that makes us be thankful that times like those have passed, and for us not to forget those who lived and died during those times.  It's also a film that's not afraid to show war in its total uglyness.  Martin Scorsese definately got his point across with this film, but he didn't do it alone.  The cast were all excellent in their parts, no bad acting here at all.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz showed they are more than just pretty faces.  Daniel Day-Lewis was magnificent as ""The Butcher"", a character whom you want to both love and hate.  Quite simply the best film I've seen all year, and I hope it will get nominated (and win) many Oscars.  Even if it doesn't, it's a true winner in my eyes. Nice to see that Hollywood can actually do something useful with a $100million budget for once.  This was playing at the theater the same time as ""The Two Towers""... unfortunately, most of the people in the long line-up went to see ""TTT""... they sure missed out, since GONY has more to say in the first 10 minutes than LOTR has to say over 3 hours.  Although this film is rather long (2 hrs 47 mins), I was so provoked by it that the time flew by. ""Gangs of New York""....

Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash.,"""Gangs of New York"" mixes real American history with a weak fictional human drama and a thick coat of Hollywoodization resulting in an over wrought behemoth wannabe epic misfire. Scorcese pulls together bits and pieces of the Civil War  conscription act, Irish potato famine immigration, Tammany Hall  and Tweed corruption, race/slave issues, slum gangs, etc. and creates a milieu which has an off-target post-apocalyptic sort of feel and then tries to cram DiCaprio down our throats as a hero though he does nothing particularly heroic in the context of the film. The flick features blood and guts street riots reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", a romance which doesn't work, an evil guy over acted by Day-Lewis and little else save a whole bunch of filler to give us a taste of the times and milk the extravagance for all its worth. In spite of all that, ""Gangs..."" received several Oscar noms and a thumb and a half up from critical corners with so-so approval from the public. Okay for fans of the principals and others into Hollywood blockbusters. Not for the jaded or those looking for substance or sophistication. (B)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"NOT A MASTERPIECE, BUT A GREAT 'HEAVY' FILM...","For all its' Uber-violence, 'Gangs of New York' is a majestic piece of filmmaking. Director Martin Scorcese reunites once again with Editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Production Designer Dante Ferretti thusly recreating a potion of a country's history spectacled with infestation, disease and rampant violence. These are but some of the characteristics employed in an unconventional manner in hopes of telling a memorable story. Scorcese displays to the filmmaking world how imaginative he can be with his long overdue, epic and costly motion picture based upon a time in New York City's history where violence was not sporadic, but a necessity for survival. Set directly in New York's Five Points District, on a micro scale the film tells the vengeful story of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio), a young man who returns 16 years after being banished from Five Points after witnessing his father's defeat at the hands of a vicious rival known as Bill The Butcher; infamous for his fixation with the meats and his innate sense of slaughterous murder. Upon Amsterdam's return, he has but one aim  - avenge his father's death at the hands of the vicious 'community leader' William Cutting,, a.k.a. Bill The Butcher. Cutting prides himself as being a sadistic and remorseless thug who surrounds himself with the filth of the community in order to profit himself and his political allies. Daniel Day Lewis comes out of seclusion for a craft he apparently dislikes and simply nails this performance as a sophisticated and well-spoken murderer who has no parameters nor morals to bound him. He fights for the Yankee Way and opposes anyone who threatens the American lifestyle.On a macro scale, the story is a piece of American history as it recreates the arduous battles commenced in 1846 between the Irish settlers and the Anglo- Saxon 'natives' who sought to protect their country against foreigners. In all of this, the draft riots are explicitly revealed as those who chose not to fight were sought out and forced to. At one point, the film effortlessly demonstrates how immigrants were drafted right off the boats as they had a suitcase from a foreign country one moment, and an American Uniform the next practically unable to speak the English language, yet ready to wage war against an unknown enemy.  The draft riot scene is a pivotal sequence in the film as it prepares the anti-climactic finale in which more violence and an astonishing amount of blood are spilled over the original streets of New York.  This film makes every effort in highlighting what the term 'gang' means as it has undergone various permutations in definition. The original story by Jay Cocks (The Age of Innocence) has been filtered by Kenneth Lonergan (Analyze This) and Steven Zaillan (Hannibal) and contains the conventional pratfalls of Hollywood Cinema such as double crosses and plot twists, yet they are thankfully kept to a minimal.  The story retains its core not so much on the development of the characters, but on the development of the times and interestingly enough, the interplay between Bill The Butcher and his rival Priest Vallon was stressed. Despite their differences and years after Priest's death, The Butcher still honored and celebrated his life. Sharing the same values and only divided by faith, honor was still a trait some had amidst all the ruins. Throughout all this lies an ingenious film in which Scorcese allows his characters to develop and evolve, as the film is a delicate piece of cinema balanced against a sensitive subject matter and directed with the utmost class and originality. Production Designer Dante Ferretti recreates the filth-infested streets and deplorable living conditions as poverty, decay, infestation and paucity are not spared in order to retell one of the vilest stories in recent memory. Those who are familiar with Scorcese's work will know he is the machine behind such films as 'Casino', 'Goodfellas' and the perennial classics 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull'. Those films are always under constant attack for the apparently amoral manner in which they exude violence, and now Scorcese can add the cornerstone of all violent films with 'Gangs of New York'. This is a perversely tempestuous violence-riddled film filled with gore, viciousness and intensity all in good use in order to demonstrate the living conditions when everyone had to sleep with one eye open. The film commences with no opening credits, just the company credits roll as we see Liam Neeson play the character of Priest Vallon, a highly admirable Community leader also fighting for what he believes in, the safety and prosperity of the Irish people based in New York. As the film opens, we see him bestow values upon a young Amsterdam Vallon as an opening battle sequence of epic proportions is mounting. The weapons are being bladed, prayers are being said and families are told goodbye as these warriors will clash on the streets of New York for the right to claim property and ownership of honor amongst thieves. Eerily close to the Brian De Palma School of suspenseful filmmaking, Scorcese seems to take a page from the aforementioned Director as the opening sequence is mounted in a very resourceful manner. Quick editing cuts thanks to Thelma Schoonmaker's hand demonstrate the weapons being sharpened as one tracking camera shot pans through the Dead Rabbits Gang led by Priest Vallon as the increasing volume in music indicates war is near. The camera tracks all the characters as we have been inside from the beginning of the film, and we have been introduced to the poverty and wretchedness of the times in a dark and cold shelter. Then the camera points towards a door and as it opens, all we see is a blanket of white symbolically representing the purity of the war and its' valor, but foreshadowing the red coat of paint about the cover the cobble stoned streets of New York. Phenomenal. That is filmmaking, and as the pace quickens, the war commences as challenges are made, met and the massacre ensues as our film slowly introduces the viewer to the violence as Scorcese aims to condition the viewer - B.F. Skinner style. This is somewhat different than his other outings whereas in both 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' Scorcese boldly introduces ultra-violence without the slightest amount of warning. In this film, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) commences the war immediately as he slices and dices his way through the street enmeshed in a series of direct stab wounds yet no blood, but as he progresses and continues his assault, the knives are introduced as blood soaked, then the puncture wounds are accentuated as he pierces his way through flesh and finally we see his face saturated in the blood of others against the intentionally misplaced musical score of Howard Shore (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy).This sets the tone for a film not aiming to please anyone or to alleviate the discourse of cinematic violence. It recreates a time when violence was rampant and for the purposes of storytelling, the violence quotient was necessary to give justice to the lewdness of the situation. Even women are not spared as Cameron Diaz portrays a charismatic pocket thief named Jennie Everdeane.Despite her romantic engagement with Amsterdam, through her savage beating Scorcese displays no one was spared during the riots from the hands of predatory thieves who were vying to survive. Many have voiced criticism over the lengthy running time, and while many have stated there were segments which could have been trimmed, I disagree. At a running time of approximately two hours and forty minutes, the film recreates a piece of history sought with fragility and values conveyed to the viewer. People would give their lives for this war waged for the rights to claim ownership of NYC and it was of the utmost importance to develop that religious fanaticism closely. The characters in the film resemble heavily wrapped boxes, in which Scorcese allows to be unwrapped a little at a time; all the while he displays his prowess as a Director who astonishes with this film. For it is true the pacing was uneven at times, and the unraveling of the characters could have been sped up. But all of this is intentional in order to evoke a climax which represents their war between the Foreigners and the Anglo-Saxons in a city that had enough of its' riotous ways. While the violence will surely turn off Academy Members, Daniel Day Lewis' performance will not and this film will stand the true test of time as a story so unequivocally told it will remain indelibly etched in viewers minds long after the final sequence.  Transition shots display the evolution of New York City from a point of view of a tombstone nestled right under the Brooklyn Bridge. Cross dissolves start in 1863 and documents the changes from that exact point up until the time the Two Towers of NYC were standing. Perhaps reminding the world despite the progression of mankind, we are still not civilized.Giancarlo's Rating: ***",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fine mess,"A sprawling, brawling mass of characters and ideas that will be remembered more for the hype and history of its production than for the history it depicts.Though the movie's scope and intentions are commendable, there's too much forced intimacy between protagonists and not enough about the actual gangs and how they coexisted (or not, as is the actual case). Love interest Cameron Diaz is only interesting when she's picking pockets, but otherwise an utter waste of time. Sadly, DiCaprio's lack of charisma makes him an unconvincing lead and ultimately scuppers the enterprise.And Daniel Day-Lewis? Oh, he's something else. But I just couldn't take him seriously. His crazy moustache and permanent squint so closely resembled that of Laurel and Hardy regular James Finlayson (who usually played Ollie's father-in-law or similarly cantankerous foil) that I was itching for him to turn to the camera with a well-timed `Doh!'Which neatly sums up Gangs Of New York  a fine mess.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dodgy accents...dodgy acting.,"The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis stands out from what is a seriously flawed movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is seriously miscast,the story is hardly inspiring and the film suffers from problems with continuity. All of the cast look far too well fed and healthy to be the poorest of the poor - and did they really live in subterranean dwellings that look like caves? Scorsese is a great director but his preoccupation with the low life seems morally repugnant here. Historical accuracy goes out the window as the gang members are portrayed in a semi-heroic light. The love interest grafted on in the shape of Cameron Diaz is pathetic. A lot of praise has been heaped on the film's attention to period detail and there are indeed some interesting observations - I particularly liked the 'Allsorts' barrel in the bar wherein all the slops are thrown to provide a cheap drink. However it was impossible to avoid the impression that you were simply watching a crowd of  extras parading around a large film set in period costume. Every scene was laid on with a trowel.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
He actually did it!,"You'd think Scorcese has bitten a bit more than he could possibly chew, this time. Well, he didn't. Gangs of new York is not an ""epic masterpiece"" and it ain't that because I seriously doubt the directors aim was that. It's a great movie in it's own account, but you have to watch it in the right way.The plot: Tight enough and well paced, with a couple of lows (expected for a three-hour film) but generally it comes out pretty neat. Some may find it disturbing, as it contains extreme violence and it does not portray an America of happy workers, even happier slaves, benevolent rich and just authorities - instead, it portraits the true 1860 society. Definitely not for those who like their films with plenty of sugar on the top.The epic and the drama: Well, basically the film is the story of two men. Around them things evolve and a brave new world comes forth - but we only get to watch snapshots of that world. Until the last sequence, that is when the whole city ""explodes"" (in some occasions literally...) and the streets are being covered in blood, and the two aspects (the main story and the events of the era) are being tied together in the same continuum.At the same time, the director attempts to portrait the whole birth and growth of the United States, in a kind of parabole, but without loosing his focus on the main story and the surrounding. Scorsese dives deeply into the psychology of his heroes, without giving out any explanation of their acts other than the probable - he lets us figure it out ourselves, and that's a God-given gift.The visuals: The film is disturbing, as it contains extreme violence. There are literally streams of blood, hacking, slashing, crushing - even some action movie fans (hey dude, look, he smashed his head with that thing... cool, man!"") might find some parts of the film interesting. The last sequence is visually astounding, and it's by it's own account a reason to watch this film over and over again... if you got the stomach to actually cope with the disturbing images, that is.The actors: I didn't think it would come a day when I'd say that Leo Di Caprio can act, but ...here I go: The kid can act. And quite good too. Guess he needed a Scorsese to put him in the right path. Same with Cameron Diaz - she has got some potential, seems so. Too bad she wastes it in films like ""the sweetest thing"" and other throw-ups like that. And... Daniel Day Lewis. Truly, with this performance, they should give him the Academy award. He portrays the vile ""Butcher"" in a way few would be able of, and he adds depth to a character that could very easily end up ""two-dimensional"". He is stunningly good.New York, New York: Scorsese gets involved in something that compares to his previous work the way a fancy little sports car compares to a huge truck: A grandioso film of epic proportions and of great ambition. He does deliver, I believe. But this film shall not be acknowledged universally, because there is too much violence, corruption, lack of the good old white vs black (good vs evil, I mean) concept and does not sweeten the pill in any way. It's disturbing and raw, and it's a great. It's not a political film - in such, the director usually picks a stance, a ""true"" hero, an opposing view, and builds upon those. In this case, the director is truly endistancemented and keeps that distance, even from his ""hero"". There are no ""good"" people in that movie, all are acting like chess pieces in a predetermined way, but at the same time they try to burst out and do their own.The verdict: A fabulous film, which is going to be recognized for such in some years",,Anonymous,Crime
A selfish indulgence I can't escape,"Gangs of New York is a flawed picture, but oh what a masterfully entertaining flawed picture. Buoyed by the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, and quite possibly one of the greatest villains ever to appear on screen, the movie is a wonderfully detailed, semi-fictional account of New York in the 1860's--when the country was a political hotbed and the people were as ruthlessly dug in and divided as... well, today.DiCaprio is good, and maybe great even. But how would we know? The picture belongs to the Butcher--perhaps DiCaprio's ability to allow the villain to shine as he is and not attempt to steal the spotlight is a credit to the young actor. After all, he's not really the main character--rather, he's the pair of eyes through which we see this complex war-torn, urban society. The main character is Bill Cutting, whose moral, political, and xenophobic complexities mirror the contradictions in all Americans, particularly of that period--though such contradictions have been the subject of American historical fiction for two and a half centuries.Scorsese makes this picture the way it should be made, with caution to the wind and a heart bursting with vivid imagination that can be seen in every nook and cranny of the massive Five Points neighborhood on screen. He indulges in every turn to fill the film with multiple thematic elements, running at once both concurrent and in contradiction to one another. This creates a film that many people are uncomfortable with because let's face it: with all this going on, where's the plot? I think the plot, fragile as it is, only exists to deliver this world and its characters for us to observe, consume, and relish in. I certainly do. For all of its mistakes, it is a film I continue to watch over and over again, with a fascination I reserve perhaps for only three or four other films I have ever seen.I love this movie, God help me.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't Think of It as History,"There is certainly a lot of carnage. There's also a little confusion as to motivation. However if you don't try to look at this as an accurate portrayal of history and treat it as a bit of a fantasy, it plays quite well. We have wonderful adversaries who posture and primp. It was more of a nineteenth century gangster film (a little Godfather thrown in) and a tribal sort of thing with all the ritual and righteousness. Lets face it, it's just a bit much, including the Hollywood ending. It did remind me a bit of the Kurosawa movies where there is not a spot unbloodied ground left after the battle scenes. Daniel Day-Lewis is charismatic. He is the reason I would watch this movie again. He absolutely eats up every scene he's in. DeCaprio is a bit boring to me. What he represents is a lot more than what he does. Never got into him. Nonetheless, it's big and impressive with great cinematography. Did anything really get settled.

"Not the worst movie I have seen, but it is over-rated","I am the first to admit that I had doubts about this movie before I saw it. Hollywood never does well with a story ""based"" on historical fact. After seeing it, my fears were not allayed, even though the film is shot well and the acting was above average.My main problem is the story itself. New York during the civil war was bad enough without having to embellish the story. Contrary to the theme of this movie, most of the rioting was caused by immigrants who resented the loss of jobs to freed slaves or feared would cause their wages to fall. Most of the violence was against blacks, including the burning of an orphanage and the killing and lynching of any unfortunate black caught on the streets.This is definitely liberal Hollywood's view of history. It may be interesting, but it definitely isn't factual. Also, all the slobbering about how great Daniel Day Lewis is in this character is over-rated. His is the kind of brutal, troubled character that doesn't appeal to me.See this movie if you want. Remember it is fiction of the worst kind.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Day Lewis on top form in good period drama,"Leonardo Di Caprio (Titanic) stars as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man coming back to New York to find his father's killer, William Cuttings and gain retribution.Nominated for 10 Oscars, Martin Scorsese's period drama brings a tale of vengeance, loyalty and honour to vibrant light with a dramatic tale involving stunning performances, effects, direction and cinematography.Di Caprio performs well as Vallon, a quiet but hurting inside man who wants vengeance for his father. It is not the best performance of his career but Di Caprio depicts the character well and comes out of his hell brilliantly towards the end of the story.The Titanic star is outshone by Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot: The story of Christy Brown) who plays Bill the Butcher. Oscar nominated for his performance, Lewis is the most sophisticated actor in this film. His anger, sophistication and ease make the Butcher the most enjoyable character to watch.Diaz (Charlie's angels) gives the best performance of her career as thief Jenny and her on screen performance alongside Di Caprio is good, despite the dialogue and situation a bit of a cliché.The plot is good and consistent, revolving around strong issues such as religion, honour, friendship and family. Vallon and Cutting both had strong passionate fathers and this ideology is good to drive the characters on. Though the dialogue can sometimes lack, most is sharp and energetic, revealing the passion of the time.The costume design is excellent, depicting the time brilliantly, as does the cinematography. The settings, direction and everything about this film is brilliant, except for the plot which could have just been a bit sharper and not run on a few clichés but a great watch with Daniel Day-Lewis in top form.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fantastic direction, extremely weak story","Watching Gangs of New York makes you feel that so much effort has been put for nothing. An absolutely top class direction by Scorcese and a memorable performance by Daniel Day Lewis, for, well, a plain and uninteresting story. It is hardly believable that they accepted contributing their immense talents having to deal with such a weak scenario. My only guess is that, this movie being shot right after the 9/11 events, they would have considered it as a tribute to the city of New York and they just had to be there. So about this excuse of a script: The tension is not built, the lines are poor and nothing is actually happening the right way.Now Leo Di Caprio. Who thought putting him against Day Lewis? The difference in class is so huge, one cannot think of them as adversaries even for one second. Daniel owns this film, while Di Caprio barely surfaces. And of course Cameron Diaz doesn't need to even be mentioned at all. Completely indifferent.Gangs of NY is the definition of a missed opportunity. With a proper script and a better lead instead of Di Caprio, it could be so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This tale of the Five Points seems pointless,"It was like Inglorious Basterds to me. Great individual scenes, but mashed together in an unfocused way, especially the third act where Scorcese decided the riot was going to be the main character instead of Amsterdam and Bill.Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance, and any scene with him in it is interesting. Leo DiCaprio however, is lacking, along with Cameron Diaz. And somehow Diaz winds up the love interest of every main character in the film. Weren't there other women around? It seems more attention was paid to the art direction/production design/technical achievements than to it's story and the structure of such. The film runs pretty long, especially for a movie that lacks a streamlined narrative. Not that it needs to be that, but I think it tries to dazzle people more with set pieces devoted to spectacle rather than devotion to characters.I think the suits got too involved considering the cost of the project and wanted to see all of that money up on the screen and the film as a whole suffered for that. Listen to the commentary with Scorsese, he doesn't mention the film once. Only the history of the actual events depicted. I only give it five stars because a great deal of my disappointment is that it is a Scorsese film, and I've come to expect better.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
An unforgettable experience!,"Ever seen a film that captured all you loved and hated about not only America(for those of of you who are American),but the world,as well? A film that made you so angry,but yet left you in tears due to its compelling story,characters,and visuals?For me,Gangs of New York is that film.I LOVE this movie! From its heartbreaking opening,to its truly melancholy ending,this film leaves with so many mixed emotions that just further support the emotional weight of this film.If by the final scene,you don't either feel a positive or negative emotion to what you saw and the effects it had on not only the characters,but America in general,then I question your humanity.Now,I am not a patriotic person.I find,as a country,America is very hypocritical,and it makes me sick,but I still care for my fellow man,and that is becoming more and more rare as time goes on.People just look out for themselves more often nowadays,and you just want to scream at them for their self-centered behavior.Gangs of New York is set in 1863,when gangs ran the streets of New York,and the government couldn't (or would not,whatever you prefer) gain control of the city that would one day be one of the greatest cities of the world.The story deals with the character of Amsterdam Vallon(Leonardo DiCaprico),who,when he was young,lost his father(Liam Neeson) to gang leader Bill the Butcher(Daniel Day-Lewis).Amsterdam is put in a reform school,but when he grows up,he plots to avenge his father's murder by getting close to Bill and killing him.In joining Bill's gang,however,Amsterdam gets to know the man personally.Now,Bill is someone Amsterdam,and we as a viewing audience, should hate without question.But he is the interesting thing:Bill isn't unlikable.Even in all that he has done,and will do(and he does plenty,as this is an almost 3-hour film),Amsterdam finds he actually is starting to respect the man,especially when it concerns Amsterdam's father,who Bill considers as ""the only person he ever killed worth remembering.""Sadly,nothing good will come out of this.Bill soon discovers who Amsterdam really is,and he won't take kindly to someone in his gang who has it out for him. And so,Amsterdam and Bill,by the film's climax,will find themselves on opposing sides in what will shape the future of ""their great city"".Gangs is a wonderful film,filled with terrific performances,amazing visuals,great direction,a solid screenplay,filled with depth and themes,and,overall,a powerful message:""in the end,how significant are the quarrels of man's past? For in the end,time will fade even legend.""Please see this.

A sprawling American mess,"This is the first Scorsese film I managed to watch in the theater. I was pretty much the only person in my group that appreciated the film. The script and storyline is confused and includes a lot of things that end up being historical detail, i.e. most of the Boss Tweed stuff. Likewise the revenge story and pseudo-love triangle at the heart of the film is a bit too pat. Diaz gives a pretty slipshod performance in this as well. Even as I was blown away with the rest of the film I recognized these significant problems. Re-watching the film the other I was even more impressed with the film's ambition-despite some of that ambition being denied- and how much Bill's nativism feels like a dire warning for Trumpianism. The film is still quite messy but it struck me as a mess to get lost in.As a ""character"" study of the social conditions of New York city c 1860's this is a very good film. Much of the historical milieu is vivid and the resulting ugly world is a good counterpoint of much of the sanitized history you get in school. The film's narrative shortcomings are worth the hit to get a fuller sense of the environment these characters exist in. While parts of the history could have been handled better-the riots at the end were race riots!-ultimately I think this is a good primer.Day-Lewis is probably the best part; the semi-confessional scene when at night with the flag draped over Bill is the scene I think everyone should watch again. It is a dire warning of where we are heading. The film humanizes the know-nothings at the same time it is condemning them. This is a dark film that brings to light much of Americana's underbelly.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
You can have all the right ingredients and still overcook a dish.,"This movie is proof that you can have all the right ingredients and still overcook a dish.Set in 1862, this story follows Amsterdam played by Leonardo Dicaprio as he seeks revenge on his father's murderer...

Very hard move to rate,"I think the 7.5 average is about right. For all that I love about the historical topic, costumes, witty bits in the script (especially all Boss Tweed scenes) and acting from DDL, there were just a few things that felt very off preventing this from being a great film of the 2000s.The entire Jenny plot feels like a waste. The opening scenes with the father almost feel like Sci-Fi and take the realism out of a critical American history topic. The first half has a tremendous amount of build up for mostly uninteresting characters (and constant detail about gangs irrelevant to the plot) just to fulfill a centuries old trope and could have been sliced by 30 minutes to enhance the final product. The second half was good enough to help it overcome those flaws, but it requires a lot of patience, and I must note that the final showdown requires no great valor from these cowardly characters - ultimately a bit unfulfilling. The action afterward that showdown does do a good job of driving home a message though.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Little Amsterdam Vallon runs away taking the knife that killed his father. Sixteen years later, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the neighborhood from reform house to avenge his father.

I forgot how good this film was. Great cast (and director).,"I am trying to view director Martin Scorsese's work as much as possible. I faintly remembered viewing this film back on its cinematic release back in 2002. I knew it was good then so I thought it was worth re-watching on a television screen.The film is set in nineteenth century New York City as thousands of Irish immigrants arrive each week on boats to the city (and country) and sets the tone for tensions for 'native' Americans. It is hard to believe that some of the set designs, as lavish as they are will become home to one of the biggest metropolis on earth. The film mainly centres on a nineteenth century character, Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) who is the main gangster of the 'streets' of New York. The film is set mainly set in the Five Points area of the city.Cutting is an apt name as he cuts up all his enemies it seems with ever sharper blades and in more rivers of blood. In one such confrontation he kills an Irishman Father Vallon (Liam Neeson). It is from this evil killing in front of Vallon's son Amsterdam (later to morph into Leonardo DiCaprio) that the plot of the film is revealed as Amsterdam vows to avenge his father's death. Vallon earns the respect of Cutting and becomes a member of inner circle before all hell breaks loose setting up a barbaric finale in which New York as we know it is born and the Cutting reign is over.The Irish accents of some of the characters are laughable. Only Brendan Gleeson makes the most of his. Other actors struggle to grasp the tongue. It is the production design (Dante Ferretti), cinematography (Michael Ballhaus) and direction of Scorcese that triumph in the film slightly before CGI dominated such films. The casting has a strong contingent of actors (and few actresses) that feature in UK productions and television and a few Hollywood films. Look out for the bloke of Billy Elliott, 'Q Algy' off Never Say Never Again and Elliot off E. T. I rate this another Scorsese hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The narrative and characters are weak but the general sweep and spectacle of the whole thing makes it worth a look,"In the 1840's New York is a mess of gangs all fighting over small areas of turf. The main rivalry is between the immigrant Irish and those who see themselves as Natives of their New York. A battle rages between them and the leader of the Irish (Priest Vallon) falls to the blade of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting  witnessed by Vallon's young son. Sixteen years later and things are different but no better. Cutting is now the head of the Five Corners and all the gangs answer to him. It is into this situation that an unknown man called Amsterdam returns  none other than the grown son of Priest Vallon. Seeking a fitting revenge for the death of his father, Amsterdam makes sure he catches Cutting's sole eye and gradually is taken into his trust.Despite lukewarm reviews I decided that any Scorsese film is worth a look and gave GoNY a night of my time. In terms of plotting the film is essentially a revenge drama that sees Vallon trying to get close enough to Cutting to take him out in a fashion befitting the man. You might rightly point out that such a straightforward tale does not require 180 minutes to tell but it does when the film tries to make this much more of a sprawling affair that aims to bridge the cinematic gap between the western and the gangster films while also painting a rich tapestry of characters against a rich background of 19th Century New York. However it fails to do this on several levels and the end result is a film that feels a lot baggier than it really should have done. This is best seen in the characters because none of them really develop beyond the first impressions they give, or a better example is the failure of the film to use Jenny in the critical way that she was clearly intended to be used.Scorsese may lose his way with the story but it is easy to forgive him because he does so well with the majestic historical sweep he gives to everything else. The sets look great, the costumes look great and the dramatic flair he gives in delivery add so much. It is a real problem that he has not taken the characters and story along for the ride but I found his silver lining to be enjoyable even if his rather OTT approach did further take away from the realism of the people and the story. His approach is matched by the cast, who are mostly enjoyable despite lacking depth. DiCaprio is more than the bland pinup I had feared he would be but he can't do much more than play the ""silent revenge"" card from start to finish. He is overwhelmed by Day-Lewis who has great fun in a fantastically OTT role that worked much better than I expected him to. Diaz is not that good and I felt she was miscast in an attempt to get ""credibility"" by working with Scorsese. The support cast is roundly good and features solid turns from Neeson, Reilly, Gleeson and many others fill out a strong cast.Overall this is an impressive film in terms of sweep and style but not in terms of story and characters  which is a bit of a problem in a film that pretty much lasts three hours. The skill of Scorsese and the presence of so many stars make it worth a look but it is hard to get past the problems in the way that the story is not as well done as it could have been, even if the general historical sweep and spectacle makes it worth taking a look at.",,Anonymous,Crime

The characters are all very unique and no one is at all boring. Daniel Day-Lewis' character of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting is the highlight of this film. He is not a good guy, but Day-Lewis plays him so well that you can not help but focus on him in a scene. This movie gives insight into the Draft Riots in New York and all the gang violence in the Five Points district.

Cynical look at history....,"The film is remarkably cynical about American public life in this period. Official history might teach that the Civil War was a noble crusade against slavery and that nineteenth-century America was a beacon of liberty to oppressed Europeans living under autocratic regimes. The history we see here, however, is the unofficial version. Elections are bought and sold as a result of shady back-room deals. The police are as corrupt as their political masters, and have little interest in protecting the public. (They make no attempt to intervene in the fight in which Vallon's father is killed). The city's rival fire-brigades would rather fight one another than put out fires. Opposition to the war effort was common, and not confined to a few Copperhead politicians. Although Scorsese shows the irrational violence of which the mob are capable, we also sense that he has some sympathy with the complaints of the poor that, in what is nominally a democracy, their voice is not being listened to and that they have no alternative but to riot. (Ironically, however, this anti-war riot may actually have lengthened the war by persuading Southerners to keep fighting, even after Gettysburg, in the belief that the North was tearing itself apart). The depiction of the riots with which the film ends is one of its two great set-pieces, the other being the battle scene between the Dead Rabbits and the Natives with which it begins.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
American Folklore,"Subjective tastes are very diverse and opinions of movie fans most often vary throughout the 1-10 scale, but in most cases majority agrees. However, there are movies that divide the audience into completely opposed groups of those who praise and those who bash the movie, with negligible few of those who rate it somewhere in between. When you scroll through the reviews for ""Gangs of New York"" you can see either 1/10 bashing or 9-10/10 hymns. And all the arguing between those groups is in vain. They'll never agree. In this particular case, I'm with those who praise it. The magnificence of this movie is not in analyzing the objective quality of its components, it's in the overall impression it leaves.Most of the movie takes place in New York during 1863 when one of the worst riots in American history took place. The location where they chose to have this film take place giving audiences a look at what it could've been like back then in New York. The action sequences which mostly involve people getting beat up in brutal ways are well executed especially the riots at the end. The showdown between Amsterdam and Bill was a bit of a letdown but it was fitting for the movie. The film was a bit long with a running time of 167 minutes. The pacing was a little slow at times but the performances by the cast make it worth watching anyway. Despite some flaws Gangs Of New York is still a well made crime drama with enough action, some suspense, a little humor and romance. So if you can get past the long running time Gangs Of New York is definitely worth watching and most of that besides what I already mentioned is because of the exceptional performances (especially Day Lewis and DiCaprio) by the lead actors and the amazing talent of Scorsese who continues to prove himself as a gifted filmmaker with this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Memorable enough yet flawed.,"This was the first Scorsese movie I ever saw and at first I thought Gangs of New York to be a masterpiece. Since viewing Scorsese's superior earlier works (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull etc) my feelings about Gangs of New York have changed somewhat.One of the films major flaws is its casting of Leonardo Dicaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio appears to be trying incredibly hard in his lead role, yet he still looks to clean cut and boyish to be taking on the role of a New York Gangster. Cameron Diaz is feisty and does her job in an apt enough fashion but the only memorable performance in the movie comes from Daniel Day-Lewis. He excels as the ruthless Bill the Butcher and he turns the aggressive notch down in his compassionate speech about his troubled upbringing. Where Gangs of New York goes down slightly in my estimations is in its execution. Too many minor and in the end insignificant characters are introduced instead of there being development to other characters such as Diaz's Jenny Everdeane.All said and done though ""Gangs"" is a highly entertaining movie with well executed, brutal fight scenes, lavish set and costume design and an acting masterclass from Daniel Day-Lewis.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sordid unrelenting blood bath,"What can be said of a film where the best scenes were the few seconds at the end, where the New York skyline morphed from the slums of Five Points to the skyline pre September 11, 2001.This film may appeal to those who want to see a violent blood bath set in grimy surroundings and played out by Hogarthian degenerates, but it is not in any way entertainment.  I kept waiting for Dante's Inferno to open up and swallow them into the fiery furnace.  The films plods unrelentingly through human misery and violence for more than two and a half hours.  Never once did I get the feeling that it may not be pleasant to watch, but at least it was raising my consciousness.  This was just a film of violence, blood lust and misery, as repulsive as Kurasawa's ""The Lower Depths"".I felt as if the director was making a film about depravity for the sake of depravity.  As if there should be a voiceover stating that ""In the Casbah/slums of Shanghai/Limehouse/Paris/Bombay every vice is catered to. Murder, drugs, vice, white slavery. No one asks questions, no one knows your name, you can hide or disappear, or make someone disappear.""  The opening voiceover from all those black and white films noire - Algiers, Shanghai Gesture, etc.  This is debauchery from the comfort of your cinema seat.Daniel Day-Lewis's ludicrous leering mustachioed Victorian melodrama villain robbed the film of any credibility and belonged to vaudeville. Far and away the only performance worth watching was Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed.  The overrated and unappealing Cameron Diaz and Leonardo diCaprio deserved each other.I can now understand why comedies and musicals did so well during the depression.  Some of us go to the cinema to be uplifted and entertained. There is beauty in the world if you want to look for it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Dr. Seuss' ""The Cat in the Hat,"" played by Daniel Day-Lewis...","""Gangs of New York"" goes a lot of places but it never really goes where it should. It starts up slow, it gets slower, and ends really fast, too fast. For two and a half hours we are dragged through relentlessly gruelling scenes that pay no purpose to the film, and then the last ten minutes, the most vital point of the entire motion picture, the point where we are so hyped, pumped and ready for a big payoff, anything big, something big...fails. It quickly accelerates and ends with U2's award-winning song ""The Hands That Built America,"" and the fancy-schmancy, slow-to-fast credits start rolling.There are a lot of problems with ""Gangs of NY."" I didn't hate the movie, but it let me down. Let me point out everything I didn't like.Martin Scorsese, one of my all-time favorite film directors, the man who brought us the amazing ""Taxi Driver,"" the monumental ""Goodfellas,"" the excellent ""Casino,"" uses good, exciting camera techniques, with bright surroundings...but it feels like a reunion of ""West Side Story."" Everything is bright, dandy, happy, and things move from normal speed to super-speed, back to normal speed in a quick moment. It's like a mix between ""Chicago,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Romeo and Juliet"" (the DiCaprio version), and a really violent bloodbath-type movie.In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to a pack of Irish emigrants, who live in ""The Five Points,"" or something like that. I've never really heard anything about this in history lectures, which is why Martin Scorsese said he was so interested in telling the story. Anyway, after a gruelling three-minute-something introduction to our characters, which just shows them walking in slow motion through an underground Irish-inhabitated craphole, we see Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis' character Bill the Butcher duke it out with their armies. Let me state here that another ""modern"" camera technique used in the film was one during the fight scenes. Scorsese lets us see the attacks, and then as the attacker kills his opponent the camera goes super-fast and starts playing some sort of odd rock music in the background, that actually resembles my quitar amp when I first flick it on and it crackles. Anyway, Neeson dies, his son sees it happen, his son grows up into (drum roll please)...Leonardo DiCaprio! Here's our first mistake. DiCaprio, who proved himself a fine actor all over again with ""Catch Me If You Can,"" one of his first films since that travesty ""The Beach,"" cannot speak with an Irish-New York accent if he wanted to. OK, no big deal, right? Right.Next, Leo plans revenge on Butch Cassidy (woops, honest mistake) by becoming part of his clan, saving his life, and then trying to murder him. Unfortunately, old pal Henry Thomas (yeah, the kid from ""E.T."") rats him out, Bill the Butcher surprises Leo with a knife throw, and there-for-no-reason-except-for-the-male-teenaged-audience-to-come-see-the-mo vie Cameron Diaz screams and yells and eventually nurses Leo back to health, where he gets a band of Irish emigrants and plans his attack against Daniel Days-are-Loosened. (Was that a pun? I can't tell, I'm sure you can't, either.)See how I summed that up in about one minute reading time? Translate that mess into a two and a half hour + film and you've got yourself the biggest flop since ""Waterworld."" Honestly, I have nothing against long films, AS LONG AS THEY HAVE AN INTERESTING STORY TO TELL WITH INTERESTING PROGRESSION. ""Braveheart,"" ""Titanic,"" all those two-VHS-tape movies have an interesting subject AND interesting progression, where things actually happen. Things don't happen much in ""GoNY,"" due to Martin Scorsese milking the subject for all it's worth. There is only so much known about that time period, only so much to imagine, and Scorsese tries to do both: Dilute facts with explosions and history with modern-day camera techniques. Scorsese is a great director, one of the best, but I try to imagine how he could not have done better given the fact he has been planning this film for years, to no prevail because of studios saying ""no."" Now I see why. They realized that this could make for an interesting hour and a half film, but 2 hr. 40 mins is just wayyyyyy too long for a film that goes nowhere.There are some really good performances in this film. Well, by one actor, at least. Daniel Day-Lewis as The Cat in the Hat is really convincing as Bill the Butcher, save the fact that it looks as if Dr. Seuss designed his wardrobe. The always-sweet, always-pretty, always-enjoyable Cameron Diaz dresses up frizzy again, just like in ""Being John Malkovich,"" and tries to convince us her character is there for a reason, but simply put...well...she's just there for a love interest. It's really shallow and really quite pathetic. And Leo DiCaprio, the film's main star, who FINALLY proved to me with ""CMIYC"" that he was a great actor...just fails to capture the passion of his character, which he did in the much underrated ""Catch Me If You Can,"" where he had a real love for his character, and got inside Frank Abagnale's skin. He did not do so great here. In fact, Martin Scorsese said he wanted to make this film realistic. If so, casting DiCaprio was the worst possible choice, because since when did Irish emigrants have well-chiseled facial features and talk like Pierce Brosnan from ""Evelyn""?""Gangs of New York"" is a good film, but with so ensemble a cast, including John C. Reilly (who was in three Oscar-nominees this year) and Jim Broadbent, such a great director at the helm, so much hype, and so many years on the shelves, you'd think that the filmmakers would have had more time to make something great, and could have translated something a bit more interesting onto the screen. I'm not saying change the story. I'm saying shorten the length. ""Gods and Generals"" was an hour longer than this movie, and ten times worse, but I can't help but think that at least ""Gods and Generals"" tried to say something, and ""Gangs of New York"" did not.3/5 stars",,Anonymous,Crime
Mean Streets,"The original Mean Streets. The real Irishmen. New York, New York, 1863. This is Scorsese's ode to the founding of our great city. A founding forged in blood, prejudice and greed. Gangs of New York is a sprawling epic, and it's impossible not to like. The city of old comes alive, in full color, on gorgeous 35mm film. The acting is as fine as any Scorsese movie can get, putting aside the legendary performance that is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. The performance of a lifetime is more apt. He chews up every. last. scene. He is disturbingly good here. The Butcher is one of the great film villains. A ruthless killer armed and motivated by hate. This character was considered for so many great actors in it's 30 year development, but thank God in the end we were given DDL. I cant imagine anyone else in this role. What's even better is that Gangs of New York never overstays it's welcome, even at 167 minutes. Like the best of Scorsese, the quality of what you are seeing very much outweighs the heft of portion size we're getting in length. I could sit through the entirety of this film again, and even if it went on for another hour longer, i'd still be right in there. Scorsese's natural ability to tell stories on screen is unparalleled. However, all is not perfect. Rarely nothing ever is. An odd choice of music and editing, at least to me, lessens the blow and muddies up the fight scene at the beginning. It felt very 2002-ish. It dates the movie significantly.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Senseless Bloodbath,"By the time this movie was released, certain facts were clear: Martin Scorsese is fascinated by psychopathy, extremely gruesome violence, and is an extremely skillful director. This film, inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1927 book, ""The Gangs of New York,"" runs for 167 bloody minutes. The history presented is exaggerated in order to be as gory as possible. The atmospherics are wonderful: the sets, costumes, props, as well as the lighting and cinematography, could not possibly be better. One can only marvel at the devotion to knives, when guns are available. The slaughter show becomes tiresome after a couple of hours, especially since none of the characters are sympathetic. The redeeming feature is the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, who makes clear why many actors say that they prefer to play villains.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A pure masterpiece and visually beautiful,"Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" rips up the postcards of American history and reassembles them into a violent, blood-soaked story of our bare-knuckled past. The New York it portrays in the years between the 1840s and the Civil War is, as a character observes, ""the forge of hell,"" in which groups clear space by killing their rivals. The film opens with an extraordinary scene set beneath tenements, in catacombs carved out of the Manhattan rock. An Irish-American leader named Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) prepares for battle almost as if preparing for the Mass--indeed, as he puts on a collar to protect his neck, we think for a moment he might be a priest. With his young son Amsterdam trailing behind, he walks through the labyrinth of this torchlit Hades, gathering his forces, the Dead Rabbits, before stalking out into daylight to fight the forces of a rival American-born gang, the Nativists. The vivid achievement of Scorsese's film is to visualize this history and people it with characters of Dickensian grotesquerie. Bill the Butcher is one of the great characters in modern movies, with his strangely elaborate diction, his choked accent, his odd way of combining ruthlessness with philosophy. Scorsese's hero, Amsterdam, plays much the same role as a Dickens hero like David Copperfield or Oliver Twist: He is the eyes through which we see the others but is not the most colorful person on the canvas. Amsterdam is not as wild, as vicious or as eccentric as the people around him, and may not be any tougher than his eventual girlfriend Jenny, who like Nancy in Oliver Twist is a hellcat with a fierce loyalty to her man. Scorsese is probably our greatest active American director (Robert Altman is another candidate), and he has given us so many masterpieces that this film, which from another director would be a triumph, arrives as a more measured accomplishment. It was a difficult film to make, as we know from the reports that drifted back from the vast and expensive sets constructed at Cinecitta in Rome. The budget was enormous, the running time was problematical.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Scorsese's worst,"People were saying Martin Scorsese should have won an Oscar for this film, but let's face it, this is not one of his better movies. Overwrought with pretentious dialogue and sequences, Gangs was a pretty shallow experience after the opening battle between the Irish and Natives. Martin Scorsese definitely deserves some recognition for his work, but giving him an Oscar for this average film would be like giving Mark Wahlberg an Oscar for Best Actor. Maybe it was because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it, which instantly ruins the credibility of most films, or maybe it was the fact that there were too many reshoots. In the end, Scorsese's dream project could have turned into another Heaven's Gate if it wasn't for his more dedicated fans. Let's hope Scorsese bounces back soon.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Outstanding casting choise,"If you want actors to play out the most outrageous, colorful and groundbreaking performances, you put Leo and Danny in front of the camera and let them do what they do. Both actors go soooo deep in there characters that the dynamic between young Vallon and Butcher alone is worth the ticket.If you watch a Scorsese film you should be prepared for a nasty ride. He has a way of writing the most skin-crawling scenes without even making it explicitly skin crawling outside the actors performances.The characters are fulfilling and dynamic, and I like the way Scorsese are working with the sound. Another thing I noticed is how my focus always searching for Vallons and Butchers eyes. We see faces and surroundings in a great mix.I think it was the hand of fate that set Gangs Of New York on hold for 30 years. Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are outstanding actors of out time, and I believe that the roles of Vallon and Cutting could not have been this amazing in all its simplicity without them.Great movie.

Where was the middle? ANNOYING!,"Many historical films, such as ""ELIZABETH"", ""THE CRUCIBLE"", ""BRAVEHEART"" and others, make one desire to know more about the period in which the film takes place. This is not the case with ""GANGS OF NEW YORK"".Because of its disjointed, uneven presentation, one wishes to forget that they were even in the theatre. It started and ended wonderfully, but in the meantime, what should have been the meat of the movie, where character development is supposed to build and where we associate with and cheer for the leads, the director, and thusly WE, lost focus.As another reviewer expressed, expectations are high with such an abundance of publicity. And with the movie making ability of Martin Scorcese you expect an extravaganza, something compelling and even wonderful. ""GANGS"" certainly had scope and vision and a panoramic view of New York history, but one thing it lacked was...discipline.  And not that long movies are a bad thing. ""GANDHI"" was LONG. ""AMADEUS"" was LONG. ""THE ENGLISH PATIENT"" was VERY LONG. But these movies TOLD THE STORY in an interesting and concise way that never left the viewer as if they had been drug through the basement of the theatre. And they won BEST PICTURE Oscars!

I found the end of the movie (the rioting part), a bit confusing. Now the upside: The era is portrayed very well, even though the costumes seem to be a little bit overdone. This movie will keep you in tense from beginning to end, from its settings to acting, it is very well done. DiCaprio and Diaz are their regulars, but Day-Lewis is unbelievable.

Fear preserves the spectacle of life.,"Martin Scorsese directs a savage and brutal masterpiece. A young boy(Leonardo DiCaprio)witnesses the killing of his father the Priest Vallon(Liam Neeson). Amsterdam Vallon(DiCaprio)returns from a fifteen year or so stay in reform school to the Five Points area of NYC seeking revenge against Bill the Butcher(Daniel Day-Lewis), his father's killer. Bill is a racist bully and believes he is the king of New York, or at least his own little corner of the world. Amsterdam gets in the good graces of the Butcher only to plot his demise. Along the way the young Vallon meets a pocket picking whore Jenny(Cameron Diaz)and reluctantly falls in love. The tribes of the city are summoned for the mother of all knock down drag out duels with the Butcher and Amsterdam intent on slaying the other.The scenes of 1840s and 1860s New York City are awesome. Great photography and camera work. The most dramatic scene is of the blood covered and body cluttered snow at the film's beginning. This of course seems tame compared to the carnage that brings this epic to a close. Day-Lewis is commanding in his role of the Butcher, one the most egotistical and racist savage characters unable to escape your memory. DiCaprio seems an awkward choice for his role and at times seems unlikely to achieve his character's accomplishments. Diaz was down right fetching and I still believe she could tempt a dead man. Also in the cast are Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, David Hemmings, Joseph P. Reidy, Henry Thomas and John C. Reilly.Sometimes a little bit too wordy and slow, but still this almost three hour film is strong enough to hold your interest and imagination.

A Story Almost Absent in American Memory,"It's Hard to Fathom that a Film can be Nominated for 10, count em, Academy Awards and not Win One.

But what was Delivered is Compelling if not Perfect. If it does have a Failing, it is the Revenge Theme, the Love Story, and a Weakness in its Casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.The Movie's Strength is its Capture of the the Time and Place, the Hordes and the Corrupt and Xenophobic Leaders in this Tumultuous Time in the Nations Melting Pot. It is an Historical Meilu that is Unfamiliar, Conveniently Forgotten, Swept Under, and is Really an Embarrassing Truth about Tribal Warfare and Pig-Headed, Ignorant People Existing in Squalor and is a Filthy Fact that is not Easily Embraced.That could be One of the Reasons for the Film's Detractors. It is Anything but Pretty.

Day Lewis is Stunning,"'Gangs of New York' is one of Scorsese's more inconsistent films, but it's still an adequately chaotic and thrilling tale of corruption and revenge. It's yet another sprawling story about the politics of organized crime in which no one can be trusted, loyalties are tested, and a whole lot of people die. But this time around, Scorsese swaps out the twentieth century mafia families moviegoers have grown accustomed to, for the brutal street gangs of Five Points in the 1860s. The performances are what really make the film, particularly Daniel Day Lewis, who delivers an expectedly electrifying take on the notorious gang leader Bill the Butcher.

A messy yet thrilling historical epic,"After seeing his father 'Priest' (Liam Neeson) murdered at the hands of rival gang leader Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) 16 years before, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the Five Points in New York seeking revenge. Not much has changed since he fled, as tension remains between the 'Natives', the Irish immigrants, the Chinese and the blacks, only Bill now rules over with an iron fist, helping corrupt politician William 'Boss' Tweed (Jim Broadbent) gain votes. With the help of old friend Johnny (Henry Thomas), Amsterdam finds himself working his way up Bill's ranks, and after thwarting an assassination attempt on Bill, Amsterdam wonders if he did it out of his desire to kill Bill himself, or a growing loyalty to his new employer.Following a lengthy book-to-screen adaptation, Scorsese's historical epic reached the cinema screens 23 years after he bought the rights to Herbert Asbury's book The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld, amongst stories of studio fall-outs and arguments over final cut. It seems all those years of pondering did not allow Scorsese to fine-tune his vision, and although the film looks absolutely astonishing, the result is a bit of a mess, albeit one that never gets boring. Telling such a detailed historical account of America's fist- fights for power amongst mass immigration and racial tension could not have come at a more suitable time, as the 9/11 attacks occurred during production. But Scorsese chooses to cram this in with sub-plots of political corruption, a love-story between Amsterdam and thief Jenny (Cameron Diaz), the New York Draft Riots, and the central revenge story.Of course, the film's ultimate saving grace is Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives a theatrical, sledgehammer performance as the one eyed-monster, and his scene where he sits talking to Amsterdam with an American flag draped over his shoulders is worth a thousand Academy Awards alone. Among the wave of dodgy Oirish accents, DiCaprio's isn't that bad, pulling of a credible performance which would jump-start his close relationship with Scorsese in the years after. Amsterdam is no regular hero, he's just as violent as the next thug, and one of the most interesting aspects of the film is how Scorsese tends not to show any race or group in a particularly good light. This is America's dirty beginnings after all, and boy is it bloody - heads are bludgeoned, cheeks are torn from their face - it's probably Scorsese's most gruesome since Casino (1995).Second time around, Gangs of New York did seem admittedly better paced and more fleshed out (I thought I might even be watching a director's cut), with the political goings-on and the various sub-plots making much more sense. But the film is still a mess, and it progresses with a taste for almost glamorising the violence. The opening scene depicting the bloody fight between the Butcher's natives and the Priest's Dead Rabbits comes with slow-motion and electric guitar music, and this punk-ish approach causes it to clash with its historical setting. However, it looks staggering. The costumes, the huge sets, and the dirt and grit, has an epic David Lean quality, almost old-fashioned in a way. Yet this is a very modern film, and perhaps a more classical approach may have benefited the film which is ultimately unfocused, but effortlessly thrilling.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Evil is in the Eye of the Beholder,"Bless Harvey Weinstein's twisted little heart. Once again he has presented us with utterly selfish, dislikable people and produced with them a pretty good story.  I felt pretty unmoved by it all, even if I was never bored. This is largely due to Daniel-Day Lewis' phenomenal performance.I find it mildly amusing that an Italian (Leonard Dicaprio) and a Cuban-Swede (Cameron Diaz) play Irish characters, while Daniel-Day Lewis (an Irishman) plays an Irish-hating American of English descent.A short synopsis. Daniel-Day Lewis plays the heard of the most powerful gang in the ""Five Points"" section of New York. He kills Dicaprio father (Liam Neeson) during a gang war between the immigrant Irish and the anti-Irish ""nativists."" It was a ""fair fight,"" insofar as Lewis and Neeson had met a formal challenge and Lewis honors Neeson. Nonetheless, 16 years later, Dicaprio plots revenge, becoming Lewis's Lieutenant with a secret plan to kill him during the annual celebration Lewis throws to celebrate and honor Neeson, ""The last interesting man I killed.""There are really no ""good guys"" in this movie, but I found myself more in sympathy with Lewis than Dicaprio.  Then, as today, American citizens are victimized by greedy politicians and businessmen capitalizing on immigration. This time, of course, it is illegal immigrants. However, who is to say that the ""legal"" immigration of the period wasn't excessive? Certainly, the movie portrays the Irish immigrants as almost entirely composed of thieves, whores and drunkards.While Lewis can be generous and, even, somewhat forgiving, Dicaprio possesses neither of these qualities. With the assistance of ""Boss Tweed"" (Jim Broadbent, in another great performance), Dicaprio and his Irish supporters steal a sheriff's election, precipitating much of the climatic violence. Diaz plays a whore and a thief, though she is certainly more unselfish than Dicaprio.Let me compare this, for a moment, with a much better movie, ""Unforgiven"". The moral ambiguity in ""Unforgiven"" is clear, in that there are no ""good guys;"" but, Eastwood's character is avenging two miscarriages of justice, the whore's mutilation and the murder of his friend under the guise of ""justice"". ""Gangs of New York,"" one wonders how New York survived such such predatory and self-destructive people.The movie boasts a good score, excellent period production values and Scorsese's usual masterful camera movements.

The portrayal of people at their worst is refreshingly frank, and while Scorsese is pro-poor, he thankfully isn't deluded enough to BS this topic. The history of that period, of urban gang life and unrest, really stands out as the second most interesting part of the film to me, and it was really disappointing that Scorsese had to tack on a dull revenge/romance plot to justify spending the money to bring the period to life. I definitely think Scorsese should have found a better way, story-wise, to integrate the characters into the history. The cinematography is very good, same as the glimpse into the culture. If the story had been fresh or unpredictable or... mehAnyway, the MOST interesting part of this thing is Daniel Day-Lewis, playing a character with a charisma all his own.

Martin Scorsese's grand ambition.,"""Gangs of New York"" is everything that we would expect Martin Scorsese to deliver. It's like all his movies rolled into one hard punch. Portraying young Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) looking to take revenge on crime boss Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1863 New York, the movie shows what a historical epic should be. I can't believe that this didn't win a single Oscar; what does Scorsese have to do to win their respect? But the point is that ""Gangs of New York"" is a masterpiece. Scorsese showed the same flair for historical epics that he later brought to ""The Aviator"". Fine support from Cameron Diaz, John C. Reilly, Brendan Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Henry Thomas, and Liam Neeson make this one solid flick. Perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Gangs of New York Has Its Epic Moments, But Also Some Flaws","I've always thought of Martin Scorsese as a perfectionist and this movie proves it again. Scorsese rebuilt a believable, accurate portrayal of New York during middle of the 19th century. Thanks to the great images and shots the movie has the right to be regarded as an epic although the whole movie (particularly the story) has its weaknesses.The movie is about vengeance. So it is nothing that we haven't seen before (and we will see lots of other movies about the same subject.) The interesting thing about the plot is - or could have been - the historical background. It is set during a developing America. However, I didn't get a satisfying view of American culture during that time. Yes, Scorsese presents us the rivaling gangs and the mob on the streets, but still the view stays superficial.The main problem for me were the characters.I've never considered Cameron Diaz as a great actress and here she seems absolutely miscast to me. It was a good idea to create a female character in that violent, male-shaped environment, but Cameron Diaz' doesn't do anything instead of being bitchy and annoying without giving her character any likable strains.Leonardo DiCaprio's main character stays pale throughout the whole movie. I don't think that this is DiCaprio's fault, he is quite good in his role, but nothing more. There is no much character development (although he is the protagonist), his character isn't supposed to show much emotion what doesn't make him likable and I think there aren't a lot of moments where we can really empathize with him.However, the movie's salvation is Daniel Day-Lewis. His performance is a revelation, every scene he appears is pure entertainment thanks to his savage turn as Bill the Butcher. What he does isn't only acting, it's a complete transformation. He changes his voice, his accents, his movements, his expression so that it's hard to believe that Bill and Daniel Day-Lewis are the same persons.Jim Broadbent gives also a good performance as the corrupt William Tweed and he grants us some moments of humor.All in all I'd say the movie is good and (without a doubt) greatly made but it has its flaws and its lengths, I lost my interest in DiCaprio's story and in most of the other characters. I doubt that the movie would be the same without Daniel Day-Lewis and without Scorsese's name on it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Violent, incoherent & very long; typical Scorsese","There's this director called Martin Scorsese, okay, he's really good with camera placement - his movies always look hip & trendy - plus he's a not untalented director of actors. He usea lots of pop music & his movies are usually full of the kind of excessively bloody violence & profanity strewn dialogue that delights the teen crowd. This combination has so far proved persuasive enough to elevate him into the Top 10 lists of 'The World's Greatest Directors' courtesy of hip, trendy mags like Empire. Fair enough. Unfortunately what this acclaimed director cannot do is deliver a coherent, well told story about characters we actually take to heart. Case in point - Gangs of New York, aka another example of Scorsese's shockingly inept storytelling.Seriously, what is the story in GoNY about? The film is thematically incoherent & badly structured. It wanders from an initial revenge set up between DiCaprio's Dad and Day-Lewis's baddie to scenes involving immigration, the draft, local politics, racism and corruption. Some of this is sporadically interesting but none of it coheres into anything meaningful so that when the end finally arrives the viewer is left with a 'Huh, is that it?' feeling (and it must be conceded that a similar sense of frustration attends the ending of almost every other movie from this overrated director).Even the performances are dreadful. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply miscast in a heroic role for which he does not possess the required presence. Whenever this guy is on screen you can feel your eyes sliding away in the direction of whatever else is going on in the frame. As Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis blows DiCaprio off the screen & yet he's the villain! Word of advice, Marty: when you're trying to make an audience empathise with your protagonist's near three hour quest for revenge it's really not a good idea to make your villain approx 100 times more charismatic & interesting than your hero.Okay, let's cut the crap. Gangs of New York is a mess & its heavy handed marketing by Miramax, which secured it 11 Academy Award nominations, received swift and well deserved justice when it won precisely ... none.",,Anonymous,Crime
Extraordinary epic! Scorsese's masterpiece!,"In my opinion, this was an amazing film. I highly recommend a second viewing to fully appreciate it. I've heard complaints that it was too long, but the detail that went into this film could not have been achieved in a shorter amount of time. It does contain quite a bit of violence, which I usually hate, but the director leaves most of the gore in the minds of the viewer and not in the eyes. The history of New York and the draft riots is basically unknown to most Americans and this film details this history very bluntly.  No sugar coating. The blatant corruption of government authority and the underlying essence of the role religion played, (and is still playing in our time), and the problems and prejudices facing Americans is all too familiar more than a century later.  From the costumes to the architecture, to the leaders and their subjects, Scorsese's vision, his life's work, is finally realized and presented to the public as a spectacle and a reflection of just how much New York has changed and yet is still a part of our lives. The ending scene, where we see the change of New York over time and the cemetary across the Hudson just sort of ""reminding"" us of what once was, brought tears to my eyes and grief to my soul.  Not necessarily ""grief"" because of sadness.  It was more of the grief one can feel from just moving on to someplace new and yet never really letting go of where they've been.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gangs of New York,"A good movie, but not quite as high as Martin Scorsese's gangster movies, most of the film's characters were bad except for Bill the Butcher who was an extremely cool character, and Daniel Day-Lewis excelled at acting immensely. He was better than all the other actors combined. The movie's storyline was excellent, but too slow to enter events. It took an hour and a half to enter the main event of the movie, but the last hour in the movie was cool. The nineteenth century and the movie beautifully depicted that era, from the constructions to the actors 'clothes. It made me feel like I was living in that era.

An Army Of One - Daniel Day-Lewis,"There are three reasons to watch Martin Scorcese's superlative Gangs Of New York:Daniel.Day.Lewis.Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Tony Montana, Gary Oldman as Sid Vicious, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and (to wax more 'modern') Hugh Jackman as Wolverine: iconic performances, one and all. Day-Lewis joins this pantheon of Actors who made acting choices that so transformed them into these particular icons that one is hard-pressed to see the 'star' beneath the role, even in retrospect.Over the years, in his diversity of roles, Day-Lewis has insidiously placed himself amongst an elite few who have the right to actually term themselves 'actors' in this 'excrementitious' business which has degenerated into a forum for 'movie stars' (people with correct hair and au courant clothes designers).Day-Lewis' role of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting personified the age-old saw that any villain's character is infinitely more interesting than any hero's character. This movie's hero being played by Leo The Fluff did not help any. The only way Fluff could ever be Hard is if he became Tim Roth. I concede that he is a very good actor  he's been doing it since he was 5, fer cryin' out loud  and he's honed his craft into that of a nascent Hollywood Legend (yet he has 'miles to go before he sleeps' on the laurels of a lip-smacking role or major award), but his insipid chick-flickable role in ""Titanic"" created that taste of sulfur in my mouth (and I'm guessing in the mouths of many others who might have marvelled at his turns in Basketball Diaries and This Boy's Life) to the point where he must almost martyr himself to engender any real 'likeability'. (Next summer: The Passion Of The Fluff.)In a film stocked with excellent actors (Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, Fluff, Jim Broadbent, Henry Thomas  and no, Cameron Diaz, is NOT one of those excellent actors, she's no better or worse than any one of a thousand women who could've filled that role), Day-Lewis molds a larger-than-history persona that illustrates the fact that Acting isn't really as easy as we all think it is. We are shown  by an absolute MASTER of the craft  how it's REALLY done: the force of will to forge this unique embodiment of power; abrasive, ambitious, ruthless, loyal; the choices of movement, accent, attire; each inflection, each flourish - Grand Gesture  not a smirk out of place, not a twirl of the mustache unintentional.This movie's plot is almost an afterthought, as Day-Lewis' scene-stealing is so complete that we simply live for and unto each moment he graces us with his being... Set against the cyclorama of political machinations which defined early New York City's cultural eclecticism, an iron-fisted tyrant (Day-Lewis) must deal with crooked politicians (are there any other type?) threatening to usurp his power over a swathe of borough known as the Five Points, as well as deal with Leonardo DiCaprio (playing the son of a former civil leader whom Bill executed personally in a street battle - a cameo'd Liam Neeson), seeking vengeance for his father's death.It was refreshing to learn that this movie's plot did not hinge on the ubiquitous device of Woman as the focal point. Even in movies that purport explosive grandeur, such as that displayed in Gangs, original storyline is so frequently sacrificed to the age-old struggle of acquiring a woman from a) another guy, b) another lifestyle, c) another tax bracket. Jenny (Cameron Diaz) intimates that she is Bill The Butcher's woman, yet after she sleeps with Fluff and we see that Bill is not in the least perturbed (but rather embraces an avuncular pleasure in knowing that his surrogate son has gotten some), Jenny loses all her importance to the tale; we, as jaded viewers, were grimacing and gearing up to see yet another testosterone-induced stag-battle over the meaningless mannequin of Woman  but it did not occur!  to the movie's great credit. It lent yet another dimension to the enigma, the legend, the inexplicable conundrum that was Bill The Butcher - that IS Daniel Day-Lewis.Brings the bile to my throat to think that those talentless drogues on Melrose Place share the same earth as this genius; that while Day-Lewis has wrought such a world-shaking role as this, there still exists on this stinking planet Poison Ivy II and Friday The 13th Part VII, and ANY of the twenty incarnations of Police Academy dung heaps. In a world made better by Daniel Day-Lewis, should there be any reason to keep Steve Guttenberg alive?Were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis, Gangs of New York would be merely a 'great' film, scourged from the engine-pit of misbegotten pseudo-history and sand-blasted onto the epic screen - but with Day-Lewis' incendiary performance of Bill Cutting, this film rightfully earns the mantle of 'classic'.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fails to overly impress,"Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and William `The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) are the two central characters in Gangs of New York. Amsterdam lost his father in fight between the Irish immigrants and the Native Americans (who are not American Indians). During the opening battle scene (which plays, unfortunately, as if it were directed by some MTV rookie), Bill the Butcher takes the life of `Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson). Only a young boy, Amsterdam is sent away to a reform school where he anxiously awaits the chance to take revenge.The movie picks up in 1863 as an older Amsterdam returns to the savagely impoverished Five Points area of Manhattan. He immediately begins to seek out Bill the Butcher in order to exact revenge. It is this period of the movie that is the best. Amsterdam is still a young man, albeit a hardened young man. Through necessity, he makes friends with some of the most unlikely people and we are left to make our own assumptions of some individuals' motives. Amsterdam meets Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) and their relationship during this period of the movie is brilliant.Gangs of New York takes a turn for the worse in the third act. Instead of continuing to focus on the intricate character relationships that it so masterfully and carefully setup through the first 2 acts, the movie decides to become a historical drama centering on the Draft Riots. While the Draft Riots are an important and mostly forgotten piece of history, the audience has invested too much time into the existing micro-relationships for the movie to simply push them into the backseat. The events leading up the riots had always been in the background of Gangs and I was comfortable with them there.The movie is beautifully filmed for the most part. As mentioned above, the opening fight sequence was strange and had an MTV quality that initially left a bad taste in my mouth. Fortunately, Scorcese finds a tone and style that remains effective and, in some sequences, is almost brilliantly conceived. All of the actors here are superb and, if you can get past Leonard DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz as 19th century hooligans, you will enjoy their performances much more. The real star here, however, is Daniel Day-Lewis. He is not playing Bill the Butcher, the man is Bill the Butcher. He plays Bill with such an intensity, I never once questioned his existence. The music in the film is hardly anything special and works effectively where it needs to accentuate emotion. The set design and costume work is top-notch.Overall, Gangs of New York is a welcome addition to my collection as it should be in yours. The shift in focus is unsettling, but does not diminish the accomplishments of the revenge story in the long run. The movie would have worked either a straight character drama or a historical drama about the Draft Riots. It does not, however, completely flow as both. Each of the parts of the film are exciting in their own rights but only succeeded in distracting one part from the other. Scorcese has crafted a fine tale and, while not the masterpiece or even Best Picture candidate it was touted as, Gangs of New York is a very good film.",,Anonymous,Crime
A departure from the usual high Scorsese standards but still a great film,"There's a lot to digest with Gangs of New York. On the whole I enjoyed it, but it felt quite messy in parts for a Scorsese film, and had a bit of a janky style which I wasn't always on board with.The main positive of this film was the cast. You can't go too far wrong with Daniel Day Lewis or Leonardo DiCaprio. Both were excellent and really embodied their roles. In fact the whole cast were great. We were treated to a glimpse of how good Cameron Diaz can be when furnished with a talented director and accomplished script. There was a solid supporting cast with lots of top British actors and all of them put in solid performances.I always enjoy Scorsese's films as they have a great way of exploring characters, have witty and sharp scripts, and manage to give us a gritty glimpse of the period they are exploring. Gangs of New York achieves all of us to the standard you would expect from Scorsese. We get a great insight into the central character of Amsterdam, and are granted a thorough insight into the workings of 1860s New York.My main criticism is the plot. For a nearly three hour runtime I was expecting a much more epic and involving plot than we got. I don't think we got nearly enough and there was so much potential to extract more from the film. There were a few side plots, such as the Amsterdam and Jenny subplot, which just didn't add to the central plot enough or develop the characters in a meaningful enough way. Because of this the film did feel a bit too long.Saying this, I did enjoy the plot and I did enjoy the film, I just think it could have been so much more refined and had a lot of wasted potential.Undoubtedly Gangs of New York is a good film and most definitely worth watching, but don't expect it to live up to the rest of Scorsese's filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good periodic drama,"Martin Scorsese is my favorite director and I have watched most of his movies. ""Gangs of New York"" is a simple revenge story in its core, but what makes it different is Scorsese's amazing making, detailing and his love for New York.Even though it may look as a simple revenge story, Scorsese tries to say a political history about New York. The situations of immigrants, the Irish, the Chinese, the Africans and a lot more. The story clearly shows how the New York we see today was build on the blood of thousands of people. Daniel day Lewis and Leonardo de Caprio was just amazing. Camron Dias gives a amazing performance. The way the movie transports us to 1800's New York is just amazing. Scorsese does this world building using the voiceovers and extremely detailed set, like in his previous movies.Give it a watch if you like period dramas.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Character Studies in Prejudiced New York,"Gangs of New York has a lot to say about America in a time where society was in revolt against itself. Unions versus companies, ""natives"" (what New Yorkers consider themselves versus the Irish immigrants) versus immigrants, black versus white. Sitting on my couch watching this movie I felt like I needed to watch my own back (yes there are devastating scenes of backstabbing) and the barbarity is emphasized to the forefront almost the point of being surreal.Gangs of New York is not only a historical commentary on the America it is set in, but a mesmerizing study of character growth and development. It is no surprise that Leonardo Dicaprio commented in an interview about the absurd method acting Daniel Day-Lewis undertook while filming this movie.Bill the Butcher (played by Day-Lewis) is as unforgettable a character as any and we are torn on how to relate to him in the movie as he is definitely a dynamic character. On the one hand, he is a power-hungry, sociopathic warlord. But, on the other hand, he has a deep respect for the most noble of his enemies and holds honourable enemies in a higher place (like ""The Priest"") then his own lukewarm generals who come off as very two dimensional compared to Bill.Despite the great characters and acting, the actual story is challenging to follow, and not in an experimental positive way. The writing is a bit dull to propel the story, and it feels like the movie is a bunch of segments of tableau pasted together.Without the characters (Neeson, Day-Lewis, Dicaprio), this would rate significantly lower in my eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An acceptable film with good action scenes and an interesting history.,"This film shows how Amsterdam Vallon tries to avenge the death of his father in a gangs fight by removing the power and influence of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, his father's murderer. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film has a script by Jay Cocks and a cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards.This film is interesting but, as far as I realized, doesn't correspond to reality. The historical accuracy remained away from this movie most of the time. But the script is interesting. It has some points that I don't understand but it works, focusing on the fight between two rival gangs for control of the poor neighborhood of Five Points. The most powerful gang, the ""Natives"", thought the Italian and Irish immigrants were a danger to America, forgetting that they had also been immigrants in the colonial period (the true Americans are the indigenous tribes who were butchered to build USA). From this seed, the film shows how the US received waves of immigrants from Europe and how it was important for the country. The film also focuses on the civil war, the differences of opinion around it, and the poverty of the poorest sections of society.The actors were well in their roles but Daniel Day-Lewis deserves a special mention. He monopolizes the film with a careful interpretation of a particularly complex and difficult character. DiCaprio was also good, but remained in a role he knows well: the good guy, very cute, seeking justice. Cameron Diaz also brings no surprises, with her usual dose of Latin charm giving greater knavery to her character, already quite opportunistic and cunning. Action scenes are many and quite graphic, so the most sensitive stomachs should be prepared. The visual and sound effects are good and help to enhance the film. The scenarios were very well imagined, although some of them are too unrealistic, and the same can be said of the costumes. Nevertheless, the film is generally reliable enough to be appreciated. The soundtrack is a disappointment because it has a sonority too ""rock"" and doesn't fit well in a period film. It seems copied from films like ""300"" or ""Mad Max"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The whole may not add up to the sum of its parts, but it's difficult to dismiss the brilliance of those parts!!!","The violent rise of gangland power in New York City at a time of massive political corruption and the city's evolution into a cultural melting pot set the stage for this lavish historical epic, which director Martin Scorsese finally brought to the screen almost 30 years after he first began to plan the project. In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day- Lewis), better known as ""Bill the Butcher"" for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow ""Native Americans"" into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, ""The Dead Rabbits,"" organized by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio). Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Directed to the hilt . . .,"knifeblade and otherwise. I suppose it's too early for a review, but I'll give it a shot and let the more logorrheic shred this as they might. Let's get this demotic party started. Saw it at a DGA preview in NYC--the words ""epic,"" ""bloodbath,"" and ""shambles"" come to mind. And that's just getting into the screening.Here are a few impressions from having seen the film, inconclusive, and in no real order:1. Scorsese is very forthright about his debt to Italian neo-realism (Visconti et al.), and the film is directed within an inch of its life. Not quite as dense and sickening as Age of Innocence's endless homage to the feast scene at the end of The Leopard, but still. Dolly shot cuts to dolly shot cuts to a dolly shot that turns into a whip zoom of a fight. Virtuosic, but what for?2. Daniel Herschel-Gordon-Lewis deserves a Nobel Prize for acting. Bill Cutting supplants any Hollywood baddie you care to name as far as complexity and character is concerned, including every adolescent's favorite cannibal analyst. Scorsese spoke after the screening, and likened the Bill the Butcher character to some Melville he had been reading. It's very appropriate, and I could only wish for more of it (Melville) in films.3. The movie's narrative trajectory is a bit off, with a climax (The hallucinatory ""Butcher's Apprentice"" scene) about two-thirds into the film. It goes a bit haywire in the end, with the characters becoming tiny parts in the sweep of history (think Bertolucci's 1900, but with smaller flags), but it's still very enjoyable.4. Oh yeah. Leo. Good enough. The Darwinian grief muscle between his brows was working overtime. A callow youth playing a callow youth (with a vendetta).5. The pop music DOES NOT WORK HERE. Pax Vox.6. The tapestry doesn't really hold as dramatic narrative, but it's a heartfelt work of film art.7. The daguerrotypes of Matthew Brady or Nadar that are shown near the end, of Union casualties of the Civil War, were somehow more immediate in their feeling. By that I guess I mean less mediated, less theatrical, and after so much the film puts you through, to realize that it is just theater is a jarring thing. The pictures have more impact than the film.8. Damn but I hope this sumbitch makes some money.",,Anonymous,Crime

I Have Now Been Exposed to the Genius That Is Day-Lewis,"Let me say this film was fantastic and a marvel to behold. The only reason I have given it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I always feel there is room for improvement no matter how great a film (in this case, perhaps the director's cut would warrant a 10). I was also a bit displeased that U2 was involved with the music, but I cannot honestly say the music was bad.Coming in around three hours, and taking up two discs, some people would consider this movie a bit on the long side. Me? I would gladly have sat through another hour of this epic masterpiece. I have watched it twice now (that's six hours) and wouldn't mind a third time in the future. The storytelling is crisp, fresh and bold -- the characters believable, three-dimensional and asking for our empathy. As much as I wanted to hate The Butcher and root for young Amsterdam, I couldn't help but feel I knew exactly where the villain was coming from. In his own way, he is the American hero he makes himself out to be.The story starts off with you thinking the plot is a simple tale of a son avenging his father's death. But this is only one plot line. It's a story of immigration, politics, the Civil War and of loyalty and honor. Such historical figures as P. T. Barnum and Horace Greeley grace the screen to give the film a wider context which it willingly and eagerly accepts.The battle scenes are some of the best you'll ever see with great carnage and some vibrant and imaginative costumes. The costumes in general are amazing with their unique styles that could only have worked in this film. If you don't like blood, this might not be the movie for you, but is tame in comparison to many other choices out there and less violent than many war films.I am not very familiar with director Martin Scorsese's work, but based on this film and ""Goodfellas"" I would say that he could easily be considered one of the best directors of our time (many people surely already think of him in this way). ""The Departed"" really clinched this belief for me. While Scorsese received the Oscar for ""Departed"", I think he really earned it during ""Gangs of New York"". But, better late than never.DiCaprio delivers his strongest performance ever in this movie, or at least up to this point in his career (which is saying a lot coming from a fan) and Daniel Day-Lewis shows us he is the very definition of what a perfect method actor should be. I believed he really was Bill the Butcher and I think at times he believed it, too. No other character from film stands out in my mind as being as memorable as he. Even Cameron Diaz, whom I extremely dislike, put on a dazzling display. My only complaint about her in this film is that she is Cameron Diaz, but I guess she has little control over that.The sets? Awesome. Who needs crappy computer imagery when you have sets like these? I could go on and on for pages at a time about this movie, but I think you understand where I am going: completely perfect film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Elaborate sets were built at the Cinecitta studios in Rome for this Dickensian yarn and Scorcese spent many months editing this film down to a manageable length as well as smoothing out the violence at the behest of the censors.In 1846, the noble Irish Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson in an all too brief role) leader of the immigrant gang the Dead Rabbits goes to battle with the xenophobic protestants, the Natives led by the vicious Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) who plays him like murderous Bill Sikes crossed with the more bluff and charming Fagin.Vallon is slain by Butcher's blade. His son escapes and grows up angry and intent on revenge and calls himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio in almost Oliver Twist mode.) Many years later after reform school Amsterdam returns to the Five Points and plots to get close to Bill in order to kill him but thinks get a lot complicated.Bill Cutting has risen in power, he holds sway with various corrupt politicians and lawmen. Bill has dreams of his new America and it does not include it being a melting plot. Amsterdam worms himself into the Bill's inner circle and almost becomes a surrogate son to him. Amsterdam also takes the pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz who might as well be Nancy) who was once Bill's mistress.However despite the cruel and nasty things Bill has done and his expertise with the blade, Bill is not a caricatured villain and Day- Lewis makes him empathetic and Amsterdam finds respect for him. Just hope that Bill never finds out who Amsterdam really is.Scorcese wanted to make a film about the rise of New York. We know this because the final shot dissolves from the ruins of a riot ridden city to that of skyscrapers in the beginning of the new millennium. The story mixes a revenge tale with the insertion of real life characters to acknowledge a city that is going to advance rapidly from the nineteenth century slums with low life characters.In making this epic which took three screenwriters the focus is on Day-Lewis making his character complex and dominating leaving other characters more vacuous and the film out of balance. Priest Vallon is interesting but is dispatched too quickly.It is a big performance from Day-Lewis but I once read that if you examine it closely, it is almost as if he is doing a Robert De Niro impression. An observation with some substance.The film is long but it is not an epic. The broad strokes of a young city growing up entwined with a young man growing to take revenge is lost in the finer details with uneven pacing and too many sketchy characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great Entertainment, Accurate Historical Context","This movie, although lengthy, is well worth the time. A mix between romance, revenge and violence this movie accurately depicts the life of the gangs within the Five Points District leading up to and during the Civil War. I genuinely enjoyed this movie despite the gory combat scenes. However I believe Scorsese spared no expense making sure this film was as close to reality during the time period as possible. Scorsese and Dicaprio come together in yet another exhilarating film of American History. This time opposing the future glory shown in The Wolf of Wall Street and showing the lowly slum life that the gangs of Five Points lived through.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Doesn't stand the test of time,"Just watched this for a second time (2020) and it seems very dated and over rated.

Sloppy and Inaccurate,"Along with so many people, I had waited for this movie to come out, but for a different reason. I have studied the Five Points at great length and wanted to see how Scorcese would deal with the subject. I was never more disappointed than when I left the theater after this drivel.The storyline was okay if it stuck to the story. However, the action went in too many directions. But to an amateur historian, the fallacies are far too glaring. Fights between gangs were not agreed to in some formal setting, they just happened. And no one ever agrees to not use firearms...they were too frequently used. The Draft Riots were not central to the Five Points...the neighborhood had actually started to improve by the Civil War. By then, the Irish already controlled the Points and simply ignored the natives. The worst riot was in 1857, when the Bowery Boys' Riot flared up and left over 100 dead. The actual Bill the Butcher was a bit different from this one. William Tweed did not ascend to the head of Tammany until after the Draft Riots...I could go on and on. Read Tyler Anbinder's ""Five Points"" or selections from ""Gotham"" to get a more accurate picture of the period.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant Must Watch!,"Suprised this isn't at least an 8.5/10. This a must see! Daniel Day Lewis, Dicapro and Diaz are amazing in this movie and it really does have as much as you'd want in a movie. The acting is incredible, the plot is well done and the writing is phenomenal. Is it a long movie? Yes but it keeps you tuned in the whole time following the plow and each actors personalities that complete the movie for the viewer. Definitely underrated and for Martin Scorsese, you've done it again! In an era with so many popular films this one gets pushed aside when it should be right up there with all the rest.

So realistic!,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Martin Scorcese has crafted a masterpiece epic that puts you smack in the middle of the gang wars that were a part of the foundation of our country.  The shame is many will not see this movie because some critics are panning it as too long or too hard to follow or because it has Leonardo DiCaprio or Cameron Diaz in key roles. First of all, this movie should be seen by any film lover if only to see Daniel Day-Lewis(""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" ""My Left Foot"") in his finest performance.  He is  frighteningly menacing as William Cutting, aka Bill The Butcher.  He has captured the spirit of this dreadful man, from his cocky walk to his handling of cuttlery.  His sneers and voice will send chills up your spine.  This is the best performance I have seen in a long time.  As a selfish film lover, I do wish this wonderfully talented man would work more often!  Leonardo, now cast as a 20 something man, is forced to carry much of the film, and he does an admirable job.  He does have screen presence, and I believe his acting ability is coming around.  Cameron Diaz adds chirpiness and spice to the otherwise drab life of the gang members.  Other nice performances include Jim Broadbent (""Moulin Rouge"") as Boss Tweed, Henry Thomas (""ET""), John C. Riley (all PT Anderson films) and Brandon Gleeson, who steals his scenes as Monk.  Liam Neeson also has a short, but crucial role.  Quick notes: look for Scorcese in a quick cameo, and he also cast Brandon DeSica (grandson of the great director Vittorio DeSica) as another tribute to Italian filmmaking.  Incredible sets and superb editing and soundtrack make this an incredible piece of filmmaking not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too long,"This would have been a very good movie if it had been 45 minutes shorter. As it was it dragged in many stages and somehow seemed blurred. If it was historically correct then, to me, there were quite a few terrific stories about Irish immigration, the riots etc which would have been more worthwhile telling. Problem seems to be that the director is very good at gangster films and got the budget on this reputation..a budget which could have been used to great effect to have made one or two films of this epoch on better subjects.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Sprawling and lacking focus,"Leonardo di Caprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, the son of the leader of a gang of Irish immigrants murdered 15 years ago; Daniel Day Lewis is Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, the murderer and leader of an anti-immigrant gang. 'Gangs of New York' is a story of racism, xenophobia, political competition and corruption, class struggle (literally!) and too much else to list here, but it is probably best understood as a story of how Vallon revenges his father's murder. Still, di Caprio does not play the most interesting character - Day Lewis does, and he does so with admirable nuance and intensity. 'The Butcher' is not merely a brutal murderer but someone who appears occasionally almost sympathetic: stressing how much respect he felt for Vallon's father and taking an almost fatherly interest in Amsterdam, who worms his way into his trust. The acting is great throughout; though the plot is lacking focus and could easily have been shortened by more than half an hour. If the film is still interesting to watch, this is because of how it depicts New York life during the civil war: The competing police forces and fire fighting brigades (who prefer beating each other up to putting out fires, while the mob is plundering the burning building), the squalor next door to riches, the use of the military against rioters, the anti-immigrant sentiment and a lot else. This is all shown in vivid detail - fascinating!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An ordinary story concealed in an extraordinary shell,"Gangs of New York is an impressive film in many ways; chiefly visually, as it brings you back to the long gone infancy of New York City with its rivalling gangs, budding racism, and peculiar coalescence of progressing civilization and crude savagery. Filmed at a majestic custom-built studio in Rome, in which several blocks from 1860s New York were constructed, and saturated with archaic - and arguably well-researched - dialects and sociolects of English, Gangs of New York does indeed create a separate universe for itself; one that should have boded for a scintillating adventure about the history of the Big Apple.But although Scorsese definitely put effort into making an as comprehensive and detailed picture as possible, his film is also highly and strangely stylized - both in its staged and overdone set-pieces (such as the opening scene) and in characterizations (such as the Day-Lewis character). These are elements which Scorsese elevates and constantly puts to the front, but which ultimately don't have the purpose or weight to deserve such showboating. Take Daniel Day-Lewis' character, for instance - the film's antagonist and most flashy character. His performance has been applauded as the highlight of the film, but in my opinion it is caricatured and often bordering on counterproductive. Day-Lewis has abundances of captivating force and authority - you can't help but look at him - but he also puts too much into his performance, making his Butcher seem otherworldly instead of tangible. Like his There Will Be Blood character a few years later, he doesn't seem like a man that could have really lived.Our protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, played with usual intensity by Leonardo DiCaprio, does so, on the other hand. And it's through his endeavours that the film is able to draw us in with a bit of heart - in addition to the constant amazement Scorsese generates. His relationship with a sweet and surprisingly effective Cameron Diaz also threatens to become very effective, had it only been given a little more room to develop. When push comes to shove, however, what holds Gangs of New York back is the overall quality of the story. The film presents some rivalry and conflicts, magnifying them as best it can, and then adds a slight love story, a personal vendetta, and a grand finale. But for all the film's initial peculiarities, the impression it leaves in the end is one of standardized structure and run-of-the-mill narrative build-up. Gangs of New York is an ordinary story concealed in an extraordinary shell.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amusing Reactions,"Others crying ""Worst Film of The Year!"", ""Utter CRAP!!"", and ""Shamefully Awful!!"" make want to laugh. The fact is, Scorcese could direct a better film IN HIS SLEEP than ninety per cent of the cookie-cutter crap that floats down the Hollywood pike. Gangs has flaws, most definitely, but in all honesty it seems as though many were sharpening their knives before the film even recieved general release, salivating at the prospect of tearing apart a fallen cinematic great. Arguments levelled against it? A mish-mash of themes-welcome to new York, births of cities-and countries over all-don't come through easy-to-label moral triumphs. Unnecessary voice-over-I'll concede ground on this one. Overly long-Jeezum Crow, if you can't sit through three hours then you shouldn't go to the cinema. Nothing happened-the total, absolute opposite of the film; in fact, the film crammed so much in that it felt rushed at points. Historically innaccurate-I'd wager that Scorcese and those involved know roughly 100% more than anyone here about the birth of NY. Overly romanticised-the subplot with Diaz WAS superfluous, I'll give you that, but when you've got a character as complex in both subtelty and grandeur as Bill Cutting, thee's more than enough to outweigh that negative. Flawed, but still astonishing and above 95% of film-making today, GONY is a must-see. Don't be swayed by the gleeful nay-sayers, chattering away as if they're the be-all end-all of movie-going knowledge. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dicaprio's Accent is Very Inconsistent,"This movie was pretty good overall. It's a little long, but the plot keeps the movie interesting and your attention.

A Visually Striking but Uneven Historical Epic,"""Gangs of New York,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, is a sprawling historical epic that aims to capture the turbulent atmosphere of 19th-century New York City. With a star-studded cast and Scorsese's ambitious direction, the film presents a gritty and visceral portrayal of gang warfare and political corruption in the Five Points district. While it succeeds in many areas, it falls short in others, making for an uneven yet captivating cinematic experience.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Amsterdam Vallon, who seeks vengeance against Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), the ruthless leader of the native-born Americans who killed his father. DiCaprio delivers a solid performance, but it is Day-Lewis who steals the show. His portrayal of Bill the Butcher is mesmerizing and terrifying, bringing depth and complexity to a brutal character. Cameron Diaz as Jenny Everdeane provides a touch of romance and intrigue, though her character feels underdeveloped compared to the film's central figures.The film's greatest strength lies in its production design and visual presentation. Scorsese and his team recreate the Five Points with stunning detail, immersing the audience in the chaos and filth of the era. The costume design and cinematography are equally impressive, contributing to the film's authentic atmosphere.Scorsese's direction is ambitious, attempting to weave personal narratives with broader historical events, including the Civil War and the New York City Draft Riots. While these elements add a grand scale to the film, they sometimes overshadow the personal story at its heart, leading to a narrative that feels overstretched and unfocused at times.The screenplay, co-written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan, is rich with historical detail and complex characters but struggles with pacing. The film's length-nearly three hours-allows for an expansive exploration of its themes and characters but also results in periods of slow progression and tangential subplots.One of the film's criticisms is its historical accuracy, with some elements and characters being dramatized or fictionalized for narrative purposes. While this is not uncommon in historical epics, it has been a point of contention among historians and those familiar with the period.The score by Howard Shore effectively captures the mood and setting of the film, though it is not as memorable as the visual and narrative elements.In conclusion, ""Gangs of New York"" is a visually stunning and ambitious film that offers a gritty portrayal of historical New York. Its attempt to blend personal vendettas with significant historical events is commendable but results in a film that feels uneven in its storytelling and focus. Despite its flaws, the film is worth watching for Daniel Day-Lewis's powerhouse performance and the impressive recreation of a bygone era. It earns a solid 7 out of 10, standing as a testament to Scorsese's vision and the potential of historical epics to captivate and educate.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just as I remembered - good but could've been great,"I've returned to this film 20 years after first watching it. I remember it being full of fantastic performances but a pretty unnecessarily long film.It was as I recalled. You cannot even begin to describe this film without commenting the performance of Daniel Day Lewis. He commands attention like no other. The controlled anger and aggression he showed is frankly chilling. There are many great actors in this film such as Jim Broadbent. But as much as I admire Jim, he can't hold a candle to Daniel Day Lewis here.Di Caprio also demonstrates his class and shows why he is a modern day great. I love the fact that there are others such as the brilliant Stephen Graham playing great turns.The story is captivating if a little predictable. At its core, it feels like something we've seen before, but it's still incredibly watchable. The overall style and mood of the film sites a great job of capturing the sign of the times.This film was so close to being a 10 but for its length. Some characters or storylines could've been cut but surely there were countless opportunities to reduce this to just over 2 hours.You shouldn't be counting down for a great film to finish but in this case sadly you can't help it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Here's a Better Title: Stabby McStabfest,"Dialogue, anyone? Or perhaps people are satisfied that 90% of this movie contained lines such as, ""ARRRRGGGHHH!!"", ""AHHHHHH!!"" and ""ROOOOOOAR!"" And the real treat: 500 different ways to see sharp objects inserted into a human body! I don't care about extreme use of violence for the sake of art (or just good old fashioned entertainment!), but in Gangs of New York the violence neither furthers the plot nor makes us care about any of the characters. After viewing this movie I am left with the feeling that I have seen some crappy teen slasher film, only this time the characters wore period costumes and, instead of 90 minutes, the movie went on for 3 hours. However, if you cut out all the bludgeon/stabbing scenes, then this movie would only have 15 minutes worth of plot/ideas to work with, so I suppose the ""filler"" was necessary.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Impressive Scorsese epic marred by excessive bloodlust...,"Production-wise this is a richly produced epic of old New York focusing on gang rivalry in lower Manhattan circa 1860s, and the production values can't be faulted. Photography is expertly crafted, the main performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent (as a bloodthirsty villain called Billy the Butcher), and it is obvious that a great deal of research and historical detail was done to give credence to the story.Having said all that, the story could have been trimmed by at least an hour with some of the most graphic battle footage eliminated--and the effect would have been only slightly less startling. But Martin Scorsese has chosen to give the story a three hour running time to tell what is basically a tale of revenge that did not have to be amplified to include all of the bloated footage left in the final cut.It's clearly a film of murderous excesses and I can understand why the Academy chose not to give it the Best Picture Oscar.Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing in his intense portrayal of The Butcher. Cameron Diaz as the ""heroine"" seems to have a modern day look no matter what period she's supposed to be emoting in--and Leonardo DiCaprio is only semi-successful in his approach to the role of the avenging son of Liam Neeson. His accent comes and goes with each scene and is especially ""gone"" whenever he narrates parts of the tale. Both he and Diaz are clearly more at home in modern roles. Additionally, a more rugged looking actor would have suited the role better.But, as stated before, the main flaw is the excessive butchery which is bad enough in the opening scene where DiCaprio's father is dispensed with by the Butcher. After that, every so often, the camera lovingly captures scenes of mutilation and killing, lovingly capturing every thrust of a knife. For a film of three hours length, it is all too much.Most of the performances surrounding the leads are excellent but one in particular stands out--Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco who meets a cruel death in the hands of The Butcher. It's hard to believe this is the same ""little boy"" from E.T. He's excellent all the way through and should be commanding the screen in leading roles.Summing up: What could have been a great film is marred by excessive violence. There is indeed still such a thing as ""overkill"" and it's too bad Martin Scorsese never gets the message.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Largely based on the lives of two men, and the gangs that surround them in New York.","Definitely shows a different view of pre-industrialized America. The movie gave viewers the opportunity to think about America and the people living in it prior to the country becoming what it is today. Personally, I had not been aware of how large an aspect of life gangs played in major cities in the US. It is quite a long movie at almost 3 hours, so some parts could get a bit boring to some viewers, but as a whole, the movie is well made. The casting was done very well, the actors portrayed their characters accurately. Leonardo DiCaprio was a strong choice for the lead and showed his incredible acting abilities.

Martin Scorsese's tale of revenge and corruption comes with a grip,"From some of Martin Scorsese's crime classics over the past three decades, we have a seen the gritty and violent portrayal of life as a mobster thirsty for drugs and rank up the gangster ladder. This historical set piece however, sets the gangster genre in a whole another world that very few have seen before. This crime-drama takes us back to the Civil War-era when the South ran rampant with slavery and the North was left coping in mass corruption and crime. This soon lead to southerners rebelling against the Union that tried keeping slavery occupied while President Abraham Lincoln fought to abolish. This Martin Scorsese picture tells a grueling story of revenge and corruption in a gritty historical representation of New York, while tackling the gangster genre on an epic scale. Taking place in 1846 in the Five Points district of New York, young Irish immigrant Amsterdam (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) witnesses the cold-blooded murder of his father Priest Vallon (played by Liam Neeson) by the hands of Bill The Butcher (played by Danial Day- Lewis) who opposes the entrance of Irish immigrants in New York. Sixteen years pass, Amsterdam returns to the Five Points district where crime has ran rampant, riots run amok, and the town run by Bill The Butcher. There he meets an old acquaintance Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) who just so happens to work for Bill as well as pickpocket thief Jenny Everdeane (played by Cameron Diaz) who he develops a relationship with, while seeking revenge for his father's murder.Compared to Martin Scorsese's other works on his resume, this film doesn't reach the depth that makes it thoroughly compelling. Nonetheless, it is a captivating journey brought together by Jay Cocks' ambitious screenplay and the substance of Scorsese's direction. The beginning scene featuring the massive gang fight between the American natives and the Irish not only sets the story on an intelligent start but also offers one of the most pulse- pounding imagery ever put in a historical piece. The entire scene is exuberantly shot with powerful cinematography. With shots showing victims stabbed, sliced, and beaten with clubs and cleavers; it does get quite bloody and disconcerting to watch, but there is no denying the scene falls nothing of brilliance. The more ambitious aspect aside is the portrayal of the life in New York during the 1800s. The moody costume design, the flashy historical set design, and scenes featuring violent riots sum up to provide a deeply authentic representation of New York's nightmarish society during the Civil War-era. The narrative on the other hand, is where the film meets it's faults. Though the plot stand solid, there are a few places that lack substance. The romance between Leonardo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz is not what I say terrible or cheesy but feels a little out of place. Overall, the film overcomes these flaws with a captivating plot dealing on the 'good versus evil' story between Amsterdam and Bill The Butcher. The conflict between the two is, at both a physical and emotional level, rollicking from when they first meet eyes to the powerful climatic battle towards the end. Thanks to the performances by Leonardo Dicarprio and Daniel Day-Lewis, these leads simply soar; though Lewis serves as the biggest show stealer here with his tyrannical portray of the corrupt main antagonist. The performance he gives so arresting, it's quite scary.Gangs of New York is an ambitious and fascinating revenge tale by Martin Scorsese featuring some supremely memorable performances by a talented cast. While this isn't Scorsese's most compelling picture, it is definitely memorable. Yes, there is plenty of violence and bloodshed to experience, but it only showcases a realistic portrayal of New York during one of America's harshest periods in history.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"What an odd, odd film.","The first time I saw this movie was years ago but I decided not to write a review about it back then, since I felt that this movie had to be seen again before I could form a judgment about it. There had to be something I was missing and thought I might appreciate it way better the second time around. But no, my opinion really hasn't changed about it, now that I have seen the movie again.Of course I love Martin Scorsese just as much as any other movie lover but that doesn't mean I'm also in love with all of his projects. Yet this was a movie that got received well by most other critics at the time. Perhaps people were too scared to admit that the great Scorsese had delivered two disappointing movie project in a row, in a few years time. His previous movie ""Bringing Out the Dead"" was not received too well (which was a movie I still really liked by the way) and it was as if the movie world simply wouldn't accept the next great Scorsese project to be a failure as well. People were hungry for a great Scorsese again and it seemed like most minds were made up already before ""Gangs of New York"" got finally released. Same thing sort of happened with ""The Departed"", with as a big different that that movie indeed was a great one.But really, in all fairness and objectivity, this just isn't a great film. I really blame it on the concept, since it's also obviously hard to blame the talent behind the camera's or any of its magnificent cast-members.I just never understood Scorsese's fascination and passion for this project. He wanted to make this movie ever since the '70's but due to various different reasons it never fell through. I really don't understand this, since the concept of the movie is such a weird one and not in a good or fascinating kind of way. A bunch of lawless bums battling each other to the death in the streets of early New York? I don't really see the appeal of it to turn this into an historic drama. Yes, I know this all in one way or another got based on facts but that doesn't make the movie any more interesting to watch. It's just an odd concept, that doesn't appeal to me in any way.Because of this, I couldn't ever take interest in the story and anything that was happening in it, as well as for its characters, which I couldn't care less about really. And there really is no good reason for this movie to be nearly 3 hours long. It's just long because it wanted to be epic but it doesn't add much to the movie or its story really. Not that you'll easily get bored by this movie though. There still is plenty happening and the actors make sure you keep watching till the end.It's a movie that is much better known and appreciated due to its acting really. Daniel Day-Lewis is of course perfect, in his first movie role since his early retirement, which lasted only a few years. It doesn't matter who or what he plays, he also makes sure he totally becomes the character and puts everything into it. And yes, Leonardo DiCaprio was also quite good and this movie perhaps was the one in which he showed the world what a great talent he was. There were still a lot of nay-sayers at the time, which had everything to do with his role in ""Titanic"" and how much some people hated that movie. It's also a movie with a real solid supporting cast in it, that is also filled with big names, such as Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Liam Neeson and Brendan Gleeson.Thing that didn't worked out, which involved the movie its actors was the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. There absolutely was none really and you should wonder if this movie and its story actually did require to have a love story weaved into it. It probably could had made the movie a much shorter and more pleasant one if it got left out. It didn't really seem to suit the story in the first place anyway.On a more positive not again; thing that obviously stands out about this movie are its visuals. They very obviously did a great job with recreating the New York of mid-19th century. The movie has a very distinctive look and feeling to it, which is all due to the authenticity of it. The sets, make-up and costumes all really help to make this movie a visual spectacle and next to its acting, is the best thing about this movie.Perhaps I'm still missing something but this is far from a great, interesting or entertaining movie in my opinion.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Not perfect, but still recommended...","This film has been lurking in my DVD collection for some time now. The trouble is, it's hard to find the nigh on three hours required to watch this epic. Fortunately, having been ordered to take my holidays, or lose them, a day off provided the necessary time-slot. It's a movie with tremendous scope that shows a side of New York history I wasn't aware of. Although not perfect, it still has a lot going for it. But more of that later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please assume the crash position for the next paragraph).We begin in 1846 at the Five Points, a district of New York notorious for its poverty and for its gangs. A clash between two gangs, the 'Native Americans', predominantly white, who were born there and the 'Dead Rabbits', predominantly Irish immigrants, leaves the leader of the 'Dead Rabbits', 'Priest' Vallon, dead. His killer, leader of the other gang, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting shows mercy on his young son and sends him away. Sixteen years later the son, Amsterdam Vallon, returns to the Five Points seeking revenge, but prepared to bide his time. He decides to get close to Cutting and manages to do so with some great cunning. He meets Jenny Everdeane and falls for her, but she is indebted to Cutting and so Amsterdam, at first, spurns her, but we all know that isn't going to last. This is all told against the backdrop of the American Civil War and President Lincoln's plans to bring in a draft on the citizens of New York. There is a lot of feeling about this and the citizens are getting restless. Also, a politician, William 'Boss' Tweed is always trying to buy the votes of the residents of the Five Points by siding with Cutting on certain matters, a situation that doesn't go down to well with certain factions. Now, having infiltrated Cutting's inner circle, it's time for Amsterdam to strike and it's here I'll leave my short summary what? You didn't really expect me to give the ending away did you?... Shame.This is a beautifully made film; everything from the cinematography to the set design to the costumes is all really well done. Some great performances too, especially from Daniel Day-Lewis, as Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, it is a pleasure to watch every scene he is in. Also praiseworthy are; Leonardo DiCaprio as Amsterdam Vallon and Cameron Diaz as Jenny Everdeane. Honourable mentions also go to; Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed, John C. Reilly as Happy Jack Mulraney and Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco.I was afraid at first that this was going to be just another of those damned ""America loves everything Irish"" kind of movies, which I totally despise! Fortunately Scorsese knows better than that and what we get is a more balanced view of things (for a change). The film is a little too long for my liking and I found it quite easy to draw parallels with the likes of 'Goodfellas' and 'Once Upon A Time in America', but I can forgive that. It is enthralling throughout and a great visual spectacle, if just for the height of the top hats and Daniel Day-Lewis's moustache and trousers! They are tremendous!

"Mad, bad and deadly dull to watch","At a loose end in Vienna earlier this week (2 March 2003), my friend and I went into the English Cinema on Mariahilferstrasse to watch ""Gangs of New York"". I fear deeply not merely for the aesthetic judgement of the cinema-going public, but for its mental and moral health in receiving this dire, overlong, gratuitously violent farrago with anything less than utter derision.The ""plot"" (I use the term not merely loosely but with something that would verge, unenclosed with the requisite scare quotes, as intellectual fraudulence) has been described elsewhere on IMDb, so I shall not attempt, even if such an attempt were either possible or worthwhile, to corral the disjointed episodes of Scorsese's free fantasia into a semblance of order. Scorsese's name itself has become a kind of Open Sesame into the acceptance of people who ought otherwise to know better. I was never a fan; even ""Taxi Driver"" seemed to me a kind of early essay in the pornography of violence that has now become the stock-in-trade of most Hollywood directors. At least ""Taxi Driver"" was technically accomplished: well-filmed, well-acted, well-edited. Beyond the moderately impressive set designs and the pyrotechnics that appeal to four-year-olds of all ages, ""Gangs of New York"" is not even an averagely well-made movie. As for the acting, Di Caprio runs the full gamut of his repertoire from A to B, while Day Lewis is a Victorian melodrama villain who, were he not terrorising hapless street urchins with his cutlery collection and unconvincing New York accent, would be better occupied tying young ladies to railway tracks in the path of approaching steam locomotives. (Anyone casting a live-action movie of ""Wacky Races"" need look no further for Dick Dastardly!)There is no editing, no discipline, no sense of internal form or tempo; there is ""just one damn thing after another"". These damn things are violence, violence, gratuitous sex and more violence. There is no serious attempt to build character, nor any sociopolitical analysis of the immiseration of the various tribes of the Five Points beyond the sentimental exoneration of anyone who is not white, Anglo-Saxon, male, heterosexual and Protestant, and the vilification and calumniation of anyone who is. Straight WASP male - Boo!At the height of the draft riots I was reminded briefly of a far better movie: bloated WASP (boo!) David Hemmings's attempts to maintain a stiff upper-lip as his grand residence was besieged was a sillier re-run of the scene in ""Carry On Up The Khyber"", where the Raj feign indifference during ""tiffin"" to the invading natives.A rotten movie that glorifies anarchy and senseless violence. Avoid, avoid, avoid! I only give it 1 out of 10 because IMDb do not give me the option to give it 0.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mostly a let-down.. but with moments of brilliance,"Having read the other comments I have to say i agree with the majority... too long, Cameron character was shallow, Leo had a dreadful accent... However I think DDL's portrayal of Bill was outstanding, he sent shivers down my spine.. evil personified, quite brilliant.. and the only thing that kept me watching to the end.However, I may be thick, but was I the only one not to understand what he actually does to Leo with the knife???

Don't listen to the nay sayers! Cause it was great!,"Seems to me like there are mixed reviews about this movie. Well being a fan of scorsese, a history buff, and film violence etc. I set out to see this at its first showing at 12:15 at my new local theater. Now for all you people that want awesome character development, deep motives that you cleary understand and are spelled out and a romantic story and some grand epic like something David Lean did. Well you can just not go see this... Its not that kindav movie. If anything this reminds me of how they use to make epic films like the early 50's . What this reminds me of is mostly Sergio Leone movies (my personal favorite director)and the first 10 minutes were outstanding. After the Dead Rabbits come out to fight and stand in the street there is this great shot of paradise square. All you hear is the wind blowing and the streets are empty like those older western movies. The camera stays in position and out of a run down/burnt down building one by one the Nativists gang slowly creep out lead by the awesome Bill the Butcher (Lewis in a great role). They all have on their top hats with royal blue hat bands and royal blue sashes. Snow covers the ground. Bill's foot steps down and digs into the snow covered ground then kicks it behind him like a bull about to charge. The camera pans up and there he is in his big overcoat and great hat. It reminds me of ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" how that gang wear their big overcoats. OUTSTANDING! just like Leone would have done it... accept this had less glances and no big close ups :( . The film cuts to 16 years later and there is Leonardo Dicaprio. He fits the part of a tuff irish guy who is in his early twenties. Cameron Diaz is fine in a part that anyone could have played. The art direction/set decoration was great! Should win the oscar. The editing alright, Costumes awesome. Cinematography has its lil moments but nothing too incredible. Acting is good overall. I can't complain I loved this movie and will see it again. People don't knit pick this to death. That will ruin any movie. Don't expect stuff like scorsese has done before. As for people who like to complain about Intrussive music. Don't watch a Sergio Leone film cause the music is a huge part of it. Scorsese was trying to go for the opera like story. Please people stop complaing I'd love ten movies like this a year instead of the crap Hollywood has been churning out. This movie is really a western ...that takes place in New York. I enjoyed it alot. Don't expect this to be like other Scorsese movies. And violent. Not really not guts spilling out or knifes entering wounds. Or any alot of blood. Too bad. This isn't as violent as Saving Private Ryan's opening scene or Braveheart. Go see this its definately worth a look and don't knit pick it to death enjoy the experience..cause its another world. Keep up the good work Mr. Scorsese!May you get your oscar.. even if it is a pity oscar (Like Newman for Color of Money)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too blustery and overblown to be entertaining,"This remake of the 1938 Cruze film of the same title, seems rather over-wrought, pondered too deeply, and executed with an epic stylization which this work frankly did not deserve.While it is entertaining for a while, about half way through, you realize that the story, while poignant, is grossly overdone. So much so, in fact, that it virtually falls apart right before your eyes.""Those five points is a finger. When I close my hand, it becomes a fist."" Well duh! With ""winning"" dialog like that, what ever made me think it was trite?!DiCaprio is more than adequate in his portrayal, but this film honestly did not rate his efforts. Anyone could have played the part of Amsterdam Vallon just as well. While I am not a fan of DiCaprio's, I find that I am a fan of his work. His style is honest and forthright, giving both fans and casual viewers a frank and easy avenue through which to appreciate his work.But as I said, this work did not rate his performance, as it was too blustery and overblown to be entertaining.It rates a 6.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Born in the streets,"Gangs of New York takes a fascinating look at a largely forgotten slice of American history. As the film's tagline states, America was born in the streets. This is the tale of the 19th century Irish immigrants who came to New York City to build a new life for themselves and of the ""Natives"" who tormented them. Put ""Natives"" in quotation marks because they are not natives at all, their ancestors came over from Europe just as the Irish were doing now. But, led by the villainous Bill the Butcher, the Natives make life miserable for the poor Irish who are just trying to survive in New York's notorious Five Points slum. Bill the Butcher rules the Five Points with an iron fist, the Irish rally behind their own leader, Priest Vallon, to oppose him. The film opens with a battle in the streets, the Butcher's gang of Natives squaring off with the Priest's Dead Rabbits, his gang of Irishmen (and an Irish lady, the fearsome Hell-Cat Maggie). Carnage ensues, this is one of the most violent, blood-soaked scenes ever seen in any film. Brutal, raw violence, hand-to-hand combat which ends with Priest Vallon falling under the Butcher's knife. Young Amsterdam Vallon witnesses his father's death. He is sent off to the orphanage. He'll be back.16 years pass before Amsterdam returns to the Five Points. It is now 1862, the Civil War now rages and that war will come to touch the city. But the story the film follows is not of the grand scope of the great war but a smaller, more personal tale of Amsterdam's quest for vengeance. But it is not as easy as just turning up in the Five Points and stabbing Bill the Butcher while he sleeps. Bill is the king of the Five Points and you kill a king where everyone can watch him die. Amsterdam makes plans to kill the Butcher at the annual commemoration of the victory of the Natives over the Dead Rabbits. But that is months away. In the meantime Amsterdam falls under Bill's sway, rising to become the right-hand man of the unwitting Butcher who does not know the young man's true identity. Eventually the time will come when Amsterdam must make his move. And then things will explode.While the tale that Martin Scorsese tells here is a highly fictionalized account of what went on in the Five Points it is still a very worthy look at that unique time and place. The main storyline here may seem to be just a simple revenge story but there is so much else swirling around. Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher are not the only characters who have their own stories to tell. But it is the confrontation between those two characters which is at the heart of the film. That confrontation is made all the more fascinating by the fact they spend so much of the film as allies, Bill treating Amsterdam quite ironically almost as a son. Knowing Amsterdam's ultimate intentions you almost feel sorry for the Butcher. Almost. Because it is hard to generate true sympathy for this villainous, murderous man. An amazing character brought to life in a tour de force performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis plays the part with white-hot burning intensity. It would be a challenge for any actor to match him but Leonardo DiCaprio proves up to the task in the role of Amsterdam.The brilliant performance of Day-Lewis is the best thing the film has to offer but there is much more here to catch the eye. DiCaprio is excellent as well and a fine cast of supporting players chip in splendidly. Most notable are Brendan Gleeson as another Irishman who will cross the Butcher and Jim Broadbent as the gleefully corrupt Boss Tweed. John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Liam Neeson and a host of lesser-known performers help to bring the Five Points to life. Perhaps the only misstep is Cameron Diaz who never entirely convinces in her role of a woman caught between Amsterdam and the Butcher. Diaz is not awful by any means but her performance just seems off a bit, she never quite seems to fit the role. Another issue comes with the film's ending, the sense that the climax doesn't quite match the epic opening. But these are only minor quibbles with a generally excellent film. Scorsese tells his fascinating story well, eventually weaving the larger war story into the mix. We see not just a personal battle between two men but ultimately a nation indeed being born in the streets. Visually the film is a masterpiece, Scorsese filling the frame beautifully. The bloody opening battle sets the tone for both the film's story and its look. The story holds your interest throughout and the look of the piece is just remarkable, the Five Points brought to brilliant life. This is a story which demanded to be told and that story could not have been placed in any better hands than those of Scorsese. This film does justice to those history has largely forgotten, those who through their working, living and dying built America.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Visually OK and some very good acting, too bad the story didn't completely convince me","My advice to everybody who wants to hear it: beware of movies that get hyped by the media and marketing campaigns. Most of the time you'll be very disappointed by this movies, not because they are bad, but only because you expect way too much of it. And it was exactly the same with this movie. It was announced as the best movie of 2002 (In my opinion that is 'The Pianist', but everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion of course), if not ever and that is certainly not the truth. I'm not saying it is a bad movie, it just isn't that great.The main reason why it isn't all that great is because the story is a bit weak, at least during the first two hours it is. The film starts in 1846, when two gangs, the ""Dead Rabbits"" and the ""Natives"" get involved into a major gang war. The people who were born in the USA call themselves the ""Natives"", the ""Dead Rabbits"" are the Irish immigrants (don't ask me where that name comes from, I don't know and I find it a rather stupid name for a violent gang, but perhaps it has a deeper meaning that I don't know), who are shipped to New York by the thousands. When the leader of the Dead Rabbits is killed by the leader of the Natives, the war for New York's Five Points has been fought. But the son has seen his father die and all he can think about is revenge. In 1863, when released from an institution, he joins the gang of the Natives, so he can finally avenge his father's death...I have to admit that these gang wars don't interest me all that much. I mean, is this based on true events or was it just made up by the writers of the script so they would have an interesting story to tell that also shows the lawlessness of those days? I don't know, but it just didn't appeal to me all that much. However, what I did like in the story was the uprising against the Draft for the Civil War. I'm mostly interested in WWI and WWII, but I find the Civil War interesting as well. Apparently the fact that so many people were enlisted while they just set a foot on land really happened and was interesting to watch.Even though the story isn't the real star of the movie, I must admit that visually this movie was absolutely beautiful. The way everything was portrayed makes clear that we are dealing with a master here (not that I've ever doubted about Scorcese's talent). And the movie did not only look good, the acting in it was also very good. I was especially surprised by Cameron Diaz' performance. I must admit that she did a nice job in this movie, as did Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis.All in all I would say that this isn't a bad movie, but that it could have been better. Visually it was all OK and the acting was nice, but the story could have been better. That's why I give this movie a 7/10, perhaps a 7.5/10, but certainly nothing more than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Painful,How did this movie get all these awards?   We found it excruciating slow and painful to watch.   It was all about shots of the period.  They must have spent a fortune on the sets.

A festival of overacting,"A festival of overacting, over-the-top, and gratuitous violence. The plot is predictable and monotonous. Worst of all this film gives me a tremendous sense of a missed opportunity. So much movie; so little outcome.The plot left us only two possible Hollywood endings, the first that Amsterdam would kill Bill the Butcher and the second that he would be unable or unwilling to kill him when a position to do it because of conscience or a growing mutual or unilateral affection. A possible variation of the second might be that he had to kill Bill though he no longer wanted to do so. The ending turned out to be the cheap and predictable choice, since that's what the audience had been conditioned to want by Bill's evil antics and Scorsese's manipulation. But it went as flat as a Perrier that's been standing too long.If, as Francis Bacon put it, 'revenge is a dish best eaten cold', Amsterdam almost carried it, but the act of revenge itself was an anti-climax because of the violence which preceded it. Certainly, when compared with the drama of a build-up to a denouement in westerns like High Noon, it paled. Scorsese fell into the deep crevasse between drama (well, melodrama, if you want) and documentary, so the violence of the riot also served to numb us to the supposed climax. Bill the Butcher, so flamboyant and threatening, went out with a whimper on the hilarious line, 'At least I died an American'. Stanley Kubrick would laugh; Peter Sellars howl. My stomach turned. Could the millions of dollars not buy a better exit line? Daniel Day-Lewis was so far over the top, he must have suffered from vertigo for weeks after. A patch over his eye, a crutch under his arm and a parrot on his shoulder and he would have been a great Long John Silver in a Christmas pantomime on Blackpool Pier. I expected at any moment to hear 'Aye, Jim lad' or 'Avast there me hearties'. Alas, no. This was far worse. And the accent, surely not of the 19th century, but of thirties gangster movies, its only function to mark Bill as a 'native'? What a pity none of the other 'natives' spoke like that, failing which the various groups should have been color coded with rosettes or given football shirts.If Day-Lewis was over the top, most of the other characters were no more than cardboard cutouts. Di Caprio showed he has not developed his acting ability since that appalling production of 'The Man in the Iron Mask' in which he played the most forgettable Prince Louis in the long history of swashbucklers. He was little different to his character in 'Titanic', talked in the same way, moved in the same way, and appeared to be thinking in the same way. Robert Redford's handsome sameness had an attractive quality. This sameness has none. It is dull in its shallow dourness. Nor has it gone further in 'Catch me if you Can'. Hollywood needs better acting from its young stars: good looks, though they may capture the hearts of schoolgirls for a while, do not make for enduring careers at the top without talent. James Dean had both but made the unfortunate career move of dying so we cannot judge a later career. Di Caprio, alas, does not. Put a stone on him, a few inches on his waistline, and his fans will disappear, if they haven't deserted in droves already.On the one hand, Amsterdam bore too lightly the Orestian imperative to revenge his father, and on the other had no Shakespearian qualms of conscience. Rounded characters have doubts and conscience like real people, but then Scorsese is not Shakespeare, nor is he John Ford, who could give his great western characters a humanity and a depth fathoms deeper than any shown by Scorsese in this film.Where's The Method in all this acting? Lee Strasberg would turn in his grave. What will they think of it all down at The Actor's Studio? Maybe they'll develop The New Method, of which lesson one would begin, 'Put on a phony and grimace fiercely.' This was not acting, it was performing. This was not film; it was pantomime.It was also morality play with Day-Lewis as Satan, Di Caprio a type of Christ about his father's business, and Diaz as Mary Magdalen, with a supporting cast of predictable and grimacing devils of various shades of evil, for, unlike Dickens or Dostoyevsky, nothing good seemed to shine out in The Five Points.Hollywood being what it is, there will be mutual backslapping with award after award, but when the scented smoke of self-congratulation clears, this will be seen as an inferior movie with much less in it than meets the eye. However, as the young man who runs my local DVD rental shop told me, 'It's Scorsese, so you have to see it!' Nicholas Dunne-Lynch 2004.",,Anonymous,Crime

Honestly underrated,"I feel like Gangs of New York is worthy of some critical reappraisal. It's been long enough, and I think it's mostly stood the test of time. It's generally seen as good, but not great, and I think that even with its flaws, it's actually excellent. The performances of DiCaprio and Diaz sometimes get criticized, but I just think that's a consequence of having to share the screen with Daniel Day-Lewis, who's giving one of his best-ever performances here. This might've been the first Day-Lewis movie I ever saw, and I was instantly a fan.It's one of many historical films by Scorsese where he says ""Yeah, America has always been ugly and violent, defined by war, corruption, and crime, and this is how/why,"" and I continually find myself impressed by how willing he is to not sugarcoat anything. Watching every movie of his set in New York City in order of when they're set would be fascinating. I also got to thinking about how many of his films are set in the past, and if I'm not mistaken, the mid-2000s is as late an era as he's ever explored in one of his movies (in The Departed). He's never made anything sci-fi-related, and I don't think he's ever made a war movie... but Gangs of New York is the closest he's come to making the latter. The final 15 to 20 minutes are especially chaotic.While keeping things vague, at about the 90 to 100-minute mark, the main plot almost revolves but then keeps going, but in the background a bit before the climax. I think that's the film's biggest weakness. You can feel the momentum and energy deflate a little, but things are redeemed by the film's end. I think it might have my favorite final scene of any Scorsese movie (I even like the U2 song which, going by what other people say, might be a hot take?). The ending has always been memorable for me, and looking at some of the things the film explores while thinking about what happened in New York City around the time of the film's release is haunting. The opening scene is also incredibly impactful, and Day-Lewis is just phenomenal; it's worth stressing that again (great supporting cast here, too).I love the way this film looks, sounds, and feels. The production design is immense, and I appreciate how you can see the huge budget on screen in almost every moment. It's a big, unwieldy, and sometimes messy film (I wonder if Scorsese wanted it to be 3+ hours, because some scenes feel a bit chopped down), but I still think so much of it's great, and believe it's overall better than some give it credit for.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A celebration of violence.,"Violence can be absolutely fascinating. Scorsese knows this all too well. Look back at his career and you can see some of the most malevolent behavior captured on film. Gangs of New York plays out like a big; colorful orgy of despicable characters doing rotten things in a truly wicked environment. There are lags in the action to be sure, and there are at least attempts at character development, but when it's finally over, all you're likely to remember is the violence. Or perhaps you'll still be in awe of Daniel Day-Lewis, as I was. And why not? His character was the most violent.Gangs of New York is a film that cannot figure out what it's really about. It's about a lot of things, but there seems to be an absence of any central theme or idea. Is it about a young man scheming about getting revenge for his father's murder? Sometimes. Is it about the struggle between early immigrant gangs and gangs of people born in the USA? Sometimes. Is it about political corruption? Sometimes. Is it about draft riots during the civil war, and the Union's inability to convince people who hate blacks to die for them? Sometimes. There are also scenes dedicated to fire brigades, stealing from rich people, and public hangings, too. Only in the film's final scenes does it attempt to bring all of these things together.I'll grant Scorsese the benefit of the doubt and tell the world he did a fine job of depicting how violent New York was during the 19th century. If his film was trying to tell me something more, I guess I missed it.So sayeth the Hound.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Violent and pointless trawl through the gaslight NY gutter of yesteryear.,"In 1846 a boy sees his father killed in a gang battle on the Five Point slums of New York and grows up intent on patient and cold blooded revenge.Only Martin Scorsese could get this pointless and expensive pot-boiler made and only the presence of a top class actor like Daniel Day-Lewis stops it from falling apart at the seams. God bless him for taking the role, he couldn't be bad in anything even if he tried.While fortunes have been spent on the setting (very convincing too) what goes on in the foreground is backside achingly dull. MS seems to know it too and the only thing he can think of is to throw in lots of violence, sex and pop music (yes you read me right!) hoping to spice up the tasteless and banal life-on-the-street soup.This is a Dickensian world of thieves, gangs, corruption and intrigue, but despite having three writers it has no soul and no depth. Charles Dickens took us to the underworld but we got a sense of time, place and purpose among the downbeats and the downtrodden. Here we have only cartoons (corrupt cop, corrupt politician, big bad boss, etc.). We are stuck on no-hope street - you are born stupid, live stupid and die stupid. Usually in some violent and over-the-top way.Leonardo DiCaprio is a problem because he is not much of an actor. Good looking and high cheek-boned he has not had his ""Born of the Fourth of July"" - where Tom Cruise won an Oscar nomination and proved he could, if pushed, act a bit. His character is stupid and uneducated, but smearing dirt on your face and voicing words in cod Irish (that is what it sounds like anyway) is not really acting and doesn't carry the weight of the picture at all.Daniel Day-Lewis is supposed to be the arch villain but we are with him all the way because he is the only one doing anyway remotely interesting or having anything remotely interesting to say! Cameron Diaz dyes her hair red and plays an Irish pickpocket, but seems a bolt-on to establish the leads heterosexuality.The film had production difficulties and you can see why. You can almost hear them in the screening room whispering ""this isn't working - this isn't working"" as you watch the film. The book may have have seemed fascinating and historical in print (to Martie anyway), but has little impact on the screen. Losers, lose - but before they lose they fight, screw and shout at each other a lot.I was glad when the last throat had been slashed and the last drop of blood had run down the snowy NY gutter, because it fell short of cheap TV on the entertainment front and had precious little to offer as a history lesson.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scorcese had the chance to make a new classic, but you never feel that what is going on is real (when much of it actually was of course), we spend the whole film waiting for the anti-climactic showdown. I enjoyed the film, but can see why it wasn't a box-office success (as it should have been with all those big names) and didn't win any Oscars. Too many disparate threads, too ambitious too cheesy.

It takes a lot of the viewer to work through Leonardo's acting problems.As a period piece it works very well - the set design, costumes, etc. are spot on. Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant here, not wasting the rich character he is given. Other bit parts are not bad, but feel a little tacked-on in spots.The primary problem, IMHO, is the off-the-shelf plot.

Everything About This Film Is Overshadowed By Daniel Day-Lewis' Astonishing Performance,"Beginning the director-actor collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio on a promising note, Gangs of New York paints a fascinating portrait of its era and is a meticulously researched period drama but pretty much everything about it is overshadowed by the exceptional performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.Set in mid-19th century New York, the story of Gangs of New York follows an Irish immigrant who witnessed his father being murdered by the leader of an opposing gang as a kid and returns to the place years later to avenge his death. Meanwhile, the forced conscription in the ongoing Civil War ultimately leads to city wide riots.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the 19th century New York comes to cinematic life in splendid detail and is a result of painstaking research & era appropriate set pieces. Scorsese's direction has the drama going up & down throughout its runtime, for many segments are highly engaging while others are poorly handled & tediously paced.Production design team does a spectacular job at transporting the viewers back to its timeline and the entire cityscape has an authentic feel to it. Camera is expertly operated, utilising many of the director's trademarks. The pace only gets worse as plot progresses plus there are many scenes that the film could have done without. And Howard Shore turns in a fitting score.Coming to the performances, Gangs of New York is spearheaded by a memorable showcase from Daniel Day-Lewis whose rendition of Bill the Butcher easily ranks amongst his finest acts. Leonardo DiCaprio also chips in with a strong input in his supporting role and so does the rest of the cast but none of them hold a candle to Day-Lewis magnetic screen presence & sheer commitment to his role.On an overall scale, Gangs of New York nails the period details of its story but the drama isn't entirely compelling and the only aspects that keep it together are its historical depictions & Daniel Day-Lewis' electrifying performance. Opening on a violent, chaotic & instantly gripping note but losing its grasp in the middle, Gangs of New York impresses in bits n pieces but it's nonetheless worth a watch for Day-Lewis' riveting act alone.",,Anonymous,Crime
gangs of new york,"Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young Irish immigrant released from prison. He returns to the Five Points seeking revenge against his father's killer, William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), a powerful anti-immigrant gang leader. He knows that revenge can only be attained by infiltrating Cutting's inner circle. Amsterdam's journey becomes a fight for personal survival and to find a place for the Irish people in 1860's New York. Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical drama film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of Lower Manhattan in 1863. The film was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan, inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1927 non-fiction book, The Gangs of New York. It was made in Cinecittà, Rome, distributed by Miramax Films and nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture.Most of the film takes place in 1863. The two principal issues of the era in New York were Irish immigration to the city and the ongoing Civil War. The story follows Bill ""the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) in his roles as crime boss and political kingmaker under the helm of ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). The film culminates in a violent confrontation between Cutting and his mob with protagonist Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his allies, which coincides with the New York Draft Riots of 1863.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is fascinating.,"One of the best films made by Scorsese. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a solid performance (one of the best I've seen in years) and ofcourse the direction. What I love about Scorsese is the fact that he makes violence look frightening and that's really how it is, unlike in movies like James Bond series, or XXX that make the audience think of it as funny(cool) scenes, which it really is not. Violence is horrible and that's how it should be pictured, unlike some would say. The movie's powerful scenes performed by Day-Lewis are startling, dazzling and stunning, which at one point was so realistically shocking that stunned me transfixed on the seat for minutes. Certainly an oscar worthy picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Daniel Day-Lewis Is Too Good,"Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show in Gangs of New York as the antagonist, Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. His performance is so unbelievably enjoyable that the audience becomes more excited to see him on the screen than the protagonist, Amsterdam Vallon (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). The plot is Scorsese's take on a simple revenge plot, but Day-Lewis' portrayal of the villain turns that on its head with more of his brilliant acting. It also doesn't hurt that he is in a movie that ""stars"" Cameron Diaz, who is less-than-mediocre, especially in this movie. Her performance is incredibly unbelievable, and it still baffles me that Scorsese trusted her acting.The other major problem that I find with this movie is that it is cluttered with details. Scorsese's ambitions were too high for this film, in my opinion, and it shows quite brightly. There are too many characters, accents, and historical events taking place to actually have a real focus to the film. The tension is unclear because there are so many different things happening at once. It's really messy. Because of this, it felt like I was watching a movie, rather than being immersed in a story, because I had to try with intent to understand the different levels of the film.Pros: - Daniel Day-Lewis' acting - Editing - Decent cinematography - Costume/wardrobes - Portrayal of mid-19th century politicsCons: - Cluttered/messy - The acting (besides Day-Lewis) - Length of the movie - Screenplay (at times, characters' reactions were unrealistically written) - No driving tensionI would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an electrifying performance by one of the greatest contemporary actors. But do not go into this movie thinking that it is like Scorsese's other films. It doesn't compare to Goodfellas or The Departed, but it's worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow,"Again I say wow.  I'm not big on long movies, or historical flicks, or films about war.  This movie, however, is an exception. This move was truly amazing.  This film genuinely moved me.  The story was full and effective and meaningful.  A TRUE rarity in this day and age. Daniel Day-Lewis was powerful and convincing in this role, I was genuinely afraid of his character.  Leo, who I usually find to be over-the-top and false, also shined in the outstanding cinematic masterpiece. In many ways this movie took lesser-known occurrences in the time frame of the Civil war and prepackaged them for consumption by the mass public, without slandering the historical or human value of what happened. I am impressed.  I won't say that Hollywood doesn't make good movies anymore.  Well, not for a while.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not as great as I had hoped for.,"Despite a lot of big names, a superb director and many nominations, this movie isn't 'great'. I had my hopes up high, but found it to be just above average. The only thing keeping it going was the absolutely riveting performance by Daniel Day Lewis. Cameron Diaz was very good as well and, excuse my gender, regardless of her abilities, always a pleasure to look at. Leonardo DiCaprio was, well... rather boring, not believable and therefor distracting.The movie's tagline (""America Was Born In The Streets"") made me frown, but maybe you have to be an American to appreciate that kind of sentiment. IMO not a bad movie at all, but I had the feeling it could have been much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Portrays the Time,"Gangs of New York does is a great movie to watch if you want to know what life was like in New York during the Civil War. Though it may exaggerate some parts, it has the basics down. It shows that many ""native"" Americans were angered with the arrival of so many Irish immigrants and how everyone felt of the draft. It accurately portrays the extent to which the poor felt their rights were being infringed upon by the draft, especially when the rich could buy their way out of it. I thought they did a good job of portraying the violence and tension between groups in the area at the time. Although, it's doubtful that there was so much unjustified violence as shown in the movie. The characters did appear to fit in with the times well though. Their speech, including lingo of the time, and appearance did reflect the time well. Though it isn't the most historically accurate movie out there, I thought it did well to portray the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Some things,"On the whole, i don't see anything other than the massive sets and period-piece details that are exceptional in this movie.The directing/editing have some bizarre and laughable choices, but generally have a larger michael bay-style issue, in which the camera simply can't stay put, and is desperately trying to make every shot far more intense than it needs to be, especially the quiet ones.The story was just awful. It's a criminally simplistic revenge plot, one that can't work for a movie with a runtime longer than two and a half hours.The historical fiction aspects were subtle background elements for nearly the whole film, until the end, when they're tacked on - still at arms' length from the main plot.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Timeless Villain is Born,"Gangs of New York is a movie felt by many to be a turn in the career of legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. It's dark and threatening tone paints a glum portrait of 19th century New York, drawing forth a pre-emptive revenge tale at the heart of the broken city.Leonardo DiCaprio generates a career changing performance as Amsterdam, a distraught Irish orphan, plagued by the loss of his war-lord father (Liam Neeson) at the hands of the truly menacing William Cutting, or known by his 'street' alias, ""Bill the Butcher"" (an unforgettable Daniel Day-Lewis in his most iconic role). It is of course Day-Lewis who truly steals the show, ripping the shards of emotional drama from under the squelching shoes of an older, maturer DiCaprio than seen previously. This outing, boiling the former child-actor in bloodied fury, forcing his supposed unsalvageable career into a whole new league of adult- orientated entertainment.Scorsese slices open the heart of American history, heaving its nasty past onto the screen in all its glory for all to see, unflinching in his presentation. The opening scene alone is a shower of gore and uncensored warfare, setting up the generic tale of ""keep your friends close but your enemies closer"" which takes place 16 years later. Having watched his father butchered by the leader of the gang known as the ""Natives"", a now older, tougher Amsterdam forces himself into the hands of controlling mob-boss Cutting who playfully jests with the vengeful soul. At 160 minutes, the film twists this story with inserts detailing the corruption and hardships of post-modern America, with focus particularly on the Civil War. This is Scorsese's unfortunate downfall, forcing an unrelated history lesson down the throats of the viewer when what he really should be doing is featuring more of the demented villain in all his unrelenting power. From the first glimpse of his curled moustache, William Cutting is an instant bad-ass, his menacing grace projected into the thoughts of the viewers at all times, his looming spirit ever-present. He is the true saviour of this, at times, sour tale of generic redemption.By the time the Third Act final rolls in, boredom has spread and Scorsese's raw desire to leave nothing out becomes a hideous nuisance. So it was truthfully very wise for the master to leave the best for last. The final part of the film ditches the previous tripe at the road side, striking up a new angle on the tale of revenge (which frankly, he should have used from the start and made the movie an hour shorter) and fronting the finale with a war to end all wars. It is here when the film truly hits its stride, shamefully a mere 40 minutes before the end leaving this writer questioning the story-boarding skills of one Jay Cocks. An epic closure to the tale does however ensue, although the final battle more anti-climactic than expected, the departure of one character disappointingly average.Overall, Scorsese's bloodied mirage of a forgotten New York City is an intense but emotionally forgettable experience. Overly long and full of tiresome historical pieces, the film lacks the gruelling and torturous finale it deserved and presented too many careless loose ends (Cameron Diaz becoming a non-essential lump of furniture within the tale). By no means a masterpiece but still a fantastic turn for the legendary director and a career-high for both Day-Lewis and DiCaprio, even if they did lack the powerful, crazed scenes which were hinted at several times throughout the script. The un-forgiving violence never lets up, providing a truthful take on an unknown story, pushing forth an original picture. Don't be fooled by the awards binge, this is no Oscar worthy delight, but an easily watchable and gruesomely memorable thriller.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unmitigated dross,"Marty's gang prangWell, it looks as though I'm going to be in a minority, but here goes, anyway. Personally I can barely believe this the same director who made such stunning, if not always likeable, American classics as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Two hours 45 minutes of unmitigated dross is enough to make one call into question 30 years of cinematic history.Gangs of New York is loosely based on the gang warfare of the poverty-stricken Five Points and Bowery areas of New York during the mid-19th century, before and during the Civil War. Though very loosely based on real characters and events, Scorsese and screenwriter Jay Cocks have treated the base material with wild imagination, and the result is a hackneyed, cliché-ridden, cartoonish debacle with little convincing social or political context.The design is sumptious and clearly very expensive - though rather 'Paint Your Wagon' - but there are few of Scorsese's trademark artistic flourishes. The only scene of real power, rather than overwhelming theatricality, is one in which Irish immigrants arriving on the quayside are given citizenship, drafted, put in uniforms and then loaded back onto ships - troopships - as the coffins of Civil War dead are simultaneously unloaded.The film was made entirely in the CineCitta film studios in Rome, and the sets never look anything but what they are. Where one felt one could almost smell the opulence of the monied class in The Age of Innocence, the slums, dirt and crumbling buildings here are pure theme park.Meanwhile, the opening scene of an 1846 gangfight, which sets up the remaining, predictable two-and-a-half-hour plot, is laughable in its comic-book incompetence - almost as though a film-school first-termer, having been given a couple of hundred extras, had just told them to stand around on a soundstage and pretend to strangle each other, while he sprays tomato ketchup over the lot.After the intensity of battle scenes created for films like The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan and TV's Gettysburg and Band of Brothers, not to mention the work of action directors like Walter Hill, this is a throwback to Forties and Fifties-style filmmaking. But even the punch-up between John Wayne and Victor MacLaglen in The Quiet Man was more realistic.Also laughably bad is the firefighters' gangbang, while there are several scenes that seem, for some reason, to have been speeded up, Keystone Cops style. The voice-over during the climactic (and unconvincing) draft riots is deeply embarrassing - one almost expects Forties-style spinning newspaper headlines. Beyond some snatches of Irish folk music, the soundtrack - U2? - is hideously out of place.Leonardo Di Caprio is hopelessly miscast as a (supposedly) hardened, revenge-seeking son of Kerry, while Daniel Day Lewis, in curly moustache like the villain of a Victoria melodrama, is as menacing as a Woolworths Star Wars light sabre, without the batteries. Cameron Diaz barely registers, and though Jim Broadbent is OK as the corrupt Tammany Hall kingpin, William 'Boss' Tweed, it's hard to believe his character could wield any political clout.This is Scorsese's Far And Away, with ketchup, but its sheer scale will make it an Oscar contender. It would be sadly ironic, though, if this was the film that finally won Marty the prize.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Brutal, Rough and Enthralling.",Gangs of New York expertly crafts a violent and poverty stricken picture of civil war era New York that is rarely scene. In Gangs of New York Gangs butcher each other for control over turf and shakespearean style revenge schemes are forged.Gangs of New York's set design and actors give the film a gritty and uncomfortable atmosphere which carries the film through its long run time. Daniel Day-lewis's Butcher is a notable example of a character who keeps the film interesting throughout.Despite this certain characters are not very entertaining which would be acceptable if they were vital to the plot but most are not. Either a character is fascinating and adds to the world Scorsese makes or is just there to be there. Gangs of New York is wholly worth viewing for the world it creates and the characters that inhabit it.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Hands that Built America,"1840s. Natives and Irsih Americans fight to the death in New York, resulting in the death of Irish leader Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) and Native Bill The Butcher's (Daniel Day Lewis) undisputed rule of the city's criminal underworld. Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Di Caprio) escapes. and after growing into an anonymous young man, returns to reap his revenge, yet unwittingly becomes the butcher's protégé...Scorsese was bringing a long treasured project to the screen with Gangs, creating a hype that suffered from setbacks, delayed releases and mixed reviews. In hindsight what we have is no masterpiece, but it remains an undeniably good film, with many fine qualities to make up for its flaws.Scorsese's recreation of the city is stunning: the level of detail completely immerses the viewer into an atmosphere scarcely read of in History books. Moreover, the rich criminal world depicted here maintains a delicate balance of understandability and chaos. Scorsese couples this with his flair for music to create a truly intoxicating mood. The photography reinforces the overall effect tenfold, wonderfully sustained and carrying scattered sparks of pure genius. For example: in one shot, Scorsese pans from newly arrived immigrants who are welcomed, given the nationality, provided a uniform, and enlisted into the Union army to coffins of dead soldiers being unloaded on another peer.Ultimately, a film lives or dies by its screenplay and acting, and herein lies Gangs of New York's polarizing point. Whether you focus on the slightly uneven story (oddly shortened in places by pressured editing) or the fantastic performances will determine whether Gangs makes it or breaks it, but for its sheer visual power and acting it deserves to be seen. Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly are all a joy to see when on top form, but the true feast here is Daniel Day Lewis's grand-standing, violent and xenophobic Bill The Butcher. A role that Robert De Niro (for whom it was originally intended over the years) near his peak might not have done justice to.See it, make up your mind. The chances of this film becoming a favorite are slim, but at the very least you'll walk away with an indelible character to remember.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Messy,"This is Martin Scorsese's biggest and messiest movie. This is a massive and dense history lesson of a largely forgotten moment and series of cultures in America's largest city. Amidst all the gangs, politicians, historical conflicts, and recreations is the story of a young man's search for vengeance. The movie's spilling over the sides, and I imagine that Scorsese's original four hour cut of the film might have worked better, especially on the back end, but this wealth of riches is so thoroughly entertaining and the different pieces tied together effectively enough that while it may be somewhat imperfect, I find it to be an endlessly fascinating and compelling watch.The story begins in 1846 when the leader of the Irish gang, the Dead Rabbits, ""Priest"" Vallon, decides that he and his people cannot take any more abuse from the Nativist gangs, led by William ""The Butcher"" Cutting of the Bowery Boys. Before getting into any real story, though, this movie thrusts a lot of its greatest assets into the audience's face from the forefront. Filmed on a giant set at the Roman movie studio Cinecitta, where Fellini, one of Scorsese's main inspirations and, at for the last few years of the Italian's life, friend, had filmed everything he had made since Nights of Cabiria, Gangs of New York is simply a marvel to look at. The sets, designed by Danet Ferretti, have incredible depth from looks down the street to into every shop and building. There's dirt and grime in every nook and cranny. There are hundreds of extras, all in incredibly detailed period costumes, across so many shots. This represents an inflection point in Scorsese's career where he was suddenly able to command huge budgets (the closest up to this point was the $50 million, no mean amount, he used to make Casino). Since, he hasn't made a movie for less than $80 million except for the passion project Silence, which he made for $46 million.The opening battle between the Irish and the Natives in the Five Points is a direct reference to Orson Welles' Battle of Shrewsbury in Chimes at Midnight in that it's made up almost entirely of individual pieces of violence. At the time that Welles made his decision to film his key battle like that, it was a budgetary concern since he never had enough money for more than a hundred extras at a time, not nearly enough people to pull the camera back and show the movements of battle with any degree of conviction. Scorsese uses the tactic for a different reason though. This is a massive street brawl. The couple of time we pull back from the intimacies of the bloodshed, we see that there are no strategies or tactics involved. It's just two masses of people who want to tear at each other's flesh flying at each other and attacking. In the end, The Butcher strikes Vallon down in front of Vallon's small son, who gets sent to Hellgate to spend the next sixteen years.The opening functions as a prologue to the actual story, that of the son, Amsterdam Vallon, returning to the Five Points as a young man to exact vengeance for his father's death. In order simply survive, Amsterdam hitches up with a young man, Jimmy, who is a very low level member of one of the gangs that reports up to the Butcher, who has now consolidated his power to the point where Boss Tweed of Tammany Hall has to reach out and look for his support. Amsterdam ends up impressing the Butcher through some public displays of bravery and an inventive use of a corpse, creating the ironic situation of Amsterdam being taken under the wing of the man he's set out to kill.Up until Amsterdam decides to make his move against the Butcher, this movie feels like it's building towards something very specific, and we're waiting for all the pieces to come together. Scorsese seems to have built this film like a traditional epic, and there's even a spot for an intermission that feels like it really should have had an Entr-acte. At the annual celebration of the priest's death, when the Butcher killed the last man worth remembering him having killed as he says, Amsterdam makes his move, but his friend Jimmy had given him up out of jealousy and the Butcher maims and tortures Amsterdam in return. It's this moment, where the screen suddenly goes to black, that feels like was build for an Intermission. The way the next scene starts up, very quietly with a doctor coming into the catacombs to treat the wounded Amsterdam, feels like it was the start of a second act. What I'm saying is that I wish this had been given the Roadshow Release it deserved.All of this happens at about an hour and forty minutes in, leaving about an hour of time to cover the rest of the story, and the rest of the story was not that small. Where this movie got cut down was pretty obviously more heavily focused on this back end than the front. The idea of running Monk for sheriff is brought up, quickly dealt with, and then quickly moved on in about fifteen minutes. The bravura election sequence feels too short, and it was obviously meant to help build the conflict out from just Amsterdam against the Butcher to the second instance of the larger fight between the Irish and the Natives. That build up feels truncated, like Harvey Weinstein forced Scorsese to limit the actual scope of the build up in the second half in order to hit a particular run time. Weinstein described at the time his fights with Scorsese as worthless and a string of defeats for himself, but I kind of doubt that. The second half of the film makes it feel like Scorsese lost some battles in the editing room to his producer.The finale of the film is dominated by a recreation of the Draft Riots of 1863, where a mob raged for several days in response to Lincoln's draft for 30,000 troops to help fill out the then damaged Union Army. What's really interesting is how Amsterdam and the Butcher, racing headlong into their final showdown, don't care at all about the grander issues swirling around them. They're so myopic that when they face down each other in the streets for one final time with their gangs behind them the larger battle intercedes completely unexpectedly, even though the temperature of the city has been raising for weeks because of the draft. The ending is a sort of explanation for why the history dramatized had been forgotten. The gangs that helps forge the city were wiped out by more national concerns, and happily forgotten by Tammany Hall. Whether this has much to do with the actual history, I doubt, but it is a strangely sad little ending as the gangs suddenly come to each others' aid as the Union troops march into try and establish order.In a story as large and sprawlingly told as Gangs of New York, there are a bevy of side characters, and the most prominent of these is Cameron Diaz's Jenny. Now, Diaz's accent may go in and out slightly here and there, but she is surprisingly good as the bludger who gets close to Amsterdam and offers him a way out of the mess that he refuses to take. She's alternatively feisty, coy, and deeply wounded as the story progresses. Brendan Gleeson is his normal, professional self as Monk, a large man with a club who becomes a barber in the ensuing years. John C. Reilly balances his menacing but small role as the corrupt police officer Happy Jack exceptionally well. I do have to take a quick moment to talk about Jimmy Spoils, played by Lawrence Gilliard Jr.There's nothing wrong with how Gilliard plays the black character caught up in the Irish gang, but it's a vanishingly small part and it seems to be there to try and protect Amsterdam from the reality that there was a lot of anti-black sentiment in the Irish community, softening a potential hard edge by giving him a black companion. Scorsese doesn't shy away from the idea of the Irish attacking blacks in the riots, focusing on them rather directly for a little bit, but it all ends up murky enough that Roger Ebert, in his review, stated that the mob was attacking blacks and the Irish instead of the reality (that Scorsese does present) that the Irish were the ones attacking the blacks. I get the impulse to prevent your main character from being a completely repellent individual, but Jimmy Spoils ends up as little more than a token and his death ends up with little emotional impact, which is a disappointment.The movie is hugely ambitious, taking on more than it can completely deliver, but it's anchored by Leonardo DiCaprio's solid performance as Amsterdam and Daniel Day Lewis's absolutely fantastic performance as Bill the Butcher. His accent, his manner of speaking, and his mere presence are completely intimidating, and he's also a fully fledged character, operating on a base philosophy that's tangible and understandable. He's a monster, but he's also a fully-fledged monster with a history, a set of beliefs, and real desires.There's too much going on for the runtime. I think a longer cut would have made the second half flow better, but I do wonder if this was ever going to be great. It's really good, a movie that struggles to bring all of its so many pieces together into a whole, and it gets awfully close.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Deeply Flawed, Deeply Moving - but SO Much Wasted Potential!","I finally convinced someone to go see ""Gangs of New York"" with me last night - and that in and of itself should have set off the radar.  But it didn't... and I'm not at all sorry I spent money to see the film.  It was, rather, a beautiful example of how even films that seem to have it all (brilliant director, wonderful star power, the largest budget imaginable, a year's worth of industry buzz, etc.) can still fail.  This film, more than others which have achieved this sort of infamy, left me sad.  After all, the story is truly Shakespearian, but a weak narrative line and some sub-standard editing in the opening and closing half hours limit the effectiveness of the movie severely.Let's start with what I liked, though.  First, STORY.  I absolutely loved the idea of the film: the characters, the setting, the history (even if it wasn't all that accurate).  I am Irish American, so that added personal level.  The conflicts and relationships were also just wonderful.  (Side Note: Isn't it funny how so many of the moving and wonderful films of this year explore father/son dynamics?  In a year with so many strong showings by actresses, that is sort of ironic).  Second, the acting.  Daniel Day-Lewis was simply amazing, as always.  Even Leonardo and Cameron, two thespians I have never taken terribly seriously, really proved themselves!  All of the supporting cast just sparkled, too.  Finally, the physical environment in which the film took place.  The sets and the costumes really imparted the gritty reality of the time (something which is generally lacking in even the best period films).  It lent the story gravity and realism, and perhaps even a little authority.But all of these things could not redeem the film entirely.  First, there was the editing (particularly, as I mentioned earlier, in the first and last half hours).  I don't have a problem with story lines that are complicated, but there was no clarity, no direction.  It wasn't entirely clear which story Sorcese was trying to telling, and that was frustrating.  The draft riots weren't set up very well.  I felt like the Civil War was a secondary parallel to the violence consuming the Five Points, and then suddenly (at the end) it eclipsed the other story ... there was simply no sense of priority.  And, second, Amsterdam's voice-over monologues were simply odd. They didn't really sound like things his character would say (although many were beautiful, poetic, etc., he's street-wise and uneducated; they also simply didn't fit with the rest of his dialog).  I was also under the impression that the voice-over came from the burial scene at the end, so it was only in the very recent past, which doesn't leave much room for him to educate himself to that degree.  Third, there was gratuitous violence and nudity.  Even for the sake of the realism which I treasured above, some of it seemed over the top.  I especially resent this in so far as it takes away from other elements that were weak and turns off potential viewers.  Some of it is most definitely necessary, but, once again, Sorcese needed to decide which elements were important and focus rather than trying to do everything and failing.  (Note: This is especially inexcusable when one takes into account the amount of time he had to work on the film.)  Finally, there was some pieces that didn't fit.  For example, the music was entirely appropriate and wonderful ... except for the music during the first battle (modern synthesized crap).  What was that?  If the entire movie were in that style, it would have been okay.  Since only that one scene was like that, however, it stuck out like a sore thumb.  I felt the same way about the credits (I can't believe I'm complaining about the credits): the style simply didn't fit.  Sorcese needed to take some hints from ""Moulin Rouge"" which was able to blend modern and authentic while maintaining internal consistency.Overall, ""Gangs of New York"" is an experience operatic in nature: the characters are extremes, the emotions are extremes, etc.  It contains all the elements filmmaking should, it is epic in every sense of the word, but it just doesn't come off entirely right.  I enjoyed it, but I was also saddened by its missteps -",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Lacks an emotional connection with audience.,"It's late so I won't bore you with much.  Gangs of New York is a great flawed film.  I had more of an emotional connection with the antagonist because he showed a personal side that the protagonist did not.  This is why the film is so flawed.  If given a heart wrenching emotional connection to the Main character then it would have been a much better film.  All I got from Leo's character was anger, I did not get compassion, sadness, or loss. There was too much anger in his portrayal.  The Butcher showed a lighter side, while Amsterdam did not.Flaws are partly due to writing and partly the fault of acting.  Then again Scorsese should have made the distinction.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Are You Kidding Me?!,"Are you kidding me? This film was nominated for Oscars? Of all the junk over the years that has been nominated and has won Oscars this has got to be one of the worst yet! First of all is the actors; Leonardo DiCaprio has no business ever playing a tough guy kind of role. DiCaprio is so girlish that he is laughable as anyone who would be in a knife fight and should stick to roles where he plays either gay character or someone who is just very fem. DiCaprio seems right at home in a sappy love story such as Titanic or as a mentally handicapped person such as his role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. As if Leon wasn't bad enough we have to deal with 166 minutes of Daniel Day-Lewis looking like a bum and acting like a confused mime. I can't think of a movie where an actor or actress has failed more miserably in a part as Daniel Day-Lewis did in this movie; he was in a word, Laughable. Now as if the two main characters failing so utterly was not enough there are several other things which make this movie near unbearable. Of this list the first thing that comes to mind is the silly costumes which although somewhat authentic for the period were over-done and seen far too much. An example of this was the ten-gallon hats. Yes, people wore them back then but in this movie almost everyone had one on which would be like someone 140 years from now making a movie which takes place in 2003 and the same percentage of people as were wearing ten-gallon hats in this movie were wearing baseball caps. The next most annoying thing about Gangs of New York was the music; the same perpetual square dancing music played over and over again as if they just couldn't come up with something better. Moving right along we come to another very annoying `feature' . the accents done by DiCaprio and Day-Lewis, neither of which sounded anything like they should; aren't actors by definition supposed to, well, ACT?! Let's face it here people, if Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this movie along with Scorsese directing it, but rather had an unknown set of lead actors and actresses with an unknown director orchestrating this whole farce, this movie not only would have never gotten a single Oscar nomination but probably would have went directly to cable or video. The only upside to this whole fiasco was perhaps the cinematography and the story. This movie had a lot going for it but was ultimately doomed by the bad acting, poor casting, hilarious costume design, annoying music and boat load of other things that sank this ship before it ever left the harbor . 3 out of 10 stars for this catastrophic calamity.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
An American Epic...,"...Gangs of New York is indeed an American epic, telling not only a tale of revenge, but also a tale of a time capsule, A New York not many know about, with the Civil War always looming over.  There will be many a filmgoer that will consider Mr. Scorsese's work in Gangs of New York as rubbish, and true everyone can have their opinion on the landscape of 1963, but one must remember that the director, like in all of his films, has crafted such to as real and extent as can be shown in a 100 million dollar picture such as this.  As much as Scorsese took cues from avant garde and Italian filmmakers for much of his films, he also took cues from epics and Westerns, and to my view has crafted the best motion picture of the year, incorportating a saga of the city he came from and his themes from his previous pictures, most notably his references to Christianity (and for instance, his theme of destruction such as seen in Raging Bull, can be identified with many scenes, not least of which the climax).The seeds for the revenge take place in 1846, when a battle is fought against the Irish and the ""Native"" Americans over the five points (parts of the slums of Manhattan), where in which William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis in one of his very best roles) slays Priest Vallon, whose son, Amsterdam Vallon (played as an adult by DiCaprio) is then taken to an orphanage until he is set out in 1863, which is when the plot unfolds. Along with the skills of Scorsese he has his actors all in great shape, Day-Lewis especially, Diaz somewhat redeeming herself after The Sweetest Thing from this year, and DiCaprio shows that every now and then he can act.Some may also criticize the way the history is represented, that the facts were skewed to tell a Hollywood story and isn't really credible to the story of the draft riots and the gangs of downtown.  I think that they may be missing the point, though I do defend the factuality- facts are always going to be skewed for a big budget picture just as this, the key is to look past that and see it as how they did in the sense of pure dramatization and if it doesn't come off as clownish or inane, and this is not the case for Gangs.For those looking for something insightful, daring, maybe even exhilarating, or just want to be entertained by more action after Two Towers, this is a definite pick for the holiday season.

Couldn't Get Through It - But Don't Throw in the Towel Yet,"I've watched this movie a long time ago, and remember thinking it was mediocre. I've tried rewatching it many times, but am unable to do so.There's something really strange about Leonardo DiCaprio movies. Every movie trails off and gets highly uninteresting. Leo is not posed as a great hero in any of his films. You root for him all the way through, and hope he could do it. But he just comes out looking weak.This film had the same impact with me, and no one could have saved it. Not Scorsese nor Daniel Day-Lewis. It received high praise at the Oscars, but is just too boring. The movie is about old New York, and the gangs that fought to take over the city. Leo's characters' father was killed by the head of an opposing gang. After his father is killed, the young boy runs away, only to return years later and take sides with the man who was responsible for the death. However, this is only to get close to the prey before the kill.It's a movie to watch whenever you want, but no one would care if you don't watch it. The best actor and director couldn't save this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic Show,"Very detailed in its approach. Daniel Day Lewis and DiCaprio performed extremely well and they were supported by an equally gifting cast.

I actually want to go and read the book know to learn more about this part of our history which is rarely discussed or addressed.If there was anything lacking, I can't think of it.The story itself was well used to provide the color and depiction of a life and society that is less well known among the annals of the U.

Gangs of New York,"I recall meeting Daniel Day-Lewis some years ago, he had just stepped from his motor bike and proved to be a charming, engaging man extremely far removed from the racist and odious ""Bill the Butcher"" character he so expertly creates in this hard, gritty and brutal depiction of the almost tribal existences lived by many in 1860s New York. Leonardo di Caprio (""Vallon"") arrives in that city's Five Points area determined to avenge the death of his father many years earlier at the hands of this ruthless overlord. Initially ingratiating himself, he soon realises that it's going to take every ounce of his courage and resilience to challenge the status quo, and that some hefty sacrifices are going to have to be made. He is not just struggling against his nemesis, but against prejudice, corruption and a prevailing, endemic, sense of fear. The supporting cast are what really makes this special - Cameron Diaz, again so far removed from her more famous roles, alongside Jim Broadbent as the shrewd, but rather cowardly ""Boss Tweed""; Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly all contribute to this tautly directed story of lawlessness and loyalty - with a bit of Civil War conscription thrown in to add to the toxicity of it all. The last 20 minutes are really captivating, and Scorsese with some masterful scoring from Howard Shore manages to leave us feeling exhilarated and uncomfortable at the same time!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gangs of New York (2002),"Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas, John C. Reilly, Liam Neeson, Gary Lewis, Lawrence Gilliard Jr. (R)Grand, sprawling Scorsese epic set in the New York City slums during the mid-19th century blending (embellished) history and the fictional story of DiCaprio seeking revenge against Day-Lewis for the death of his gang leader father. A feast for the senses, especially Dante Ferretti's sensational set design and a soundtrack mixing eclectic folk compositions with Howard Shore's stirring score (to say nothing for an Oscar-nominated tune from U2), it's like plunging into a grimy furnace for the better part of three punishing hours and emerging crusty, smeared, victorious. Like his other gangster sagas, Scorsese fills the story and screen with juicy details on the fringes that elevates the material above mere revenge story set in city filth; it's ultimately about the bloody birth of ""America"" as fought on the streets of its largest, messiest metropolis. Loses some narrative momentum in the last hour but rarely falls short of engrossing, oft-mesmerizing. Day-Lewis tears into the role of the rapacious but undeniably charismatic Bill the Butcher with so much relish that it's nearly impossible to take eyes off him; so potent, he often reduces his primary co-stars (DiCaprio & Diaz, both doing solid period work) to mere fresh meat wanting for tenderizing. Not quite on the same tier as Scorsese's most searing, towering masterpieces, but very close, and this one is arguably the most purely ambitious film of his career.91/100",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Martin Scorsese's Masterpiece Devoted to New York City,"An absolutely marvelous piece of work! It was one of the best films that I watched during my senior high school years, and at that point it left a strong impression on me. I reviewed it in recent days. Still, the perfect acting by Day-Lewis, Dicaprio and Diaz is worth all the trouble fumbling among the old discs (some may argue it should not be counted as an ""old movie""yet) and trekking all over again through a course of nearly 3 hours.You have to give credit to the Great Martin Scorsese for his extraordinary ability of story counting and character selection. Reviving an old world is never easy, much less to say doing it in style. Once again the heritage of family spirit is fully embodied in his film. The sense of family honor and loyalty compelled young Amsterdam, after his graduation from university, to set out on an arduous journey of revenge. Of course, the audience will not only take delight in the completion of the Herculean task, but also savor each and every memorable episode all along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quality gets MPD,"Gangs of New York suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder in terms of its quality. We have, on the one hand, the masterful talent of Martin Scorcese, Daniel Day-Lewis and (though he is drastically underused here) Liam Neeson, a setting in the dynamic and brilliantly reconstructed New York City of the mid-nineteenth century, the themes of Civil War Draft Riots and a rapidly expanding and industrializing country attempting to cope with sudden and massive expansion and waves of European immigration. For anyone who has lived in the northeast and whose forefathers crossed through Ellis Island, there is nothing more we could ask for.Unfortunately, we also have the sometimes talented but dreadfully miscast Leonardo DiCaprio aping an awful Irish accent across a horrifically made up Cameron Diaz (whose accent is equally awful). In spite of the great visual recreations, the film tacitly ignores some important historical points, and not merely by bending dates and character traits: the idea that Irish or other poor European immigrants would have associated with Chinese (almost non-existent in the Manhattan of the day) or blacks is downright laughable. The great climactic action scene is rather dry, nuanced, and thoughtlessly executed. In fact, the film's action takes place only at a few checkpoints throughout, and meantime we are forced to sit through two and a half hours of incomprehensible intrigue and completely unsympathetic characters.And yet, to add further confusion, we are told that internal disputes had forced Scorcese to make ""damaging"" cuts to the release version of this film, and that fans have been clamoring for him to release an even more painfully dragged-out director's cut (a request which he has firmly resisted). So in the end, Gangs of New York is a very pretty and awful mess, much like the actual city of New York must have been in the 1860's. Scorcese's nostalgia for the old New York City is one I fully sympathize with, but this nostalgia hardly suffices to cement a solid film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Half-baked acting plus half-finished script equals one poor movie,"Overwrought, overlong, meandering, flabby, sentimentalised, poorly scripted, indulgent twaddle from one of the masters of modern film-making.  How did it happen?  If it had been made on a shoe-string by an idiot it would hardly matter but it cost a fortune and it was still rubbish.  With an utterly incoherent story and dreadful acting from all but Day Lewis this was more reminiscent of The Muppets Take Manhattan than Goodfellas.  The scene that summed up the film's failings was Day-Lewis draped in a US flag telling DiCaprio how his amazing energy reminded him of The Priest.  The flag was just such simplistic, condescending, tacked-on profundity and DiCaprio has as much dynamism as a wilted lettuce on legs!  Why did no-one work on the script?  It's like a first draft, full of loose ends, cliches, historical inaccuracies and laughably second-rate Oirishisms.  Save yourself several hours of life and don't bother with it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Were New York gangs really this funny?,"Daniel Day Lewis should have won an oscar for his method - routine portrayal of charismatic Bill the butcher who undoubtedly, is one of the few things to preach about in this Scorsese epic. Of course, with the acclaimed director at the helm Gangs of New York film is technically great with some memorable shots (one crane shot into the opening battle is particularly impressive) and superb attention to detail - like the use of a barrel to cover a fire hydrant. It's not something that is exploited, but amusing none the less. However, Diaz and Di Caprio are at their most boring and the films use of colourful clothing dilutes the power Scorsese is trying to achieve. Therefore the streets and gangsters don't feel threatening, only comical.",,Anonymous,Crime
City on fire,"Martin Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" takes us back to the 1860s in New York City to show gang rule, driven by greed and prejudice against immigrants, particularly the Irish. The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, and Liam Neeson.Into the corrupt world of the Five Points comes the adult Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio), who as a child witnessed his father Priest Vallon (Neeson) murdered by Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) who detests the Irish. Amsterdam infiltrates Bill the Butcher's organization, with the idea of killing the Butcher when the time is right.Everything about this film is impressive, and that's putting it mildly. The scope of it is so enormous, it makes ""Gone with the Wind"" look like a small independent film.Scorcese and his actors have captured the 1860s atmosphere - the locations, the filth, the conditions, the brutality, the costumes, the language - to complete perfection.This is all set amidst the background of Tamany Hall and thousands of immigrants in search of a better life coming off of ships, only to have things thrown at them, while the young men are conned into becoming soldiers.The acting ranges from great to good. Daniel Day-Lewis is terrifying as The Butcher. Every scene in which he appears is tension-filled, because you as a viewer have no clue what he's going to do - stay calm or cut somebody to pieces. A madman. A brilliant performance.Leonardo DiCaprio as a young man who has to stifle his horrible anger is excellent. Cameron Diaz is effective but not as strong as she perhaps could have been as a pickpocket who falls for Amsterdam but has a history with the Butcher.One has to give her credit for continually stretching her talent in different projects. Here, she's in the presence of giants, so if she doesn't come off as well, it's to be expected.Get ready for a lot of blood and gore.

two incomplete films in one,"I remember when I first got to see Gangs of New York around 10 years ago I was enchanted by the main storyline of Amsterdam (DiCaprio) on his path to revenge his father from Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis). The film also closely follows the American civil war historical events which I found dull and irrelevant at that time. I recently rewatched this and to my own surprise, this time around I only cared for those historic lessons depicted on the film, not bothered at all with the fictional plot.I think that's just the difference made in me through these 10 years, changing my interests and views. But what came to me was it doesn't quite blend; the DiCaprio-DDL story (which is interesting on its own) didn't really merge with the war events, which really hurt this feature. It doesn't leave an impression of a coherent, wholesome narrative, but of two films forcedly mixed together, not satisfactory in this presented form.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

See it for DDL,"Watching ""Gangs of New York"" again, I was awestruck by the power of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher - the flawless accent, terrifying rage, and shrewd intelligence combine to create a villain unlike any other that I've seen. Had the studio campaigned for Day-Lewis to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, rather than Best Leading Actor, at the 2003 Oscars he likely would've won. And not only is DDL perfect as Bill Cutting but the storyline centered around him is fascinating, focusing on a dynamic slice of American history rarely given the Hollywood treatment: the so-called ""Nativist"" reaction against Irish immigrants and the 1863 New York draft riots. As a descendant of Irish-American immigrants, this aspect of the movie hit home for me as it showcased the bigotry that the Irish had to overcome before finding their place in America.Unfortunately, Bill Cutting plays only a supporting role in a movie cluttered with various storylines and side characters that don't fit together. The real protagonist is Amsterdam Vallon, played by Leo DiCaprio, who is on a quest for revenge against Bill because he killed his father. But that storyline takes a backseat to a cliched love triangle between Bill, Amsterdam, and a pickpocket named Jenny. And THAT storyline is overshadowed by a subplot involving the underhanded dealings of political boss William Tweed, and then that aspect of the film is sidelined in favor of another political thread focusing on the 1863 draft riots.Throughout the movie's nearly three hour running time, it shifts breathlessly between these elements without fully developing any one of them. The result is an often messy film that struggles to find a compelling story to tell. Never before have I been bored by a Scorsese movie, but in this instance I just wasn't interested in what was happening throughout the majority of the film because so much of it seemed underdeveloped and unnecessary to the overall plot. Scorsese would've done better to focus exclusively on Bill Cutting and the draft riots, rather than undermine what could've been a great movie with superfluous side characters and subplots. So I recommend watching ""Gangs of New York"" for Day-Lewis, but keep in mind that it's not one of Scorsese's better movies. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Big! Big! Big! Nothing...,"Sorry Martin, this wannabe ""Titanic"" didn't do a thing for me...I don't want to say this is simply a film for the masses about the masses but that's the way it turned out: a big fat mass of masses for masses.That said, without spending too much time, I belive the film fails honestly because Scorcese is attached to it.If this was a film made by any unknown director or some greenhorn, I would have no choice but to applaud the effort as the EFFORT is tremendous.  But, when you look at the body of work and more importantly the intelligence and multi-level approach of Scorcese's other films, this film completely fails in comparison.Somewhere along the way this film was butchered, (pun intended) whether it was by the studio, by Scorcese, or by the batch of writers who's conflicting visions and machismo keep bobbing up and down throughout the story.  I believe Scorcese (or the studio) tried too hard to make a film for ""today's (young) audience"" instead of just making (or letting Scorcese make) a Scorcese film.  Sure, perhaps many of today's brainwashed and dumbed down proles might not get it, but the film would have entertained the large following this director has cultivated over his many years behind the camera.  If the only story he wanted to tell was a nobody wins revenge tale without redemption, flanked by an extremely shallow and cookie-cutter romance, then why waste all the time and money with 1860's New York? Whether or not Martin is actually washed up or still possesses his own magical abilities with a camera I cannot say, but it seems that whatever his original vision was, someone went through it (violently) with a cleaver.It's interesting though, as a comparison, the actual base human story of ""Titanic"" has the same cookie-cutter romance elements as ""Gangs""  yet it is crystal clear that the FOCUS of ""Titanic"" is on an IMMACULATE portrayal of both the ship itself, the passengers, and the events that took place -- an accurate portrayal of history is the most important factor.  ""Gangs"" does not present that same sharp and exacting historical focus to any degree, instead bits of chopped up pseudo history and gruesome violence are thrown around for a bit color in an otherwise monochromatic, by the books, and boring love story.Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now...  Half my theatre left after the 2 hour mark, some before, and that was on opening night.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
A footnote in history points to the future,"The opening street battle reminds one of the ambush that opened The Wild Bunch - the crash through the shop window a clear allusion - and the aftermath of this same battle reminiscent of that of the Atlanta fire in Gone With the Wind.Scorsese juxtaposes the violence of mid-1800s New York and the American Civil War. The street riots are a civil war too, the political motivations are interesting particularly as the film seems to describe the gang wars as a baptism of fire for a young nation coming to terms with its multicultural originas.No Italian gangs here though, but the descendants of the hoodlums of Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino would easily fit into the gang milieu already well established before their arrival.My big question is when is Scorsese going to make his western. The clue was in Cameron Diaz's stated dream to run away with DiCaprio for a new life to San Francisco, albeit via Cape Horn. For anyone who has seen Howard Hawks's Barbary Coast, life may not have been much different for them, but anything could happen when you went west in those days.Scorsese seems to love westerns - Hawks' Rio Bravo, Ford's The Searchers for example - it would seem logical that he should explore his themes further in this genre. Gangs of New York points the way.",,Anonymous,Crime

Grandiose.,"While I do have some complaints with the way that Scorsese handled the film's style I found it to be a very enjoyable film highlighted by one of the finest performances of all time. The editing during the fight scenes happens way too quickly and becomes convoluted, and the way that he introduced us to the era seemed far too rushed and never really let us understand the surroundings that we were placed in. The script does a good job of explaining the politics of the time period and what was happening in New York at that time in history, but the introduction to it all felt really forced and rushed. But once I got used to that, it was quite easy to immerse myself into the setting. The art direction and costume design is phenomenal and all of the actors do a great job of making us feel like we're there with them.In order for me to like a film I have to like the story and Gangs of New York has the benefit of being a sensational, almost Shakespearean, tragedy which I absolutely adore. The story centers around Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) who, as a child, sees his father slain in battle by the menacing Bill ""The Butcher"" Cunning (Daniel Day-Lewis). He flees the scene and lives at the church for sixteen years before returning to the place where his father died and is re-introduced to the world that he once knew which is almost exactly the same, with the addition Bill running everything with an iron fist. Amsterdam succeeds in becoming a close associate of Bill's, eventually becoming basically his right-hand man and saving his life at one point. He does all of this for the chance to avenge his father and murder The Butcher in cold blood. As I said, the story is very Shakespearean and that's what I love about it and that's why the ending was a bit of a let-down. It doesn't follow continue with it's tragedy roots and that disappointed me but it was still handled quite nicely.Of course with Daniel Day-Lewis being my favorite actor and his extremely strong selection process I'm more than likely going to adore his performance, and that's very true for his portrayal of Bill. His brooding intensity, flawless accent and ability to strike cold fear into someone while saying the most polite things truly make it one of the most astonishing performances of all time. Just plain brilliant. Everyone else in the cast is quite nice; DiCaprio is great, Diaz is above average, John C. Reilly and Brendan Gleeson provide fine support but it's ultimately Daniel's show and he amazes us as always. Overall, Gangs of New York really is a great film, regardless of some flaws scattered along the way, which follows a brilliant story and holds one of the finest performances of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A little long but very good,"This film will make you feel depressed after watching it - it is just the mood of the film, not the film itself or its message.The acting was great except for Cameron Diaz (why she was picked to play an Irish pickpocket does not make sense and she cannot fake her accent well - nor Leonardo DiCaprio for that matter), and Daniel Day Lewis definitely was perfect for this role.The cinematography, editing, sound were all great and conveyed the mood well. The costumes were pretty good but makeup was lacking - everyone still seemed very clean despite the filthy living conditions of the day, although apparently this was the fault of producers and test audiences who felt DiCaprio seemed unattractive so historical accuracy lost there.On that note, this film does not shy away from violence and corruption which founded America, which is particularly brave considering the times we live in and our fear of admitting we ever did wrong. Some of the fight scenes - in particular the introductory fight - were a little long and overdone but overall they were well done.This is not Scorsese's best film but it is a good film - as Ebert stated in his review, it would have been a triumph for someone else but compared to his past work it is fairly average (which still means very very good) compared to his other films.I can't really find anything wrong with this film but it does run long so expect that. Definitely worth a watch for some great performances but not a classic as it is a downer.OVERALL SCORE: 8 out of 10. Great film so long as you're in the mood.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Mixing revenge, past traumas and personal dramas with plots involving political scenes, historical conflicts and romance, Scorsese creates a beautiful film, but without soul","When we look at Martin Scorsese's filmography, there is no doubt that we have one of the best directors in the history of cinema. The mind behind works like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino and Raging Bull is one of the most active today and besides these, he has other incredible recent films like The Wolf of Wall Street and Silence. However, like any other filmmaker, Scorsese makes a mistake. It's not that he makes bad movies - he's incapable of that - but sometimes he releases works that don't reach their potential and prove to be clumsy. Gangs of New York unfortunately fits into the said second category, as it could be one of Scorsese's best films.Inspired by the book of the same name written by Herbert Asbury in 1928, Gangs of New York tells a story that takes place in New York between 1846 and 1862, when several gangs fought for control of the city. When the film opens, two of these groups are about to start a battle: the ""Nativists"" (formed by Protestant nationalists) and the ""Dead Rabbits"" (composed by Irish Catholics). Respectively led by Bill ""Butcher"" (Day-Lewis) and ""priest"" Vallon (Neeson), the members of the two gangs plunge into a violent conflict that results in the death of the latter, stabbed by the ""Butcher"" in front of his own son who, 16 years later, returns to avenge his father's murder. Interpreted by Leonardo DiCaprio, Amsterdam Vallon infiltrates Bill's group and becomes his pupil while waiting for the ideal moment to kill him - something that turns out to be much more complicated than the boy first imagines.Throughout the 166 minutes of Gangs of New York, there is exactly one shot that reminds us of the Martin Scorsese responsible for masterpieces such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas: in order to illustrate the fate of Irish immigrants in New York in the early 1860s, who were convinced to enlist to fight the southerners in the American Civil War, the filmmaker follows, in a single camera movement, the immigrants who get off the ships, are enlisted in a list of volunteers, embark on another ship bound for battle and returned to the city in coffins. It's not only an economical outlet, but also a stylish and effective one. Too bad the rest of the movie isn't as memorable.Unfortunately, contrary to what happened in Scorsese's previous works (in which the filmmaker showed a deep interest not only in the universes addressed, but also in their inhabitants), in Gangs of New York the greatest focus lies on the historical setting, and not on the characters. . In this way, the plot about the relationship between Amsterdam and Bill never involves the viewer, who is already too busy assimilating the various information about American politics, economy and society from the period covered in the film. As if that weren't enough, Amsterdam's grudge against his enemy never finds an echo in the audience, as the ""Butcher"" turns out to be a much more interesting figure than the character played by DiCaprio. And how could it be otherwise? Despite being anti-abolitionist and xenophobic, Bill demonstrates that he has facets that make him a three-dimensional and fascinating being: after killing ""priest"" Vallon, for example, he prevents his followers from mutilating the corpse and decides to send the enemy's son to a orphanage, so that it ""may receive education"". Later, in a scene brilliantly directed by Day-Lewis, the subject reveals how he lost sight in his left eye and explains why he always acts so violently - something that creates an even greater bond between him and the viewer.Since Bill is fascinating from beginning to end. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is powerful and magnetic. The composition made by the actor shows how rich his character is: as he is one-eyed, one of his eyes is more open than the other and he has a strong American accent. Just notice in the scene where he talks about how he lost his eye or in the tense scene where the knives are presented, how Day-Lewis' presence manages to drive the scene. Even in the scenes where we see Bill's violent and explosive side, Day Lewis remains imposing in the scene and always fascinating. It is yet another proof of how this actor, known for being a method actor and who emerges in the mind of the character, is one of the best in the history of Cinema.Meanwhile, Amsterdam, in addition to being equally criminal (even selling corpses for dissection) and treacherous (note his attitude during the aforementioned presentation of knives), is excessively introspective, not allowing us to share his pain. At no point do we buy Amsterdam's revenge and the film fails to make us feel any kind of connection or empathy with the boy. This clearly undermines Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, which is stuck with just one expression, which is perceived to be more the character's fault than the actors. Besides, why should we mourn the death of ""Father"" Vallon if we never really got to know him? Scorsese even tries to balance the little time that the character remains on the scene when casting Liam Neeson for the role, but this is insufficient (the objective was, obviously, to explore the heroic persona that the actor built in films such as Schindler's List, Rob Roy, Michael Collin and The Phantom Menace). And, truth be told, there is no one on Gangs of New York who couldn't be described as a ""barbarian"".But unfortunately, not even this arc between the two is well explored, because it seems that the focus is still the construction of the historical context and even in that the feature is lost for so much it shows: arrival of Irish immigrants; country's economic issue; the public's reaction to the American Civil War; racial issue; street violence; politicians taking advantage of power; rebellion due to the War, etc... That is, even in the construction of the universe, Scorsese and his screenwriters were lost in the exceptional reconstitution of the time made. Even the voice-over, a feature that Scorsese used brilliantly in several of his works, proves to be useless this time. And this is regrettable, since the history of New York in this period is fascinating, demonstrating that the simplistic division between North and South during the Civil War did not correspond to reality: supposedly defender of the ""Union"", the city (and the State, governed by the Democrats, opponents of Abraham Lincoln) plunged into chaos when the president enacted a law to summon all men to battle - except those who, favored by a golden cradle, could pay the fortune of 300 dollars to get rid of the mandatory enlistment. The result was a veritable social insurrection that demonstrated, among other things, that racial prejudice was still very strong among the theoretically abolitionist population.This entire historical context is, by the way, used as a backdrop by the filmmaker, who, however, proves unable to insert his characters into that scenario: at a certain point, for example, Scorsese deviates completely from the main plot to portray the election of a secondary character to the position of deputy - something that makes the film unnecessarily lose focus, since it has nothing to do with what had happened until then and is immediately forgotten as soon as we return to the story of the revenge planned by Amsterdam.Returning to the technical aspects, ""Gangs of New York"" is a visual and technical dazzle. It seems that Scorsese thought about how beautiful the most classic films about the 19th century were and decided to do the opposite: the film is dirty, the city looks like an open sewer. It's New York because the characters talk all the time that it's New York, but the viewer realizes that the city in the film is not the city we know or see pictures of, that's a merit. The production design - even the characters - emphasizes this rot in the city, showing almost all of them with rotten teeth and torn costumes. It is an incredible work, as well as the photography of Michael Ballhaus that uses a palette of colors emphasizing the warm colors emphasizing this characteristic, even if the composition of the frames is too reminiscent of the newspaper strips of that time. It is one of the works that proves the perfectionism of Scorsese and his team. An example that shows the director's technical virtuosity is the first battle scene, which is superb and shocking, due to the details and Scorsese's not hiding the violence.The totality may not be worth more than the sum of its qualities, but it is precisely these qualities that make the film's merits undeniable - the greatest of which, without a doubt, is Day-Lewis. His campy, cartoonish Butcher is both strangely charming and cravenly human. Scorsese's direction is once again excellent; his attention to detail, added to his epic intentions, guarantee magnificent moments, whether in the battle sequence that opens the film or in its visceral climax. The value of this work was very well measured in its 10 Oscar nominations, but the fact that the film did not receive any trophy at the awards shows its irregularity. ""Gangs of New York"" is, therefore, a huge mess: mixing themes like revenge, past traumas and personal dramas with plots involving political scenes, historical conflicts and an unlikely (and totally dispensable) romance, Martin Scorsese creates a visual spectacle that it has no soul - an aesthetically beautiful but emotionally cold film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Quickie: Competently made, but surprisingly generic coming from Scorsese","This is such an early 2000s movie. Huge great cast with great actors that are mostly underused or wasted. Great potential in a plot that is executed in an overly bloated, cliched, underwhelming, and even sometimes contrived way. It has this weird weak and extremely cliched Cameron Dias romance which completely feels out of place. Unnecessary narration, tons of exposition, and uninspired dialogue. There's so much that can be done with the time period, but honestly the time period almost seemed supplementary to the actual storyline and characters of the movie, and by the end of it I felt like it wasted too much time setting up this world that wasn't even that important for the storyline and characters apart from making this a flashy impressively made movie. I did certain aspects of the time and setting though, like the election, and rising racial tensions, but not enough was done with it. With all this time it should've been used to either develop the main characters more, or the larger cast. The Butcher could've been such a great character, and the movie could've easily focused on him, but we don't spend enough time with him, and focus our time on the basic Amsterdam. I don't know what to say about this movie honestly... I can see people enjoying this if they're sucked into the world. I was really trying to like it, but I couldn't get into it. I mean it's technically very well made in terms of the gorgeous sets, costumes, and seriously impressive camera work, scale, etc. But even some of the technical elements were off like the editing. It has its moments, but even Daniel Day Lewis wasn't enough to truly make this movie good. Even Leonardo Di Caprio, the now classic pairing with Scorsese, wasn't that good either. It's still decent enough, it definitely has some great moments, but it's quite disappointing how much potential this movie had even as someone who had lower expectations. I think there's some themes of the cycle of violence, and USA's development, but nothing seems to be too deeply developed here. There was this part a little after the half point of the movie where I thought it was suddenly going to take a surprising and exciting direction, but then it prematurely stops itself from going all out, and the rest of the movie plays out as you'd expect from the cliched plot. At least the battles were cool. Also, is it just me or is this movie and The Departed very similar? They even have similar issues, though at least The Departed was more enjoyable for as flawed as it was. I feel like I've seen this type of movie so many times. Maybe I would've liked this if I saw this earlier, but the entire movie was just so predictable. Honestly apart from the sets, costumes, and camera work this could pass off as a movie made by a pretty average director. Sadly one of Scorsese's weaker films.(6/10)Note: This was an old review I wrote after watching the movie that I didn't originally post because I thought it wasn't good enough and I would probably expand it, especially considering I plan to write many reviews for Martin Scorsese's filmography. That being said, I don't think I care enough about this movie to do that, so I thought I might as well post this.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

I normally cannot stand Cameron Diaz, but she was the only believable character in the whole film.

"The film should be seen, all 168 minutes, if you care about the arc of this director, the history of New York, and the amazing gifts of Daniel Day-Lewis.","It's 1863 New York City, prior to Rudy Giuliani and well on its way to being anarchic and lawless beyond any modern imagining. The underworld is ruled by Billy the Butcher, played with cunning, humor, and ruthlessness by Daniel Day-Lewis in an Oscar-possible performance. Leo DiCaprio will win no awards as the vengeful Irish orphan, Amsterdam, but he comports himself well enough to be taken seriously as an actor.The re-creation of 19th century New York at the Cinecitta Studios in Rome is filled with soot, clogged with humans, and choked with detritus to make it both ugly and fascinating.  Director Martin Scorsese's seasoned hand takes a cue from Howard Hawks' `Searchers' by opening a door and letting the point of view camera marvel at the snow-flaked town to be irrevocably changed by the clash of Irish immigrants, led by DiCaprio's dad, Liam Neeson, with nativists, led by the wily Day-Lewis.DiCaprio will try to avenge his dad's death, with the help of a resourceful and randy pickpocket, played with gusto and charm by Cameron Diaz. The revenge is the plot linchpin and its weakness, for it regularly telegraphs the next anti-climax and takes precious emphasis away from development of interesting characters like Day-Lewis, Diaz, and the talented Jim Broadbent as the infamous political sidewinder, Boss Tweed.The rivalry leads to the worst riot in American history, the Draft Riots, a preeminent holocaust that destroyed much of Manhattan at the hands of mobs and navy guns, even the homes of prominent businessmen and publishers. Amid the carnage, made even fouler by The Butcher's surpassing ability to eviscerate pigs and men alike, there seems little hope, except for someday a century and an half later a mayor with guts and cold compassion. Until that time, that great city accepted its pickpockets, prostitutes, and politicos as part of its landscape, caught powerfully by the genius director of `Taxi Driver' and `Goodfellas' among other urban stories.The film should be seen, all 168 minutes, if you care about the arc of this director, the history of New York, and the amazing gifts of Daniel Day-Lewis.

Brilliant Performances but Lacking in Almost every other Aspect,"The film has a great cast and a clever idea for the story, partnered with some great action and the direction of Martin Scorsese this seemed to me like it was going to be a slam dunk of a film, however, I was underwhelmed. I think it had excellent world building but this was at the cost of conciseness, the film could have been a lot shorter. As well as that while the story had a clever premise found it was played in a rather formulaic way, the saving grace really was the talented cast. I thought they were all good, Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, Cameron Diaz decent and Jim Broadbent fun. The ensemble of side characters has the likes of John C. Reilly, Brendan Gleeson and Stephen Graham, all brilliant even if they aren't given the most screen time, still there is one man who brings this film up in my rating, while these lot may raise the rating from a 6 to a 7, it's Daniel Day Lewis who brings it up to an 8. The best part of every film he's in, his performance is electric. He brings such a dedication to his roles and is easily the best part of this film, it's a shame that he put all that dedication into this. It's not terrible by any means but for a Scorsese film it's easily my least favourite. The cinematography isn't as good as his usual films, there is one scene with a terrible CGI elephant which is just... Why? There was no need for the elephant, it didn't have to be there. You clearly couldn't CGI an elephant with the budget and at this time so why did you bother, all it does is take you out of the scene. Anyway, badly CGIed elephants aside this film is somewhat of a let down but still well worth watching for the performances. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Possibly a historical reminder?,"Gangs of New York is an odd film in that it doesn't seem to pretend to be any one thing. It starts with gang warfare in an area of New York city, with Sir Daniel Day Lewis playing a historical character called Bill the Butcher, and his arch nemesis Priest Vallon played by Liam Neeson. Vallon is killed in the fight and his son is taken off to an orphanage.All countries around the world suffer from gang dynamics, it's part of tribal human nature to affiliate to a group you relate to and to be in conflict with rival groups. That's the history of humans since the earliest forms of humans walked the earth around 7 million years ago. This element of what you may call humanity is shown to follow a common theme of nativism.Bill the Butcher considers himself a true American (although we don't know his lineage and he certainly isn't native American) and is angered at the influx of Irish immigrants which at one point reaches 5,000 per week seeking a better life. It is estimated that as many as 4.5 million Irish arrived in America between 1820 and 1930. Most lived in poverty and so crime was rife and powerful gang figures ran their areas with an iron fist.And so we see this in Gangs of New York and it centres mostly on young Amsterdam Vallon, the priest's son who witnessed his fathers death at the hands of Bill the Butcher, return as an adult to seek vengeance for his fathers death.However it is interrupted by the civil war and the ensuing draft. During the riots against the draft 120 people were killed but some say the real total was 10 times that amount. In the middle of the riots and military action to quell them Amsterdam manages to kill Bill the Butcher and now his life's aim is complete he sets off with his love for California.It's interesting that the very same themes run through the film that have run through all historical ages. Even now in 2024 we have nativists in all countries, fighting against immigration from other countries and the crime and cultural changes that mass immigration brings. Nothing has changed since the 1800's.Those in power seek to retain power for the sake of the power, not to manage a city for the better, but simply to be at the top f the chain. Again in modern times we still see that exact same model. Wealthy men and women enter politics and become wealthier but never seem to make life better for the majority of the populace. This again is a theme echoed down history. One quote from the film is as they bury the bodies of the dead rioters in mass graves, one man says ""These are votes we are burying.""
It's a very gory film, with lots of violence and inhumanity, but overall, the thread that runs through it for me is that things never change and probably never will. The exact same themes of power, greed, violence, poverty and the tiny number of wealthy people ruling the rest of the world run through every single eon of history. Our masters may be overrun and beaten, but only to be replaced by new masters. Every era and every age. Nothing ever changes. And the film suggests, nothing ever will.This film is a historical lens, and a future prediction, of human history.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Controversial,"Subjective tastes are very diverse and opinions of movie fans most often vary throughout the 1-10 scale, but in most cases majority agrees.

The Moose Hole - 'Gangs' Disappoints,"After many delays, production budget problems, problems on the set and so much more, Gangs of New York finally makes it to theaters. The movie looked to never to make it to theaters after having it opening day moved from December 2001 to February 2002 to July 2002 to arrive a week before Christmas Day 2002. The $100 million budgeted film was directed by one of the most famous directors in Hollywood, Martin Scorsese. Scorsese had the idea for this film nearly 30 years ago and now his vision is brought to life even after much strife. But will this be another masterpiece for the great director or will all the problems overwhelm the Miramax film?The story goes that Amsterdam Vallon arrives in the city of New York after spending 16 years in jail. He once lived in the mean streets of New York before his father was killed by a man named Bill the Butcher, who fought to protect the rights of the ""natives"" of this country. Amsterdam joins the Butcher's group of ""natives"" and becomes very close to him. Along the way, he meets up with old friends who have either gone into hiding or joined the side of the ""natives"". Amsterdam soon makes the decision that the Irish immigrants can't live in such horrible conditions any longer and so goes after his father's killer for the sack of the people of America. The story of Gangs of New York is a neat one at that but by the end, the audience is way too confused. The historical aspect of the film would have been fine by itself but by adding the Amsterdam subplot, the stories get so jumbled together that it is unclear what is exactly going on.Gangs of New York is the second film for Leonardo DiCaprio to open around Christmas Day 2002 and he continues to show that he can't boast his acting ability outside of Titanic. The character of Amsterdam Vallon is way too complicated to fully understand but that is not the fault of DiCaprio. He does his best to make the audience accept as this Irish immigrant and he does a pretty good job at it. Daniel Day-Lewis was fabulous as Bill the Butcher. Lewis presents a great New York accent that makes him seem like a true American ""native"" in the 1860's. The only character that didn't seem in place was Cameron Diaz's Jenny. Once again, this is not the actor's fault but of the writer's. Diaz does a good job acting this character out but by the end of the film, her character seems very pointless to the story.Overall, Gangs of New York was a big disappointment. Of the many problems, the thing that sticks out the most is the story. The era of the 1860's is a fascinating time to set a film against but the historical aspects are too jumbled together when that story is joined together with the Amsterdam Vallon story in Gangs. It was not much appreciated that the cause of the Union, which was to abolish slavery, was put in such a bad light. It is understood that many people didn't like the draft but some aspect to explain the draft should have been added. The government is looked on as a monster in this film which is not true at all. The film just seemed too dragged on. For three hours the movie looks to be going into one direction to just then turn around and go in another direction. Gangs' ending was too predictable. Scorsese could have saved at least a hour and a half of the audience's time by cutting out many unwanted scenes to direct straight to the bad ending. There are some things to like about Gangs of New York but they are so few that they not be mentioned here. See the film only if you really want to see it. If not, then wait for rental on DVD.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Not bad, but could have been better.","After watching the movie and the Discovery Channel Documentary on the Gangs of New York it appears to be somewhat accurate. The movie is not necessarily a true story but was based on some actual events.First, the movie was a bit too long. At almost 3 hours really the only movies that can get away with that length is Schindlers List and Titanic. This is a part of history that many many people are not familiar with.I also had a problem with some of the casting, mainly Cameron Diaz. I would have liked to see a lesser know actress-it would have made it much more realistic plus her character was not anything extraordinary that anyone else couldn't have done it. Cameron is just to big and overpaid to make anything real to life. I doubt she was worth the absurd amount she was probably paid.Daniel Day Lewis `was superb! Impressive performance.I am still undecided on Leo's performance. It was okay but did not blow me away.I was not sure what they were doing with the accents.

Lost itself,"This movie has some hallmarks of a Scorsese picture, but it lost itself somewhere during the filming.  Normally, Scorcese has a knack for keeping focus on a main theme (i.e., Casino = greed is bad; Raging Bull > out-of-control temper can get you in trouble).  However, after the first hour, Gangs of New York lost any theme and causes the viewer to just watch the movie and to not think, which is very unlike a Scorsese picture.   In addition, I would like to know when and where Leonardo DiCaprio became a movie star worthy of being in a Scorsese picture.  Perhaps it was Titanic, but his performance therein was not what made Titanic a decent film.  The guy is simply awful. In every movie that I have seen in which  he performed, he was outperformed by all his co-actors.  His acting is completely unbelievable, and his ""Irish"" accent came and went (very sloppy).  He looks like he is still 14, despite his attempt to grow facial hair. Unfortunately I have to blame Scorsese for this foul-up.  DiCaprio ruined otherwise decent performances by Lewis and Diaz.

Put Scorsese Back on the Map.,"Scorsese was on a hot streak in the 70s, then on-and-off in the 80s and 90s. This 2002 masterpiece caused Scorsese to be on a hot streak again like in the 70s. It was also the first movie he did with Leonardo DiCaprio--the start of a great team.The story isn't very original and the movie is too long. The near three hours could easily be condensed to a clean two hours. A regular revenge story with weak subplots that can be confusing as they become blurry. The movie is about a boy who witnesses his father being murdered by the ruthless Bill ""Butcher"" Cuttings (Day-Lewis). Sixteen years later, the boy (now Leo) returns to vow his father's murder. But rival gangs, love, loyalty, and Cuttings' ascension makes the job difficult. The acting is uncanny by everybody. But Day-Lewis steals the show. The riots and action are extremely brutal, but very entertaining. As I mentioned before, the movie is too long, but the entertainment and movie making really make up for the slowness. Condensed, this would be in the Top 250 and be considered a Scorsese masterpiece. I don't find this to be a masterpiece, but it is very close to it. Like The Outsiders--it was as close to being a masterpiece without actually being one. But still, I really think that this deserves more.

A Mixed Bag,"Most veteran movie-goers should by now be very wary of films with a huge Oscar publicity machine, especially those brimming with ""buzz"" so long before the movie is anywhere near theatrical release.  This is such a movie. I was wary, but I kept an open mind because it was a Scorcese film, and sometimes his directing ability has the uncanny power to avert cynicism from his film.I call this film a mixed bag for the following reason: It has one really good performance (plus a few others that were okay), good directing, and okay cinematography but a very, very poor script - and that script hurts a lot of the film.It should be obvious by now that Daniel Day Lewis's performance as William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting is the one I'm referring to - if anyone deserves an Oscar for their acting in this movie, it's him.  Everyone else more or less does exactly what the script requires them to do.  Liam Neeson did quite well for his brief role as ""Priest"" Vallon and Brendan Gleeson did a good job as McGuinn, a quiet subdued role for the only character to see through young Vallon's disguise.The stinker in this movie is the script.  First off, what is this movie?  Is it a revenge drama?  A romance story?  A period political piece?  It never decides - it cannot.  Instead the script meanders through each of these possible threads and picks up and leaves off where it wishes.  This lack of focus sometimes lets you stop caring about some of the characters (and I'm not really spoiling anything, but the ending practically forces you to). Also, the backstory of the beginning scene is never given, so I'm still confused as to why the movie ended up where it did.  I chalk that up to a bad script that's in a hurry to tell the story.Scorsese at least has done his job in directing in his usual, reliable way. I forgive him the two very obvious uses of artistic metaphor in visualization: the ""blood on the blade"" and the bible falling into the water.  He deserves an Oscar at some point, but I'm afraid it shouldn't be for ""Gangs of New York"".  He has done better, and will do better in the future.The last thing I have to nit about is the cinematography.  I think it was vastly overrated.

The Back-story ruined by Cartoon Tailor,"I saw this recently on DVD and unfortunately liked the documentary more. The movie was just too long and a lot of good concepts got washed away with bad art direction. The story looked cartoony... the costuming served not the reality but the fantasy of the story, and believe me the violence, which is very real, juxtaposed these little ""art directions"" to no greater purpose. The characters were drawn out and given blood only to have them put into a cartoon fantasy which ruined the foundations of the back-story for me.The acting was good, but I didn't find any stand outs - maybe because I kept trying to talk them out of their choice of cartoon tailor. The Art Direction which obviously had a lot of time and money devoted to it was a real let down for me with this one.",,Anonymous,Crime
One great Scorsese epic,"When Martin Scorsese directed his dream American epic about 1860's New York, I expected a masterpiece and got one. With Daniel Day-Lewis leading an outstanding cast that includes Leonardo Dicaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, and John C. Reilly, there's no going wrong. Lewis is spellbinding in the semi-central role and the epic sweep is outstanding. Scorsese normally makes films not normally associated with epics, but this time he does and the gamble pays off. Powerful, sweeping, well-acted, and directed by a great master at the peak of his always provocative form, Gangs of New York is as essential as any Martin Scorsese masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not the average run of the mill movie,"As I was going to see this film, I already knew what is was going to be about, and before I seen it,I already loved the story concept (even If I hated the title - It should've been called ""Ashes of the Irish"" or something like  that). but for what ever reason they chose to name this film ""Gangs of New York"", and it wasn't the film I thought it was going to be. First I'd like to say that Daneil Day Lewis played his role perfect. He did so good in his role as the butcher that I cannot imagine any another actor in that role (Really). I also liked the surreal, Dirty,Brutal,Gritty old 19th century New York City setting..I though the sets were fantastic. The Special effects were pretty standard(which means pretty good these days), and Liam Neeson was also very convincing as the boys father,too bad that his character was only in the movie for about the first 15 minutes of the film.However what hurt this film is that it is way too long, and you almost feel like the director is trying to drag it out further with a series of scenes that have little or no bearing on the story. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio were the way wrong choices for this film. I remeber thinking to myself as I was watching it that Colin Farrell or Ewan McGregor would've been much more better suited for the role of Anstredam than DiCaprio was. And Diaz is much too much of a modern California girl to star in this period film set in 19th century New York City and it shows. Again I found myself recasting that role to Kristen Dunst or Heather Graham who I believe would've been for better in that role than Diaz. Niether Diaz or DiCaprio are convincing and there acting skills are just flat all the way through this film. Another pitfall of this film is the miserable film score. the pulsating hich school marching band style snare drums that continuously play to a fast paced beat actually begins to give you a headache before the film  is finished.Its worth watching at least once...I dont know if it was too much or not enough, this music score is god-aweful, but I gave it 6 stars out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

How versatile is this guy anyway? He can play an Indian, a Brit, and an 19th century scoundrel, as well as a handicapped person. I thought the movie itself was very good from a cinematic standpoint but a little slow at times. Unlike some of the reviews, I thought Cameron Diaz did a really good job in this. I was very underwhelmed by Leo DiCaprio's performance. It came off kind of stiff and uninspired. So..to summarize, I think DDL should have gotten at least a best actor recommended for this.

"Partial greatness, good entertainment","The great director Martin Scorsese has shown us that he truly is in the elite of filmmakers with titles such as, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino and later The Departed on his record. However as much as I liked many of his other films and regard some of them as being some of the greatest in resent history, I was not convinced by Gangs of New York. Even though it hat some great parts, that deserve to be recognized, it also hat some doubtful scenes, a few dull characters and a lag of originality. These are hard words to use, considering that the movie was entertaining and hat a lot of brilliant moments, but when these doubtful moments emerge between the good parts, it pretty much takes out the joy of the ride in a very anti-climatic way, that spoils the overall impression of the film. I must admit that I was quite impressed by the acting (especially Daniel Day Lewis' performance), the effects and the very distinguishing Martin Scorsese touches throughout the entire movie.

"Aweful, shamefully aweful!","Gangs Of New York is an atrocious misstep all the way through.  I really wanted to enjoy this film.  I know its dividing audiences across the country as to its true merit, but I wanted to be on the positive end of the spectrum.  I felt that if this film were successful film making it would be a great step in the artistry of modern cinema, not to mention a great case for truth in director's vision.  What results is a film so terrible words cannot describe it.  Leonardo Dicaprio once again delivers a predictable performance, Cameron Diaz cannot figure out if she's an Irish immigrant or a dumb blonde from Hollywood.  Neither of these two actors can maintain their accents; they drift in and out from one line to the next.  The battle sequences are so poorly conceived and laughable in their executions.  Its ridiculously obvious that the 100's of extras have no idea of what to be doing.  The script is an absolute disaster.  It introduces new and unnecessary characters with only 5 minutes remaining.  Not to mention plot points are consistently started, yet never resolved.  Character development is nil.  Symbolism: predictable and laughable.  The final sequence where we zoom into a The Butcher's glass eye and its revealed that its an eagle was trite and clichéd.  IN the end, the only redeeming factor of the film is Daniel Day Lewis.  He gives Bill the Butcher, depth and comic verve that insert much needed life into the proceedings.  Whenever his character's is on screen his completely steals the film.  Perhaps this makes the film all the more terrible.  If only his brilliant performance was in a film more deserving of it.

Major Disappointment,"I don't think I can remember a movie where all the components are in place to create an epic motion picture, and they all fall apart like a jigsaw puzzle with incorrect pieces jumbled together into a mess.Throughout every scene tension is created leading to more tension. Characters are defined well and the acting is superb throughout ... but because of the history of the period, I knew the outcome from the first frame and it really didn't matter to me who died at the end and who didn't. And that's the problem with the entire production, I really don't care about any of these characters. Plus, the historic and political issues, which are driving influences of the era, didn't develop the desired drama/intensity to close the hoped for effect the director had in mind.Sure, the love interest is developed, but I don't care if they stay together or not. I admire history and maintaining contact with a city's or community's past; however, because New York is a city that never slows down enough to truly admire and honor its past and the citizens who inhabited those times, I wasn't taken in by the final frames detailing the growth of the city and loss of individual histories.Overall, the production quality is remarkable and true to life. The acting, as I mentioned earlier, is outstanding. But unless viewers care about the characters on screen, there isn't much to capture their attention for a full three hours.Overall, I give it a 5 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Crime

Martin Scorsese OK Film,"Martin Scorsese has done some great films, but this one comes off as just OK. It is not from a lack of trying as the visuals in this film are quite rich & evocative. The action sequences are pretty well done too. Martin Scorsese's biggest problem in this film is the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio performance in this film shows he is still trying to mature as an actor. He walks through this film without putting much effort into it in spite of all the folks around him. Hopefully, after doing this film & CATCH ME IF YOU CAN with Spielberg, the learning will help him as his acting is flat in that movie as well.Cameron Diaz is in this film pretty much as eye candy but is really not given enough of a role that she will be remembered for this one.Daniel Day-Lewis alias ""The Butcher"" in this film really gets the best role & steals the film from everyone else. With all the action & scenery in the movie, there really isn't a lot to steal, but (if you pardon the pun), ""The Butcher"" to me gets the meat of the acting in this script.At 167 minutes this film runs pretty long, mostly because of the long action sequences, & it could be made shorter as some of the sequences drag all too long, but even if it were shorter, it would not really improve the film.This is a good film, but not a film that will be remembered other than as one of Directors Martin Scorsese film more than anything else.

Brilliant performances,"""Gangs of New York"" is everything you've heard it was: dark, dramatic, violent, moving, thought-provoking, and, yes, very long. I felt that Martin Scorsese could have told the same story, with as much gravity, and still cut the movie by 30 minutes. Still, there are really very few spots that drag. While I do not believe it is the best film of the year, it does contain the best performance. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing as Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. He makes you hate the character, as well as find yourself laughing with his cruel jokes. The character reminded me of ""Curly Bill"" Brocious (played by Powers Boothe) in ""Tombstone"", in that he was evil to the core, but still had plenty of charisma. His was not the only character that stood out. Brendan Gleeson breaks out as Monk, and Cameron Diaz gives her best performance to date. The film is good, but not great. The direction should be rewarded, as it is on the scale of ""Braveheart"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Scorsese balances hundreds of extras and a beautiful set to bring the viewer right into the scenes. The battles are as gruesome as in any movie, but still leave plenty to the imagination. The final camera shot is also powerful, and quite moving as it shows the evolution of New York City. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies, but was slightly disappointed due to the large build-up. I believe it will still be nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards, but feel that the true winners should be Scorsese and Day-Lewis.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tiring...very, very tiring.","""Gangs of New York"" is a spectacle--with amazing scenery, stunts and special effects. However, it's also a very tough film to like and of all the phrases I could use to describe it, 'feel good' is probably the last. I found it thoroughly unpleasant but spectacular.The film concerns a vendetta between one annoying person (Leonardo DiCaprio) and another even more annoying and unlikable person (Daniel Day-Lewis). Lots of screaming, stabbing, killing and nastiness occurs until ultimately (and thankfully) the film ends.I know my summary above is ridiculously short and vague--but so were the characters. There was little depth, often their behaviors made little sense (why didn't DiCaprio's character kill his enemy early on in the film? Why, exactly, did 'the Butcher' spare his enemy--he had to know he would come back to kill him!) and they were collectively about as likable as a case of VD. And, because the film is about three hours long, I found it tough to stick with this one. While the film is directed well, it's just depressing and awful throughout.

"Too Long, Average","(Possible Spoilers)Gangs of New York. Something most people would never think of. Probably a response would come of how all the gangs were in Chicago. However, this movie is set before the birth of Al Capone and his Italian gang. Set in 1863 New York, as the Civil War rages on, the movie let me down a little.Amsterdam Vallon is the son of murdered gangs leader Priest Vallon of the Dead Rabbits Irish gang. After a grotesque battle at the start of this film, the movie takes an awkward turn into a slow drama in which Vallon goes to work for his fathers murderer Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) and then begins to plan against him.Gangs of New York was long, too long yet it was fascinating. Seeing how the Irish were actually treated coming from a famine stricken country and how they weren't afraid to stand up against government and society was interesting. I've researched this era and am quite familiar with what actually happened. The riots at the end of this film were portrayed accurately being based solely on the issue of drafting immigrants and Tammany Hall's sway in office.The city design and filming location was excellent.Acting was alright. Daniel Day-Lewis was solid as Bill, DiCaprio did a surprisingly good job as a main character yet Cameron Diaz as a main character in a historical drama made no sense.

Martin Scorcese sure hates short movies,"Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio star in this epic, retelling the early days of the struggle for New York City.Lewis stars as ""Bill the Butcher"" a patriotic local who runs the Five Points, a treasured piece of local ground. His name is ""Bill the Butcher"" because he is a butcher, literally, but he doesn't restrict his carving skills to animals, if you get my drift. Most are scared of him and get out of his way. SInce he defeated Priest Vallon and the Irish in 1842, things have been easier for him. That is until ""Amsterdam"" (Di Caprio), comes into town. He strikes up a relationship with Bill, but it's obvious he has a past (because all people have a past), but his past is special because his dad was.....""The Priest"", who Bill killed in 1842!!!!

A great cast, also starring Liam Nesson, probably in his finest work since ""The Phantom Menace"" and Cameron Diaz, in probably her best work since ""The Mask"".

Daniel Day Lewis is Robbed of an Oscar,"The scene is set as two groups stare across an intersection in the mid 1800's. On one side is the Irish, led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). The ""Natives"" as they like to be called stand opposite them with their leader Bill ""The Butcher"" (Daniel Day Lewis). Each side holding a wide variety of ""cut em up"" weapons. Everything from clubs to machetes are present. The battle is just beginning.Martin Scorsese's film Gangs of New York depicts the early years of New York City and the Irish immigration, specifically in an area called the Five Points. The ""natives"" as they so liked to be called, who's ancestors have lived there for many years, despise the Irish. They feel like it's not an immigration, but an invasion. An invasion of there land.The Irish don't like the welcome they have received from these so called ""natives"". They as Priest Vallon puts it, ""Plauge our people..."". The son of Priest Vallon is Amsterdam played by Leonardo DiCaprio. As he grows up, Amsterdam hates the natives and most of all, ""The Butcher"" for what he has done.What makes this movie stand out is the acting, most memorable is that of Daniel Day Lewis as the horrible, merciless, and down right nasty Bill ""The Butcher"". Bill oversees everything that goes on in the Five Points. ""Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you,"" is what he says to Boss Tweed, just a politician trying to get in on the action of the Five Points.Lewis's character is one that is both respected and feared by everyone in the Points. His sometimes violent behavior brings pain and suffering to those on the other end. All kneel to Bill, even Amsterdam who befriends him.The great thing about this movie is that you can see it over and over again and still find something interesting about it. Whether it be the actual historic value it shares, or the bloodshed and violence that rivals that of Braveheart. It's a shame that this movie won nothing at the academy awards with 10 nominations. Daniel Day Lewis especially was robbed by Adrian Brody (The Pianist). Movies like Chicago, The Hours, and The Pianist beat it out.

King Of New York,"Gangs Of New York Dir: Martin Scorsese 4/5The tale of Gangs Of New York has been reported time and time again as the story of a tyrannical butcher who chops and cuts, crushes and destroys: Miramax studio boss Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein apparently enforced cuts to Martin Scorsese's epic new film from a bloated four hour running time to a more manageable 168 minutes.  What damage (or good) this did to Gangs will no doubt be the speculation of movie geeks for many years to come but is actually irrelevant.  What remains is a powerful, exciting and unusual work, which is undoubtedly the first must-see film of 2003.The other butcher in the tale of Gangs Of New York is Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) the criminal leader of the 'Five Points' which form the heart of New York in the mid 19th century.  At the start of the film he is challenged by his archenemy Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) for control of the points.  Priest Vallon's gang are the Dead Rabbits, they are Irish and tired of being treated as second-class citizens.  Bill The Butcher's gang are the Natives, who believe that all the Irish and other immigrants are trespassers.  A battle between the two huge gangs follows and Vallon is slain by Bill the Butcher.  All this is watched by Amsterdam, Priest Vallon's son, who escapes capture and comes back 16 years later to seek his vengeance.The most immediately striking thing about Gangs Of New York is just how poor the opening battle between the two gangs is.  It is full MTV-style, full of cuts of blurred action to a rhythmic score that sounds like 19th century techno.  The obvious reasoning behind this is that Scorsese is trying to do something different to show that Amsterdam only has a vague memory of this battle that happened when he was just a small child.  But ultimately it just doesn't work.  It is so bad that if Scorsese did not have such a weighty reputation, it would be dismissed as bad filmmaking. It is so bad that it actually takes a few scenes for the film to recover.  You are left with thoughts of what could have been if this had been a longer, more violent, coherent battle sequence and how much of a boost this would have given the film.However, thankfully, the film does recover.  We follow the grown-up Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), who infiltrates the Butcher's gang, growing in importance in power until he is ready to take down his enemy.  A lot of people may think that almost three hours is a long time for an archetypal story of revenge but the film is much more than a story of gang conflict. Scorsese is trying to cover much more - he is trying to show how this period in New York's history influences how the city and indeed America is today. Much of the film does not directly feature Amsterdam or Bill the Butcher, but the issue of the civil war draft, inequalities between rich and poor, corrupt politicians and election rigging and rich and poor inequalities. The last image of in the film of New York fades through the decades to show New York today, showing that this time is really the building blocks for the modern day city.The performance by DiCaprio in only his second role since Titanic - which is a comment on how long this film was delayed as much as it is on DiCaprio's work ethic - is very good.  He seems to have suffered most in the post-Titanic backlash but he is one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood today with charisma and range.   However, Cameron Diaz as Jenny, Amsterdam's lover, outshines him.  It's quite a one-dimensional role but Diaz brings a lot of spunk to the part. It's good to see Diaz acting instead of just performing with her massive smile and fantastic body.  But both are eclipsed by Daniel Day-Lewis, persuaded to return to acting by Scorsese after a five-year hiatus.  He blows his fellow actors off screen with his complex character.  Bill the Butcher is not a man that's all about power and greed but he is a man whose only thrill in life is conflict and who has never really recovered from the death of his rival Priest Vallon.  Some moments in his performance are spine tingling, changing emotions in a split-second.  Day-Lewis is an absolute certainty to be nominated for a Best Actor and would be a worthy winner.  The lead trio are well supported by Jim Broadbent as the corrupt mayor of the city and John C. Reilly as a duplicitous policeman.  The only poor performance is by Scottish Gary Lewis, who plays an Irishman but still sounds like he came from a rough side of Glasgow.The performances are not the only brilliant thing about Gangs Of New York. The sets, apparently two miles long, are vast - the film probably takes place in fifty locations. After the opening battle there is an amazing crane shot, which zooms out until the people are the size of ants.  Scorsese has created his own world.  It looks and feels like nothing ever filmed, authenticity jumps from the screen.The script has received criticism for being convoluted and shabbily structured.  It certainly could have been tighter and certain things, like the importance of the 'Five Points', could have been explained better. Perhaps this is the fault of there being three talented but very different screenwriters on the project - Jay Cocks, who wrote Scorsese's other period drama The Age Of Innocence, Steven Zallian (Schindler's List) and Kenneth Lonergan (Analyze This).  However, while the screenplay is not the most coherent or fluid, it still contains several magical moments.  Every second or third scene is absolutely brilliant.  The beauty of Amsterdam waltzing with Jenny holding a candle, a scene remenicent of the 'mook' scene in Mean Streets where Amsterdam decides whether or not to take offence at being called a `fiddlin' Ben', a scene where Bill the Butcher demonstrates his knife throwing skills with Jenny. There are many, many more but they are best left for you as a surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A Brutal, Gritty Gangster Epic","Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is a visually stunning and violent exploration of 19th-century gang warfare in the Five Points, New York. The film captures the brutal, lawless nature of the era, where rival factions fight for power in a city teetering on chaos. The gangster element is raw and unpolished, filled with ruthless street battles, political corruption, and shifting loyalties, making it feel both historical and timeless.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a compelling performance, portraying a young man navigating the treacherous world of gang rivalries with both intensity and emotional depth. His journey is gripping, marked by a mix of vulnerability and calculated vengeance. While Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show with his menacing presence, DiCaprio holds his own, proving his ability to lead a large-scale epic. With its rich atmosphere and relentless pace, Gangs of New York is a must-watch for fans of gangster films and historical dramas alike.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Has Scorcese sold out?,"This movie is a sad sign of the times. If you compare this film with any of Scorcese's  other work you will notice some remarkable differences.  Gone is the gritty realism which has been a trademark of his work, and replaced by formulaic acting and storyline. I mean could you really compare the comic book character of Daniel Day Lewis to anything DeNiro has done in Scorcese's films? As for the obligatory  love interest between DiCaprio and Diaz, Scorcese has never resorted to using romance as a filler to pad-out the story  in his films before.  As for the performances of these two actors, Leo was mediocre  as usual, and Diaz was only slightly better.What this movie did for me was re-affirm the direction Hollywood film-making has taken in the last few years.  In order to reach the mass market, many Hollywood movies are being pitched at a very low level and as a result films such as  Titanic, Pearl Harbor, and Gladiator are churned out.  These films achieve the desired goal of earning mega-dollars at  the box office, but as a result are made up of uncomplex storylines, stereotypes, and two dimensional characters. When you compare these movies with films such as The Godfather or Silence of the Lambs which were complete with characters and storylines of depth and complexity,  it is easy to see from here the direction Hollywood is taking.What this movie also re-affirms for me is a suspicion that Hollywood is buying up award votes.   Apart from receiving a Golden Globe nomination for best picture, Cameron Diaz has also been nominated for her part.  Her Golden Globe nomination (and I'm sure an Oscar nomination will follow) is right up there with  Nichole Kidman (Moulin Rouge), Gwyneth  Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love), and Marissa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) as one of the most undeserving nominations given to a female actress.  As a result, I am convinced that this movie will go along the same tracks as other ""simple-minded"" movies such as Titanic and Gladiator where it will be showered with Academy Award Nominations that it clearly won't deserve.If this movie had been made by any other director I would have brushed it off with a laugh, but the fact that it was directed by Scorcese is sad.  Was he only complying with studio heads in order to make this film? I only hope this is a one off for Scorcese.  I would hate to think that the likes of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas will not be seen again. All being said, at least foreign films are still being made where they they are driven by the characterizations rather than a lame plot. I can still watch them.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Cameron Diaz is miscast in this movie in my opinion. She doesn't look nor sound like an Irish-American woman. That, and she just looks like Fiona from Shrek, not hot anymore.

Excessive talent dished up with too much monosodium glutamate,"Over three hours of Scorsese's self-indulgent odyssey supposedly about the birth pangs of 19th Century New York City but really a gratuitous re-enactment that tells us very little about history and a lot about Mr Scorsese's continuing efforts to work out his personal religious angst. After a bloody and horrifically realistic opening battle, the gang warfare festers on in simplistic Protestant vs Catholic rabble-rousing fashion whilst Di Caprio, Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis all take turns to sparkle a bit. Scorsese shines with wasted talent throughout and the film will no doubt pick up the odd minor Oscar or two for misdirected effort.

Becoming a Vegan,"About the 73rd bucket of blood finally did me in with Martin Scorcese's vomitous mess of a historical epic, Gangs of New York. This over-hyped, lurid, and nauseatingly meaty tripe is a 2.5 hour reason for swearing off animal flesh, butchery of any kind, and any desire to visit New York's more historical neighborhoods.I sat in gape-mouthed amazement at the gutting, gashing, and gore that culminates in one scene, with rioters sloshing through movie blood. I lost interest in all the characters-or the story, for that matter-after only the 37th corpse piled up in the streets of ""the Five Points.""The colors, the performances, and the fascinating new ways to impale a human body on blade, pike, or cleaver may appeal to the red-meat eaters in the audience-of whom I may just no longer be one-but I'm thinking it's time to clean out the arteries and the brain cells.And go cold turkey on Scorcese.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Greatly directed ""history""",The story of the movie has been greatly directed by Scorsese which took this script and turned it to a almost look alike history.Great performance by Leonardo DiCaprio which has been greatly progressed as an actor since his appearance in The Beach (which was terrible as well as the movie) but he is still having problems expressing his seriousness in the movie.Daniel Day-Lewis had for my opinion get the oscar for his acting which was remarkable great! his cruelness in the film is shown almost to the edge of insanity as well as his knowledge in politics and control of this side of town.

"Brutal, Bloody and Brilliant","From the very opening, you know how violent ""Gangs of New York"" is going to be.  The brief appearance of Liam Neeson as Priest is absolutely brilliant and the tone of the movie is set then.  Everyone knows just what a great actor Daniel Day Lewis is, and he does not let himself down in this one - as the Butcher he is Evil personified, and the surprise to me was the maturity of Leonardo de Caprio as Amsterdam, in such an unusual role for him - he was brilliant and proved he is not the light weight actor that I had previously rated him.  Cameron Diaz was fine, as was the supporting cast.  It is definitely not a movie for everyone as the brutality dominates nearly every scene, but if this bears any resemblance to New York in the 1840's and earlier, then we should all have learned about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scorsese Missed the Mark,"Martin Scorsese is working with a subject that suits him to a tee -- gang warfare in the streets of New York -- and the film's got his trademark kinetic style -- something's always happening on screen. So why does the whole film feel so leaden and uninvolving?""Gangs of New York"" should have been kick ass. Instead, the most it got out of me was a shrug of the shoulders and a ""meh."" Daniel Day-Lewis acts up a storm and is certainly something to see as Bill ""The Butcher,"" the vicious leader of one of the film's eponymous gangs. But unfortunately, the story takes place through the perspective of Leonardo DiCaprio's character, and DiCaprio, usually a fine actor, simply isn't up to the task here. Cameron Diaz, meanwhile, shouldn't be let within 100 feet of a period piece.The film's period look is detailed and authentic -- there's an awful lot of mud in those 19th Century New York streets.

no where near as good as I thought and hoped it would be,"This film follows a young boy who watches his farther die in a gang fight over the 'five points area' of New york. After returning in 1863 he seeks vengeance on Bill the Butcher by infiltrating his inner circle.This film was good but no where near as good as I thought and hoped it would be. What I enjoyed was the directing even tho (for me at least) there's many other Martin Scorsese films done better its still extremely good it won him his first Golden Globe for Best Director. The acting by Daniel Day- Lewis playing Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting was nothing short of incredible you get completely engrossed in his character and he completely steals the show for me. You really believe he's a cold hearted killer willing to do anything to get what he wants. He owns the role! Leo's performance wasn't as good as we are now use to from him but for a film he did in the year 2002 it was still very good and I didn't mind his Irish accent and thought it was pretty good. Cameron Diaz was a pleasant surprise as she was really good at her part as well, one of the best performances iv seen from her. The cinematography was very good as well, at times you really felt you were in 1800's New York. Sadly tho as you would expect from a nearly 3 hour long film it did dip a couple of times and you do lose interest. I thought this was due to the story, it wasn't as intriguing as it should of been and only because of the great acting you wanted to keep watching. Due to not seeing him grow up, at all, which i hate to see in movies makes you not really connect with Leo's the character you still care about him but you should be able to really feel the pain he's in and the emotions thats driving him but annoyingly i couldn't do that.

On hindsight its a re-watchable film thanks to the incredible acting but not a lot more. 7/10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Must Watch,"""Gangs of New York"" was in my opinion a great movie and entertaining to watch till the very end. It covered all things that a good movie should. It had action, suspense, romance, and a great message to all that watched it. While the movie did have some less historical accurate parts it did contain many things that truly happened. It showed the horror of the draft acts and the riots against them. It showed the terrible conditions that immigrants had to put up with, and the filth of areas in New York such as the five points district.

Ultimately Exploitative Work,"It begins, unfolds, and ends with violence. True, there was much tension and wasted lives during the mid-nineteenth century New York centered around Tammany Hall and Five Points.Frankly, though, when all's said and done, I much prefer The History Channel's more scholarly presentation to Martin Scorsese's version.THC presents the pure facts, allowing the viewer to focus in on actual events from a historical perspective. Scorsese's film forces concentration on the director's and scriptor's own viewpoint. And since that attitude is very negative, that's what comes out. ""The Gangs of New York"" is an extremely negative film, exploitative and personally quite sickening.It's too bad a most significant part of American history that has not before been fully depicted, has this long, cold, in-your-face work as its sole exemplar.Nor is there any particular lesson to be learned here, no insight into cause and effect, and no offering to assist humanity to avoid errors of the past. It's as skewed as is the press media, with its main purpose merely to engage the attention and emotions-- not challenge or enlighten them intellectually, humanistically or spiritually.That said, the film does offer the usual superb Scorsese acting and production values.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Complete Movie by Scorsese.,"Analysis of Martin Scorsese's films reveals that like Ridley Scott, Scorsese also is a master of picturesque, artistic violence. ""Gangs of New York"" is a movie set in a time when there were enough such materials. In this film violence rules indifferently, as if this is an usual content of an usual movie. Scorsese masterfully used this post-Lincoln era, when cruelism was the badge of the nation.This is also one movie that's historically so perfect.... which is quite evident from superb set and costume designing. Under Scorsese's brilliant direction, cinematography was also magnificient. But what prompts you to watch this movie again and again is the performance of the two lead actors. Both Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio acted superbly. Day-Lewis delivered undoubtedly his best performance since ""My Left Foot"". His action, his style to hold the daggers, his way to deliver a speech were so original as Bill the Butcher that it's hard to imagine Day-Lewis without those mushtaches. DiCaprio, though not upto his standard, also gave a fairly good performance. But I somehow have a feeling that DiCaprio didn't quite suit into the role. It's not his acting but his looks what perhaps made me feel this way; Not quite hardened, I suppose. Anyway, what he did was fine. Cameron Diaz was not unimpressive too as the pickpocket.The original song ""Hands That Built America"" by U2 is a fantastic one. It accurately catches the subtle sad note underneath all the violence in the film. John Williams' score, as usual, probably going to be the best. So, historic storyline, superb acting, brilliant direction, artistic violence, good score and at last, a thoughtful abstract ending sequence. What more can you want? 5/5.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Intense, Unyielding, and Interesting","This film is compelling. It also catches the viewer off guard. At first, it begins to build itself as your average son-of-killed-man- gets-revenge-years-later plot line. Then it completely throws the viewer off, thereby creating very deeply emotional characters. They feel like they are real as more information is revealed. There is also no shortage of intrigue. It might begin to feel as though the film is too long, but when it is over the entire picture comes together and one sees exactly why it was played out the way it was. Most of the cast is brilliant; the accents are slight but noticeable enough to be believable. Each performance is gritty and well done. Daniel Day Lewis and DiCaprio play off each other beautifully- they're both excellent actors and could have easily over-performed one another, but it can be perfectly understood that Scorsese directed them well. Each main character's story has a purpose that makes sense and doesn't feel unnecessary. It is true, however, that many of the supporting cast is forgettable(mainly because they look very similar and are only seen once or twice), though the film tries hard to make you care about them when they die. And there is a lot of death in this film, specifically killing. When the word ""gangs"" is in the title, that's obvious. The film also does a great job of showing the plight of civil-war era Americans who were affected by the first draft, showing facts that not many remember these days. The end is sure to tug on your thoughts for sure, and it leaves the viewer pondering everything from America's history to the meaning of loyalty. Very well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Brilliant, captivating, exciting","I saw this movie about five years ago, and watched it again in 2009 on a whim. I was pleasantly reminded of why I had such great memories of it to begin with.Leo shows us again why he's a great leading man, as a young Irish immigrant seeking to avenge his father's death. Daniel Day-Lewis instilled fear at every moment, and convinced me to check out his other work. Knives, guns, and blunt objects are abound as immigrants and ""natives"" clash. It's funny how much this movie exposes those that think they are the ""true American natives"" when really, everyone was an immigrant at one point.I also enjoyed how three different people were praying to the same God for polar-opposite intentions. It showed how God can be used as an excuse for... anything, including battle (sound familiar?).Overall, this movie was stellar.

What is worth mentioning above all is the acting overall, which is indeed a great job to see. Her we see Leonardo DiCaprio learning to get into character more totally than what he did in his earlier works. And he learned from few of the best here. We see him here acting with Daniel Day Lewis, who is quite an expert in getting into complex characters such as his in this movie.

Scorsese's worst,"While certainly not a bad film, this is undoubtedly my least favourite Scorsese movie (well,out of the ones I've seen). I was so excited when I heard about the film and the actors because I do actually feel DiCaprio is not a bad actor in general and he's not bad in this either. The problem with this film, I think is the plot. All it is is one guy kills other guy's dad, years later first guy takes his revenge. That's it. There is no more to this story. Does Scorsese not realise that this is the story of The Lion King? Does he not understand how ridiculously unoriginal the film is?So I hear you ask - how come the film is a whopping 2hrs and 45 mins long? Because to make up for the lack of anything to do in the story Scorsese tries to put in every random event that happened in that period into the film despite the fact they have little to do with the plot. What was the point in going on about the drafts for so long. Amsterdam himself says that none of the gangsters were going to be drafted so why do we keep hearing about these things that have nothing to do with the characters? Why go on and on about the riots when none of the people we have been introduced to are taking part?However like I said earlier this film is not bad. The battle scenes while sometimes grotesque are epic and worth the watch. Day-Lewis's De Niro impression is spot on as well and he is quite a good bad guy. Be warned however, this film is severely depressing. My friends and I walked in with intentions to go for  a drink afterwards. However, by the end of the film we all felt so down we all just went to bed.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The actors gave it their best shot, but the movie itself, though interesting and not boring, is a big mess-incoherent, uninvolving and overblown. I think Scorcese became overwhelmed by it all, and I can see now why it took so long to release this movie. I'm also surprised about all the Oscar buzz.",,Anonymous,Crime
Superb Daniel Day Lewis Performance Elevates Scorsese Gang Epic,"Gangs Of New York was a film i had forgotten about until recently, my distant memory recalling Daniel Day Lewis being a highlight of the film. On re-watching this i was reminded of what a great cast we have here. As well as Day Lewis we have Dicaprio, Cameron Diaz, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, Stephen Graham and Jim Broadbent. Daniel Day Lewis performance as Bill The Butcher is that good that only Brendan Gleeson can really compete when on screen with him, Dicaprio suffers by comparison. The film is beautifully shot and the backstory is engaging. The strongest part of the film is probably the middle third where Amsterdam (DiCaprio) is taken under Bill The Butchers wing, you can really see the emotional torment Amsterdam is going through as he is torn between revenge and grudging respect for Bill. Cameron Diaz performance is often criticised but i think she did fine with the role and the love story between her and Dicaprio feels real. On a negative note the film does feel too long, and could have done with being trimmed a little bit and perhaps the set up of Neeson character could have been more in depth as he barely has a cameo yet his fate is pivotal to the story. Ultimately though Gangs Of New York is a well made, well told story elevated to within touching distance of being a great film by Daniel Day Lewis's performance but ultimately falling just short of that pinnacle.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Strong and Entertaining,"Martin Scorsese's movie is close to the best American commercial cinema can get. I do not know to what extent the events described in the movie are true, but they come really alive on the screen. A whole world is brought to our eyes - powerful, violent, colorful and you can really philosophize and say that you understand where the violent power and fascination of today's New York come from. This world seems to come directly from the books of Dickens or Hugo. If the American literature did not have a novel writer of that stature to describe the 19th century society, here comes Scorsese, and re-creates that world one and a half century later on a different media.I am no fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but he is at his best in this film. Daniel De Lewis has already an Oscar on his shelves, and would have deserved a second one for his creation in this movie. There are a lot of other well acted strong characters in this film, and you can feel the hand of the master in directing the actors, as well as in the camera work. One may say that violence is not always justified by logic but by artistic needs, but these were the times, and there are a few memorable scenes to pay back for this.9/10 on my personal scale for this strong and entertaining film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Falling short ..,"This film was saved from the toilet by the ever present net we call Lewis. A Scorcese favorite. Out of all the characters, I found Bill to be of the most intrigue. I wanted to know his life, his hardships. Lewis did an excellent job in portraying a man who worked from the foundation up. A man with honor, and morals amongst men. Sure he may have flown off the handles at a few points, but look at some of the other sides of it. I mean, the Irish finally have their candidate for Sheriff, and yes Bill does do the foolhardy thing by calling on him to fight. So Monk goes on out there and instead of just asking him to come up and talk, makes this huge appeal to the entire city. This scene was vomitorium material, and instead of feeling for he plight, it made me think of what an a$$ he looked like up there. No wonder Bill snuffed him. I didn't feel any amount of pity for DiCraprio at all. To me, Amsterdam was some kid that'd been away for so many years to come back to a world he barely knew. A fight he had never experienced. Cameron Diaz ... well, I didn't much notice her in the film. I didn't know her story much, and I just thought she was lucky Bill was puttin up with her blonde headed ways. Liam Neeson, in his brief moment, was as always, a master at his craft. He is always a man to carry a tall, respectable presence in a film.To boil it all down, this film carried Lewis to new levels, meanwhile leaving all the other actors/actress' behind in the annoying cloud of flamboyance which made this movie reminscent of old Broadway. Gay Broadway. Nothing against either, but they remain on the stage. This was a set oriented piece which was more interested in drawing a viewer into the ""slang"" and the material objects, then the actual story. Story first, costuming second in my belief. Summing it up, I give Gangs of New York a 6/10. Interesting enough to keep me watching, much to annoying to see again. Let's hope Martin scores big next summer. I'd certainly love to see a Goodfellas for our generation.-J-Go",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
On a personal note,"Overall, I Loved this flick. Moreover, as an Irish-American, watching it filled me with great cultural pride. I've seen movies about the Irish before, but never has one made me feel this way. I think I owe it to Mr. Scorsese, author Jay Cocks, and the cast and crew for making a film that had this effect on me. I especially was impressed by this as Scorsese is Italian and not Irish. (I don't know about writer Jay Cocks, although his name doesn't necessarily look Irish to me, I can't say.) Scorsese used his legendary movie-making skills to connect with my inner cultural identity and excite it in a way that made this already spectacular film even better for me.

Good but....,"There were lots of things to like about this movie but the story line was getting pulled in too many directions. Leo's revenge gets lost amidst the other developments making for a less-than-compelling story line and some anticlimatic moments at the end. Also, many of the scenes showed a gratuitous amount of gore as though Scorcese was doing some sort of homage to Peckinpah. On the plus side were some wonderful characters, some great acting (especially Day-Lewis), and beautiful, evocative sets. I also liked the historical context woven into the story: the macro themes depicted are a little known source of New York's history. I'm giving the movie a good rating but it could have been much better. In the end, the whole added up to less than the parts.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Technical Virtousity,"Dante Ferretti's overwhelmingly detailed production design (with set decoration by Francesca LoSchiavo and costume design by Sandy Powell) and Michael Ballhaus' masterful tracking camerawork helps push Martin Scorsese's passionate revisionist history of gang wars between Irish immigrants and Americans into greatness. It's one of the few times (his minor period piece `The Age Of Innocence' is another) where Scorsese has relied so heavily on sets and costuming to advance his New York themes (here it's about the city's amalgamation) and it's also one of his most commercial efforts to date: with its big names (Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz) and familiar plot (it's another story of revenge) to attract a mass audience, Scorsese tones down the graphic nature of the tale; while there's plenty of bloodshed, it's far less shocking than the knife-in-the-hand images of `Taxi Driver' and living burial in `Casino'. The story is by Jay Cocks, but the script seems pieced together with individual contributions from Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan and while it does at times meander from incident to incident, it never bores over the course of one hundred and sixty-eight minutes because the violent tension that keeps mounting is mixed with the characters' poverty-stricken despair and the effect, while it comes close, doesn't desensitize you. The performances by the principals are excellent (DiCaprio has an unreadable look in his eyes and makes a great mythic hero and Diaz does well in a role that's underwritten yet touching); and in fact the film's best moment is a quiet conversation in which Day-Lewis describes to DiCaprio his respect for his enemy/counterpart, the noble warrior (DiCaprio's late father, played in the opening section by Liam Neeson). Day-Lewis' penchant for overacting here serves him well; his misguided isolationist anger is balanced by his respect for the rules of combat and he seems to be as concerned with his character's philosophical motivations as much as the violent ones. Scorsese has never overly politicized but he does here and while his sympathies towards the newcomers is obvious and a bit cloying, the indignation he feels about how these peoples were used, relegated to the periphery and then discarded while laying the foundation of today's New York seems a reasonable, justified response. At this point in his career, Scorsese seems to believe he has to make an epic statement about his town and country to give value to his career--he needn't; his body of work speaks for itself--but while this may not be the crowning achievement he wants it to be, its' technical virtuosity makes it quite an impressive achievement in a class by itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rarely will I give a film such a high rating,"I am generally fairly strict about how I rate films. Rarely would I give a film a 9.It starts out slowly, the first half of the movie. It actually does start with a bang (a battle scene) but after that, it slows down for the first hour or so. But it's like a good book - you have to set up the story for what's going to happen. Because after that first hour, it really picks up the pace. Scene after scene, the suspence of what is going to happen to all the characters that you've begun to understand and root for.So many different themes run through this movie. I've come to the conclusie that it's just as much of a think-movie as a smash-and-bash movie. You get everything from revenge (as the Chinese say, when one starts on revenge, go ahead and dig two graves) to loyalty, power, fear (in more ways than one), even love - yet it manages to avoid the clichés.Just remember, in this film: is the bad guy really the bad guy and is the good guy really the good guy?

"A well-paced, entertaining-enough historical blockbuster that lacks the narrative and thematic maturity set by other films.","Martin Scorsese's grim and elaborate depiction of civil war New York. Gangs of New York sculpts an intriguing detailing of society and a compelling narrative driven around the evolving nature of Leonardo DiCaprio's Amsterdam Vallon and Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting relationship with each other.The huge, and I mean gigantic, ensemble cast are all consistently good enough to grant adequate immersion, even Cameron Diaz isn't terrible, and of course Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely flawless; every time he acts he creates one of the defining, most detailed and utterly memorable characters of its decade. The production is extensive and impressive in scope; featuring numerous detailed sets, countless costumes, and a seemingly infinite number of extras.It is in fact in Martin Scorsese's direction of Gangs of New York that the film falls from greatness, being amateurish at times even; the cinematography and score are unnoteworthy; the voice-over and flashbacks are expository and stops the film from transcending into narrative and thematic maturity (even with the adult content).But nevertheless, Gangs of New York is a well-paced, accessible, entertaining and even thrilling historical blockbuster, featuring a wonderfully indulgent production and a glorious and astoundingly good Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill 'The Butcher'.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A history of a history that few were aware existed,"The nineteenth century was an incongruous time for many peoples. The British empire was losing its worldwide coverage, and the Russian monarchy was but a century or less away from annihilation. Indeed, many films that are set in this era use it as a setting, but very few have depicted it in realistic terms. Gangs Of New York is the first film I have seen, and I have seen many of all varieties, than even makes the attempt. Whether or not they succeeded, I won't say, but they deserve credit for trying.The New York of the nineteenth century is shown as a decadent, corrupt place where roving gangs regular war with one another. It begins with one such battle, in which migrants fight with a group of men who are all whiter than I am, but claim to be natives. Oh well, if they were born there, I cannot argue with them too much, but it does feel strange when the actual natives of America are nowhere to be seen in this production. Still, this opening battle sequence does give a nice, authentic feel for the story.Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely shines as Bill The Butcher, a character you want to hate but just cannot because of the elegant human quality he brings to his performance. Although the film tries to show him as little as he is needed, this is his show. He keeps the audience's attention on the screen in spite of the charisma vortex in the rest of the cast. Speaking of a charisma vortex, one has to wonder exactly what they thought when they cast Leo DiCaprio in what is essentially a gangster film. I'm yet to be convinced that he really even grew that facial hair. Cameron Diaz is little better. She is thoroughly unconvincing as a nineteenth-century prostitute. Which should surprise nobody - she has a difficult time convincing anyone that she is a twenty-first century human being.Some elements of the story are quite hilarious to behold. Whenever I hear someone rabbiting on about how much better we had it in times when the church had greater control of our daily lives or the like, I often kindly request they take a look at things, fictional or no, that say otherwise. The fighting between the fire brigades in this film is one of those things. I'm sure these historical retro-rose-eyeglass wearers would gladly go back to such a time. Then again, when I see the police having to brace themselves against angry citizens breaking into their headquarters instead of the reverse, I guess maybe they have some point, however small.Acting aside, there are some unfortunate decisions made. Whomever was arranging the music should have told Scorcese (or vice versa) that U2 lost whatever credibility they had long ago. I swear, if I hear Bono Vox repeat that these are the hands that built America one more time, I am going to want to put his head further into his rectum. The editing is also a tad off-centre, with much of the final riot in New York seeming like a montage of clips rather than a coherent whole.Still, I gave Gangs Of New York a seven out of ten. It was one of the better films of 2002, and that it didn't win a singular Oscar out of the eleven or more that it was nominated for only further destroys the Academy's credibility. See it with a friend or loved one, and marvel at the work done to create the mood.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The script was messy, and was let down by so much happening in a short space of time after a long / slow / boring, build up.This isn't as good as the classic Scorsese films. There are actually many annoying features in the films, such as the inappropriate music and the stereo-typing of Irish people.Ultimately I found the film confusing, and couldn't see what Scorsese was actually trying to tell us. I was left unconvinced as to how important these gangs were to the birth of New York. The major turning point in the film, actually had very little to do with the gangs, and seemed to be the more important moment in the history of New York.If he was trying to impress us with the colourful characters in the gangs, well the film fails on that count as well.

One of the best movies I have ever seen.,I enjoyed this movie. I did not enjoy it just because of the excessive violence or for it being a gangster movie but I enjoyed it because it had a good plot and the fact that Martin Scorcese decided to take a little bit of a different approach to ways his films are presented. This movie is not about the normal Italian mafia crime families that Scorcese usually presents in his films. Gangs of New York is a true story of battling gangs in 1860s New York city during the civil war. I will not spoil the ending of the film but I will state that if you see this movie.

Lavish and indulgent - a work of flawed genius,"I read somewhere that Martin Scorsese has been trying to get this film made for decades. That is a long time for ideas, plot-threads and themes to be swirling around in such a talented, creative mind. It seems that when he finally got the green light, everything exploded out in a seismic gush of violence and vivid colour. This is movie-making on a mammoth scale  no quarter given, no corners cut, no concessions. CGI is for wimps.The star of this film is New York itself. Scorsese uses great sprawling sets that disappear into the distance; a vast array of props, period pieces and extras; bloody fight scenes that are almost unparalleled in their intensity and ferocity; and a general air of bubbling discontent.New York is and evidently always has been a cultural melting pot. This is the 1860s version and the key conflict is between the vicious, snarling patriots and the boatloads of Irish immigrants who arrive daily. There are no heroes here  no moral high ground  just angry mobs of hoodlums perpetually spoiling for a fight. We join the action just before an almighty dust-up between nationalists led by William 'Bill The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Priest Vallon's (Liam Neeson's) Dead Rabbit gang over control of the notorious Five Points district. It is a blood bath, but Cutting slays Vallon and emerges victorious. He goes on to rule the Five Points with an iron fist, exploiting the fear his legend has generated.Fast forward sixteen years, and Vallon's son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the Five Points with a sizable chip on his shoulder and planning vengeance on Cutting. Before he can act, he becomes embroiled in all the sleaze and corruption and is soon fast-tracked to the upper-echelons of Bill's inner circle. He also finds time to fall for sexy pickpocket Jenny (Cameron Diaz)  not bad for a chubby Irishman with a bum-fluff goatee and a bizarre mid-Atlantic brogue. After being taken under Cutting's wing and learning how he reveres his father's character and memory, Amsterdam suddenly has a crisis of confidence and sees Bill in a different, almost paternal light.You can see his problem: It is difficult not to warm to The Butcher. Day-Lewis injects an impressive amount of passion into a man with admirable commitment albeit to a questionable cause. He may be a psychopath, but he's not afraid to fight for what he believes in and he strongly believes in quixotic notions like honour and respect for one's enemies. He also has a rather splendid moustache.Day-Lewis is undeniably superb in this film and DiCaprio and Diaz are both fine, but it is difficult for an actor to shine through the grandiose direction. Gangs is littered with Scorsese trademarks  the steady cam shots that swoop around Vallon as he strides out to meet Bill dominate the opening scene, but their impact is disappointingly weakened by the slo-mo and speeded-up footage of the otherwise breathtaking fight sequence. Such visual jiggery-pokery may have graced a film like Casino, but here it is strangely out of place  I suppose he was going for a clever juxtaposition of raw hand-to-hand combat with more modern Matrix-style shenanigans. Whatever, I don't think it really works.Scorsese also has a fair bit to say about class. There is social comment all over this film and in the main it is beautifully handled: The (I presume) fictional yarn about Amsterdam's revenge segues neatly into depiction of the real-life conscription riots that took place at the time. Indeed, fact spills into fiction during the thrilling denouement when the showdown between Bill and Amsterdam is overtaken by events around them. Scorsese has little time for the upper-classes  here they are nothing more than a snobbish hangover from British high society - cowering in fear as the angry masses steam-roller through their flimsy security and eject them from their own billiard rooms.Lincoln's presidency, widely regarded as being the fulcrum for modern American life, is here derided as ineffectual. As if to sum this up, William Cutting survives an assassination attempt in a theatre. Famously, Abe was not so lucky. Scorsese's America, as the tag-line suggests, was born on the streets  not in the Whitehouse.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing,Who's idea was it to give Leo Dicaprio the lead for this film? I would like to know the reasoning behind that selection. Maybe it was the same person who decided that Cameron Diaz should have been given the role of Jenny. Neither one of those two had any business being in the movie.

Maybe my favorite movie of all time,"As I was going to see this film, I already knew what is was going to be about, and before I seen it,I already loved the story concept (even If I hated the title - It should've been called ""Ashes of the Irish"" or something like that). but for what ever reason they chose to name this film ""Gangs of New York"", and it wasn't the film I thought it was going to be. First I'd like to say that Daneil Day Lewis played his role perfect. He did so good in his role as the butcher that I cannot imagine any another actor in that role (Really). I also liked the surreal, Dirty,Brutal,Gritty old 19th century New York City setting..I though the sets were fantastic. The Special effects were pretty standard(which means pretty good these days), and Liam Neeson was also very convincing as the boys father,too bad that his character was only in the movie for about the first 15 minutes of the film.However what hurt this film is that it is way too long, and you almost feel like the director is trying to drag it out further with a series of scenes that have little or no bearing on the story. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio were the way wrong choices for this film. I remember thinking to myself as I was watching it that Colin Farrell or Ewan McGregor would've been much more better suited for the role of Anstredam than DiCaprio was. And Diaz is much too much of a modern California girl to star in this period film set in 19th century New York City and it shows. Again I found myself recasting that role to Kristen Dunst or Heather Graham who I believe would've been for better in that role than Diaz. Neither Diaz or DiCaprio are convincing and there acting skills are just flat all the way through this film. Another pitfall of this film is the miserable film score. the pulsating high school marching band style snare drums that continuously play to a fast paced beat actually begins to give you a headache before the film is finished.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
This movie was okay...,"I was able to sit through the three hours but I didn't come out of this movie thinking it to be a masterpiece in filmmaking as many have declared. For starters, I was eager to see this movie because I'm a huge New York City history buff, and I wanted to see Scorcese's depiction of the Five Points. Unfortunately, the relatively mindless and overused plot (son wants to avenge father's death) interfered with what otherwise would have been a pretty good historical fiction account.  To those that disbelieved that New York was really as it was portrayed in the movie, all you have to do is read any book about the Five Points (now, Chinatown) to know that it is historically one of the worst urban slums in history, albeit not nearly as bad as some of the then contemporary writers made it out to be.  To that end, the movie was fairly faithful, with the exception that I think the timing of the historical characters to the events that actually took place were a little off.  Although the acting was decent, parts of the script, and especially the plot, were deplorable.  Overall, I give the movie was okay... it's not the type of movie I would rave about or recommend unless someone wants to see a brilliant acting performance from Daniel Day Lewis.

"A Flawed Masterpiece,","Martin Scorcese's Gangs of New York is one of my favorite movies of the decade and deserved some well deserved Oscar recognition, but it like almost every other film it has man flaws from making it a masterpiece. To praise this film I must say that Daniel-Day Lewis was simply outstandingly perfect as Bill 'the Butcher' and deserved the Oscar over Adrian Brody. Also the set design/costuming was done perfectly and is probably going to be one of the last films to use complete sets instead of CGI, while also using amazing costuming which represented the time and place exceptionally. Scorcese's directing was as always, great (Oscar worthy once again). And on a final note of praise the entire cast of the film was fantastic, perfectly casted with quality performances from every cast member.Although I give this film a lot of praise as I certainly love it, it has many minor problems with one impending large one. It's main problem is that it taps into many different themes throughout the entire movie, but fails to go deeply into any of them only tapping the surface of any of them. It felt as if the film could have been three separate films if they had focused on one or two subjects. Other minor problems can be it is an epically long film that nearly runs three hours and it seems to drag in a few parts but over all has a nice flow.This movie certainly could have been better but it still stands as a great film, a treat for the eyes, and a pleasure to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

They have a big fight with another gang, the ""Dead Rabbits"". The leader of that gang, Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), is killed and his son Amsterdam Vallon witnesses everything. 16 years later he is Leonardo DiCaprio and he seeks revenge. A lot has changed. I can say more about the story but I don't want to give too much away. There's one sub-plot involving Cameron Diaz as the love interest.The movie looks great. The costumes, setting, basically New York around 1846, looks perfect. The cinematography adds to this as well. DiCaprio is a good lead although almost every other character is more interesting including characters played by John C. Reilly, Jim Broadbent and Brendan Gleeson. The best thing in this picture is Daniel Day-Lewis. When he is on the screen you don't watch anything else, simply because you can't. He is so impressive, so great.

Wild Film And Bill Steals The Show,"Gangs of New York is one of the wildest and most unique films of Scorsese's career and that's because it's wild and unique by any standard. The film takes place during a forgotten and fascinating corner of American history. The movie is based on some facts and real characters but of course takes its dramatic liberties. The plot concerns DiCaprio character on a path of vengeance against Day Lewis' who killed his father and is sprawled out at a 167 minutes. But that's because that's a story to give it some direction and to hang everything else on. What this film is really focused on are the characters and environment. Every scene tries to further immerse you into it with intricately deep backgrounds and minor details. And of course the most compelling and stealing the show is Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher. There's a number of good performances in this movie including star Leonardo DiCaprio who marks the start of his continuing 20 year 5 movie collaboration with Martin Scorsese in this film, but everything is shoved aside by Day Lewis. He feels like this character was transported from that time into here with a bunch of modern actors.

It doesn't know whether to be a tale about an aggravated period of New York's history, or a simple tale of revenge. And after stumbling back and forth for three hours trying to decide which direction to go in - it ultimately fails to satisfy on both accounts. Daniel Day Lewis pays wonderful homage to Deniro (although I'm not sure if that was intentional), and the rest of the cast do an okay job. But if I were you, I'd leave after the opening sequence 'cos it ain't going nowhere but downhill from there my friends.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overbearing and boorish,"What a self-indulgent snorefest this one was. At over 2.5 hours long I thought it'd never end, and pity those who paid real money to sit through it in a cinema.I ended up disliking the ""hero"" much more than I disliked ""Bill"" since at the very least Bill could be taken at face value without appearing one-dimensional. He was a real person with a breadth of beliefs and emotions and D. D.-L. did a terrific job playing the character. DiCaprio, on the other hand, was almost cardboard and frankly I've seen better drama from the protagonist on ""The Benny Hill Show."" Perhaps less time spent pondering his own legendary acting skills and more time considering what real people look and behave like would be well spent.Cameron Diaz looks and behaves like she's dressed up for Halloween in this one, she never convinced me her character had the least interest in anyone around her or in anything going on.The shot at the end where the graves are seen in front of an increasingly modernized, more familiar NYC was disliked by several people I spoke to for some reason or other but I actually enjoyed it and thought it was a good touch.3 points for the morphing NYC time-lapse scene-4 points for DiCaprio-2 points for Diaz (at least she had less dialogue than the leading man).-1 for the soundtrackDon't rent.

Solid movie experience,"Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York serves as a positive cinematic experience. While the film can be a bit slow moving at times and some characters have heavy accents that can be tough to understand at times. However, outstanding acting and a relatively interesting storyline paired with exciting action takes you back in time to the battles between the several gangs in New York City in the mid to late 19th century. While the story may not be entirely historically accurate, the modern day movie viewer is not likely to avoid the film solely for this reason. While this may not be Leo Dicaprio's best film, it is certainly still a solid performance. Daniel Day Lewis is also a bright spot as his depiction of ""The Butcher"" is both terrifying and interesting as the viewer seems to be wanting to learn more and more about his character as the movie progresses.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Nutshell Review: Gangs of New York,"I guess the one thing on everyone's mind about the show, just what is so NC about the NC-16 rating that is slapped on this movie currently screening in local theatresYour search is over, here are the answers: 1. The bloody opening gang fight, which one suspects has been snipped at some points ever so carefully by the censors 2. There is a nightclub scene which has prostitutes baring their chests 3. In that scene they smoke opium 4. Sorry guys, you do not see Ms Diaz exposed ala Halle Berry in NC-16 SwordfishSynopsis OK, now to the movie proper, just 4 words: Daniel Day-Lewis Rocks. If you think that is 3 words, you're just being petty. The first 10 minutes of raw gang power's the best thing in the show, other than that... sad to say, there ain't no more of an all out gang war despite the rebuilding of The Dead Rabbits. The plot is choppy at times, probably because the show had to be cut down to a more butt-tolerable length of 169mins.The Good Leo Di Caprio's Amsterdam resurrects The Dead Rabbits.

Cinema is about dreaming,"Don't let negative opinions put you off. It is one of rare examples of good balance between sentimentality and art in cinema. 'Gangs ...', with their beautiful pictures, first-sort editing and matching music are much more then a pseudo-historic movie as the aforementioned Braveheart. They tell a tale happening in a different world, so much different from the one we live in or see in 'normal' movies. The story and the characters may be a bit on the schematic side, like in about every Hollywood production, but this is a simplicity of a fairy-tale or a legend, and is completely adequate to a nostalgic - and somewhat colored up - vision of times and people long gone by. Having said that, the acting, as well as directing leave nothing to be desired.If you go to the cinema to dream a dream together with the director, like on Burton's or Jarmush's works, you should definitely see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Research the Five Points before watching this film,"This is one of those movies that is very deep, has a lot going on at the same time, and demands your full attention. But one thing that it also requires is a historical knowledge of this time period. Without that knowledge, the movie isn't worth much to the viewer. You may also find yourself lost and even wondering why anyone likes this film.I will start off this review with the positive aspects of the film.1. The acting. Daniel-Day Lewis put together his best performance since ""My Left Foot"". He plays the antagonist and does a superb job of making you loathe him. The greasy hair, the ridiculous outfits, the smug look on his face, that arrogant walk, and even his manner of speaking makes him repulsive. His image alone makes you want to curl up your fist and smash his face in. He is truly the ultimate villain. Even many of the smaller roles are played quite well. The actor selection for this movie is amazing, save the selection of Cameron Diaz. Don't get me wrong, Diaz surprisingly performed her part well. But with Scorsese, you'd expect a better selection of actress. Nonetheless, she easily put in her best performance ever.2. This film does a fine job depicting this specific time period in New York. The story is important and is actually quite relevant today. Based on the description of this movie on the back cover of the DVD, I figured this movie was just about the Irish. But it's not. It is also about civil rights, the poor, the corrupt, and is a testimony to the history of New York. This is a story that needed to be told and it was put together quite well. The set designer deserves credit for putting together an excellent representation of a Civil War era New York.Here are the problems with this film:1. It is still rather bland and lengthy. The movie is more informative than entertaining. While the movie definitely has tense moments, irony, foreshadowing, and amazing acting it still doesn't have much of a climax. The climax also quickly fizzles.2. The movie has so much going on that it becomes quite confusing. I commend the director for using visual aids such as flashbacks to try to clarify the film. But it is still hard to follow. With so many events going on and so many different groups fighting, it's hard to keep track of the whole point of the film. At the end of the movie plenty of people will be left wondering what just happened and what purpose this film holds.This movie is still worth watching. But like I stated earlier, please do a little research before watching this movie. Do a quick study on the Five Points, the Civil War, and immigration during the Civil War era. You will appreciate the film much more if you know what is going on.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Almost great.,"Well in my mind Scorsese is just about the greatest living American director still working on a regular basis.  This film had many elements of greatness but ultimately I had my share of problems, the biggest having to do with how this epic got made in the first place.  No way, no how was a picture this size going to get financed without a big star or two at the center, and it is that star that was my biggest problem with the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio does a perfectly fine job but his performance is hardly inspired, he did the best job he could but we was not the best person for the job.  I found him to be one note and boring.  Too bad Collin Farrel was not the hot star then that he is now, I think he would have been far more interesting.  Daniel Day-Lewis on the other hand was absolutely awe inspiring.  Man can this guy act, never would I have thought a year ago that I would shake in my boots at the mention of his name, but his Bill the butcher is seriously intimidating. The rest of the cast is first rate, especially old faithfuls like John Reilly and Brendan Gleeson.  The production is huge, the sets amazing though because there were so few sets, I'd say the bulk of the action took place in three locations, the movie felt oddly claustrophobic.  Maybe after a second look I will feel differently as is so often the case when viewing the work of a master like Scosese, but for now I felt the film was lacking",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Intense, Violent, and a Rough Time Period in History","After watching Gangs of New York, I have a better picture of how rough life was during the 1840's- 1860's. Between gangs and protests against conscription, violence and chaos roamed the streets of New York. I believe that the movie was produced well to show the hatred towards immigrants and how the immigrants survived. Between having to pay one gang, the natives of America, and having to fight other rival gangs in order to keep their ""homes"", life was rough for the new immigrants. Amsterdam knew that in order for survival he had to join forces with Bill the Butcher. This pained Amsterdam because Bill killed Amsterdam's father, but in order to survive you had to work for Bill. The movie also shows perseverance through Amsterdam rising up after his father's death and humiliation by Bill to form the Dead Rabbits Gang again and try to reclaim the city. Everyone should watch this movie to see just how divided the United States was during the Civil War, it was not just North and South.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A lovely, enlightening, and profound picture!","How could anyone deny ""Gangs of New York"" of its beauty and grandeur? How could anyone deny the historical benefits of the film's experience? But most of all, how could anyone claim that ""Gangs of New York"" is a failure? In my mind, considering the stakes, it is Scorsese's greatest success! Historically, the film takes a small number of liberties, but calling it inaccurate would be like saying Picasso's faces weren't life-like enough. Who cares? We are presented with an impression of a world rarely known about. An impression of a dark, cruel, and forgotten time which is brought to life by the most amazing set, make-up and costume designs ever concieved and constructed, and filmed with crafty and gorgeous camera work. Everything else is perfect, what about the acting? Leonardo DiCaprio, regardless of what people say, is a great actor. It is a fact. His vocal and facial emotions are brought to new heights in this one, and it is amazing to watch. Cameron Diaz is also good, with her pristine subtleties in the beginnings, and emotional breakdowns later on. But Daniel Day-Lewis takes the taco as the gross, colorful, and overwhelming Bill the Butcher. He literally becomes the character, and the results are shockingly brilliant. ""Gangs of New York"" will be the pinnacle of New York history movies, if not New York movies in general. It spotlights gang life, racism, the Civil War draft riots, and the horrid conditions of New York's Five Points.

It was also very interesting to see what the roles of religion and politics were (or could have been) those days.I really love Scorsese's obsessions with religion and I can't think of other American directors making a film like this, I think he is a free soul (or at least he is not with these dull times).God bless America.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scorsese fell short.,"While the movie itself was historically amazing and the set incomprehensible, Scorsese took some serious shortcuts on this film.  I was impressed with the acting performances (especially that of Diaz, who I thought might flop).  However, there were several screen shots of extremely poor quality.  It was like they inserted unenhanced shots within the other well-done and improved shots for some unknown reason.  Every time they did this the lighting of the same shot was too light and the picture incredibly grainy.  At other moments in the film, the voice-overs were so poorly inserted over the film that you could hear the actors speaking when their lips weren't even moving.While I agree that this film was good, it could have been so much better. I felt as if Scorsese might have taken shortcuts and produced a blockbuster, candy and popcorn film instead of a masterful and monumental film.

'Gangs' is a great American film in the tradition of the best films of the seventies, including of course Scorcese's most famous work. It may not be to everyone's taste - it is a period drama, it is very bloody and violent, and in many ways it rips apart the idealised past America holds for itself. But go and see it and make up your own mind. As a piece of filmaking, it is unrivalled in contemporary America.

I thought to myself, ""wow, is this what DVD's have come down to?""Anyway, so i pick up the movie (turned out it was $7.50 plus tax) and watch it. This is my reaction:Leonardo DiCaprio did pretty good in the cliché role. It gave me shivers down my spine with his delivery of certain lines that revealed the seething resentment in his heart. His reaction in the end is priceless. (PM me for more details I guess)Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed was, in my opinion almost as scene stealing as Daniel Day- Lewis. You could feel the remorse in his voice as his beloved 'votes' are being burned to eternal damnation.Daniel Day-Lewis... He is quite the actor. A lot of people bash him for being over the top but I think his performance very much so fits the movie since a lot of the stuff we see in the movie are meant to wow us. Day-Lewis takes his time to get everything spot on. From the accent of his voice, to his mannerisms, to even the way he comes onto the screen. He dominates everything, and even when he's not on the screen, he is left onto the back of your mind. He's magnetic, mesmerizing, methodical and meticulous (alliteration intended). That was definitely worth his Oscar nomination for this movie.Final thoughts: all the three actors above, plus the subtle things in the movie like the dude drawing Boss Tweed in the bare knuckle boxing scene (a reference to Thomas Nast?), the references to Jesus, etc is what convinces that this is pure, unadulterated entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Advertising won't trick me,"I don't care who directed it, this movie sucked. The acting is terrible, the characters aren't beleivable at all, the storylines and main points of this movie aren't imaginative, their just stupid and ridiculous, in fact the only good part in this movie is the actual historical facts (which have nothing to do with the storyline, and aren't exactely diffacult to do whatever you want with seeing as it was a friggen riot). First on the acting, De Caprio still is just as bad as he was in Titanic, unbeleivable, inconvincing and overall, he doesn't come off as 'badass' he comes of as just being an paumpus ass. He's supposed to be Irish but he continualy slips in and out of accent. Cameron Diaz should stay in the stupid pop-culture movies because her 'blonde cheerleader' acting style obviously is way out of place in this movie set in the 1860's. And Lewis as 'Bill the Butcher' just comes off as a jerk, not as the leader of the 'Native American' party during the war (which are badly represented since although they were politically active group, they were not a common street gang, which makes sense since they hated both the Irish and the blacks, why would they have to hang around in the slums?). Now for the story, it starts off somewhat interesting with the battle between obviously persecuted Irish and some other unknown group (which since you don't know they're the 'Native' party yet, makes the fact ok). But in this scene, the main character Amsterdam is an 8 year old, and not Leo. But then the time warp happens and it's 16 years later, enter Leo. The storylines don't display the chaotic and desperate struggle between natives of New York, Irish immigrants from the potato famine and freshly freed slaves, struggling for jobs, food and houses. Where there was scuffles and fights, they were random and not organized, gangs were small and primarily nothing more than names of small groups of teens, rather than the personality and colorful differences in the movie. Lastly, this movie shows an organized slum of gangs who meet at conferences to plan fights, this is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. And to top it all of, for about 30 minutes this is a friggen porno, bubes, sex and whores which is obviously there to distract from the fact that there are 10 second pauses in between each line!

"Gut-churning, but thrilling and masterfully executed.","As there are already many excellent, detailed, and comprehensive comments on this film, mine shall have in the main a more general approach. North America (not including Mexico), to a much greater extent than South America, really doesn't have all that much history when compared with practically anywhere else apart from the antipodes. My apologies to my American (USA) and Anzac cousins, but this is a fact. That is why we see the same chunks of American history recycled again and again, with a great many contradictions from film to film. (Though why they don't exploit the two wars with Britain long after the War of Independence I have never understood, especially since neither of them could really be considered an American defeat). One can understand, however, why movie-makers had up to now kept the wraps on, or swept under the carpet, this particular piece of history. Though doubtlessly exaggerated but true in essence, this movie shows us a vast panorama of a variegated and divided community, who like rival colonies of ants slaughter one another to take sole possession of a disputed ant-hill. I cannot recall a more brutal and callous struggle for the survival of the fittest ever shown on such a large scale on the screen that wasn't a bona fide war-film. And, mark you, the combatants, male and female, are, except right at the end, exclusively civilians. Here we see all the prejudices, hatred, megalomania, corruption and cupidity that still, to some extent, vitiate American society even up to this day, and which are the cause of such conflicts. And all this mayhem occurs among inhabitants of that hub of civilisation, the Big Apple, when one would be less surprised if it were taking place among the head-hunters of Borneo in the depths of the primaeval forest(my apologies also to any Bornean headhunters who happen to read this piece). I can quite understand others avoiding or heartily disliking this film, because it certainly isn't suitable fare for the squeamish, and shows ,as I have said, the ugly side of American society that some would prefer to forget. Daniel Day-Lewis is convincingly multi-facetted and gives a superlative performance. How this bloodthirsty bully and the last of the Mohicans can possibly be being portrayed by the same actor staggers the imagination. Di Caprio gives a fairly convincing performance as a young vendetta-seeker, which is certainly stronger than that of ""Titanic"" when he refused to turn blue despite his long sojourn in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.( Perhaps such a hue would have rendered him less romantic, though it did a lot for Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart""! ). Liam Neeson does a short but competent job as a harsh but loving father and a bold and chivalrous skirmisher. By the way, the nasty-looking assortment of weapons used to gouge, slash, and disembowel adds much verisimilitude to the slaughter, before which the ""rumbles"" in ""West Side Story"" pale into insignificance. Cameron Diaz makes a convincing pickpocket, and does her best work since the very different rôle in ""Very Bad Things"". She manages to look much more attractive than usual, so how Leonardo manages to resist her feminine charms after being locked up in a religiositous reformatory for sixteen years is difficult to understand. The camera work is fantastic: the scene where we get a ""de-zooming"" bird's eye view of the opposing warrior bands in the snow is like a painting of Hell by the Dutch renaissance artist Hieronymus Bosch! One thing puzzles me though, which must be the fault of the scriptwriter: how can Bill the Butcher be so incredibly accurate in his knife-throwing when he has no depth vision for lack of one eye? Unfortunately, I saw this film dubbed into Spanish, which, although I understood everything that was said, and the dubbing here is probably the best in the world, much may have got lost in translation, and, of course, I was deprived of the timbre of the actors' real voices and the variety of accents and dialects (all were speaking flawless Castilian)and, possibly, Anglo-Saxon curses, which must have figured prominently in the original dialogue. Had I seen it in the English-language version, I would most likely have given it a nine or ten instead of an eight.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Life wasn't sugarcoated like it is now (plumbing,electricity,natural gas,grocery stores,MOVIES,)It was a fight for survival (limited food,clothes, etc...)I think that's what was portrayed by Scorsese. The documentary states that there were very few policemen at this time period And their main duty was to protect the property of the rich and well off. Life just wasn't civilized yet.

"Unrealistic and farfetched, however it has some merit!","""Gangs of New York"" is not an easy film to watch. It's excessively violent. There's a lot of blood and some disturbing scenes. I don't mind any of those things as long as they are not farfetched as they were in this movie. The violence is so farfetched that you think it's only a movie and that there is no way it could have ever happened. The whole thing goes beyond being realistic, so it becomes forced and unbelievable.The love story becomes predictable and uninteresting. We don't really seem to have any reasons to care about the love story of Amsterdam and Cameron's characters. It all becomes too farfetched. Daniel Day Lewis is not as great as many people are saying. He seems to be too prepared for his performance, so that it becomes what it is, only a ""performance"".Leonardo Dicaprio is miscast. He's much better doing other kinds of dramas or comedies like ""Catch me if you Can"". You're so used to seeing him as the nice boy that it's hard for him to fit in this part. However, he's passable as well as Cameron Díaz. Her performance is good, though she needs a better script to really show better acting skills. Her performance in the knife scenes is very powerful and strong. Her eyes turn red and when they do, it means they're really getting into the role as if they were living the drama itself.Martin Scorsese annoys me as always. He annoyed me with movies like ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Age of Innocence"". He seems not to believe in God, since you see Amsterdam throwing the Bible into water (a gratuitous event) and you also see a family praying for their safety, but just as they finished praying, the War begins and people destroy their house. It's as if Martin Scorsese would've said to people ""don't believe in God, throw the Bible into the lake, or see that God doesn't do what we ask Him to do). Those things really annoyed me in this movie, and they were gratuitous events. The movie could've been the same without those scenes.""Gangs of New York"" has some good points as well. There are some gripping scenes like the knife throwing scene and the fight between the butcher and Amsterdam. Cameron's performance is outstanding, and Leonardo's return in movies is nice to see.

"May not be a classic, but who cares?","This film seems to fit in the category of "" love 'em or hate 'em"", and if asked to choose, I would have to align myself with the first group.  The movie has its flaws ( a somewhat distracted and unfocused plot, a throwaway love story, and a wandering Irish brogue affected by Leonardo DiCaprio, among others), but I was sufficiently impressed by the Wagnerian scope of the whole enterprise to the point where these minor flaws didn't concern me.If nothing else, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance made watching ""Gangs"" worthwhile, simply to enjoy the gusto with which he brings to life the vicious, Irish-hating gang boss Bill Cutting.  With his odd accent and even odder fashion sense, this character could be taken for a cartoon at first glance, but the xenophobic rage underneath this facade reveals itself frequently in both words and action, letting any and all know that this guy is to be taken seriously.  As both antagonist and warped father figure to DiCaprio's character, Bill displays a complex and self-contradictory nature that begs the viewer's scrutiny.  Here is a man who openly despises anything and everything Irish, yet he has an Irish right-hand man, and in Diaz and DiCaprio, two Irish surrogate children. And, for all his psychopathic brutality, he still maintains his own peculiar code of honor, in which he holds in highest esteem the memory of his mortal enemy, who also happens to be...once again, Irish.  Day-Lewis renders this monster believable and, at times, sympathetic. In contrast, every other actor's performance pales in comparison, but there are no major complaints on this score.  DiCaprio, Diaz, and the rest effectively inhabit the grim world that Scorsese creates for them in all its squalid glory.  If these characters offer little emotional engagement to warm our hearts to their plight, it may be for the simple reason that they themselves are emotionally dead, incapable of any passion but the desire to survive. As for the movie's look, it is authentically grungy, right down to the hogs rooting in the street, but it is also lush and beautiful in its cinematography and costuming.  The painstakingly reproduced New York of the mid-19th century is a wonder of cramped tenements and dingy saloons that sucks you into the despair of a city on the verge of disaster.In spite of its extended length, I found the film to be well-paced, and it moved along briskly.  I did feel that the climactic ending was a little rushed and didn't quite play out as expected, but that wasn't enough to mar the whole film.  Without getting into any debate over the historical accuracy of the events depicted, I was left with a sense of gaining some insight on a nearly-forgotten chapter in our nation's history.  Not a pretty chapter, necessarily, but a fascinating one nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The underbelly of American history.,"After the initial fight scene ended leaving a patina of red blood soaked snow covering the area of this gang fight, my memory immediatelyreturned to Michael Cimino's masterpiece, Heaven's Gate.Thereafter throughout the film I kept thinking that I was looking at the reality of America's teenage years-the years that don't correspond to Cherry Blossoms, apple pie and all the other ""nice""  icons of the past in which America wants to wrap itself.The connections between the embedded violence that Michael Moore examined in Bowling for Columbine and the gestation of the violence examined by Scorsese in this film are far too strong to be ignored.This historical relationship of violence should be recognized and steps taken to eliminate such immaturity from a country that purports to be leader of the world.  I know this national examination will never take place but the threads connecting the past to the present must somehow be cut .",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Gangs of New York"":  How Accurate is its History?","Beginning in the 1920s and for about a decade and a half Herbert Asbury wrote a series of historical travelogues about the sin quarters of a few American cities.  Examined were New Orleans's Latin Quarter and the Barbary Coast of California, San Francisco being its undisputed headquarters.  His most popular book was, however, ""Gangs of New York,"" which enjoyed a wide circulation and is easily found in second-hand bookstores today.  My copy is an original.  This book would never have enjoyed a contemporary republishing but for Martin Scorsese's adoption of its lurid story for his new, sprawling, partially engrossing but also flawed film of the same title.Herbert Asbury was no scholar and in his introduction to ""Gangs of New York"" he wisely eschews any interest in or competence at sociological analysis - a reality any reader would recognize halfway into his saga.  Asbury was a popularizer of legend, myth and historical record recording with a bit of raciness that appealed to 1920s readers a past that he viewed as finished and buried.  His gangs were no longer a menace to urban folk (he wrote before Prohibition spawned the emergence of major organized crime, run competitively and homicidally by Italian, Irish and Jewish figures).Scorsese aims for accuracy.  In physically reconstructing the notorious ""Five Points"" area of Manhattan he did a good job (albeit in Italy!).  But mirroring on a set the famous Mission Church, later the infamous combined hot bed residence and brothel as well as criminal base of operations, isn't the same as doing what language can do: make alive the smells and cries that emanate from as close to hell as humans in their degradation can journey.The film starts in 1846 with a violent confrontation between Irish Catholic emigrants and so called ""native"" Americans, what we might consider to be low(er) class WASPS.  Very low class.  A blind xenophobia and religious-based hatred fuels the bloody combat and it's an accurate reflection of a New York still gripped by the violence of the aptly named ""Know Nothings"" (actually their response to questions about their activities, this being before the heydey of the Fifth Amendment). Not mentioned in the film is the 1849 Astor Place riot, a protest by ""Know Nothings"" to the appearance of a famous English actor which ended in a number of these characters being swept away by militia fire.Scorsese continues this explanation for inter-group homicide and rioting through the July 1863 Draft Riots, probably the most deadly urban riots in American history (the jury is still out and always will be as to the death toll especially amongst blacks).  This may work as cinema but it's not accurate.  Gut dislike of the Irish (and later the Italians and the Jews) was certainly real in 1863 but that wasn't what the riots were about.  The film does show violence against blacks including lynchings but the underlying hatred that drove thousands into the streets in mad rioting was fueled by economics.By 1863 Irish AND Italian working class men feared that blacks would take away what often was a precarious livelihood at best.  The enactment of conscription by the Federal government (coming after the Confederacy had established the precedent) did not simply arouse rage because of a fear of combat.  The Draft was viewed by most white working class people, regardless of ethnic association, in two ways: it supported a war to liberate economically competitive blacks (which the film briefly shows through signs) and it bolstered the argument that the conflict was ""A Rich Man's War and a Poor Man's Fight.""  The film recognizes this with mention of the $300 substitute fee by which one hit with a draft notice could evade service. But the continued emphasis on religious basis as a cause of the rioting is exaggerated.The depiction of the relatively young and politically perspicacious William Marcy (""Boss"") Tweed is amusingly on target and many in the Manhattan audience laughed when he mentions, offhand, his desire to build a great courthouse in the city (the Boss Tweed Courthouse led to his imprisonment where he died because of the monumental graft with which it is forever associated.  The building, beautifully restored, is again a source of political controversy).Costumes and language largely reflect what we know of the times.  Scorsese engaged Luc Sante, author and historian, and probably one of the finest chroniclers of New York's criminal past, as adviser and his efforts show.This film has attracted much media attention and articles on the history of New York's gangs have appeared in a number of publications including Time Out New York, New York Magazine and the New York Times.  On TV several good documentaries have been screened, for example on The History Channel. People wanting a serious and very well-written account of what Five Points was really like should read the book ""Five Points"" by Lyle Ambinder - it's close to definitive.*****As to the film:It's good, not great. Twenty or thirty minutes could have been edited out and should have been. There are no opening screen credits and the first end credit is ""Directed by Martin Scorsese.""  That isn't there for nothing: this is as much a director's all-consuming project as was James Cameron's ""Titanic.""  Leonardo De Caprio is expectedly good as the young man seeking to avenge the death of his father at the hands of the leader of the ""Natives,"" played by an astonishing Daniel Day-Lewis.  His acting alone justifies seeing the film.  Cameron Diaz is predicatably okay, not more, playing that most endearingly familiar screen role, ""The Good-hearted Hooker Next Door.""Overall, 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese's masterpiece,"I was working at the cinema when Scorsese's epic period film Gangs of New York came out in 2002, and the first time I watched it, I was blown away. From the visceral opening battle, to the brutal finale, I loved every minute of the film. Scorsese has never been shy about violence on screen. After all, this is the director who gave us the brutal gang murders in Goodfellas and the torture scene in Casino.I had never read Herbert Asbury's book about 19th century gangs in New York City, nor did I know about this obscure period of New York history. Focusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens and winding alleys of the Bowery and the Five Points district of Lower Manhattan, the book evokes the destitution and violence of a turbulent era. This film made me want to know so much more about the people, the battles, the politics and the blood-soaked tribal warfare.Leonardo DiCaprio, in his first collaboration with Scorsese, is unfortunately the weakest part of the film. It's not that he's bad, and I do not agree that his accent is shaky, it's just that he was still reasonably green in his career. The supporting cast is a very strong ensemble of great character actors like Brendan Gleeson, John C. Reilly and Jim Broadbent. Daniel Day-Lewis, well known for his method action and complete immersion in his roles, gives the greatest performance of his career as the brutal gang leader Bill the Butcher. When Bill yells at Liam Neeson's Priest Vallon ""Then may the Christian Lord guide my hand against your Roman Popery!"", I was gripped to the screen, watching the warring clans hacking and stabbing until the snow is stained red.I would love to see the original 4 hour cut of the film, before it was whittled down to it's current length, and that's a rare thing for me to want a longer film. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is amazing, and Howard Shore's rousing score is incredible. The best film of 2002 (The Academy award winner, Chicago, is overrated rubbish). Gangs of New York is my favorite film of the decade. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A quite excellent piece of cinema,"How did this cinema feature earn my praise?Well, as any of my friends, family, and teachers can tell you-I have a really low attention span. I tend to judge movies by if I can tell how much time has gone by, and how restless I have gotten.If I get restless after ten minutes and don't wish to endure a minute more, that's a pretty poor movie. If after three hours I feel as if maybe an hour or so has gone by, and look at the clock with wonder- then, the movie is a truly excellent watch.Gangs of New York managed to hold my attention for it's entire length; it accomplished this because it did not hold your hand, block your vision, or bore you; it gave a slightly romanticized look into the lawlessness and chaos of early New York; it managed to show the excessive violence of the times without the violence being the only thing. Many action movies rely only on action to carry themselves forth; Gangs of New York managed to have extremely large portions of graphic displays without the feeling that the violence was the only draw to the movie. Rather, the relations between the characters took place upon the context of the violence.It's world building was done excellently, in a manner described as ""Show, not Tell""; however there were monologues that explained the world on basis. But these monologues and other conversations that explained the context did not feel forced, as if they only existed for the viewer, but instead they felt natural, giving us an insight into the character's lives, thoughts, and emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The ""Bill The Butcher"" movie","I went to see the long awaited ""Gangs of New York"" not knowing what to expect. When I got out of the theater I was filled with a sense of peace not because the movie portrayed it, but because it showed the other way around.""Gangs of New York"" is a movie about open war; about defeating your enemy by any means necessary, about going into battle when everything else has failed and you realize killing the other is the only way. The movie shows a place with no law but the street law, no order but the order the gangs establish; a place where violence is the common language. This is a city in which the strong survives and the weak is massacred (it reminds me of today's Tepito, Mexico City). And in the midst of chaos there is still room for honor, loyalty and love.Martin Scorsese has done a great job transporting us to this dreadful city. Once again I have to (painfully) admit that there is no need for computer graphics to make a time and place, such as XIX century's New York city, come alive. I guess it is much easier for actors to be in character in a place they can see and touch. It also demonstrates that you don't have to be extremely explicit in your shots to achieve a sense of animal violence.Daniel Day-Lewis and the rest of the actors did an excellent job, with the possible exception of Cameron Diaz. Leonardo DiCaprio has proved again that he can be not-annoying when he wants to. After this movie and ""Catch me if you can"" I wonder if he's only good when he's sharing the screen with a REALLY good actor, like Daniel Day-Lewis or Tom Hanks.And speaking of Daniel Day-Lewis, HE IS AWESOME! His performance is the best of 2002-2003 and probably the best I'll ever see in years. Thanks to his portrayal, Bill ""The butcher"" has made it into the list of the best villains in the history of cinema; right up there with guys like Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. He's the face of pure undying evil. He's the most powerful guy around, he knows it too well and he will use it against you -personally- if you ever cross his path. I absolutely loved him. I think he is the trademark of the whole movie; I imagine a future conversation like this: -""Hey, what was the name of that movie with Bill The Butcher in it?"" - ""You mean Gangs of New York?"" - ""Oh yes, that's it"".There is one other thing I noticed about the structure of the storyline. It would seem it was based on a three-act play, the first being from the beginning to Amsterdam meeting Bill the Butcher, the second from their meeting to the betrayal and separation and the third from the separation to the end. Each act has its own climax and the pacing of the movie becomes very slow, and sometimes too slow, in the transitions between them.The only thing this movie lacked for me to rate it a 9 is a good ending. Me, like many other people I know despised the ending, or at least didn't understand it at all. I liked the very last shot though. The one with that beautiful view of the evolution of New York City.""Gangs of New York"" is a must-see. Go see Daniel Day-Lewis in the performance of a lifetime.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Just imagine a giant hairball,,and trying to figure out which hair is yours","Thats what I thought of this movie,,and the fact that it was way too long. I totally agree with the other comments about Cameron Diaz being miscast for the role,, I just couldn't see her as Jenny. I also considered Scorcese's attempt to incorporate fact with fiction a disaster- I honestly found the movie dreadful. And the accents-terrible. While Leo was narrating the film, I heard both an American accent, then Irish  (whoops!) and his character did the same thing.I also realized a couple of the characters in the movie were Irish and not American, when their accents changed-you have to look at the movie differently when you finally learn whose side they're on. Too much unnecessary violence also gives this movie the booby prize-speaking of booby,  you see alot of them in the film too-also seemed out of place. Maybe it was a good excuse to have Cameron and Leo get their freak on, circa 1846. The producers ought to have included good ole'Abe Lincoln in a threesome-it couldn't of made the film any more ridiculous. Sorry, I am normally a fan of Martin Scorcese but if there's a such thing as ""trying too hard"", this is a great example.",,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best films I've ever seen,"Gangs of new york is the best American film i've ever seen. There are so many elements that made me love this movie: Daniel Day Lewis as the butcher(he rocks), the atmosphere in gangs: survival of the fittest, bigotry, illegal gambling, thieves and celebration. The film is about a young man(leonardo dicaprio in his best role) who seeks vengeance on Bill the butcher after the menace killed his father. I'm surprised that this film didn't come out in 2001 because this film would've had better chances for winning all the Oscars instead of a beautiful mind. I was enthralled, freaked out and surprised when i was this film. This has been another hit for Martin Scorsese since he wanted to direct this film for three decades.

19th Century gangs of New York,"A good effort of Martin Scorsese to bring us back to the reality of 19th Century in New York city, where the values were already lost at that time. Usual fights among the ""natives"" with the Irish, Polish and other emigrants plus, obviously, black population were shown all over the film. This is a drama combined with action, where the butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) is the perfect villain while the young man Amsterdam (DiCaprio)is coming back to his town to revenge his father's death. Actually the plot is not complicated and it goes directly to the end all expect, but the most important aspect of the film is to see how New York was developing already at that time and how difficult was to live for all those emigrants who worked hard and may not see after their contribution. At certain point of the film it reminded me the novel ""The Jungle"" of Upton Sinclair, which reveals the suffering of many emigrants in US. DiCaprio did his best but not at the same level when he starred ""Titanic"" (1997) while Cameron Diaz showed that she can also work and develop herself in dramas. Day Lewis was simply excellent in his role as the villain of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I mean it has almost everything you would associate with a good movie, an excellent cast, a wonderful director and a epic length. But alas I came out of the theatre feeling empty and almost cheated of my money.You start with an interesting period of history that most people are not well versed in, put a good old revenge story in, build it up to a strong climax and destroy it all with a chaotic final act that negates everything that has come before.If only Scorsese had cut off everything that came after the Cameron Diaz / Daniel Day Lewis knife-throwing scene and rebuilt the movie with a decent ending this movie might go down as one of the best films ever made, but unfortunately it wont, the fact that is has been nominated for Best Picture and Best Director show how far the Oscars have fallen in awarding not excellence but rewarding strong marketing campaigns.Avoiding the pettiness that is picking out the disappearing/reappearing accents and scars, I would award this 3/5 primarily for the first two acts when sadly if it had followed through it could have been a 5/53/5 on the watched far too many movies scale.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A bit muddled but not disappointing,"What I found most interesting about this movie was it's time period. It started out in NYC in 1846 and then finished in 1862, during the American Civil War. This period of time is unfamiliar to us. It was interesting in that you heard the names of streets that are still around, but their scenery is completely unfamiliar. I especially enjoyed the scene at the end during the closing credits where they show NYC fast-forward evolve from where it was back then to the skyscaper-festooned megalopolis that it is today.The weakest part about the movie was its resolution. Needless to say, there was a gang-fight involved. However, for some reason the filmmakers mixed up two separate fights into one. Was this movie supposed to be about the tension between ethnic gangs of New York, or was it supposed to be a movie about the tension that led to the anti-draft riots of the Civil War? The two fights are unrelated, and I'm sure many people who saw this movie the first time may not have figured that out. This would be a source of confusion in this movie, and the filmmakers did a very bad job on this part. An anti-conscription riot gets started, while at the same time a gang-fight was about to start in another part of town. The conscription riots caused the US Army to get involved to put it down, which ends up interfering with and breaking up the gang-fight at the same time.

Great film by Scorsese,"This is a pretty impressive film; most of its qualities are good, if not great. However, it still falls short on a few points. The ending seems somewhat anti-climactic. Much of the film is overly Hollywood-like, as well. The climax is a letdown. Overall, the film is great, but it could have been fantastic. The love story is also too much of what we've seen hundreds of times before. The plot is good, and tells a tale that very well could have happened. It's fairly historically accurate. It's somewhat well-paced, but I ended up being bored in the last half hour or so, and downright disliking the very end. The acting is great. All of the actors pull off very good performances. Diaz, Day-Lewis, DiCaprio, all great. The supporting characters were well-acted as well. The characters were well-written, and mostly credible, though there were at least once where a character seemed to go very much out of character, apparently just to move the story along. The cinematography is great. It has a pretty good atmosphere, and there are scenes that feel very much like you are watching actual footage from that time. The film suffers somewhat from being predictable; it holds very few surprises, partly due to it being fairly formulaic. The film is well-done and the scenes that are supposed to be so, are intense. The special effects are well-done, and the direction is good. All in all, an entertaining and well-done film which is unfortunately dragged downwards in quality by various Hollywood-like qualities.

Gangs Of New York,"Gangs of New York was directed by Martin Scorsese in 2002. If you like action, blood, skull crushing, fires, gun shoots, and Leonardo DiCaprio, then you'll love this movie.

The main character Amsterdam (DiCaprio) is out for revenge. His father was killed sixteen years earlier and Amsterdam wants to avenge his father's name. The setting looks real, the costumes old fashioned, and the makeup, WOW. It actually looks like blood and guts are spilling out of the people. The actors other then DiCaprio included Daniel Day-Lewis, sporting a glass eye, and Cameron Diaz with red dyed hair that does not suit her skin tone.

Most great films have characters that you either love or loathe but throughout the film I could not help but feel that Bill The Butcher was generally a more likeable person than Amsterdam. For a start Amsterdam (as pointed out in the film) is sneaky, conniving and treacherous character who is seeking revenge for his Farther who died in a battle he willfully entered into. In no part of the film are we led to believe that his Farther was a noble or valiant character, in fact from my impression he was just as ruthless as Bill.

Favorite movie of all time,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Daniel day Lewis' character "" The Butcher"" is the best character I've ever seen in a film. I've seen reviews where people complain about it not being "" historically correct "" no where in the film does it say it's completely based off of history. Anyone who knows about history knows that it was called the five points and that the "" Gangs of New York"" existed but the names and a lot of the factual events are unknown. Leonardo Dicaprio is fantastic as always but Daniel Day Lewis steals the show and he is why this movie is so great. Sad to see it's only a 7.5 rating. Don't let that fool you this movie is a hidden gem and will make you feel like you went on an amazing adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great entertainment but come on ................,"I was so looking forward to this but left feeling somehow disappointed, mostly because the whole thing was frankly rather unbelievable. Yes the direction and acting is brilliant and the cinematography is wonderfully beautiful. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing and his head in hand scenes and face and body language are worth the admission money alone. I do have problems though, first, Leonardo is undoubtedly a very pretty boy and good actor but he is certainly NOT a hard-man, Daniel Day Lewis brilliant though he is, hams it up in such a Faganesque manner that you do wonder how these two would last 5 minutes on Six Points with some of the characters and rival gangs that are lurking about nevermind that they are supposedly bossing the neighbourhood. Next, why does Amsterdam spend so long in the Butchers company and defend him so vehemently, does it really need 'Monk' to remind him that 'your father was always loyal to his people' and then return his cut throat to remind him that revenge is surely what should be on his mind?. The violence is strong and seems a bit over the top, also again a bit hard to believe that anyone could for example possibly survive the first mass battle. If you dont care for violence at the cinema this is certainly not for you. On the flip side the knife throwing scene is brilliantly exciting and Cameron looks genuinely frightened, I know I was, fell in love with her again - damn. The immigrant and civil war recurring theme does work well and is cleverly worked with immigrants arriving and being packed straight off to the south on one side of the dock while the bodies in coffins are being returned on the other. Don't get me wrong Im giving it a 7/10  and yeah its a good entertaining movie alright, I was just hoping for a 9.5 from 'Don' Martin.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
John Jakes On Acid,"""Gangs Of New York"" feels as much of a labor to watch as it was to make, and considering the fact we are being paid considerably less for our part than director Martin Scorsese was for his, that's a problem.There's the potential for something good here, a fictional take on life in the hard streets of Manhattan during the Civil War, but the film never delivers. Instead, it serves up bloody chunks of exposition and characters with lines that are meant to sound profound but come off clumsy. ""The blood stays on the blade,"" a young boy's father explains in the opening moments, after he cuts himself shaving and the boy starts to wipe the razor clean. Why? Is he so sentimental about shaving cuts? Does he not know a bloody razor will rust much faster and become useless, even dangerous, for shaving over time?When the boy grows into a man, he becomes Leonardo DiCaprio, who seems to have undergone a physical metamorphosis from the sallow-cheeked lad of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" to bloated rodent-man of Arch Hall Jr. proportions. I never understood the mania for DiCaprio, either pro or con. He's a serviceable actor who gets a lot of big parts though the consensus seems to agree he was better when younger. Here, his post-pubescent woodenness is evident as his Amsterdam Vallon character is forced to double as clunky narrator (""New York loved William Tweed... and hated him, but for those of us trying to be thieves, we couldn't help but admire him."") and put through his paces too quickly for air.What air there is is sucked up by Daniel Day-Lewis's overripe performance as Bill Cutting, the greasy-haired nativist butcher with the Snidely Whiplash 'stache. Day-Lewis definitely gives off a lot of energy, but he's also all over the place, the most out-of-control performer in a Scorsese film including Richard Manuel in ""The Last Waltz."" One minute he's denouncing the Irish with a zealous scorn, the next he's taking young Amsterdam into his embrace. For a guy who hates the Irish so much, Bill sure spends a lot of time with them.Cameron Diaz fights with DiCaprio in delivering the least convincing Irish accent, really lost at sea though I blame Scorsese and the screenwriters more than her. Too many other minor characters are used too obviously as plot devices, explaining how things are as a way of moving a bloated story along. The film bites off way more than it can or should chew, wanting to show not only the nasty environs of Five Points but the machinations of Tammany Hall and assorted figures of the day. Boss Tweed is wedged into the storyline very roughly, as is Horace Greeley and P.T. Barnum.I was reminded in the end of John Jakes and the historical fiction he was popular for when I was growing up. Young man arriving in a strange American city, meeting famous people from history books while making friends and enemies of uncommon intensity. Simpler fare for a simpler time, yes, but there was something entertaining in the way it was done. Here, one gets a lot of blood and violence, some sex, sketchy attempts at humor, much emoting, and absolutely zero fun.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very disappointing,"If you would like to experience `Gangs of New York' without having to sit through the film, simply spend three hours in a room with the most reprehensible, unredeemed characters you can imagine and the results will be about the same. And this is film's biggest problem. You don't care about ANY of the characters. Scorsese's New York is peopled with individuals who don't share a shred of decency, morality, righteousness or compassion between them. On top of that, the film's final frames suggest that present day New York, having been built on the blood of these repugnant, over-the-top, (and, essentially, unbelievable) characters, is somehow indebted to them. ""Gangs of New York"" is a weird blend of history, sentiment, and melodrama  and has a thinly veiled  anti-religious sentiment running throughout. It subtly implies that religion is somehow behind all the misguided violence and reprehensible behavior in society. I may be reading too much into this, but the theme is definitely present, and one that needs to be either fairly explored or abandoned altogether.  I have to agree with a comment made by an earlier poster: Less IS more, Mr. Scorsese. Less is definitely more.",,Anonymous,Crime
Day-Lewis+DiCaprio+Diaz=An amazing movie,"Gangs of New York quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't think of another film like in recent memory. And the acting in this movie is unreal. DiCaprio is great, this is the role that changed his image from pretty boy to badass. That being said, don't forget about Day-Lewis. He's fantastic. I know, he's always fantastic, but not like this. His character, The Butcher, should go down as one of the best villains in cinema history. But enough about the acting, how about the directing? Masterful. Scorsese is a genius. He takes his movies above and beyond what others are capable of. He's truly in a league of his own. The mechanics of this movie are amazing. The sets, the dialog, the costumes, the camera angles, the sound, the music... all are flawless. The last shot in the movie(the one of the cemetery along the river with New York in the background) is easily one of the coolest scenes of all time, of any movie. Its incredible. I have no idea why this movie is not in the IMDb Top 250, I think it deserves to be in the Top 50!!! If you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy watching movies whatsoever, go watch this movie.

I Adore This Movie,"Martin Scorsese has a bit of a tendency to do gangster films and crime thrillers but there's no denying how good he is at them I mean just look at The Departed, Goodfellas and The Gangs of New York. In case you hadn't already seen I adore this movie, one of the reasons for that is its setting I love the 1800s as a time period for movies because everything just looks as impressive to us now as it did to people back then. The period just makes things look dirty and its characters so hard working. The characters are one of the best things about this movie particularly its villain Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting played masterfully by Daniel Day-Lewis in one of the best performance of his career he just so plays the racist, sexist, insane cruel man so well I hated him while still being unimaginably entertained every time he was on screen. Leonardo DiCaprio is great in this movie even if it could be argued that it's not one of his better performances but still great as his motivations are very clear and and he really is inspiring as a leader. This movie is superbly directed by Scorsese as always as there are plenty of tracking shots and close ups even during the action scenes. The ending of this movie at first might seem a bit underwhelming but the more you think about it the more you realise it is perfect for what it needed to be the social events that are being built in the movie all explode onto the screen and portrays the New York draft riots perfectly as there is death and destruction all over the screen and seeing most of the characters we have grown attached to throughout the movie lie dead in the street as the protagonists weep over their bodies. This is without a doubt one of Scorseses best efforts and that is really saying something looking at his filmography. The Gangs of New York did everything right. 10/10 A+ 100%",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing,"The talent and money available should have resulted in one of the great flicks of all time. But instead the film is a jerky, often difficult to understand parody of a time in America's history that while certainly more violent than one can imagine could not have been so cartoonlike and so full of frankly bizarre and corrupt characters. The violent scenes were nothing special and actually for all their brutality failed to convey the violence. Compare truly believable violent scenes from Saving Private Ryan; Braveheart, Gladiator, Pulp Fiction, etc. and Scorcese did nothing special with these scenes. There was so much potential for a visually stunning film- but even this opporunity was wasted until the closing.  We see hardly nothing of the spectacle that New York must have been in the 1860's. Think of what Coppolla did in GFII with New York of the Italian immigrant. We are given no real flavor of the time and the incredible variety of cultures that had to exist at the time. The acting was superb, and some of the scenes were incredible to see, but overall I left the theatre thinking of only one word ""waste"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Gangs of New York takes place during the second year of the Civil War, and follows the story of Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) through New York City.","I had to watch this movie for a project in APUSH with my best friend, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. Not only was the plot very intriguing, giving me a different look at certain aspects of the time period not touched upon in class, but the recognition of several familiar faces (Such as Leo as Amsterdam, Cameron Diaz as Jenny, and even Brendan Gleeson and Jim Broadbent from the Harry Potter films) kept me on my toes, looking out for others I may recognize as the film progresses. Casting, I felt, was very appropriate for the characters. They seemed to fit the roles so well, I felt. On the other hand, at times I found the plot slightly confusing, and hard to follow, but other than that, it's a masterpiece of a film, with great actors, scenery, and plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Epic but mostly gratuitous,"The movie begins with a fierce street battle between two gangs fighting for the control of a degraded New York neighbourhood: the so-called Native Americans and a group of Irish immigrants. The former win the battle and that control for the years to come. This is supposed to have taken place in mid-nineteenth century. This battle is very well filmed, directed and acted. The usual Scorsese's mastery revealing itself once more. From then on we watch the return of the young son (Di Caprio) of the immigrant leader who was killed by the Native Americans' leader during the battle. He comes out of an orphanage with the intention of revenging his father's death. The movie goes on through scenes of great realism where we see in the streets of those New York poor quarters the proliferation of a mixture of races and nationalities where the most varied gangs dominate: petty gangs, poor gangs, rich gangs, second rate gangs, big and powerful gangsters and poor thieves and robbers. But on the top of the hierarchy there is the great chief the so-called ""The Butcher"" who is precisely who has killed our boy's father in the most cruel way. Till the scene of the first attempt the boy makes to kill The Butcher the movie develops itself in an atmosphere of realistic authenticity.But from then on what we watch is a series of several scenes of doubtful verisimilitude and gratuitous and meaningless violence which seem to serve only the purpose of revealing the savage and cruel nature of The Butcher. He becomes so truculent and brutal and acting with black humour into the bargain, that he turns out to be almost implausible. From a certain point on the renewed fight between the Native Americans and the Irish immigrants gets mixed in some confused way with the fight of the army conscripts (the Civil War is going on by that time) against their forced enrollment (this fact is historically true and confirmed by the way). Therefore the main value of this movie is only found in its excellent first part since in the second one it loses force in terms of ideas and verisimilitude. It ends in a somewhat clumsy and not very meaningful way in what regards the historical outcome of the fight of those two groups (if it ever actually happened any time).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""for the rest of time...it would be like no one ever knew we were here""","Gangs Of New York remains one of Martin Scorsese's most divisive films, you can search various forums and read countless reviews, and you will find the general debate is if the film is a masterpiece or mess ?. Truth is, in this humble reviewers opinion, is that it's an uneven masterpiece, what isn't in doubt is that Scorsese didn't aim to make friends here, he made a bold as brass historical piece that is the flip side of the sugar coated American dream, the sweet story that is so often the heart beat of many a mainstream picture from Hollywood.The story is centered around the gangs that battled for supremacy of New York's lower east side in the early 1860s, with the American Natives and the Irish American Foreigners being the principal players, this all plays out to the backdrop of the civil war and the draft riots that would go down as one of the darkest parts in America's history.The great points are many, the sets and delicious period cinematography are top draw, a true feast on the eyes, a big pat on the back for Michael Ballhaus for the latter, and some of the set pieces here find Scorsese being poignant and on form, and whilst the costumes may raise a smile, the researchers did them proud. The cast of course are trailing in the wake of a devilishly menacing turn from Daniel Day Lewis as chief Nativist Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting, its note perfect in both delivery and actions. Leonardo DiCaprio holds up well as Amsterdam Vallon, a boy who became a man very quickly, and in view of D D Lewis's barn storming show, it's with much credit that Leo lays down a marker of better to come in his career.The rest do good enough without being totally memorable, Cameron Diaz is perhaps a bit too precious for the role of Jenny Everdean, but she's an essential cog in this epic wheel, whilst Brendan Gleeson is grandiosely gruff as Monk McGinn, throw in solid support from Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly & Liam Neeson and the acting doesn't harm the film. However the film is very much split in two, the first half is grand and has pot boiler written all over it, but come the second half it feels rushed and not fully fleshed out, the ending whilst not bad per se, just leaves you hankering for another 20 minutes to do it justice. Still, it's a fine film that has too many great things for me to ever do it down in rating, so it's a very safe 8/10 for me.......... always.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It was a huge mistake to make such a film based on a time of American history that seems unexceptional and truly unimportant.

One look at him with that ridiculous mustache and accent and you cant help but laugh. You end up hating him more out of irritation than anything else.

Compelling epic,"I finally got around to seeing this film about 6 months after I had intended to, and unfortunately picked the hottest day of the summer so far to see it. I say unfortunately because every yokel in the Milwaukee metropolitan area decided to take advantage of the budget prices, and of the air conditioning for three hours, so the audience I watched it with generally were not the least bit interested in actually watching the historical drama and weren't afraid to vocalize this.  Loudly.  And repeatedly.  The good news is, apparently the average attention span for a film is 2 hours, so around the 2 hour mark people seemed to leave the theater in droves, and I finally was able to experience the final hour in relative peace.Having said that, I actually really enjoyed this film.  I have heard complaints of the length, the lack of action, all they do is fight, there's no story, etc. I found it to be not only compelling, but it actually has prompted me to do further research on this time period.  This was a film that Scorcese has been trying to make for a long time, and it is a natural addition to his gallery of films that take place during certain periods of history in New York.  Perhaps I missed something, but I only saw a couple of major fights during the film's three hours, and in answer to the lack of storyline:  Clearly, this was a film not only about the life and times of the Five Points from an historical perspective, but it chose several characters to lead us through this history lesson not through narrative, but as a regular ""life on the street"" type of storytelling.  It is also a classic story of a love/hate relationship between mentor and apprentice as well as a struggle with ones own identity and destiny.If I had to issue a complaint or two about the film, I agree that the length was a little cumbersome, and Leonardo DiCaprio apparently kept losing and finding his accent with wild abandon, but that is more nitpicky than anything.  For the few faults this film may have contained, the high points certainly made up for them, namely the amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  I had heard a lot of build up regarding his character over the last several months, and of course he was nominated for an Oscar, but his performance was truly inspired.I will definitely buy this on DVD when it is released, but will probably wait awhile to watch the film itself again.  However, if Scorcese provides a commentary track, I will be watching that instantly - the man is a genius and once again, he has created a film that solidifies my complete awe of his intelligence and vision.--Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Excellent Movie In Its Own Right,"For your information, I mostly just grade movies and never write reviews about them unless I think they deserve it, and well, this on truly does.As such, I may not be much of a critic, but the greatness of this movie in particular can't simply be described in a grade: it has to be described in words.This movie had the perfect setting, a captivating atmosphere, astounding performances from all actors and actresses, an epic soundtrack, and a truly engrossing storyline. Now about the story, I'm not really that knowledgeable concerning the history of the founding of America, but if it was anything like this, I would most definitely had want to read more about in school. I'm a foreigner to USA, if you couldn't already guess it.Now with all this said, I do can understand if certain people don't agree with this movie, due to its somewhat modern style. But if your expecting your average history lesson with everything set exactly as it was back then, then you've chosen your movie poorly. This movie gives you history in a way that etches itself into your subconscious, if not the historical teachings then at least the feeling of the time that you were presented to. It does it all, and does it really, really well, even if it is somewhat unorthodox.So as a conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, all in all, and must see for everyone who's come of age (and I really do mean this, DON'T see this one if you're underage) and can stand movies with explicit material, because it has a lot of it. It will make you sick, make you cry, leave you marked for years to come with an experience of awe, tragic but ultimately touching perfection - if not going all the way, but what does - that will stay with you for years to come. Anyway, it receives a clear 10 out of 10 from me, and it raises the bar for the respect I have for director Martin Scorsese.

Mean streets of New York,"Gangs of New York was the best film released in Ireland in 2003 and a film that makes me proud to be Irish. The film opens with a stunning set-piece in a snowscape in New York's Five Points in which the Natives, led by Daniel Day-Lewis, overpower the immigrants, known as the Dead Rabbits. The film follows the quest for revenge of the son of a slain immigrantThe story is set in the era of the arrival of floods of Irish immigrants escaping the Famine in their native land.The film goes on to take in the Draft Riots during the American Civil War and, on a great canvas, Martin Scorsese paints an unforgettable portrait of the foundational years of the city of New York and sets us straight on what life was like on the mean streets of New York in those years.This is film-making at its greatest and Scorsese's superb direction is complemented by the sinister cinematography of Michael Ballhaus. The best shot of the film is when Leonardo Di Caprio's character discards his Bible, tossing it off the bridge and we have a close-up shot of the Bible crashing onto the river surface, displacing its own weight in water.Scorsese's sense of yearning for something lost in his own city comes across. The concluding time travels shots of the New York skyscape, shots so full of heartbreak and lost eras. Shots so evocative of lives and loves past in the world's greatest city. New York, New York - one hell of a town. The Twin Towers feature in these closing shots and stand in this worthy film as a lasting tribute and monument to the courage of the people of New York on that fateful September day.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great sets and a disturbing story made Old Tymey New York a beautiful 19th century nightmare.What people did to each other back then was pretty sick.  I'm sure we've got some nasty stuff now too but I never imagined it on such a large scale. Scorcese is always the guy to dredge up the most disgusting human behavior. While I appreciate seeing the dark side I never knew about, I wondered if he can direct anything NOT about organized crime.The story, to me, really wandered.  I wasn't sure what Leonardo was trying to do and I don't think he was either.  We've all felt that way about ourselves but when it's time for the movie to build to a climax, I don't think it should seem so spontaneous and vague.

A huge disappointment,"As a big fan and great respecter of Martin Scorsese, counting TaxiDriver, Mean Streets, The King of Comedy, and The LastTemptation of Christ among my alltime favorite films (sorry,Raging Bull), I looked forward to Gangs of New York with hugeanticipation. I have to say I was let down.The story was a typical tale of revenge and love, wrapped aroundthe political happenings during the early years of New York City.Sounds interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't.The problem for me, primarily, was one of character development.There was no change in any of the characters throughout themovie. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) represented the oldguard, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) represented thenew, and Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) was the political figurewho was really in command of the situation.None of these characters grew at all during the movie. Cutting wasa believer in rule by violence right up to the end. Vallon was benton revenging his father's death, his only true motivation throughoutthe film. Boss Tweed was a typical politician, playing both sides,depending on which looked like the right horse at the time.As for the acting, Broadbent did a great job as Boss Tweed, andthe smaller supporting roles were quite well done. DanielDay-Lewis was outstanding as Cutting, but his weird accent wasdistracting right from the beginning. You may try to make anargument that it was true to the time (which I doubt can be proven),but to my ear it was quite false. DiCaprio suffered the same accentproblem, but, even worse, his screentime with Cameron Diaz wasmuch less than sizzling.Another problem: I couldn't buy Diaz and DiCaprio together at all.  Iguess maybe Diaz seems too old to play the role.  While they arenot that far apart agewise in reality, in the movie they were bothsupposed to be around 21 or so, and Diaz just couldn't pull it off. Imay be imagining that, but I can say this for sure: Diaz andDiCaprio had no chemistry at all.In essence, Gangs of New York is quite a boring film. The story isinteresting, that this is really the story of the formation of New YorkCity, but as cinema, it falls very short of the greatness attributed toit. I can give it only 3 stars out of 10.

boring,"Scorcese movies have always been an occasion worth celebrating. From the first ""Taxi Driver"" till the ultimate best ""Goodfellas"" all of his movies were at the very least super entertaining. However, to my modest opinion this is not the case with this one.The first thing that comes to my mind is the length of the movie-super long. Actually, is not that it was long rather that it was filled up with nothing. ""Magnolia"" was much longer, but it didn't feel long at all cause it was interesting. The acting, with the exception of Daniel Day-Lewis' one, was weak. Even Diaz who I really appreciate as an actress was very unconvincing. But I don't think this was her fault, it was more of a bad screenplay. With the exception of the opening and closing fights, the rest was even painful to watch. It would've been so much better had it been an hour short.I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends.

Where bold filmmaking becomes excess,"Well, it's finally happened.  Martin Scorsese's gone completely over the top.  There were signs of it happening in his other films--each one contained some sort of gore-fest, but they were all tempered by the compassion it had for its characters, the desire for redemption that was evident in Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta, and sometimes even the hoodlums in GOODFELLAS.What we have in GANGS OF NEW YORK is just nastiness for its own sake. Nastiness beautiful choreographed, skillfully captured on film, but mere nastiness nonetheless.Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio) returns to the Five Points district looking for revenge on Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis), the gang leader who killed his father years earlier.  The Five Points houses the scum of New York, thieves, murderers, and rapists apparently lurking around every corner.  The story starts to take off when Amsterdam becomes one of Bill's trusted colleagues.  Matters are complicated by the fact that Amsterdam seems to have some genuine affection for the Butcher.Any depth, however, is effectively lost under the rivers of blood that flow in this film.  I'm not usually offended by violence, but how is anyone going to get anything out of this film if they have to cover their eyes half the time?The Amsterdam/Cutting plot is intercut with New York politics, and these two stories both come to a head during the famous Draft Riots, filmed in Scorsese's typical kinetic style.  It's a magnificent spectacle.  But what are we supposed to make of the whole thing?  Trailers inform us that ""America Was Born in the Streets.""  The draft riots were a shameful chapter in America's history, not just an act of social uprising, but a chance for many angry New Yorkers to commit heinous acts of violence against African Americans.

Too Much Flamboyance,"'Gangs of New York' is insatiably violent, largely to its detriment. It drives into the precursor of violence as a flex for characters to provide exposition, but the script isn't strong enough to make meat out of it, and the film comes off as being quite confusing.Leonardo DiCaprio is an A tier actor, but here he feels too subtle and lacking the energy and oomph that he always brings to the table. Cameron Diaz is forgettable, as unfortunately most of her roles are. The absolute star of course is Daniel Day-Lewis, who steals the show with every scene he is in.Unfortunately that ultimately becomes one of its big problems - it becomes the Daniel Day-Lewis overacting show, and everybody else is either underacting or written so poorly that there is no chemistry. The movie is also shot poorly at times, with the story all mangling together to become hard to care about.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Poor Scorcese,"I know the great Martin Scorcese was not the sole input into this film, and may be representative of how hard it is to make a truly excellent motion picture in this day and age.  What didn't help was how DD Lewis tried to act like DeNiro the whole goddamn movie.  Any moment I expected him to bust into a ""you talkin' to me?""The screenplay was flat out unbelievable and poorly developed, while DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Diaz were all miscast.  I wonder if Scorcese chose them or the studio did.If Daniel Day Lewis is going to put on a DeNiro show for 2.5 hours, then why not just get DeNiro and make him look a little younger?  Perhaps Bob wasn't interested.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Plot like hamburger helper, very little meat.","Watching this one I kept wondering if there would be anyone left alive in NY City by the end of the movie.  The main plot, revenge, was hidden and over ridden to a great degree by the Anglo-Saxon hoods and Irish hoods trying to wipe out each other. Then there's the betrayal aspect of DiCapro's character by Thomas's character; after all what are good friends for, et tu Brutus? Over all the movie was too long, slow in most places, and even comical.  The wardrobe must of come from the Ringling circus.  While most of the acting was good, DiCapro's character seemed to hold it all together and Day-Lewis played an excellent part as the villain.  Definitely not Oscar material, but okay to watch once.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Braveheart Meets Mean Streets,"In spite of the egregious miscasting of DiCaprio and Diaz, this is a significant piece of moviemaking and should not be missed.Daniel Day-Lewis virtually carries this film singlehanded.  His villainous swagger, convincing (and surprising!) New Yawk accent, and brutal, in-your-face control of every scene he's in is worth the price of admission. DiCaprio, whose boyish and bland demeanor is much more suited for the teenage antihero of ""Catch Me If You Can"", is completely lost here, and could have trashed the entire film had Day-Lewis not been so strong. Diaz is about as passionate as a lamp-post and is nothing more than window dressing in a part that calls for a dark, torrid, sensual and controlling woman.  I'm surprised and disappointed that Scorcese let the casting be so shallow.An interesting dichotomy in ""Gangs"" is the sets: interiors were fabulously deep, rich in detail, and convincing, while the exteriors were about as real as an MGM tour in Orlando.  It is entirely lost on me why this production schlepped to Rome to come up such backlot-looking, phony sets.But don't despair - the intelligent, historically accurate and informative script, the direction, and Lewis' tour-de-force combine to produce a film ""event"" that you should certainly see on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Disturbing atmosphere meets love story, meets revenge story","This movie is definitely well done. The acting is great, the script is good, the scenery amazing, the music perfect. But I have to admit, that I did not like the depressive ending. Martin Scorcese is a master in creating a disturbing atmosphere, as he proofed in ""Cape Fear"" and ""Shutter Island"". Especially the last twenty minutes of this movie, he shoveled so much anger and violence (the riots in the streets) in my face, that I thought about leaving the cinema. The end of the story is realistic, but depressive and if there is a moral to this story, than it is not a nice one. As others already mentioned: Daniel Day-Lewis was great, great, great. He created a believable character with all his ups and downs. Full of love, full of anger, full of pride, full of blackness. He had not a single weak moment. He was there every moment and I can not understand, that he did not win the Oscar for this performance. I am not a fan of Di Caprio and I can not understand, what Scorcese likes about him, but this time he was quiet good. But I am convinced, that others actors would have done a better job. Liam Neeson again just a small role, but far better than his last acting in ""Clash of the titans"". I hated the character of the mayor, so he must have been played good. To me, the role of Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) was not necessary for this movie. It would have worked without her.Again, very well done movie with great acting. With another ending it would have been a 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

not really,"The first two minutes was impressive. Then something happened and the movie lost its whole presuasive power over me. I saw a wee woman with sharp, pointy teeth and artificial claws joining the rest of the men to take part in the street battle. Now, realize that this is a fight with no precision weapons, where brute strength, height, arm reach and endurance count way more than agility. And Mr Scorcese was showing me this little woman jumping over massive men and killing them with her claws and bites. Wow ! So cool! Well, granted, I am aware of the ""Hell Cat Maggie"" legend. But I didn't think the film was based on legends. At least, a taller and muscular actress could have been used to play this character. Is it really necessary to include this character and mess with the whole realism of the movie?Just when I was getting over this stupidity I saw a black gang member with Johnny (the good gang member that helped Amsterdam when they were children). Just how realistic is it that an African boy is allowed into a white gang in one of the most racist chapters of New York history? How come people like William Cutting and McGroin tolerate this guy's activities in the neighbourhood? How realistic is it that this African boy (not even a man yet) pushes white men to vote for a candidate in the heat of the Civil War when African Americans were seen as the reason for the war?These might seem like minor points for many. But, I think they make that little difference between a good movie and a great movie. IMHO, this movie was good. But it was mostly due to Lewis' spectacular acting. DiCaprio was OK, but one expects a more convincing performance from a lead actor. I guess it was his mishap acting against Daniel Day Lewis. Contary to what many think, I think Diaz was a good choice for the playful, humorous, and sexy vixen female character; Jenny Everdean. There wasn't much to act in her character anyway. This movie is NOT underrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Scorsese's  Mess,"Watching a bad film is always a chore. Watching a bad film that runs nearly three hours can test the patience. Yet watching a bad film created by one of our cinematic geniuses is just plain tragedy.There are elements of Gangs of New York that remind us of Martin Scorsese the master. We remember the blood-drenched rope during Raging Bull, or the violent stabbing of a gangster in Goodfellas. Gangs of New York has plenty of blood, that is for sure, but none of the violence is tethered to anything worthy like in Scorsese's other works.A violent film for the sake of being violent should be judged on its own merits, not based on the merits of the person creating it. I understand much of what Scorsese was trying to tell in the picture, but it just does not work. The film is set in the backdrop of the Civil War. As the nation is warring with itself to set an identity, so are the people of the five points in New York City.After his father (Liam Neeson) is murdered sixteen years previous, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the five points and seeks vengeance. The murderer is one Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) whose power was considerable then, but has grown to total dominance now. Amsterdam slips into Bill's lair as a young student of violence and mischief.Along the way we meet Tammany Hall's classic corrupt politician William ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent) as well as the police corruption of ""Happy"" Jack Mulraney (John C. Reilly). We visit a pickpocket (Cameron Diaz) who is the love interest of Amsterdam and his friend Johnny (Henry Thomas). All of these characters add a certain voyeuristic quality, but we don't care about any of them or their motives throughout the plot. We peek into the wealthy of New York along with the poor. And finally the city explodes when the government enlists a draft primarily on the poor New Yorkers and immigrants, since those with $300 (a fortune then) are able to buy themselves out of war.Daniel Day Lewis received many awards and critical acclaim for his performance. I felt it was overdone and overwrought. DiCaprio was fine along with some others, but the truest revelation is Cameron Diaz. I have never been as impressed with her as I was here, standing up high against formidable acting opponents. In general the critical consensus was favorable, likely due to Socrsese's previous excellence. That the film more or less tanked at the box office does not surprise me for the reasons listed above.Given what is wrong with the film (and there is a lot), it is not a total failure. Scorsese has appeared on talk shows praising the ""hands that built America"" that came from New York during this time. Though I disagree that is what the movie is ""about,"" I did enjoy a critical look at the treatment of immigrants. Those are the ""hands"" I would refer to as the builders, not these violent gang members fighting over the very worst the nation could offer. For a more detailed and much more entertaining look at this time and these issues watch Ric Burns' ""New York: A Documentary Film."" A scholar notes that the immigrants (mostly Irish at the time) gave much more to our country than we gave to them. Sad but very true. *.5 out of ****",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

The set, costumes , colour and feel of the film really brought the 1850-60s to life. The acting as truly wonderful. Daniel Day Lewis, always fantastic in everything, put in a monumental performance which will stay with me forever.

Could have been so much more...,"Gangs of New York is a fairly satisfying film. It is based in the 1800s and follows the plight of ""Amsterdam"" from his early childhood to when he returns to New York as an adult to seek vengeance on ""Bill the Butcher"" who'd slain his father many years before in a gang-fight.The performances are superb, especially Daniel Day-Lewis who pretty much steals the show as the nasty ""Bill the Butcher"", leader of a gang called the ""Natives"", whose sole aim is to rid New York of the influx of Irish immigrants.The big problem with the film is that you simply don't care about the characters, other than the three principal leads - Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis. Thus when there's gangwarfare, it's very difficult to know quite who to root for or what's going on.The film doesn't really answer any questions and opens up many more possibilities than it achieves. This could have been a truly outstanding film, certainly there is enough scope and the look and feel of the 'Five Points' in the 1860s looks spot on. However, it falls short on character development.Overall, worth watching - be warned that it is fairly violent and bloody (typical Scorsese) but not the masterpiece it could have been.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Frankengangs!,"No argument! Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker, film historian, and a most likable fellow. I like him. I can't help it. Yet, I do not like most of his films. This one is debatably an exception, perhaps saved by inch-fractions primarily by the spellbinding, remorselessly superb acting chops of Daniel Day-Lewis. Curiously he is an Irish actor from Ireland playing an Irish immigrant-hating American of English ancestry, William Cutting, who in real life was no longer living during the final climactic scenes of this film. The shrugs do not end there. Leonardo DiCaprio (now, thankfully, finally, a grown man playing one) plays an Irish American (who struggles with his Irish accent throughout the film).The film ends with the NYC Draft Riots of 1863. Without drawing up a long list of historical inconsistencies and equivocations, as one example, famed Tribune Editor, Horace Greeley, who was only 52 at the time of these riots, is depicted as a wizened, old man in a long, white beard. In fact, he was only 61 when he died nine years later. Although the chances are that Greeley was brought into the story for his abolitionist views this remains unclear in this release cut of the film.Generally, this story of the search for vengeance by a boy who sees his father killed during a gang riot never weaves into a full, coherent scenario. The climactic backdrop of the New York City draft riots, in truth were fomented primarily by outraged laborers of mixed nationalities, e.g. of both Irish and German descent, against the importation of poorly paid blacks. These riots that were also given support by the Lincoln hating Tammany Hall-corrupt Democratic Party of the city of that time are not accurately presented here nor clearly melded into the story despite the fast intercuts of flyers and posters of the period. The films' depictions of US Navy Frigates (perhaps on the East River?) firing cannons into Manhattan is news to me, a born New Yorker who has lifelong followed New York history. Toward the end GANGS feels just like what it is a contrivance that upon departing leaves in its wake an empty feeling.The production values, design, ambiance and atmosphere are handsome. However this film, claimed by some overwrought hype writers, as the ""Birth of New York"" is better described as myopic mayhem. If relentless brutality is your cup of tea, try it. Who knows?

Surprisingly moving,"I bought into the hype.  I'll admit it.  The advertising campaign for Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" swayed me.  I was already listing it with my favorite movies of the year before I'd ever even seen it.  DiCaprio for Best Actor!  Day-Lewis for Best Supporting Actor!  Scorsese for Best Director! Best Picture!Well, you know what?  After having seen it, I can only say this:DiCaprio for Best Actor! Day-Lewis for Best Supporting Actor! Scorsese for Best Director! Best Picture! Diaz for Best Supporting Actress! U2 for Best Song!...get the picture?I expected the film to be excellent, to be sure.  I expected to be blown away by the brutality of the battle sequences and the interaction between great actors.  The film delivered, and in a way I never expected.I was almost literally moved to tears.  I was one of the last out of the theater today, because I had to keep myself focused on the here-and-now, reassuring myself that there probably never was an Amsterdam Vallon whose father was slain by Bill the Butcher when he was a child.  That the film, based around true events, was set a century-and-a-half ago, and that none of the people who were killed would have lived to see today anyway.Still, though, Scorsese had me.  He twisted me around his little finger, making me squirm during the bloodshed, tap my feet to the dance, become wide-eyed at the betrayals, and finally utterly crushed by the ending shot, a beautiful bit of demi-time-lapse photography on the growth of New York. It is in these closing moments that I could feel something rising in my throat.  It wasn't a nauseous feeling, unlike some of the battle sequences (which left this usually hard-hearted moviegoer a bit uneasy).  It was genuine emotion.  I was horrified by what man could do and how quickly he could forget.Scorsese has always seemed to have his finger on the pulse of the nation. How he could have known when this movie was shooting how close the storyline would be to modern events is beyond me.  How he could have known that, on the brink of a war that few want, the youth of the nation (like me) is beginning to find their political voice...Scorsese, one of the greatest cinematic minds of this or any other time, has once again made a picture that defines its times, intentionally or not.  It is doubtful, however, that the film would not have worked without amazing performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Broadbent (fast becoming my favorite character actor), Henry Thomas, and surprisingly solid performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (both of whom I had dismissed as ""just another pretty face"" long ago).""Gangs of New York"" is, without question, the most important movie of 2002. It was not the most entertaining, though it was certainly entertaining.  It was not the most fun.  It was probably not even the best (I'd wager to put ""Road to Perdition"" a notch above it).  It was, though, the movie that will be remembered nearly thirty years from now, as we remember Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" and his other cinema classics.  This is the one that will be viewed in film classes for decades to come.This is, to use a worn-out phrase, a must-see.Thank you, Mister Scorsese.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gangs of New York,"Visually stunning, if not oddly cast, Marin Scorsese directed Gangs of New York in 2002. Weaving the tale of the development of an area of New York known as the Five Points, all the while following a man seeks revenge for the murder of his father. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, Gangs of New York tells the darker tale of the origins of the country during the Civil War. Perhaps one of Scorsese's most visually striking vivid films, Gangs of New York was nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2002, cementing Scorsese's iconic reputation as a director.Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), as a child, witnesses his father, 'Priest' Vallon's (Liam Neeson) death in a gruesome battle with a rival gang member, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). After avoiding a life of living under Bill's supervision, Amsterdam makes it his life's mission to exact revenge on the man who killed his father. In 1863, Amsterdam returns to The Five Points which is being run by The Butcher and his gang, many members of which used to belong to The Priest's gang. Life in The Five Points is hellish for anyone who isn't a member of The Butcher's gang. They run the state like it's their own, are blatantly anti-immigration, womanizing, and exceptionally violent. The forced conscription brought about by the Civil War brought with it the most turbulent of times for the fledgling state of New York, and the entire country itself. Riots break out in the street protesting the corruption in government and the violence used to rule the citizens. The violence acts as a perfect backdrop, keeping The Butcher just distracted enough for Amsterdam to exact revenge for the murder of his father.The filming of the opening battle scene was a stroke of brilliance by director Martin Scorsese, complete with his signature God's eye view overhead shots. Leonardo DiCaprio, despite being a stock actor of Scorsese's, seemed ill-fit for the role of a son seeking revenge. He lacked the deep-seeded revenge angle needed for the role in place of the overly facial pretty boy he is so constantly lauded for playing. Cameron Diaz is completely miscast in the role, of the love interest, never coming off as fitting in the period. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderful performance, as always, brilliantly capturing the violent, yet philosophizing gang leader.

Personally i am a huge Martin Scorsese fan and i have seen every movie he has made and am fully aware that he is not perfect (kundun).  But this is a great film. The movie is a revenge story set in the backdrop of 19th century New York.  I read the book Gangs of New York and i think that the creative team of dante ferretti and sandy powell really helped recreate 19th century New York. The performances in the film were good all around.  The Cameron Diaz storyline took away from the revenge between Amsterdam (dicaprio) and bill the butcher (day-lewis).  Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance on screen since kevin spacey in american beauty.  It is hard to imagine that willem dafoe and robert de niro, as great as they are, were considered to this role so perfect for day-lewis.

And all that plain violence without any reason? the times of the law of Hammurabi were over already!

Over the top.,"I normally don't comment on popular films, but I'd heard a lot about this one, so I gave it a whirl on the old DVD player. And I had a hard time coming to terms with what I saw, but saw it I did.Ho boy.I have to confess, I'm not a big Scorsese fan, but I've nothing against the man either, and have enjoyed several of his films. Yet this film really makes me wonder what's happened to the cinema going public when a film as predictable and flimsy as this gains artistic recognition. Not only is it predictable, but it's also just over-done on a number of levels.Scorsese puts such a whopper of a caricature spin on all sides that I found it difficult to buy into the film's reality. I've no doubt the real people upon which the film's characters are based were brutal thugs, but the Satanic equivocation with the antagonist is just too much for me to take. The man is shown to have values, but is also immersed in such an evil dour that one wonders why he's even in the movie at all. Scorsese might as well just stuck a guy holding a pitchfork and wearing horns on his head in the role. Day-Lewis'es character has a political and moral position (however skewed), but it's never fully explored, and is so framed as being evil by Scorsese that one wonders why this character was allowed to express his view at all.Likewise with DiCaprio's role. Again, another fine actor is placed in a position where he must portray a character whose roots are given a divine essence. As if everything he stands for and values is held in a blessed light. For myself, this smacks of the so-called need to define the ""white hats"" and ""black hats"" for the audience. And when you need to do that, then you might as well be writing a children's novel, because the author has just demonstrated his lack of respect for the audiences' ability to come to their own conclusion.This kind of social commentary and politicking is done without apology. The result is a film that's pretty thin, and again reveals the inner heart of a man, Scorsese, who himself cannot give a good accounting of the riots, because his presentation does not gybe with the hard facts of the genesis and result of the conflict. And when I say facts I mean that which motivated these people to pillage and plunder mid-1800's New York.Scorsese did his best. My hats off to him. There're few directors who could've tackled such a project, and Scorsese gave it his best shot. But this film, for all its garnished praises, falls far from demonstrating the true hearts of human beings, and gives us cartoon characters from, what George Parker from Orange County, CA called an ""Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash."" I couldn't agree more.Most of you who have expressed interest in my views on films will probably already have seen this, so it's a moot point for me to recommend it or not in this review. But, on the odd chance that you haven't, and are interested, and are reading my comments, as well as others, don't say we didn't warn you if come away from this film feeling somewhat disappointed.Corporate art strikes again.

Good film but the ending seemed rushed.,I know there were real problems with the making of Gangs of New York and that it took a lot longer to put out than Martin Scorsesi would have liked and to be quite honest apart from the rushed ending you wouldnt notice . Although two and a half hours long it is not a film that drags because of some of the brilliant performances on show especially from Daniel Day Lewis and Leornardo De Caprio also the story is gripping which is why the ending is such a let down.

OK (if you can get through it),"Those who romanticize the lives of 19th century Americans and maintain Americana images of bustling city streets where innkeepers, aristocratic women carrying parasols, nannies, leather smiths, bankers, cobblers, bricklayers, market managers, and police officers (whose job involved no more risk than chasing down an occasional pickpocket)will have a hard time assimilating this version of U.S history. ""Gangs of New York"" gives the impression that in 1860's New York City anarchy reigned and the antisocial predominated.Usually, movies that have characters that I would never want as neighbors also feature ones that I admire or envy, people who endure struggles and make decisions with which I empathize, but not this movie. It doesn't include any character I find likable - not even Leonardo DiCaprio's. I have to concede, however, that my feelings reflect to a degree the quality of the performances, since a viewer can't react with loathing and revulsion if the actors don't make themselves appear heinous and heartless. Daniel Day Lewis's acting, especially, affected me. As much as I wanted to put my arm around the flawed but generally decent man he portrayed in ""The Crucible,"" I was hoping that someone would dismember ""The Butcher.""""Gangs of New York"" does deal with a very significant social-political issue, the strained relationship between the Irish and the English, but it can also frustrate because it does not teach much.

"History made relevant, violence made meaningful","""Gangs of New York"" is history made relevant and visually appealing.

This is one of the poorest areas of New York City where many Irish immigrants are settling. Prejudice against immigrants is the core of the struggles that resulted in the initial battle and remains an open wound. Later, the impact of the Civil War on the lives of these already embattled in class conflicts results in escalated and more impersonal violence.A passionate affair with a luminous Cameron Diaz takes place, a love triangle with the man who killed the elder Vallon.The poor protest, Federal soldiers shoot them down, to be repeated during nearly every war since. In ""Gangs,"" the controversy is played out in the context of the Civil War. The poor go to war; the rich avoid conscription for a fee of $300, a fortune at the time. (Now they join the National Guard.) In anti-draft rioting in 1863, as a century later, innocent people are killed, either drafted to fight and die for a country that has abandoned them or, once again, as at Kent State, killed by soldiers (National Guardsmen) on our own streets.I pity the people who are bored by this movie. Who was it who said, ""Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it""? The current US president, who did not fight in Vietnam, is now planning a war that raises the same issues about the draft and executive powers, a war even less pertinent to most of our lives than the Civil War was to the impoverished residents of New York's slums.This movie reminds us that, though memories of specific events once so impassioned and meaningful eventually fade away, we experience our own versions of them in our own era.The acting, directing, cinematography, and editing are all superb.

A Strange but Captivating Film,"I had no idea GoNY was set in the 1800's, and so the film came as quite a shock to me. I had expected mafia-type action but instead I was treated with a fantastic yet dark world of betrayal and blood and an excellent black comedy.The only complaint is the fact that Cameron Diaz can't act! She barely keeps her Olde American accent consistent, and looks way too thin to be authentic. And the lines they give her are laughable at best, sounding more like lines from an essay than an actual person.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A solid (yet flawed) movie.,"The last act of Gangs of New York made the entire movie worthwhile, for me. It also was part of the reason why the film occasionally felt so disjointed.On one hand, Gangs of New York tackled such heady issues as immigration, the draft, class conflict, racism, and discrimination of all kinds. It's a pretty brutal and realistic movie, in that regard. On the other hand, it's the story of a young Irish American who seeks revenge for the murder of his father. I found the latter far less interesting than the former.These two parts of the story are supposed to parallel each other, and I can see the ways that Scorsese tried to connect them, but it's only towards the end where this approach actually works. The rest of the time, it's fairly awkward.I lay a lot of the fault for this in the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. I have no problems with either of these actors (and have enjoyed them both in other movies), but they just didn't ""fit"" here. And when they were surrounded by so many actors who were perfect for the location and time period, they stuck out like a sore thumb. It doesn't help that the two characters were basically thrown together, with little story basis for why they should be so devoted to one another.Despite what I considered to be its considerable flaws, I still thought that Gangs of New York was a good film. Seeing an exaggerated portrayal of some of the actual history of early New York and immigration to the city was cool, and most of the latter half was brilliant. Fans of Scorsese are in for a (at times muddled) treat.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bizarre Direction,"'Gangs of New York' is fantastical nonsense. I honestly am not sure if it's an unfunny comedy, like the equally overrated and awful 'Gone Girl'.Scorsese's directing of the actors is even worse than in his weak 'Goodfellas' formulaic reworking 'The Departed'. The casting is terrible, and the direction was clearly unclear, as it's like each actor was acting in a different film. The plot is completely moronic and unbelievable, and the fictitious gang in their bizarre top hats look stupid. Daniel Day Lewis looks like The Cat In The Hat, whilst hamming and camping up his role to the max, but then sticks out like a sore thumb as the other actors, unsuccessfully, attempt to play it straight. The film's wholly made-up, unsatisfying, and impossible conclusion just adds bad science into the mix, to go with all the historical inaccuracies.If you enjoyed DDL's deranged moments in 'There Will Be Blood', you'll enjoy him being even more extreme here.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Martin Scorsese has lost his touch.,"First time i saw Gangs of New York, i was kinda excited, but i also had my doubts (Dicapprio as a tough-guy seems sooo far fetched) I thought i was in for a real edgy film, the kind of stuf that i was used to from Martin Scorsese, like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead Martin Scorsese suffered the ""James Cameron Syndrome"" (typical hollywood love story alert) i felt like a i was watching a woman's movie. The costumes, i suppose were authentic, but they seemed to take away from the film, like theyre' too flashy for a story about true grit. Oh yeah and another thing, THIS IS THE LEAST VIOLENT SCORSESE FILM MADE. Nothing like The Last Temptation of Christ, which ruled. However, there are some good points of violence, but for some reason, they don't show much. I feel that Martin Scorsese has finally succumbed(sic) to the hollywood system. The film lacked much energy and was too long and slow. What felt like 6 hours was only 3 hours, and could have been told in 2 hours. still Daniel day lewis gave a rather caricature of snydly whiplash and as for leo, he was the same guy as he was in titanic.This is Scorsese's fall,             2 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Crime
Another Great Film for Scorsese---7/10,"A lot of people think this is Scorsese's worst film. Even though that can't be taken as a bad thing since most of his movies are masterpieces, i think this is one of his best. Other than some minor flaws such as the love story and the good but not great ending, this is another great film for an already master director. Most parts of the story can easily be turned into a modern gangster film. It is a movie filled with crime, revenge, and betrayal. Daniel-Day Lewis gives the true greatest performance of the year and one of the best i have seen ever. This is the first Leonardo DiCaprio movie i liked. Titanic sucked and we all know it. Cameron Diaz is delicious in any era and although i didn't like the love story i did like her character. Goodfellas remains my favorite Scorsese, but this is a great movie with a excellent acting and one of the best of 2002. The academy should be ashamed. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A watchable offering that wanders too much,"I confess embarrassment that I had not seen this film until it came out on video.  Having a 2 year old can present obstacles to seeing a film so pervasively violent in the theater.Thus, fresh from the DVD viewing, three things come immediately to mind:1. I am really glad I could pause this and go to the bathroom.  I may not have gone back into the theater if I'd purchased a large soda and found myself unable to stay until the end.2. A budget this big, and this many huge names on both sides of the camera, have made a beautiful and epic movie that loses its way in the story and would never have been greenlighted with a first time director.3. The fact that this part of American history has been swept under the rug for most publicly-educated citizens makes it hard to follow and even harder to swallow.Regarding the first point - ""epic"" can mean sweeping and engaging, or it can be a polite way of saying ""really frigging long"".  Kind of like a one-bedroom, half-bath beach house is ""cozy"" or ""charming"".  Off the top of my head, I can map out perhaps 15 real story beats, but a great deal of superfluous environment creation is going on that makes the film 3 hours long.  I was so unclear as to the protagonist's intentions during the second act of the film, I had no idea when or if we were going to get to the end. And when we did, it wasn't in the environment I expected, and the payoff was diluted.  If this were based on a true story, I'd accept it, but the fictional characters were developed inside the structure of history, so there's no reason why we couldn't get the kind of ending the buildup seemed to promise.Regarding the second point - I think Scorcese was really allowed to run with this.  I know there are rumors that huge parts of the film were cut out, but if that's the case, the fault lies with the director for not cutting the right things.  He seems enamored of the period in history - as I would probably be if I had researched it extensively - but the development of characters suffers for it.  We are left to draw our own conclusions about what should be carrying the plot: the people we are offered as our points of view.Regarding the third point - I have no idea how to solve this issue.  It's not a movie about a single rarely-discussed battle in a war we all know about tangentially.  It's a movie about (a) religiously-divided gangs in 19th century New York City, (b) fierce nationalism in a newly formed country ,(c) the political and social implications of a draft in a society of newly-arrived immigrants, and (d) a revenge tale carried out across generations between two men impacted by points a-c above.  If this had not been Scorcese, and if he had not gotten DiCaprio and Day-Lewis and Diaz, this film would never have gotten off the ground.  It could have used some pruning before it did.With all of those complaints out of the way, I still gave this movie a 7 (and this is high for me - I rarely award 9's; only three 10's are in my entire IMDb voting history).  The costuming and set design are fascinating. The battle scenes are bloody, and they might seem over the top, but I suspect that's what it looked like when people hacked each other to death using large handheld implements.  The acting is stellar in some cases (Day-Lewis is great, although not as astounding as I expected from the reviews) and passable in others (DiCaprio has relatively little to do, given the fact that I don't feel his character develops, but he's good at what he's doing).  I can't comment on Diaz's performance because it feels as though her character's entire arc was cut out of the film, leaving only a series of random actions that don't seem consistent.  I think I give it this rating because it did eventually get around to closure, and it showed tremendous attention to detail.  I just didn't like how it got there, and I wondered if some of the detail clouded the overall point.Story is king in great movies.  ""Gangs"" is good, but not great.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The supporting cast does a fine job, especially Brenden Gleeson and John C. Reilly. I did kind of feel sorry for Leo after this film was released, only for the reason that I felt it unfair they tried to have him carry this film, and that's not good. He had to act opposite one of the finest actors in film or stage. That's quite a feat. Also, I felt the sets, costumes and screenplay were top notch, and the editing and cinematography done very well too. Because of the film being a Scorsese film with a star studded cast, I feel people's expectations were through the roof, expecting for it to be one of the best movies they have seen.

"Several basic conventions stand out: acting, sets, costumes but the film changes its mind half way though and thus relegates itself to good rather than great.","A lot of people may love Martin Scorsese but I feel the best word to use to describe him would be: consistent. Scorsese is showing no evidence of lacking in his more recent stages as a director, in fact The Departed recently won Best Picture and Gangs of New York is still an enjoyable film, albeit not great, for the best part.With the film set up superbly thanks to a long and bloody street fight and the main character of Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) established, the film looks like it'll go down that route of revenge but that's the one major thing that sticks out  it changes its mind half way through. Apart from Amsterdam's backstory, returning to New York and rising the ladder in order to get closer to his revenge; the film isn't really about anything. For some reason, Amsterdam isn't in every scene but when revenge is the story's drive, how should be. Instead, we get a few nothing scenes set in an office full of caged birds and just general chat involving the antagonist Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Day-Lewis).Once most of the dross settles down, Gangs of New York evolves into exactly what I thought it would be: A well shot, brilliantly choreographed, well acted film about one man's rise up the male dominated world of gangs and gangsters. Amsterdam gets into fist fights, actually helps out Bill now and again to gain extra trust, has encounters with the loose women that populate that world and just generally hangs out and makes friends. Why the film couldn't remain like this, only the filmmakers will know.Although it sounds fantastic, there are still one or two things that just stick out. The strangest of which was the feeling I got when I wasn't sure whether or not I was supposed to laugh. There are some scenes that just don't seem to need to be there; the one in particular is the hanging scene: was it meant to be funny? What was the point of it? and Why didn't those 'guilty' put up more of a fight to escape if they'd done nothing? You see, scenes like this and a few others from memory just don't seem to have a purpose  if it was to emphasise Bill's evilness then it was still unnecessary.These few things aside, Gangs of New York will counteract anything negative with something positive. The scene Amsterdam and Bill share after the orgy is particularly memorable as not only do we find out more about Bill than we already knew but we also get the feeling Amsterdam has won his trust. There's also a scene involving Irish immigrants coming of the boats as soldiers (who probably aren't coming back) go on  fuelling the racist hate the film has simmering throughout it. Two fantastic scenes that contain so much more than meets he eye but why the pointless scenes are included anyway is beyond me. Like I said earlier, the revenge plot line I had hoped for came but unfortunately; then went. Gangs of New York then turns political as a twist involving Amsterdam and Bill occurs and they must now go against one another in the form of words; a sort of 'Cold War' between the hero and the villain if you like. This was different and consequently disappointing although the final payoff is enjoyable and leaves a good feeling of closure.I labelled Scorsese 'consistent' in my opening but this particular film is 'inconsistent'. It starts out on a revenge path, contains elements of racism but turns political and what with the World Trade Centre involved at the end, it's like the film's trying to give a message that nobody really wants to hear but with brilliant sets and misé-en-scene, Gangs of New York is worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Unrelenting misery,"Not a shred of humanity shines through in this film to rescue it from being one of the most unpleasant cinematic experiences of recent years. Some say, ""but it's Scorcese"", afraid to consider that the master may have taken a misstep, and ready to admire his pet project on the basis of previous triumphs. I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree. For highly stylised characterisation, read ""pantomine villains"", for impressive design, read ""an overwrought and unconvincing pastiche"", for a captivating plot, read ""a relentless barrage of violence, punctuated by the annoying musings of unsympathetic characters, none of whom arouse any sympathy"".I have no problem with violence in films, especially of the sort shown here. That is, brutal, unsettling and far more likely to make one a pacifist than a violent man. Usually, however, the violence is countered by the humanity shining through in at least one of the central characters. The only character capable of arousing pity and sympathy is this film is that of Cameron Diaz (under-used). Others, especially Di Caprio (as Amsterdam Vallon), simply arouse frustration, annoyance and contempt (are we suppose to respect this disturbed young man's violent revenge fantasy?).The only plus note is the (historically accurate) incorporation of the anti-emancipation riots and lynchings of black men in New York during the Civil War into the plot. There have been few American films recently to show the ugly side of America's formation and I'll give the film a cautious plaudit for that at least.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awful,"I had hoped to enjoy this film, and for awhile I did. As time went on through the film got worse, and worse, and worse. By the time the movie finally ended, I pretty much hated the movie.

The good parts of the film are hopelessly outshined by the horrible.The overall story that develops is dull as can be. Everyone in the film is corrupt. There's simply no one to root for in this film except maybe the army who are almost shown as the bad guys. Nearly everyone in the movie is a murderer, a racist, or both. It's that bad, and I'm speaking quite literally.The gore goes from entertaining in the start to offensively disgusting in the end. There's also some pointless nudity, but we're not talking Cameron Diaz here. It's just extra girls laying around topless for no real reason. Extremely pointless and not in the least attractive. Overall I strongly recommend avoiding this film. It's incredibly long, dull, and you'll feel like you need a long shower after watching it.Rirath_com",,Anonymous,Crime

historically not correct and politically correct?,"Jay Cocks, writer of the story, was more accurate in his historical vision in the other Scorcese movie about New York: The Age of Innocence. There is a difference of ten years between the two movies and you see in Gangs...and the later The Age of Innocence that New York has had a big transformation after the civil war. The Irish immigrants would continue to flow into the States until the end of the century and then the Chinese and Italian immigration started. However, there were no Chinese immigrants during the sixties!  So the presence of the Yellows-gang of Chinese is simply not possible. It is also not correct that there were blacks in the Irish gangs. Is this because the producer Harvey Weinstein wanted to give us a politically correct movie with the obliged percentage of blacks? The gang of the Dead Rabbits, to which Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) belonged, was originated from the Kerry Mountains, not far from Killarney in the South-West of Ireland.  The Irish, suffering from hunger and the holocaust by the English, fled to the States (from Baltimore in Ireland f.i.) in terrible circumstances which were hardly better than the slave transportation from West-Africa. Jenny Erverdeane (Cameron Diaz) looks too old for the Young Amsterdam but The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a good cast.  This movie should have been longer or shorter and not in between because the story has no time to develop and the end is too simple. We learn from this movie also that the civil war was not popular because so many soldiers died (especially immigrants were enrolled by an unfair allotment system ) or were mutilated.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
brilliant spectacle / mediocre conventional drama,"""Gangs of New York"" is a deeply flawed film from Scorsese. It's certainly not a flawed masterpiece as many have asserted, but rather is an at times brilliant spectacle, but just as often a mediocre conventional drama. Scorsese seems too intent on making a big film with big set-pieces but has failed to devise this within a coherently constructed framework. Ultimately the film's greatest problem is one of intention  it seems to be about everything and nothing and finally rounds off in a confused mess. The final reel is perhaps the weakest 20 minutes in all of Scorsese's work. Some other shortcomings include the conventionality of the narrative  a straightforward revenge drama, with a love interest tacked on, with several soap-opera moments and melodramatic twists. Leo is okay, but he doesn't really impress. Cameron Diaz causes all kinds of problems, she is dreadful playing a character that is redundant. It's a stupid and useless character that detracts from the overall film. Given all of this there is a diamond in the rough  Daniel Day-Lewis. Playing a complexly drawn character Day-Lewis is sublime in giving the cinema's best performance in the last 3 or 4 years. He is simply astounding in every scene he is in and he dominates the other actors with an uncommon charisma and an indescribable attraction. Scorsese's film is moderately entertaining but I expect more from one of cinema's great filmmakers. I think history will show that Scorsese's earlier examination of New York's foundation - the modern masterpiece ""The Age of Innocence""; will dominate in all comparisons to ""Gangs of New York"".",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Overly sensational with one great lead,"Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" takes too much time introducing the audience to the environs of New York City's ""Five Points"" in 1862-63. The story is supposed to be that Amsterdam Vallon is out to avenge the death of his father at the hands of Bill the Butcher. But that's not the story exactly. Before Amsterdam can get much of an idea about where he's going and how he'll get revenge, he allows William Cutting to take him in as a surrogate son, and come to the point of almost loving him. It is not until halfway through the movie, when Amsterdam saves The Butcher's life that he realizes how far he's stooped.Daniel Day-Lewis, as everyone agrees I am sure, gives a fantastic performance as a racist gang leader who pretty much owns all of the Five Points and everyone in them. Leonardo DiCaprio is woefully miscast as Amsterdam Vallon, and it's rather surprising. For an actor as admired at his age for the veritable talent he's shown on-screen, Leonardo cannot pull off a convincing Irish accent. Cameron Diaz as Jenny is similarly handicapped, but her character is given enough redeeming qualities to at least make one want to care for her. The supporting cast is perfect, however, Jim Broadbent as the corrupt William Tweed is almost unrecognizable and seems to act almost like comic relief for all the beaurocratic bull he throws in The Butcher's face. John C. Reilly, star of three of the five Best Picture nominees, also does well as an Irish cop with a big black hole where his heart should be. Brendan Gleason gives his typical strong performance. Henry Thomas, a native of Texas, is a welcome relief when his wholly convincing accent is compared to DiCaprio's half-hearted attempt. And, of course, Liam Neeson, as the fallen ""Priest"" Vallon makes his usial strong performance.To warrant any feeling for Amsterdam the movie should have not wandered so far from his story of vengeance before returning to his mission. If there were any characters in the movie worth caring for, whether they died or not, the movie would be more enjoyable. I admired that the whole movie was shot on a set in Rome, but if the movie didn't LOOK like a set, then maybe it would've been easier to swallow. The Butcher, Monk McGinn, Priest, Jenny, and Johnny were all developed enough to care. You never wanted Bill to win the fight, but at least you could understand him. Not so with Amsterdam. The climactic Draft Riots of 1863 were well-staged. A chapter in our history worth taking not of. So too was Boss Tweed, the man who ran Tammany Hall until he was convicted by the Thomas Dewy of the 1800s, Samuel Tilden. But while Scorsese wanted to make a movie chronicling the underworld of New York and the Irish immigrants, his unflinching examination of the Five Points gangs, and nothing but, leave a nasty taste in your mouth.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

What has Scorsese created? --- Nothing spectacular at all,"Back in December, I couldn't wait for this film to be released. When I finally went to see it with a friend of mine, I just knew it was going to be worth the wait. . . but, sadly, I was wrong. This movie could have turned out as an absolute masterpiece, but it was butchard. I'll break it down:I had absolutly no complaints about the acting. It was, indeed, supurb. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful. Though, I was expecting so much more from Daniel Day-Lewis. The way everyone was talking about him, saying that is was a preformance that will never be forgotten. I forgot it right when I left the theater. I am not saying that he did a bad job, but certainly did not deserve awards.The screenplay is the solid basis of a movie. Without a good script, you will not have a good movie (regardless of who is directing it.) Gangs of New York had a VERY bad script. It had no plot twits at all. Nothing to keep a viewer hooked. Nothing. The diolouge was flat. It just seemed to run on for the length of the movie. And the so called ""love"" in the movie. What love? It was two confused people who wanted to take out all of their sexual frustrations out on eachother.But the worst thing of all is the editing. Nothing seems to flow together at all. It is just one jumbled mess, that shows nothing. Really! One minute two people are talking and the next two woman are haveing graphic sex with eachother. THE MOVIE MAKE NO SENSE!I don't think people really watch this movie. I think that they just see the name Martin Scorsese and just say is was great. Well, I really think that Scorsese did a bad job, as did the writers. This movie will not live on as Taxi Driver or Mean Streets did. It is really not worth your time of seeing this movie.

"Bold, epic, magnificent movie","""Gangs of New York"" is a big, bold and magnificent; it is glorious movie-making, period.  The brilliance starts right away in this film, because it opens upon a seemingly alien world that the audience has never seen, but as it pours itself out into a small and poor inner 1846 New York City neighborhood we come to realize that what we are witnessing is not a ""Mad Max"" scenario, but something different out of American history with which most of us are unfamiliar.  A violent clash of Irish immigrants and anti-immigrants then ensues, preparing us not only for the individual human drama of the main characters, but for a drama much larger than those characters, and the horrific nature of the violence is cinematically accentuated by the staining of the snow-covered ground underlying the feet of the combatants with crimson (and, yes copious, blood).  From this point on we are led further and deeper into the lives of the main characters, with the backdrop of a burgeoning metropolis rife with political corruption and a nation divided by the Civil War.  The various effects that these larger issues have, or do not have, on all of the characters populating this movie is sometimes apparent, sometimes not, which is a tribute to the intellectual aspect of the film -- it lets the viewer think, ponder, and reach individual insights and conclusions.  The heart and soul of mid-19th Century Irish immigration, prejudice and poverty are well-portrayed with immaculate attention to detail in all aspects of film-making, most notably acting, set decoration, costuming, and cinematography, truly made to be seen on a big theatrical movie screen (those who wait for this to be released on dvd for their smaller home screens will have missed something special).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Minor flaws, but still a great film","Is ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese's best film? Is ""Richard the Third"" Shakespeare's best play? Most Scorsese fans would rightly rank ""Taxi Driver"" and ""GoodFellas"" above ""Gangs,"" just as Shakespeare scholars would tell you ""Hamlet"" and ""King Lear"" are more complex and better characterized than the still-great ""Richard."" Ultimately, such distinctions don't matter. ""Gangs""' minor flaws don't distract from what's ultimately a great (if not perfect) film.Scorsese begins with a simple story that owes its soul to, if not ""Hamlet,"" at least ""The Lion King."" Some view the lack of plot complexity as a flaw, but I think the bare-bones story structure is just the right choice for this film. Because Scorsese doesn't have to juggle a lot of disparate, clunky plot threads, he can give this film what it needs: a colorful, fascinating palate of well-drawn characters and impressive visuals. I never believed I was seeing anything but the roiling, filthy, angry underbelly of a nation confronting its turbulent adolescence. The concise plot allows Scorsese to work his magic as the greatest visual artist in modern American cinema.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance isn't exactly earth-shattering; we haven't seen what he's truly capable of since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" Many have complained about his off-Irish accent, but I don't think that's a big issue. Remember that Amsterdam Vallon spends most of his life in New York. Most children of immigrants, then as now, sport a ""halfway"" accent, not quite American but not quite that of the Old Country. Cameron Diaz manages to let us forget ""Charlie's Angels"" for a few hours. As much fun as it was to see her wiggle her ass at the camera, here she proves that she can indeed act. And what can I say about Daniel Day Lewis' performance that hasn't already been said? Like Denzel Washington in ""Training Day,"" Lewis' Bill the Butcher is a very evil man who convincingly and seductively becomes a slick, personable charmer when need be. Lewis gives one of the great performances of the past few years.All in all, ""Gangs of New York""'s minor, unimportant flaws don't distract from what is ultimately a great film. Not every movie needs a complex, challenging storyline. It worked for ""Pulp Fiction,"" but wouldn't have worked for ""Gangs."" Scorsese's key accomplishment is in realizing that, and using his inimitable visual skill to create a fascinating, engrossing film that seems far shorter than its three hours. It's not Scorsese's best, but like Shakespeare he has plenty of competition from his own work. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Visual masturbation.,"As good as the direction was, I felt that I was alternately either watching a mid 1800's version of either Mad Max or A Clockwork Orange.The story was a fairly straight-forward revenge tale.  Unlike many other commentators, I liked the Di Caprio character and thought he did a good job (which is saying a lot for me, since Titanic is one of my most hated movies of all time and I despise anyone involved in that project) and felt D.D. Lewis was doing a bad De Niro impression the whole movie. To his credit, he was semi-creepy (mostly due to the handlebar moustache though), but whatever he was doing with his voice ... it was cheeseball.  Cameron Diaz was miscast, but I didn't mind it much since it at least gave me something to look at while I was trying to stay awake.  The plot and story were nothing to write home about, and the movie was about half an hour too long for the lack of substance it had.The extreme liberties on historical accuracy also were annoying to me, especially since the movie played itself off as being at least somewhat historically accurate (for example the fades to New York in its current real state at the end of the movie, as if the two were even from the same universe much less one evolving from the other). I'm a fairly cynical member of society (left winger and an atheist), but the continual mockings of democracy, voting, value of human life, religion,etc besides just plain getting old quickly also came off as needlessly cynical untruths. If the movie was going for any real insights into early American life/thinking they failed miserably.6/10 more because most movies are junk rather than this one being particularly good.On the plus side, I'm off now to watch A Clockwork Orange again.  Kubrick makes Martin S. look like an amateur with this type of material.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"to many entrees, too much time","Almost always when I indulge in a buffet my selection of entrees makes very little sense. I take what is available and pile one taste upon another until the whole mess tastes like slightly crunchy rubber. Then when I ""finish"" my overindulgence comes the I can't believe I ate the whole thing syndrome and the vows not to return until I run a marathon or at least play a round of executive golf. Which leads me inevitably to Gangs of New York.Each of the individaul entrees look interesting... Danilel DayLewis...Leo... Liam.....Cameron...Broadbent...Robbie Robertson...Scorsese...Reilley...even U2...New York City.... and even an unrecognizable David Hemmings for God sake and you've got a buffet say that makes about as much sense as piling lasagna on scrambled eggs and putting the whole thing over french fries, tuna fish, squash and peanut butter. Something epic has been created, something barely digestible, something thought provoking and worth the money but something that in the end leaves a ""whaddafug was dat?"" aftertaste.I can't believe how many movies Scorsese supposedly waited three decades to make. Gangs of New York is yet another one joining Kundun and Last Temptation of Christ and The Age of Innocence (right there we're talking nine decades alone whihc is ninety years...how old is this guy anyway?). I wish he would return to movies he took only a few years to make like Mean Streets or Taxi Driver or King of Comedy instead of these ingenious, awe inspiring works of overincubated art fart that no one seems to enjoy as much as the man who dealt it. (I keep thinking of Marty at the Oscars as his presumed night of homage deteriorated into humiliation and shutout. That weird smile.The caterpillars etc.)Macbeth spoke of life as ound and fury signifiying nothing. Scorsese's got the sound and fury right but the implication is that it all signifies something and right there the picture starts to go wrong.Butcher Bill is a great character and Lewis should have gotten the Oscar. I'm a big Leonardo fan but gotta say he was miscast. He might have been good in two movies that were left out of this movie....sixteen years at Hellgate and the Rallying of the Dead Rabbits...perhaps also the missing love story between Dam and Jenny but Scorsese obviously didn't have the time to go there.Still for sheer effort alone and the fact that only Marty could in fact make this kind of exquisite mess...I gotta give Gangs an eight out of ten.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great concept, look, some great performances, script needs work","Amsterdam Vallion watches his father die in a gang battle in New York by the hands of Bill The Butcher.  After being sent to reform and now grown up, he sets out for vengeance in 1846 New York.So aside from the location, history time period, just what makes this film so unique considering its nothing more than a boilermaker of a script we've heard a thousand times before???It's unfortunate there wasn't some other story to tell, cause this is really the only thing wrong with the film.  Daniel Day Lewis's performance is masterful, and the others are good as well, and most of the minor characters (John C Reily and Gary Lewis) are exceptional.  Great direction, great cinematography, but can't make for the lack of script and something to engage the viewer than the simple plot story line.Still worth seeing.Rating 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Personal Vs. Political,"Though Scorsese had cogitated this project for decades, it still serves well as a companion piece to his adaptation of The Age of Innocence. Set in 1870s NYC, that story depicts the ivory tower built upon the urchins of the city's mean streets up into the 1860s, depicted here. I find the extreme class divides between both stories fascinating. Was Day-Lewis' Newland Archer studying law and enjoying the opera on the Upper East Side at the same time his Bill the Butcher was leading slaughters in Lower Manhattan? Standing alone, nonetheless, Gangs is about the classic revenge struggle of DiCaprio's angry young hero Amsterdam.This is Amsterdam's fever dream of recollections and impressions of the history of Five Points. Mention of saints, Satan cast out of paradise and a large, championed crucifix, all in a row not even two minutes in, shortly followed by a battalion of reactionaries receiving Holy Communion before a vicious street fight, signals Scorsese's way through the character's agitated story, some of it, Amsterdam tells us, he remembers, the rest of which he took from dreams. So, he's very much of his time, place and circumstances, living them both inside and out. This gives Gangs the vehement storytelling energy of Scorsese's more modern films centered on gangsters, rather than, say, the abstract contemplativeness of his earlier Kundun, also about a crusader whose early childhood is saturated in deep religious zeal. And perhaps there's a religious lapse personal to Scorsese when Amsterdam becomes a man, setting forth on his vendetta as he pitches the Bible into the river, in very smooth high-definition slow-motion.What's also immediately evident is the full-bodied cacophony of urban life, squashed in on itself, doing little to comfort traditionalists and xenophobes, not the least stubborn of which is Day-Lewis' Irish-hating Bill, a killer WASP let's say, introduced scraping his foot against the ground like a literal bull, whom we later learn is perhaps the most eloquent man ever to have trouble reading. NYC here is its own character, arguably in a similar way that Vietnam is the main character of Apocalypse Now, in that it ceaselessly inundates the characters on their epic journey. Amsterdam and Bill are at personal odds framed by their dynamically different class and generational positions in a society fueled by racism and other forms of bigotry, fed by ubiquitous corruption. The illustration of the hounding and intolerance of non-Natives at the time is one of the historical elements to which the film remains most faithful. Even beyond the barbaric makeshift melees that bookend this saga, violence is the fabric of this main character, and Scorsese creates an all-encompassing textile of sudden explosions of it, from fleeting cutaways of random muggings to a brutal fistfight between Amsterdam and McGloin carefully storyboarded for gracefully headlong, vicious energy, followed with fluent transition into a contemplative comedown of Amsterdam's uncertain sentiment toward the newly admiring Butcher.True to America's lineage, Scorsese depicts a world where property holds sway over humanity. ""I'll give you a dollar for that locket,"" Bill bids a fellow, who tells him it was his mother's. ""Dollar and a half,"" Bill wrangles. ""Done."" A man of wealth, likely one of Newland Archer's peers, bids, ""You can always hire half the poor to kill the other half."" Anybody can be bought, and in order to secure your rights and have them protected you must secure and protect them all by yourself. The film's tapestry shows how free-for-all capitalism and weak government had made criminals out of everyone, having generated America's immense gangland history. Let's point out that Amsterdam and his compadres rob a poor woman's house while it's burning down. They're hungry! He later leads his posse in pawning a dead body off as loot. Bill swiftly lets him know that the mere pleasure of his company has a price. We see he means it when he puts on the most masterfully commanding charm and deferential charisma when confronted with a wealthy family whose interests are carefully considered by powers that be.The film's sporadic glimpse into the antiquated tradecraft of thieves and gangland M.O. is given the grinning sense of nifty fun of The Great Train Robbery's Victorian-era safecracking or Paper Moon's Dustbowl short cons. Cameron Diaz shows her bones as the wickedly clever sneak thief who becomes Vicky to Amsterdam's LaMotta, or maybe more akin to Zoe Bethune to Amsterdam's J.R. Unfortunately, this romantic trajectory also sends the plot for a time into hackneyed territory, something Scorsese had avoided more effectively than any other Hollywood director of his generation, or most. Gangs, thus, does lose the infectious forcefulness and unceasing originality of any of his other crime-themed films. Karen Hill had three dimensions. Diaz's Jenny is increasingly diluted into one, merely a tag-along love interest. It's the class struggle that gets the propellers spinning again, as the immigrants engage their oppressors with Democratic leadership. And when subjugation and violence again overtake, the film comes full circle to the epic street fight for justice, both for the hero and for America itself.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A big load of hooh-hah over nothing really,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMartin Scorsese takes an Oliver Stone esque stab at the American dream/ideology with his latest offering,seeking to shatter anyone's illusions that America was a land built on hope and prosperity with his tale of the war that waged on New York's Five Points area between 1846 and 1863 between the American natives and Irish immigrants,interwining it with the tale of young man Amsterdam Vallon's (Leonardo Di Caprio) quest for vengeance against the leader of the native's Bill 'The Butcher' (Daniel Day Lewis) because he was the one who murdered his father (Liam Neeson).It's directed by Martin Scorsese,it's epic in scope and length,it has an all star cast (including,by the way,Cameron Diaz as a female pick-pocket) and it's the kind of thing the Academy usually lap up anyway.Of course oscars were in the air in the case of Gangs of New York.Personally,though,I couldn't help but feel the movie was trying to send me to sleep,a meandering,lengthy hodge-podge of bland characterization,ineffective characters,disjointed plotting and a script that always seems to be trying too hard.On the plus side,I suppose,there is Day Lewis's engaging performance to bear in mind (he did win the oscar,didn't he?),as well an absorbing feel to the time and place setting.And to be honest,it's got far too much interesting themes and ideas to explore to be completely not worth your time.But,bearing the length in mind,if you manage not to nod off (or switch off,for that matter) before the end,maybe you deserve to win an oscar.***",,Anonymous,Crime

Titanic II:  Washed Ashore?,"Scorsese is a brilliant director, creating some genuine masterpieces of film - but I think Gangs of New York may have been just out of his league. Scorsese had everything to work with that usually makes his films blast off: A great cast, true crime story (as true as Hollywood gets, anyhow), and of course dramatic violence to drive home the point that sick human beings are really capable of that kind of stuff.  For some reason, it just didn't work out here in GNY.  As much as I wanted to really enjoy this film, when asked by others how it was, I can only reply ""Ehnnn..."" while turning my hand back and forth.Gangs of New York displays its Titanic feathers in its very premise.  The scenario pits the hero from the bad part of town (Leo), an initially reluctant love interest (Cameron Diaz/Kate Winslet), the upper echelon villainous villain who has her (Zane/Day-Lewis) and a major historical backdrop with impending doom (SS Titanic/1863 Draft Riots).  Mix it all together, put the dramatic climax during the historical climax (Leo and his love dodging people falling off the titanic into the ocean during the sinking/Leo and his love dodging Navy shelling during the riots), put into context here and there miscellaneous social and political aspects of the historical period (the treatment of the poor and class wars on the Titanic/the treatment of immigrants and Civil War issues in 1863 New York), add a dash of gratuitous nudity (need I embellish?).  Bake at 70 degrees - 55 if the heat's out at the Cineplex - for 3+ hours and...BAM you have yourself a Titanic blockbuster!Other problems also came to mind while watching this film.  First there's the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is just not believable as a mid 19th century crime lord.  As good an actor as he is (and his performance in this case wasn't terrible)...the guy is just not believable in GNY.  The accent didn't stick and every time he spoke as the narrator, I momentarily wondered ""Who cast the Malcolm in the Middle Kid to do narration?""  He needs to stick to films that he can be really great in such as Gilbert Grape, Romeo and Juliet, and of course, Titanic.All in all, GNY was not without its merits.  Daniel Day-Lewis turns in the performance of his career as Bill ""Da Butcha.""  Several scenes with the Butcher were great and the scenes during the election were hilarious. Between those, things could get slow.  The ending was entertaining but overall a letdown.Gangs of New York had a lot of potential, but when all is said and done at the end, we have another Titanic - beefed-up/heavy, overdone, ==seemingly=> unsinkable?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A little too ambitious, but great fun","Gangs of New York is a classic Scorsese attempt of a masterpiece, running at nearly 3 hours long.The acting in the film is sublime, particularly, Daniel Day Lewis, who portrays 'The Butcher' in a truly fantastic way, and makes it extremely enjoyable to watch his menacing character.It is a good film, and the plot is enjoyable up until the final half an hour in which Scorsese's reach extends too far.

"Day Lewis stole the show, hands down","This is a very good picture, but not a great one. Martin Scorsese brings us a very medieval look to late 1800s New York. It works for this movie, it is it's own world that is easy to get caught up into. It is a bit too long, but any one who considers themselves a fan of acting needs to see this. The reason is the performance of Daniel Day Lewis as William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting. He is simply wonderful, it is the best performance in the history of cinema...period. He completely wraps himself into the character. Very soon into the movie, it becomes clear that this has turned into a display case for Day Lewis' talent. He is mesmerizing, he steals every scene, although it was not too difficult to steal the scenes from Cameron Diaz and Leonardo Dicaprio (I must say that Leo's performance was not bad, he showed great potential, Diaz was out of place) Diaz is not an actor, she is a movie star, Leo is border line, but everyone else is an actor, John C. Reily, Jim Broadbent, Liam Neisen, and of course the completely underrated Daniel Day Lewis. See the movie for his performance, it is still very good and entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
