Very enjoyable film,I haven't finished watching bridesmaids for the first time I just saw the moment when Melissa McCarthy character says she never bloats. That It's a gift.She is so adorable while saying this! I watched this moment several times. She really is a very talented actress! Love her!So far it is very entertaining movie except one or two uncomfortable script moments. Wedding speech scene was hilarious. So was tennis game. Girly competition. Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne are both great. Sometimes it gets sad like cupcake scene but it is funny at the same time.I'm going back to watching the rest of the movie. There was one scene with Chris O'Dowd. Can't wait to see more of him. Another talented actor. Love him as well.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining,"There are many prickly relationship comedies, many wedding related comedies, many gross-out comedies, many my-life-is-a-mess comedies and many comedies that shoe-horn in a romance.This has all those familiar elements but it works really well. It is well-paced despite the long run time, with a good mix of the various elements that keeps the entertainment and comedy value strong. Importantly the characters and relationships seem believable which makes the comedy parts so much more effective when they happen.Kristen Wiig plays the lead character and co-wrote (taking care to include romantic associations with two really attractive guys). Wiig is really funny and effective in the role. I also really enjoyed the performances of Rose Byrne and Chris O'Dowd. Melissa McCarthy is good and her bit on the plane was really funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love Hurts,"Let's be honest: when we saw the first trailer for Bridesmaids, who among us didn't think it looked like a dismal rehash of The Hangover (only this one, of course, features a ""ratpack"" of women)? Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.The story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart. At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired ""friend""—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad ""bow"" to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.There are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition. Sure, it's extraordinarily raunchy from time to time, but the nuanced, perfectly- timed moments of comedic genius make it a very worthwhile trip.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Very Funny Movie,"Kristen Wiig is one of the rarities from Saturday Night Live that was able to be great on the show and make the transition to films successfully. Bridesmaids was one of the best examples of this. It is more than just the use of a character, or trope, in a feature film. It is the use of a powerfully gifted comedian in a smart, funny role. It is the female counterpart to the male driven Hangover. Wiig is beautifully supported, and enhanced, by Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Ellie Kemper, and SNL's Maya Rudolph. Melissa McCarthy is shocking and funny in this one. She has some of the film's funniest scenes. Judd Apatow did a terrific job making a film driven by an all female cast that is not just for women. Jon Hamm has a small, buy very funny role in this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Goofy and funny,"It's a fun one time watch. Directed by Paul Feig. Life of a unsuccessful pastry chef whose best friend moves kn and is ready to get married; the funny competition between herself who is the maid of honor and one of the bridesmaids. The cute love story with the cop who actually loved her cakes when the bakery was in business, and keeps telling her to go back into it. There are good messages at parts, like when she hit rock bottom another friend comes over and tells her the problem is not the world, it's herself, so the solution has to come from her as well. Really good acting by everyone. Also a small message in Helen's story, on how money can't buy friends.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolute perfection,"This is the funniest film ever made. Hands down. And it gets funnier every time. I have never laughed so hard, and I quote it almost daily. Just perfection!The cast are all amazing and are perfectly cast. Kristen Wigg has never been better. There are just too many funny scenes- the plane scene is an absolute classic. If you don't pretend to be Ms Iglesias on your next flight then there is something wrong with you. But all the scenes are hilarious- the wedding speeches, any scene with Annie's mam, any scene with Megan, any scene with Rita... just brilliant. You feel like, somehow, even though they're all completely bonkers, you know them. And you leave the film feeling great.Watch it... on repeat! You will not regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not very funny,"For this film to work it has to be funny - and it isn't. I'll pretty much laugh at anything - I even thought Tropic Thunder was hilarious, Satan's Alley, now thats funny. But I sat through this and didn't laugh, smirk or smile once. Its not that i don't get Kristen Wiig, in fact I think she steals her scenes in Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, where she is fantastic (""Its not a competition, but you're best""). She's also probably the best thing in Paul as a god bothering hillbilly.But why doesn't this film work for me? Well it just isn't funny - there's no genuine humour in someone being drugged up and doing bad things on a plane, or people getting food poisoning and needing to defecate on the street. You would expect a lot from the people who put together this movie but they don't deliver.",,Anonymous,Romance
"silly, funny, bitchy, and just great","This flick is silly, funny, bitchy, and just great. We meet Annie (Kristen Wiig) a bridesmaid, whose best friend is getting married. Annie has lost her business and is alone and loveless. She is also getting pushed out of her bestie relationship by the NEW broad, the NEW bridesmaid, who is gorgeous, rich, and generous. How dare she? Then Annie loses her apartment and has to move back in with mommy (Jill Clayburgh). This is a hilarious chick flick of high caliber. The women are funny, clever and outrageous. The fashions are just silly enough and the writing and acting carry it off smoothly. There isn't a miss in the bunch but Melissa McCarthy stole plenty of the show.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
10/10 From a Guy,So this is the first comedy with a mostly female cast that blew me out of the water. Its as good as comedy gets - period. Right at the top with 1 other (which I'd rather not name for reasons).I had already liked Wiig but this was her crowning achievement. It was also the movie that but Melissa McCarthy's career on the fast-track to stardom. Solid performances from the rest of the cast who all deserve a mention.The film is filled with side-splitting hilarity.I loved the toasting scene at the shower and the awkward one-upwomanship that ensued.The plane scene has so many quotes and Wiig's genius shines so brightly.Then the dress-trying scene had me rolling.I've probably rewatched this movie as many or more times than any other. I've also recommended it as much or more than any other.A masterpiece film that just so happens to be a comedy!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm seriously confused.,"OK. After seeing the previews of this movie, it was added to the list of movies I did NOT have any intentions of seeing. However, I heard so many great things about it, I decided to give it a try. Let's just say, my gut feeling was correct. I have NO idea what so many people found so amazing about this movie.It's not that funny. Yeah, there were a couple of scenes that I found humorous, and chuckled. However, most of the ""funny"" scenes were either involving sex, about sex, about poop/vomit/farting/burping, or a lame attempt at slapstick humor. Lots of predictable cheap shots. Seriously, no sophisticated or classy humor... the whole film made me feel trashy, honestly. I get that it's rated R, but still. I felt like I was in an adult version of an equivalent to Spongebob at times.Small plot. This movie is slowly stretched out for over 2 hours, with a plot that could easily be explained entirely, with all important scenes, in about 30 minutes. There were SO many long scenes that seem to be thrown in just so Kristen Wiig can score another laugh, yet they don't progress the story. Quite a few plot holes, and there were many scenes where I caught myself rolling my eyes, thinking, ""really?""The greatest movies develop their characters so much that you literally feel for their outcomes. I left the theater with no regards to any of the characters in this movie, because they were all so distant and under-developed. The plot was so weak and rushed for the next pointless comedy spiel, that they didn't give the characters any depth, except maybe the lead of ""Annie."" I can think of 2 memorable scenes right now from this film, and I saw it last night. Yeah, there were some funny scenes, but nothing worth raving about in my opinion.I do have to give ""Bridesmaids"" some credit. An all-female leading role movie is very new in show-business, especially in comedy. Sadly, these women made the ""Hangover"" equivalent instead of raising the bar, but they get Kudos for the efforts. There were some sweet moments in the movie, that for me, held the film from turning into a complete waste of money. I do like comedy, but I prefer classier, witty humor instead of the easy, thoughtless humor. I would much rather watch a movie that evolves a character so much that the cheap shots aren't needed for laughs. If you liked ""The Hangover,"" then you'll probably enjoy this movie..",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the funniest comedies of the 2010s,"This movie, along with movies like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde, is one of my favorite chick-flicks. It's one of those films that are funny no matter how many times you watch them. It's got a solid cast, all of which are hilarious. The protagonist is over the top but also relatable at the same time, to some extent, of course. I empathize with Kristen Wiig's character. Feeling like a loser, being afraid to take a risk at following your passions because of past failures, feeling left out, seeing your friend by pulled away from you by someone who's seemingly ""better"" than you in any way, feeling inferior to other women, being afraid of growth, being afraid of commitment, staying with toxic people who use you, having little respect for yourself. I think a lot of us can relate to some of the things I listed. And of course, this character is funny as hell. Kristen Wiig put in her all, and I'd also like to give credit to the writers for allowing her comedic talent to shine in this role (unlike the writers for the Ghostbusters reboot, which was full of talented actors and actresses who were completely screwed over due to bad writing). Her character was written so well, as were the others. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"To love this movie you have to love dry, ironic humor. This movie has it in spades. I get why people don't think it is a good movie. They don't like intelligent humor. Too bad for them.The entire cast is absolutely brilliant. The star of the movie is Melissa McCarthy. The STAR.Chris O'Dowd burst on to the American screen with this role - he is amazing- watch him in UK shows.Same for Rebel Wilson- this may have been her best performance ever. Short and sweet. Have not been impressed with her roles since. This was her defining moment.I am not sure that people realize that this one movie catapulted three unknowns to fame. That is extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One for the girls!,"Saw this film yesterday at a preview screening, and enjoyed it. Most of the girls in the screening loved it, whereas the one man was saying at the end, ""I didn't get it!""... I guess I was somewhere in the middle of the two opinions.I was hoping for more sass from Rose Byrne. And less vom-com from Sukie From Gilmore Girls. The comedy is a blend of well-timed mutterings and over the top cringe moments, but overall Wiig does well, and has great Meg Ryan-esque hair.As I walked away from the film, what stayed with me most wasn't the comedy, but an overwhelming desire to call some old girlfriends I hadn't spoken to enough recently. Its a great portrayal of female friendship, and its difficulties (we've all been there in one way or another), topped by the very genuine-seeming moments of in-jokes between Wiig and Rudolph. They were definitely the best moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A hilarious and surprisingly touching comedy,"My friends invited me to a preview screening of Bridesmaids last night, and I accepted the invitation with a sense of cautious optimism. The trailer for the film admittedly didn't do much for me, but I was intrigued by the concept of a female-driven Apatow film. Ultimately, I went into the theater with modest expectations, hoping to get a few good laughs out of it.By the time we came out of the theater, my three friends and I had smiles plastered across our faces, and we couldn't stop talking about the film for the next couple hours. We all loved it. I think it easily ranks with the best of the Apatow productions, and it might even be my personal favorite. Like all of Apatow's productions, there are admittedly scenes that arguably go a little too far or a little too long, but that's a small criticism when the film successfully fires on so many other cylinders.To start with, the film is hilarious, and I think the comedy far exceeds the standalone bits shown in the trailer. Scene after scene is filled with humorous and often sidesplitting moments, and they had the theater in an uproar during the screening. I can't say enough about Kristen Wiig. Prior to this, I've always liked her to some extent but never really loved her. I think she's good at what she does, but I wasn't sure her shtick could sustain an entire film. Would her passive aggressive wit get old? Is it the only note she can play? Can she handle anything more dramatic? Ultimately, she blew me away in this film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny, but her character is surprisingly well-developed, and Wiig brings the character to vibrant and dynamic life on-screen.And this brings me to my next point about Bridesmaids: the film has a surprising amount of depth that completely caught me off guard. Bridesmaids isn't a quickie 80-minute gag fest by any stretch of the imagination; it's actually a leisurely paced 2-hour character-driven comedy that takes time to develop its characters and establish the various relationships and resultant conflicts between them. Ultimately, the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sad in places. Despite the over-the-top antics shown in the trailer, the themes that the film explores are actually quite grounded. Kristen Wiig's character is someone who is feeling completely let down by life, which is a place we've all been, and the personal journey of her character resonated strongly for me. While her character is easily the most well-developed of the bunch, even the other bridesmaids ultimately show some three-dimensionality as well, despite the fact that they are sometimes initially introduced as two-dimensional caricatures.Ultimately, Bridesmaids was one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in a long time. It's certainly not perfect: it could probably do with some editing, there might be a few too many subplots (some of which are left unexplored), and it arguably goes too over-the-top at times, but everything else about the film works so well that these complaints are little more than nitpicks. While I applaud everyone involved in the production, it is Kristen Wiig who deserves the most accolades. As co-writer and lead actress, she plays a huge part in the film's success, and I sincerely hope this film puts her on the Hollywood map, as I would love to see more from her in the future. Whatever the case may be, Bridesmaids certainly makes for a successful maiden voyage for her into the world of feature-film comedies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny enough for a GUY to enjoy!,"It's amazing that no one has thought of this before. After countless years of watching groups of men behaving like idiots on the big screen, we finally meet a gaggle of women who will put any stag party to shame. A lot of people have called 'Bridesmaids' the 'female version of The Hangover' and there certainly are similarities in the set-up, but they're both different enough to be enjoyed separately without too much comparison.There's a preconception (possibly among men!) that 'women aren't funny,' or at least women aren't AS funny as men. I won't attempt to guess at either of those statements' validity, but I will say that 'Bridesmaids' goes some way to prove that women can be pretty amusing when the setting is right.The 'plot' is pretty simple: a woman is getting married and invites her various friends to the various pre-wedding preparations. Mayhem follows.Yes, there is a strong element of 'rom-com' in there, but it never overshadows the general humour. There are six central (female) characters and not all are as 'fleshed-out' character-wise as they possibly could be. However, the film plays to its strengths and gives more screen time to the funnier of those among them.Basically, you have a light-hearted comedy/romance that should appeal to men and women. I should point out that the humour is pretty 'adult' in nature and anyone easily offended by bad language may be in need of earplugs (and that's just from the women!).Of course it's not for everyone. I'm guessing its primary audience will be women. My (male) friend warned me from ever watching this film, telling me how awful it was (I haven't admitted I've seen – and enjoyed – it to him yet).Special mention to Melissa McCarthy, who steals every scene (and every puppy).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Hilarious,"I'm going to tell you now that the advertising for this movie is weak. It comes off as some kind of chick flick, it's trailer gets a few chuckles out, but it really does not do the film justice. Bridesmaids will be the surprising film of the year and could very well even be the comedy of the year, topping films like The Hangover II and 30 Minutes Or Less. Yes, it's that funny. And I will tell you now, this is not the film you think it is.Bridesmaids is a fairly simple film that sees one unlucky lady being the maid of honor for her best friend while attempting to plan the wedding. All of this as her own life falls apart at her feet. Suffice to say, hilarity ensues. And it really does ensue. Surprisingly, despite what you might think, this is not a chick flick. It's got romcom elements to it, but it's like any other comedy, but with that rare all female cast. I can't remember the last time laughing this much during a movie. It helps that everything falls into place so well. Kristen Wiig is hilarious and this should be her star making film. She carries this with great talent and is at her most hilarious here, while still playing the emotional parts very well. There wasn't a single moment that brought me out of the film, and that is the sign of a film well done. Her surrounding cast does as great a job, with Melissa McCarthy being the standout as the token obnoxious groupie. Nearly all the scenes featuring her are laugh out loud funny.The writing also shines here as it's Apatowian comedy comes through. This is reminiscent of the early Apatow films, like 30 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up. The comedy lingers at some moments, and even shoots for being uncomfortable. The dress scene in particular is gross, but probably got the biggest laughs, as I could hear people in the theater barely containing themselves. But again, the film is a constant laugh riot. It certainly does have a very nice emotional backbone and that comes across well with a very relatable story that isn't so much about any kind of romance but rather someone who is losing their mind. You feel bad for Wiig's character, but not in a way that makes her sappy or over the top. Rather, it's a down to earth kind of falling apart that anyone could relate to. Much in the way that Knocked Up and Superbad worked for their relative stories, Bridesmaids is a rare comedy that has an all female cast, yet can appeal to anyone.I guess that's the biggest surprise here, that this is a film that can work for everyone. My audience was mostly female, but everyone was cracking up the entire time. So, don't let that fool you. Nor should you let the advertising fool you either. This is one hilarious film that you would be sorry to have missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: Bridesmaids,"Help! I may be losing my sense of humour, which I fear. While many have found The Hangover and its Part 2 really funny, somehow I'd hardly classify them as really being comedies of their respective years since there are padded moments that doesn't do the story any good, while at times having scenes which were really engineered and came across quite artificially. The same goes for Bridesmaids, widely touted to be the female version of that Todd Philips directed series, and in the same vein, suffered a similar fate in having the expected play out as they should, and nothing more.Not that I'm expecting rocket science, but the story does indeed take a leaf out of The Hangover, borrowing its basic setting of an impending wedding, coupled with a celebrity finale that is as formulaic as how most wedding dinners here are conducted - you get the fanfare introduction of the appetizers, before a rather bland main course topped off by noodles or rice, followed by desserts before everyone forms a beeline for the doors.Written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, the latter /who also stars as the leading character Annie, this film could have been labelled as a singular rather than a plural entity, given varying degrees of screen time granted to the rest of the entourage. Annie is that neurotic woman who cannot seem to get her act together, being a flop in her confectionery business, a flop at her sales work, in total disarray for having entered into a f*ck buddy relationship with a rich playboy, and in arrears with her apartment rental. We only know that she's best friends forever with the bride to be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) and has been tasked as the maid of honour, which is where the whole film revolves around.Not. Despite its wedding theme, there is only a handful of scenes related to the run up to a wedding, such as the fitting out for gowns in an expensive shop which provided some of the best scenes in the film, a bridal shower and of course the expected finale for a film like this. The rest of the scenes felt like glue, being there piece the disparate scenes together so that it can flow from joke to joke. On the jokes front, there's a good mix of verbal jousting and slapstick, which came complete with the obligatory toilet humour, and plenty of potty mouthed characters who think that swearing equates to funny. Obviously some worked while others tanked, with brilliant ideas all utilized in a single setting, leaving mediocre ones to prop up the rest, which was a pity.The real crux of the film, one which actually made me appreciate and enjoy this a lot more, is its theme of the rich and poor divide given the presence of Helen (Rose Byrne) as the antagonist, being extremely loaded, and for reasons to be unveiled which had nothing to do with Lillian's wedding, if at all, having set up to be Annie's chief rival to be well received, and recognized as Lillian's BFF. It addresses how sometimes money can be used to buy emotions, affections, friendships and all things superficial, but when it comes to the crunch, nothing beats sincerity and a keen interest without having baggage such as ulterior motives. Sure there were a couple of engineered scenes to bring this up in not so subtle terms, but I guess when used in the context of weddings from the female perspective, meaningful things can be built without the need to always resort to material wealth, though of course the latter, together with personal connections, sometimes help, and that's the ugly truth.Surprisingly the story was allowed to wander all over the place, to allow Annie to get involved romantically with a cop (Chris O'Dowd) naturally in contrast to her f*ck buddy, but also to provide some comic relief no matter how brief those moments actually became. I suppose no flick chick can entirely omit this aspect in a film with the absence of that proverbial Prince Charming type, so O'Dowd served the purpose complete with his Irish accent used to sound exotic and to provide a very small talking point in the film. A trip to Las Vegas got set up as well but for all the fanfare expectation, everything got centered around the airplane journey which was included in the trailer, and somehow overstayed its welcome.If only the film had avenues to bring in the other bridesmaids, especially Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey into the picture, it would have been more inclusive since they won't fade away as unimportant, disposable caricatures. Even Melissa McCarthy had it lucky to have a jarring, comeback moment of sorts to engage the audience directly, being the equivalent of Zach Galifianakis in his turn in The Hangover though less annoying, to literally slap some sense to the protagonist and preach ideals and values to the audience out there. It's a pep talk alright about self confidence and self pity, mildly amusing though not contributing much to the story anyhow.Still, the film lived up to its marketing billing of The Hangover equivalent for the female crowd, and it shows, despite venturing into gross out territory centered in and around a bridal shop, which personally contained the best moments of the film. Call me crass but at least my laughter was sustained in that setting alone. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad crude jokes that are not funny and way too long,This is a boring film.This is what happens when a not very talented actress writes and produces a film and is in the main lead. She is annoying as hell and the scenes that are supposed to be funny fall flat. Especially the one on the plane to Las Vegas.In the final part the film tries to become sentimental but by then I was way past caring for the main characters. The only person who acted was Jill Clayburgh. What a contrast between her acting and the others.I saw it via Netflix DVD and thank goodness I did not pay money to see this nonsense in theaters.

At the end of the day it's a Romcom,"I know I am 13 years late for this movie since for the genre the time it came out does make a difference, in any case I tried to keep that in mind and since it was the most interesting movie on the flight catalog I decided to watch it.I was surprised by Kristen Wiig's performance, it's the first movie I've seen her as a lead and she did quite great! As the title of the review states it's simply put a romantic comedy, sure it has some refreshing perspective in the sense that the type of jokes and the overall tone is usually dominated by an all male cast, so it was good to see the change of pace but it's not revolutionary.It was a fun movie to pass the time, some great performances, some good jokes, it was surprisingly good for the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridesmaids,"Bridesmaids was an absolutely hilarious comedy movie that was also just well done. I'm going to say it because others won't, but I was surprised it was so funny with an all female cast. Usually crude humor like this gets lost or comes off as too scripted and forced but this was actually very funny even without men. It was just effortless and funny while still maintaining a strong story line with peaks and valleys throughout. I'd highly recommend it. IMDb DOES NEED to get rid of this character minimum asap. It's beyond annoying and over the top at this point. I just wanna watch movies and leave simple reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Puts most modern comedies to shame,"This is like a big slap in the face to all the lame chick flicks out there as of now and a breakthrough, star making leading role for the brilliant and hilarious Kristen Wiig. I have never seen a comedy in a long time that was as consistently funny and I mean laugh on the ground with tears coming down your face funny as well as touching and for once genuine characters that you can relate to and have an instant, believable, bond and chemistry on screen that makes the ongoing crazy shenanigans all the more effective and hysterical. The showstopper, scene stealing, laugh riot Melissa McCarthy was fantastic and no wonder has her own sitcom and she should host or be apart of SNL or something she is so freaking funny I almost wet myself! Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig should make more comedies together and are much better than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were in Baby Mama, they are a comedy dream team and the rest of the cast is the cherry on top. The movie goes through typical issues from the average chick flick like jealousy, insecurities, narcissism, cat fights, self-doubt, self-pity, self-destruction you name it but it deals with those is a more honest, realistic non sugar-coated way that was refreshing and smart from the norm and raises the bar so high for chick flicks (which is more anti of that anyways) and comedies in general that I personally can't see any comedy this year or in the future surpassing its comedy greatness, it's golden!!! Overall if you were waiting for a movie that will truly make you laugh harder than you ever laughed before in the theaters in a long time your wish has been granted, wear depends just in case because you might need them. Highly Recommended! The most satisfying comedy in the past decade that I never wanted it to end and forget about the overrated The Hangover and its unnecessary sequel and bring on Bridesmaids 2 already! 4.5 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Bridesmaids,"Many people have been describing this as the female version of The Hangover. Those people however forgot to do one tiny thing- watch both films! Yes both films revolve around the preparation for a wedding and contain their fair share of low brow comedy but that is where the similarities end.Bridesmaids follows Annie (Kristen Wiig), the maid of honour for her best friend Lillian's (Maya Rudolph) wedding. While she is preparing for the big day though, the rest of her life is falling apart around her. Her love life is in tatters and she is struggling to keep on top of the bills. All the while she has to set up the wedding, organise the bride and compete with the other eccentric bridesmaids to keep things on track.The main thorn in her side comes from Helen (Rose Byrne), one of Lillian's new friends and bridesmaids who Annie feels is taking her friend away from her just when she needs her the most. Add to that the other colourful Bridesmaids of Megan (Melissa McCarthy), Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) and Becca (Ellie Kemper) with the continual flow of jokes and situations and you get one decent comedy.What I liked about Bridesmaids was the fact that it did not shy away from all the gruesome details just because the characters were female. Usually women in films are depicted more prim and proper so it was refreshing to have this change. Some might consider some of the scenes to go a little too far or continue for just a bit too long (one scene in particular did start to drag for me) but I felt overall it just about hit the nail on the head.Wiig, along with her co-stars, impresses throughout the film showing us that she has a place as a comic actress and the addition of Chris O'Dowd as the love interest worked well.If I were to pick fault with the movie then I would have to say that some of the characters didn't make me want to care that much about what happened to them (but then again this is primarily a comedy not a drama) especially the bride who I never felt had that was enjoying her wedding at any point. Also there were probably a few too many sub-plots and side stories that could have been shaved of to drag the time under 2 hours. Apart from that, I was pretty impressed.This may be one set out for the females in the audience but it is very much a guys film as well. There is a bit of a romcom element but it takes a backseat to the main female character driven comedy. Some will find the jokes distasteful and not rate the movie because of this but I was chuckling away on more than one occasion. Guys, if your going to be dragged along to one 'chick flick' this year then make sure it's this one.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best movie there ever was,"I love this movie SO MUCH. I watch it every year. FUNNY, with a great message! Your the problem, but you're also the solution.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly a funny film which follows in the footsteps of The Hangover.,"For those wondering if this comedy delivers the laughs the answer is yes it does. The humor keeps on coming, and this is perhaps the funniest film I've seen in the theaters this year. The setups are actually good, and almost every scene ends up being funny. I have to mention that this isn't a romantic comedy though there is some romance on the side. Apart from the bridesmaids I thought that the characters weren't well developed. The film is often raunchy but it has a sense of realism that's believable. Bridesmaids is similar to The Hangover (2009) and other films that followed. The difference is that this film stays true to life with scenes conveying different emotions that are very believable. In this sense the characterization is some of the best that I've seen in comedies. The film mirrors modern society very well, and it doesn't hide from weird and harsh realities. Kristen Wiig is fantastic in the lead role. Like I mentioned before, however, the supporting characters aren't the film's strength and scenes between Wiig and Chris O'Dowd were not something that I enjoyed. The scenes with the bridesmaids on the other hand were very enjoyable. To sum up Bridesmaids is an original, touching and enjoyable film. I definitely recommend seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

nice,Nice comedy film. But I thought it'd be one of my favorites because of how much I heard good things about it but no; it is only funny at times. 6/10,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not the film was expecting, pleasantly surprised","This movie was advertised as being the female equivalent to the Hangover, but it isn't anything like the Hangover. There's no drunken bachelorette party. It borders on being a rom com and is more about the main character, Kristin Wiig, finding herself again. Whilst there is the occasionally slapstick moment and variety of improvised crude lines, it's not so much to offend anyone. I don't like silly movies generally but I do like rom coms, and I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Also surprising is how well Chris O'Dowd fits in to the movie and his believable performance having only seen him in quirky British TV shows like IT Crowd. At times the dialogue was a little awkward in the movie and there's some uncomfortable pauses but a pleasant surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Apparently, women swearing really is funny to everybody","A movie for women, about women, and by women. Well, make that last one written by women but directed and produced with the Paul Feig and Judd Apatow touch. This means that we get comedy and emotion in equal parts. But it also means that we get perverted humour, cliché cat-fights, and sweet romance.Some of the requisite inclusions like trying on bridesmaids dresses, which incorporates the perverted humour, are absolutely hilarious. While some of the requisite girl fights are stupid, ridiculous, and completely unrealistic. Realism may not be something they're aiming for here, but it's funnier when it's true.""Bridesmaids"" is more about Annie (Kristen Wiig) than the other bridesmaids. A better title would have been ""Kristin Wiig Before the Wedding"". Wiig is best known for ""Saturday Night Live"", and they do take a lot traits from SNL, live over-using Wiig, having scenes last longer than they should, but at least the majority of them are funny. Thankfully the other featured bridesmaid is played by Melissa McCarthy. She is given the best character, the funniest lines, and proves how good of a comedic actress she is.Undeniably, ""Bridesmaids"" is hilarious, but the ridiculously high critics' rating really just suggests that men love it when women swear. It's funny but it's not brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good humor and also some heart,"The Hangover with women instead? The answer is both yes and no. I seem to be one of few who were kind of cool towards the Hangover, sure it was good entertainment but nothing special and there are much better recent comedies out there. Or maybe it is because comedy is no longer any of my favourite movie types.But now for the somewhat surprise after this gray introduction: I really liked Bridesmaids. It was great fun all the way through and to my positive surprise it isn't just a bunch of jokes strung together by a simple plot that serves no other purpose. Bridesmaids also has a story that feels worth following. I would categorise Bridesmaids as a drama comedy. That is I think one of the main reasons I liked it. There are both parts of laughter and wanting to see what happens next. OK so the story is good but it's not great. At the time of writing this review the movie has been nominated for best original screenplay. According to me it is not that good but I don't know all the competition. At the start I stated that it still is somewhat like The Hangover and that would be the funny parts. The humor feel the same kind with awkward situations and serious acting in pretty absurd happenings. Works mostly great. And so the acting? It is most of the time good. It is the kind of forced dialogue and over the top behavior. But I don't mean it in a bad way it is how it should be for this kind of comedy. Kristen Wiig fits well in the lead and manages well to create the character the viewers care for even if you don't entirely sympathize with. Rose Byrne is just as good as the rival. But the performance that stands out enough to take the spotlight ever time she appears on screen is Melissa McCarthy. The audience laughed at every thing she said, well almost. Her character and her acting was perfectly humorous. Still does she deserve a best supporting actress nomination? I'm not sure but it is true that funny movies seldom get the attention of the big ceremonies like the academy awards so maybe it just feels strange. I don't think I have that much more to say about Bridesmaids.It is a very good comedy, not great but it might be the funniest I saw the previous year. The fun stuff is great and it still doesn't get stuck and start going on routine. Thankfully the movie also has some emotional substance coming from a well written story. Bridesmaids is a movie that absolutely deserves to be seen and then one will want to see it again. My grade 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Funny and Heartfelt!,"Annie's life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime best friend is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian's maid of honor. Though lovelorn and broke, Annie bluffs her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect, she'll show Lillian and her bridesmaids just how far you'll go for someone you love. (C) UniversalWhen I saw the trailer for BRIDESMAIDS, I didn't see anything special with it. There were maybe a couple of good jokes in there but nothing really hilarious to make me wanna see it right away. However, after the end credits rolled from a prescreening I went to, I have to admit it: It's freaking hilarious! To put this into perspective, I don't like many modern comedies, so this is saying a lot. There was one sequence in the film that was so funny and so shocking that I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in a film EVER! To say that the trailer doesn't do the film justice is an understatement. However, on the up side, the trailer doesn't show the funniest jokes in the film like most trailers for comedies do these days (don't you hate it when that happens?).And no. BRIDESMAIDS is not a chick flick. There are some raunchy scenes in here that you have NEVER seen in any other film before. Let's remember, this is a hard R-rated Judd Apatow production, so this film shouldn't be taken very lightly. It's not to say that BRIDESMAIDS is one of the best comedies of the decade. In fact, as much as I laughed throughout the film, it does slow down after the first hour with the second hour not being nearly as funny as the first. Still, I laughed out loud pretty frequently, which is a feat hard to pull off on someone like me.BRIDESMAIDS is also pretty heartfelt. This is mostly due to the wonderful ensemble cast, who are all fantastic in their own way. Kristen Wiig FINALLY gets the chance to shine in a starring role! Honestly, this girl can carry a film on her own. Maya Rudolph was also great. Seeing the dialogue exchange between her and Wiig made their chemistry feel very authentic which is no surprise since they were in SNL together. It's also fun to see Rose Byrne in more comedic roles, who was also in GET HIM TO THE Greek and this year's sleeper hit, INSIDIOUS(!!).I think an obvious audience favorite from the group of girls would be Melissa McCarthy. She provides some of the films biggest laughs and for a good reason. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the remainders from the group and they were pretty good, but they aren't as prominent as the other girls. There are also some guys in the cast, most notably Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm. O'Dowd did a good job playing Wiig's love interest (and you can pretty much see where this is going...), and Hamm did well for the limited amount of screen time he had.Sure, BRIDESMAIDS is predictable as hell but so are 99.9% of other modern comedies. However, it's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited. Overall, it's just plain old entertaining, hilarious, and heartwarming. Who knew? Also, with the ""HANGOVER with girls"" comparison, BRIDESMAIDS is a much funnier, insightful, and honest film than THE HANGOVER ever was.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unpretentious comedy with a great cast.,"This had been on my list for a while; I tried watching once but one of the early scenes made me cringe so much I had to stop. Not that it was bad, but it is the kind of humor where characters are in such embarrassing situations it gives me ""second hand embarrassment"" and it's hard for me to watch. This is the type of humor this movie has, along with a lot of slapstick and crude jokes. Critics seem to either love or hate it but I have a more balanced opinion. Once I passed the cringe effect, I did enjoy the humorous situations. Is it the best, smartest comedy I've seen? No. But I still had a great time and a few good laughs!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is how stupid comedy has become and how low brow theater goers are,"This movie was SO AWFUL it gave me a headache. ANYONE who thinks this is humor is out of their mind. It is grotesquely sad to me that in this day and age ""humor"" has resorted to being a fart, or vomit, or toilet scenes, or comments about body parts and secretion. It's really just disgusting and shows a COMPLETE lack of originality and talent in writers. The scene with the women trying on dresses and getting sick is revolting and gratuitous at best. I found the entire film degrading to women and vile child's play. AND TWO HOURS LONG?!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? I had an expectation that it would be silly but just went for a laugh. What I got was depressed and a headache. What is most depressing is that sadly, this generation sees this as humor. And they will never know the likes of great comedic writing and true humor that comes from situation and from brains and true wit. Someone should shoot Jud Apatow.

"Judd Apatow meets Wedding Crashers meets The Hangover, with females!","This movie is hilarious fun. My wife drags me to one chick flick a year in the theater, and I'm glad it's this one. Considering the talent involved, I expected something more than meets the eye after seeing the trailer. However, I was not expecting such a hysterical experience. This is a chick flick for dudes... the anti-chick flick ""chick flick"" if you will.What I loved about this movie is that although you get a sense of the heart and charm, it's not afraid to pull any punches just because the characters are female (the scene in the bridal shop will be the topic of much discussion, I assure you). I also loved the cast, lead by the always awesome Kristen Wiig. She was perfect in this role and I hope she does more work like this. She can make me pee my pants with laughter, and then straighten me right back up in a matter of seconds.I also loved the pacing of most of the film. Several scenes had just the right amount of awkwardness or pause or ""beat"" that really added an extra element of hilarity. There were several of those scenes where the audience was collectively cracking up, almost violently so. People were wiping tears from their eyes and still relaying jokes back and forth to one another as they filed out of the theater.Anyway, guys, trust me.. make this the ""chick flick"" you surprise your girl with and take her to the theater.

It was suggested by two ex-friends, who i will now call acquaintances because they let me waste my money. That is not what friends do! That being said, this movie definitely has a few laughs here and there, but i probably forced myself to laugh because i went into the theater thinking it's a comedy. I feel as if the whole movie was forced into comedy, although i think it would have been a great movie had they made it more into a drama. I think the blond girl (dont know name) definitely did act well, i was sad for her when she was going through the stuff and i would have loved to see her get her life back together.I definitely think the humor they used has been done to death, like food poisoning, going in the bathroom in your pants etc etc. It is worth a watch, ONCE.

The award nominations speak for themselves,"Contrary to all the negative flack that this movie received on this site, it garnered quite a following a quite a number of award nominations, Oscars and Golden Globes included. The bad reviews use words like ""class"" - and overly uptight terms like ""bathroom scenes"" or ""pooh scenes"" which caused audience members to ""cover their eyes"". This leads me to the natural conclusion that those who disliked the movie are somewhat of a conservative crowd who want women to behave a certain way and dislike ballsy humor. Perhaps they expected something fluffier because it starred women in pink dresses. Perhaps they feel that women shouldn't be this crass or sarcastic; that only men should be allowed to behave this way. Well, for once, women in film stopped acting like Hollywood caricatures and started acting like real women who I know and love. THAT'S why people react so favorably and appreciate this movie. For once, men weren't the raucous, offensive ones in the spotlight while women were relegated to being clumsy or having their skirts blown up. Aren't you tired of female comedies in which the lead protagonist is funny because she falls? I am. I stopped counting the number of trailers that feature women falling for laughs, while men get to be real and raw. Now, look, everyone appreciates a different kind of humor. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I tend to appreciate more sarcastic and often offensive material that challenges the norm. For that reason, this movie is right up my alley. If you want a feel-good tampon commercial, this isn't it. This movie is for people who are tired of seeing women act prim and proper. It's for people who know that real women can be proper if they choose, but some are also just like this and they're finally being depicted in the movies. If men made this movie, we wouldn't be having a debate about it. Their behavior would be totally acceptable. I knew what to expect from this movie and I got it - and then some. They went above and beyond my expectation. If you didn't realize that a comedy starring this particular cast would be offensive, then you've been living under a rock. That's like going to see Kathy Griffin or Margaret Cho and expecting a church sermon. That's YOUR bad. And to the person who thought it was unrealistically annoying that someone would lose control of the decision-making for their own wedding... have you ever actually been involved in a wedding? I have. Many of them. And that really does happen. Stress, pressure from family, it gets away from you faster than you know and takes on a life of its own.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laugh-out-loud in patches.,"Hailed as the female answer to crude comedies such as The Hangover and Knocked Up, the latest from Judd Apatow (here working as producer) doesn't quite reach those lofty heights. Star comedienne Kristen Wiig (getting her first lead role after a thriving run of supporting gigs in Paul, Whip It, Adventureland and Walk Hard) is marvellous as Annie, the worst Maid of Honour ever, and Melissa McCarthy and Australia's own Rose Byrne offer noteworthy support as the chick version of Allan (short fat guy from The Hangover) and the bitchy frenemy respectively. However, for every hilarious ""I can't believe they just did/said that moment"" there is a lengthy run of humourless scenes that stall the momentum. At 125 minutes Bridesmaids goes for way too long, and Maya Rudolph is achingly dull as the wife-to-be Lillian, but there are enough laugh-out-loud moments to ensure both sexes walk away with a grin on their face.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Perhaps you have to be a woman to appreciate and truly like it.,"As a comedy, to me, this movie just wasn't really good or funny enough. It actually was a pretty awkward movie to watch at times and I just can't understand why it is being liked so much. Oh well, perhaps I simply need to be a woman to 'get it'.The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was buildup like a realistic and serious movie, complete with emotions and women trouble and all but with yet also some truly over-the-top comedy thrown into it. This just wasn't a combination that worked out very good or felt organic to me. Some of the insane comical situations really seemed out of place and totally not in tone with any of the rest of the movie. This especially goes for the movie its gross out moments.It's good and all that there is a big and popular comedy for- and by women for a change but I'm just incapable of seeing it as a great or fun one. But like I said, this is probably all because I'm male and just can't relate to any of the issues being handled in this movie, or just simply don't find them all that interesting or appealing. Yes, this foremost truly is a chick-flick, so if you are a female, simply just ignore what I have to say about it, since chances are you are going to have a totally different opinion- and feeling toward this movie.But really, the movie as a whole doesn't seem to be all that well written or clever. It's of course mostly being predictable and most of the comical situations feel forced and like they were shoehorned in. Besides, it seemed so unlikely to me that all of these girls were all truly friends, since most of the them have very little in common. Some of the characters are also terribly underwritten and I have no idea why they were in this movie at all.It's not like the actors were bad though. I known lots of people are always saying bad things about women doing comedy but this movie definitely shows that females are perfectly capable of handling comedy material. It of course helps that the movie is written by females. You could really tell that by basically everything that this movie was written by females for females. The dialog and story-flow all feel more natural because of this. I only did wish the comedy was something better and more natural feeling as well. But again, if you are a female, chances are you will still end up really liking this movie.I wasn't all that impressed but then again, this movie clearly wasn't made for me.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie and Helen's 'showdown' at the bridal shower was a well-scripted high spot, creating the momentum for the turnaround moment and an irony-rich happy-ever-after ending.The characters really are not hugely different from Carrie Bradshaw and Co but well-rounded with everyone given good lines and comic moments. All the performances are outstanding except for Matt Lucas's cameo as Annie's house-mate; he's NOT given any good lines.

Good jokes spread far too wide.,"I started Bridesmaids once back in the last Oscar season but I couldn't get passed the first half hour. My enthusiasm for that year wasn't enough to force myself through everything and I don't think I was in the mood. I decided to give it a chance now that I want to watch all the Oscar nominated screenplay films so I skimmed what I saw and continued from there. Bridesmaids is essentially 2 hours of Kristen Wiig's sense of humour, which is good in small doses where I enjoyed her in her bit parts of Apatow films, but this film is hit and miss gags (the bleached asshole gag had me on the floor though). I wonder if the nomination is just for all the ""gross- out"" comedies of late because this one wasn't anything special.It has some sharp moments and it does do a great job of making Wiig's character hit rock bottom, but there were a few moments I felt were out of character just for laughs. Melissa McCarthy was actually pretty good, but not Oscar calibre, not even up to Robert Downey Jr. tongue-in-cheek Tropic Thunder calibre, but good for the package she's in. I love The IT Crowd but the misuse of Chris O'Dowd really sucked. His character was written embarrassingly bad. His first scene is what made me turn off the film the first time. This second attempt was more entertaining this time round but the film's biggest problem is the awful pacing. It's ridiculously slow and lacks all story drive. It needed a good ruthless editor to come in and kick some life back into it. Beats The Hangover anyway.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It was OK, it wasn't THAT good","I want to start off by saying this is a good movie and I would recommend it to others. I just read all of these glowing reviews and I must have had some really high expectations. I wasn't blown away like all of these other people were. I saw it with my girlfriend. We both laughed and had a great time. After it was over, we moved on though. We weren't quoting the movie or talking about it for hours.The character development was great. I enjoyed the originality of the jokes and situations the characters were placed in. For the most part, it wasn't stupidly predictable, although there were parts where I knew what would happen later in the movie.This is a fun, witty comedy. I think it was geared toward the female audience. (I'm male) While I did get some really good laughs, I could tell some jokes were just not meant for me. I just sat there, rolling my eyes, like I was sitting at some sort of girl slumber party that I wasn't invited to. The older, female audience was practically wetting its pants, however. Maybe they're just not used to the crude, in-your-face humor, reminiscent of so many ""guy"" movies just like this.There were some scenes that went wayyy too long. OK, I get it, it is an awkward moment, lets move on..... There's no reason to waste 10 minutes of a movie to stress how awkward a moment is. And of course, there HAD to be a musical moment where everyone breaks into song and dance together, as if they all got together the day before and rehearsed. This single moment turned this movie into a ""chick-flick"" for me, sorry.On a more positive note, the acting was great! My favorite character/actress was the groom's sister! By far! Kudos! Sorry, I don't know anyone's real name. Seriously, its far too much to keep track of.If you're a female, go see this movie. If you're a guy who wants to see a movie with a girl, you could do much much worse than Bridesmaids. I did enjoy myself, and left with a smile on my face. The completely packed theater was justified. I just didn't think it was quite as good as the other reviews are saying. I was expecting to see a movie that we'll be watching and re-watching for years, judging by what others said. If my girlfriend gets it on Blue-ray, and its a rainy day outside, I'd gladly watch it with her again. I just won't go out of my way.All-in-all, I'd recommend this movie.

'Dick and Fart Jokes' Chick Flick Style!,"'BRIDESMAIDS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Judd Apatow tries his style of raunchy yet emotional comedy/drama with a chick flick by producing this Kristen Wiig vehicle (an 'SNL' and supporting film player vet). Wiig stars in the film as well as co-wrote it with comedian Annie Mumolo. Apatow's buddy Paul Feig (who created the popular short run TV series 'FREAKS AND GEEKS', which Apatow also produced) directed the film. It co-stars Maya Rudolph (a fellow 'SNL' vet), Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Chris O'Dowd. The film tells the story of a woman going through a midlife crisis at the same time that her best friend is getting married. Most of the film's big laughs come from the type of vulgar and crude humor you usually only see in guy movies, which is a nice change of pace and ballsy. The film isn't quite as consistently hilarious as Apatow's best films but for the most part it works and it does have the touching emotional aspect that Apatow films are known for as well (which it actually does a better job of delivering).Wiig plays Annie, a down on her luck jewelery store clerk who had recently attempted to follow her dreams and open a bakery. Despite Annie's great cooking talents the bakery failed due to the recession (she says). She's also had a lot of poor luck with men and is constantly treated like merely a f--- buddy by the pretty boy she wishes was her boyfriend (Jon Hamm). When her best friend Lillian (Rudolph) tells her she's getting married and asks her to be her maid of honor she falls deeper into depression and despair. Things are complicated further when a rivalry grows for Lillian's affection between Annie and Lillian's new good friend Helen (Byrne, looking more stunning than ever), who's also the rich beautiful wife of Lillian's fiancé's boss.The movie has plenty of hilarious moments, including some of the raunchiest and most vulgar dick and fart jokes of any comedy recently, but at times the jokes tend to stretch on too much and lose a lot of their momentum. The movie is way too long for a slapstick romantic comedy (at a whopping 2 hours and 5 minutes!) and some of the vulgar jokes are almost too grotesque to even sit through (at least for me, I had an extremely hard time stomaching this movie). When it is funny it works though and Wiig is very impressive in the lead. The rest of the cast is more than adequate as well (especially Byrne, McCarthy and O'Dowd). The emotional drama of the film is surprisingly what works best about it, it really feels true and heartfelt (especially the relationship between Annie and a friendly police officer (O'Dowd). While the movie isn't quite as good as Apatow's best it's still an impressive achievement and hopefully will help pave the way for more female driven crude comedies to set new ground in the future.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj550csrEQk",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Proof that an all-women ensemble can deliver mainstream laughs,"To use a completely irrelevant but title-appropriate expression, when it comes to comedy, women tend to be the bridesmaids and never the bride. Prior to ""Bridesmaids,"" the only mainstream comedy driven by females that I can recall (at least in the Judd Apatow era) is Tina Fey's ""Baby Mama"" back in 2008. Comedies preceded by a ""romantic-"" given the nature of their intended demographic, don't count, at least not in the eyes of the general public. Fittingly produced by Apatow, ""Bridesmaids"" fights all these assumptions and historical tendencies better than you'd expect.Star and writer Kristen Wiig and co-writer Annie Mumolo pick a fight with the biggest and most relentless rom-com formula at the party: the wedding story. It's not exactly the easiest way to challenge the general perspective on women-centered comedies, but if successfully avant-garde enough, has the greatest potential for turning the genre on its head a bit while still appealing to the women who still prefer to indulge in these repetitive story lines.Some of ""Bridesmaids"" most effective marketing came from a critic who called it ""'The Hangover' for women."" The only things the two films have in common is that a wedding sets in the events in motion and they both expressed a desire to push R-rated boundaries. ""Bridesmaids"" has a much more traditional comedy structure and heavy doses of romance.Annie (Wiig) has hit a mid-30s crisis: her dream of opening a bakery came true but got cut down thanks to the recession, she has a crappy living situation and she keeps going back to a guy (Jon Hamm) who's rich and good-looking but doesn't care about her. Her one rock has been her life-long best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). When Lillian gets engaged, Annie assumes the duty of Maid of Honor, but the tremendously pretty and rich Helen, another bridesmaid, seems intent to steal that out from under her, which pushes Annie over the edge.The script puts a particular emphasis on developing Annie's character to the fullest, which hurts the comedic rhythm of the film a bit, but ultimately makes ""Bridesmaids"" a stronger film. The movie doesn't quite live up to being billed as hysterical with exception of a few boundary-pushing scenes and takes awhile to get going, but the emotional parts don't set off a chain reaction of eye-rolling, which alone puts ""Bridesmaids"" in a higher tier as far as rom-coms go. A montage scene toward the beginning when Annie bakes herself a singular ornate cupcake and then eats it for lack of a better idea drastically slows the film down, but might contain more intelligence in those two minutes than most romantic comedies can fit in two hours.Most of the heart comes from a terrific and believable relationship between Annie and Lillian. Their scenes drag on a bit as these are two talented improvisers volleying the humor back and forth. They carry on like any two best girlfriends but with a touch only true comedians can offer. ""Bridesmaids"" mostly showcases Wiig's off-beat awkward humor. Annie comes across as a lady-like Larry David character, someone you pity to death and care about but who can be completely nuts and usually causes all her own problems by reacting poorly to adversity.Outside of the cat-fighting between Annie and Helen, the rest of the bridesmaids get short- changed (another reason to separate this from ""The Hangover"") except for Melissa McCarthy as Megan, a character so multi-dimensional that you never know just what to expect from her. As much as this will feel like speaking poison, she could warrant her own spin-off.""Bridesmaids"" doesn't break the mold and completely usurp female comedy conventions, but some of the film's best characteristics do offer proof that women can be funny in a mainstream way, at least when the characters receive thoughtful treatment. The R-rated gross-out humor could have backfired, but it was treated in such a way that it effectively enhanced the story and fit the characters, something most rom-coms that try similar tactics fail to achieve.Hopefully Wiig keeps churning out films and can train some other hopeful lady comics to follow in her footsteps so that romantic comedies can truly be enjoyed by everyone again.~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fart Comedy Meets Chick Flick,"Every time I think Hollywood can sink no lower, they do. I guess this film is considered a great ""advance"" in the field, because now these horrendous script writers and directors have shown that the girls can fart, defecate, curse and inflict ""funny"" pain just as well as the boys.When will this idiocracy we live in finally get sick of ""humor"" that would have been considered immature for 12 year old boys as recently as twenty years ago? When was the last time a ""comedy"" was produced in Hollywood that wasn't based exclusively on potty humor and hapless males getting hit in the crotch?Lorne Michaels should be ashamed of himself, for forcing all these monumental no-talents on America. Kristen Wiig is merely the latest in a long series of thoroughly unfunny, untalented, obnoxious ""actors"" like Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, David Spade, Rob Schneider, etc. Big screen comedies basically have been taken over by the pathetic alumni from SNL and the just as sordidly horrific ""talent"" emanating from the stable of Judd Apatow.I wonder if Maya Rudolph-yet another ex-SNL cast member-can appreciate the irony of her appearing in a work of ""art"" like this, considering that she was one of the stars of Idiocracy. Probably not, considering that none of the SNL people seem to have the slightest appreciation of the brilliant satire Mike Judge employed in that film. Instead, they continue to collect hefty paychecks for contributing ever more filth to our decaying cultural landscape.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Bang-A-Rangin' Expedition With A Rendezvous With Comedy!!!,"The title 'Bridesmaids' was a little misleading at first, me and probably everyone else who only heard the title was instantly thinking 'chick flick'. I'd like to make it clear right now, just because a movie has a female cast, that doesn't automatically make it a chick flick (not bashing that sub genre, just clarifying). It was a bit on the rom-com side, but most comedies are. Anyway, once the trailer started and i saw that the brilliance of Apatow and Feig were collaborating, i had to see it. From beginning to end i couldn't stop laughing, the cast was perfect, especially Kristen Wiig. It's as if the jokes were tailored to her comedic style, which is probably due to her involvement in the writing process. What was really great about this movie, which is a large part of any comedy movie being successful, Bridesmaids is infinitely quotable!! (supposed to be all caps, but IMDb told me i couldn't shout hahah but i love shouting!!!!). Seriously, i saw it a few days ago at an advanced screening, and haven't been able to stop talking about it. Instant classic, cant wait to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Women Do Raunch,"The title characters squabble over which one is the best friend of the bride, thereby disrupting the festivities. The film sets out to prove that women can be as raunchy and disgusting as men, as if that's something to be proud of. While it is generally entertaining, much of it feels stale and the laughs are few and far between; perhaps women will find it more funny than men. The film's claim to fame is a scene where the women suffer from food poisoning, but the most amusing scene is the one where Wiig is trying to get the cop's attention by performing a series of illegal stunts in her car. For a comedy of this type, it goes on much too long.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst Movie Ever,"Absurd pathetic women, fart, poop, drunk humor that isn't even funny. It is obvious that there is much improv going on as the characters do not connect at all and some of the conversations between characters don't make much sense or tie to the rest of the film. The gags such as the engagement party toast go on and on and on and completely lose the viewer. In real life, people would get arrested and lose their jobs if they did some of this stuff (especially the cop). The gags end up being annoying rather than funny.I haven't walked out of a movie in decades, but I walked out of this one.

The first 10 minutes of the movie passed and I already wanted to leave. Nonetheless, I stayed, hoping that something drastically funny would occur. Boy was I wrong! After realizing the movie had been playing for an hour, I knew it wasn't going to get funny. I walked out and got my money back (thank goodness). This was a sad attempt at humor. Yes, I realize that everyone's sense of humor is different, but I do not understand how anyone in their right mind could think this movie was even the slightest bit funny. Not only was it not funny, but all of the attempts at ""humor"" were just down right nasty! I'm not prude and some of the jokes made me feel uncomfortable, and I found myself thinking: ""Were the people who wrote this script on crack?"" One of the worst movies I have ever seen.

A cute Comedy movie that could have been a little a better,"Let me start by saying that I adore Rose Byrne, I just think she has grown into a really talented actress, and in Bridesmaid here, she played her role to perfection. I loved her in the Horror movie Insidious released just few months ago, and always been a fan in Damages.Bridesmaids tells the story of Annie, a single middle aged woman struggling with her own life when her best friend Lillian gets engaged and assigns Annie as her maid of honor. Worried about losing her best friend and pressured by leading the bridesmaid, things start to spiral out of control. And to make things worse, she has to compete with Lillian's new friend, the rich and always competitive Helen ( played by none other than Rose Byrne ) who seems to be trying to steal Lillian's friendship.The movie has plenty of laugh out loud moments, very hilarious, funny and at times disgusting scenes. It came out as a real fresh Comedy that I enjoyed most parts of. The characters were lovable, funny and interesting to follow, and the actresses playing them were very good. The problem I found with Bridesmaid was in the editing, it seems it was done in a rush and so appeared choppy and inappropriate. For example, in an early scene when Annie was making a speech, she was holding a wine glass, and in that same scene, the glass is quickly shifted from the right hand to the left hand then back to the right hand. And there were many other editing problems I noticed that I won't go through here, but it was obvious. Also I thought some scenes were a bit ridiculous and too long. The whole movie running time was a bit too long for me as they could have easily cut some unnecessary scenes.In summary, a pretty decent and fresh Comedy with laugh out loud moments and funny characters that falls just short from being great with some ridiculous scenes, it drags a bit and was a bit too long in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Raunchy Chick Flick,"Most chick flick comedies are usually unwanted by many people because of their childish and mostly caricatured humor and their escapist love stories. But when Apatow and Paul Feig tries to save this genre, it's still has its chick flickness but it has a realistic and full of heart storyline. The film has its raunchiness. It's hilarious throughout. Bridesmaids must be the best comedy movie of the year so far, and one of the funniest chick flick comedies ever.First goes to the actors. Kristen Wiig's is a brilliant comedian. Her craziness and charisma really made the show aside from the humor. Maya Rudolph gives a lot of heart to her role. Melissa McCarthy has the best parts and she nearly steals the show. The rest of the cast did a great job to this film.Bridesmaids is not as generic as the other female comedies existing. The story isn't really that original but it portrays in a realistic way. Not quite realistic but it's not an escapist love story where the main girl is perfect human being but a loser. Aside from the love story plot, the parts when she is being jealous to her best friend's new friend. There's mixed emotions and comedy to those scenes. Paul Feig knows how to put humor plus heart perfectly in a comedy film.The humor is written by clever writers even the star of this film. What we expect to this film, it's hilarious throughout. The raunchy humor and some toilet humor mixed with heartfelt emotions and awkwardness. It's (obviously) one of the merits of this film.Most people say this film is like The Hangover but with female cast. The Hangover is more clever but this one is more hilarious and more heart than you expect. The performances plus the hilarious humor, this film is easily one of the funniest female comedies ever although it's unnecessarily long but it's undeniably enjoyable(even if you're a guy).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Time-Pass!,"'Bridesmaids' is a One-Time Watch, that entertains here and there. An engaging & hilarious first-hour, and a sterling central performance by it's lead star Kristen Wiig, are enough to give this recent box-office hit a watch.'Bridesmaids' Synopsis: Picked as her best friend's maid of honor, lovelorn and broke Annie looks to bluff her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals with an oddball group of bridesmaids.A full-on Woman-Flick, 'Bridesmaids' begins wonderfully & offers an engaging & hilarious first-hour. The Screenplay by Annie Mumolo & Kristen Wiig herself, is top-notch in the first-hour. But, in the second-hour, it falters hugely. The Screenplay loses pace and the clichéd moments, disappoint. Though it does pick-up again in it's penultimate moments, the overall impact seems to be missing. How one truly wishes if the writing material, could've been as good in the second-hour, as it was in the first-hour.Paul Feig's Direction is fair. Cinematography is good. Editing is passable. Art Design is perfect. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Kristen Wiig delivers a sterling central performance. The Talented Performer, stands on her own all through. A performance that deserves to honored! Maya Rudolph is first-rate, as usual. Melissa McCarthy is fantastic & brings in a host of good laughs. Rose Byrne is nice.

Who Spoiled Bridesmaids?,"I've had very mixed feelings about this movie from the first time I saw a poster for it in my local theater. On the one hand, I love Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig and I like raunch (like the scenes with John Hamm). OTOH, I hate scenes like the food poisoning scene. So, I wasn't going to go, but one of my husband's cousins (female) said it wasn't that disgusting so my daughter and I went.We liked it, though the disgusting stuff was too much, there was enough funny stuff that the movie almost came together. My daughter tells me that Hangover 1 was less gross than Bridesmaids. I wish people would pay less attention to Judd Apatow.The interesting thing was that most of the audience when we went to see it was women between the ages of 40 and 60 and a few men of about the same age. I figured the audience would have skewed much younger.What made the movie work for me were the scenes like the brilliant staredown between Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne, the generally sweet scenes between Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd (what a cutie!), the scene where Wiig knows she must dump Hamm, and even the scene when she makes the incredible cupcake for herself, during a time when she's swearing to other people that she's no longer baking. And the scenes in the jewelry store - hysterical!I was also happy to see Jill Clayburgh, even if I didn't recognize her at first (she died not long after the film was done).Now, about Meghan - what bugged me about her was that she was written and performed like Rosie O'Donnell. Not all fat women, even not all Irish fat women, act like Rosie. But, I like that Meghan was quite successful and smart on her own, even if she was socially very awkward. I just wish every time someone decides it's OK to show fat people having sex, that food wasn't instantly involved.As a writer and an actress, Kristen Wiig has huge potential. I just hope some guy doesn't ruin her next script. Bridesmaids wasn't ruined, but it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Funny for some, torture for me","I think the most important thing for me to say when I start off my review of Bridesmaids is that it is funny, and I can see why some people love it. I don't love the cheap bathroom humor, and some of the characters are so over-the-top that you have to seriously suspend your disbelief. However, in general, it has some effective comedy that gave me a few chuckles. For me, the best humor came in the light-hearted romantic comedy scenes with Chris O'Dowd. He was a breath of fresh air in a movie that was hard for me to watch. That's the perfect cue to start discussing why I didn't enjoy this movie all that much, despite recognizing its positive qualities. It falls into a genre of film that is notoriously hard for me to stomach. I cannot take movies that introduce a likable protagonist and then spend the bulk of the runtime torturing that poor person.Bridesmaids is like a torture device as I watch Kristen Wiig put through the ringer, and stripped of everything positive in her life. I'm a sympathetic viewer and I can hardly stand watching her reduced to a level that could have easily made her suicidal. Her explosions of rage were warranted and it felt like an infuriating drama that almost made me cry rather than a humorous moment as they intended. Rose Byrne was vile and hard for me to stomach through the entire film, and Maya Rudolph became progressively less relatable as a rift grew between the two main characters. (I won't even talk about how awful Rebel Wilson's schtick was whenever she popped into the film.) Thank goodness Melissa McCarthy was there to lighten the mood. She is constantly funny, and brings levity even in the frustrating times. Between her and O'Dowd, I still managed to get some enjoyment from Bridesmaids, but overall, it was a tough movie for me to stomach.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maiden Voyage,"I should have known. After seeing Ms. Wiig's appearance on ""The Daily Show,"" during which she admitted having to buy and consult a book on ""how to write a screenplay"" prior to creating ""Bridesmaids,"" I still went ahead and shelled out the money for a ticket. And, as I suspected, the movie came off as a less than sure collection of scenes trying desperately to inflate a plot.And don't get me wrong, some of those scenes are hysterical. But this movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and so suffers from the same malaise that afflicts the lead character, Annie: drift.I believe Kristen Wiig has better material in her future. But she's got to move from the neat form of sketch comedy to the more challenging, and longer, form of feature film with her storytelling talents intact.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
BRIDESMAIDS: Scaring Women from Marriage Since 2011,"After we are finished talking about the gross moments, the riotous laughter, and a few knockout performances, there is going to need to be a fair evaluation of this movie. I think it is going to be a good one.There were numerous LOLian moments. The fitting room. The airplane. Air Marshall John. John Hamm. ""Hold On."" And McCarthy and Wiig turn in some magnificent acting and substance. Wiig does a good job harnessing the propulsion of the movie, even when it becomes a flaw. There are large pieces of material that could be edited out, but Wiig still manages to fill the screen with the same lovable awkwardness that audiences have started to appreciate. One of BRIDESMAIDS' best qualities is the ensemble energy. The women work well together (and the unnecessary material should have been swapped for more time with them) and every character has unique energy. This is exactly what makes BRIDESMAIDS crucial as genre evolution. This level of female ensemble acting in contemporary comedy has not been produced to this extent. It's a marvelous group performance and a big step forward.The script is owed a certain due. The use of repetition and stop-start dialogue is commendable, but the silence is what drives BRIDESMAIDS. They seem to know every smart-ass retort, but nothing can stand up to silence when they just have nothing to say. It's used very well. The scene where Ms. Wiig makes and eats a cupcake is one of the most arresting examples of loneliness, loneliness amongst everything, that has been recently seen. In fact, Ms. Wiig crafts herself as a repugnant character, wasteful and constantly waiting for pity. Her jealousy towards the enigmatic Helen is taken much too far (even in the film) and, like Woody Allen writing his own flaws into his own characters, here we see an embarrassing character in need of a Rosebud (baking shop).As the main themes are clearly lined out as ""change v. same,"" we never end up seeing a title bout. There are some apologies and everybody gets to the wedding. But will they be any better off when the sequel comes out? Will Helen still be the clueless self-righteous turd that she is? Will Annie be baking? and not being the most subtly evil twirp that she was here? Maybe we will find out.Until then, enjoy something very close to Judd Apatow. Enjoy some truly unique comedy coming from a great gaggle of females. And Enjoy seeing girls be girls, cycling through dismay and distaste.63.232",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Disappointed,Well if your a guy this is just another Chick flick just like all the others. Its watchable I Guess but there's nothing really funny about it. Some people compare it to the Hangover but with chicks and its not even close.What Disappointed me is that right when I thought the movie was going to get Good. It just went back to the same boring chick flick stuff. It stays the same the entire movie. The movie didn't even have a climax or a resolution. I don't know just really bad writing. A Stale chick flick.Anyways I mean what do you expect its clearly a run of the mill chick flick. A lot of critics point it out being funny even for guys. But I Don't know my girlfriend is really into chick flicks and even at the end of it she said it really wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.I give it a 6 because maybe its acceptable for females.

Better in the second half,"In this Hollywood comedy, an unstable woman is asked to be the maid of honour at her friend's wedding. She has a rivalry with a new friend of the bride who is also one of the bridesmaids and happens to have loads of money.I usually avoid Hollywood summer comedies but this one seemed have earned more praise than usual. As the main characters are female (unlike more than 99% of Hollywood films of the time), I thought this one would not have the vulgar, toilet humour that the ""guy"" films have. The first half of this film proved me very wrong on that count. Many of the early scenes were over the top though I got a great laugh at one woman lamenting the ""messiness"" of having three pubescent sons.The second half proves better. It keeps the lightness but has some warmth for the characters - even one who is unlikeable in the beginning.

Bridesmaids,"Marriage doesn't have to end a friendship, but there will be adjustments. And who would've thunk, a band of bridesmaids could be so engaging? Only in Milwaukee. While prepping for a friend's wedding (Rudolph), a bridesmaid (Wiig), one unexpectedly passed over for the top spot (Byrne), finds her own life in disarray: a bakery dream gone bust, habit in casual sex turned tiresome (Hamm), mean, moronic roommates (Lucas Wilson) and her car takes a hit she can't afford. Then Annie catches a break, meeting two people she probably doesn't deserve, a kindly cop (O'Dowd) and co-maid (McCarthy) with ""security clearance"" who slaps some sense into Miss Walker, literally.Though not officially a remake of The Women (56 08), the similarities with MGM's 39 classic should confer upon it honorary inclusion as marriage & mostly dames are its motif, subject husband (to be) nearly unseen, in-fighting amongst the girls is raucous and the ending, well, let's just say, it's ""the, uh, stuff that dreams are made of (Wilson Phillips)."" Lotsa zany lines (""There's a colonial woman on the wing, churning butter!"") & packed tighter on funny bits than a Focker carry-on, including a 'pity party' when we discover Megan's a missle expert, gown fitting that makes all others 'pale' in comparison, a flight that teaches never mix barbs & booze, bridal shower where we witness the murder of a cookie after learning why bleach is the ultimate hygene, and a visit to Helen's home, she with a face that could launch 1000 Harley Davidsons but now parent to the ugliest step brats you'll ever see.Running just over 2 hrs but not feeling nearly that long (good sign), Bridesmaids was directed by Paul Feig with co-writing credits to Kristen & Annie Mumolo who plays the fearful flyer (""Just toss it back"").

Good without being great... But it DID pass my 'Six Laughs Test'...,"Very well made and yes, it did pass the 'six laugh test' – If a comedy doesn't get more than six laughs from me it ain't no comedy! As for performances, well, everyone was very good; Kristen Wiig as Annie Walker, Maya Rudolph as Lillian and Rose Byrne as Helen all did great jobs. I loved Melissa McCarthy as Megan, she really made me laugh and (of course) Chris O'Dowd as Rhodes; I know him from the TV show 'The IT Crowd' here in the UK. Also worthy of note were; Rebel Wilson as Brynn, Matt Lucas as Gil, Wendi McLendon-Covey as Rita and Ellie Kemper as Becca. Oh, and look out for Jon Hamm (uncredited) as Ted.A story about popularity, friendship, love, relationships all kinds of stuff really; I was kind of struggling to keep up by the end! There is a trend in comedies (of late) of putting people in awkward, uncomfortable, often embarrassing situations and I must say I'm afraid don't find it funny. You are made to care about a particular character and then laugh at them as they squirm in an uncomfortable situation. Sorry people, it just doesn't do anything for me. As far as this film goes, yes there were some of those moments, but there were also some truly comic moments, mostly supplied by the wonderful Melissa McCarthy, it has to be said; although Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd did raise a titter or two. The surprise for me though, was the performance of Rose Byrne, she did really well in a genre I wouldn't particularly associate with her. Over all, I must say, despite a couple of misgivings, I did enjoy this film a lot more than I expected to Recommended.My score: 7.1/10IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 93,096 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 75/100: (Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 232 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 'Liked It' (based on 87,373 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

But it got SO much positive hype, Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars (and I usually agree with him), I really like Melissa McCarthy in Mike and Molly, and it even snagged a few major award nominations(!), so I thought I'd give it a go.The subject matter (sleeping around, dysfunctional marriages, and emotional insecurity) was aimed at adults, while the humor (stupidity, farting, vomiting, defecating, fat ""jokes"", and getting drunk) was aimed at 7 year old boys! There wasn't one female character I could relate to or feel sympathetic toward. I didn't laugh once, and so much of it was truly painful to watch.

This will be a classic!!!,"I thought the acting was outstanding, the writing was superb - funniest movie I've seen in a long time. My husband and I both thought it was hilarious and both consider it a 10. The whole theater was laughing their @#&!&% off!!! There really wasn't a weak link in the acting and the movie never slowed down. It just kept going and going with the laughs. I guarantee this will be a classic for future brides, best friends, and all others that need a laugh. Melissa McCarthy was outstanding. Aside from Kristen Wiig, she made the movie. Everyone's role fit them perfectly and they didn't leave it with a weak ending. It was funny to the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"BridesMaids - Crude, whacky but entertaining","Kristen Wig's Bridesmates impresses with whacky incidents and uncommon characters making each scene worthy to watch making you laugh hard. The novelty of the universal theme of jealousy-friendship triangle is conveyed very well on screen. Due to that, it becomes very easily relatable to watch right from the first act of the film.The big ensemble of cast, notably Kristen and Melissa impress with splendid performances.The dialogues are crisp, funny but crude to a great extent but eventually works at most instances. However the crude exhaustive conversations at some scenes could stand out to be quite odd. At the downside the last act becomes shockingly cliché and ends like a typical chick flick.But In overall a great entertaining, stress reliever.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I laughed, I laughed and I laughed some more","I'm not exactly sure who the people are who are giving this movie a poor rating, but I can only assume they either have some malicious intent or went into the movie with presumptions based solely off the name. That or they just don't have a sense of humor and should probably be experimented on by the German's (South Park reference... you'd have to have seen it ) This movie is FUN. From start to finish, fun. It's a laugh a minute comedy usually reserved for an all-male cast but delivered masterfully by an all-female cast. It's defiantly not just for the ladies, men will love this movie as well. In a world full of comedy releases like ""The Dilemma"" and ""Gullivers Travels"", Bridesmaids is a breath of fresh air and reminds us that some producers (and directors.. and writers) still care about the craft of comedy writing and take the time to make their scrip ""work"". They even had the time to add some heart... for the ladies, I presume.Go see Bridesmaids.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really good!,"A genuinely funny comedy that can be a little conventional, but it definitely worth a watch.The focusing on a unique group of women- each allowing for some great comedy- which works really well together. Usually it would be over the top or dull, but it just works here. Furthermore, the plot is not very conventional; there were certain plot points I thought they would hit but they broke away from quite a few. However, they still stick to some convetions and sometimes don't really expand upon them.Some of the cinematography and editing is not very experimental. It doesn't try too much in this regard, but sometimes that can be good for a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Mixed Bag, but More Good than Not","At times ridiculously funny, but other times severally frustrating, Bridesmaids suffers most from trying to do to many things at once. In my experience watching this film, I had truly never seen a comedy that confused my emotions so much like this one. It's as if 2 people took turns writing every other scene and put it all together into one mesh of a film. At times, Bridesmaids can be a brilliant dramedy, providing some very sweet and touching moments, and some truly outrageously funny gags. At other times, the film can be extremely painful to watch, whether it's from the awkward funny gags, cliched writing, or it trying to force it all at once, the film can't ever seem to truly find its footing. However, in the grand scheme of things, I would say there is more positive than negative in the film, and though there was certainly many steps in making it, Bridesmaids at times can be a pretty good film. As for the acting, Melissa McCarthy steals the show in every scene she takes a part of, truly deserving the best supporting actress nomination at the actors, and showing how to write a character as eccentric as herself. Other good performances include Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd, and at times Kristen Wiig. In the end, Bridesmaids is a bit of a mixed bag. Its tonal shifts are unappreciated, and its humor, when it isn't trying too hard, can be brilliant. It may be confusing to the senses to sit all the way through, but there are plenty of good gags to bring you to the end of the film, even if the journey makes you frustrated as Wiig's character throughout.My Rating: 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable,"""Matrimony: Unbelievably Believable"" Director Paul Feig and Producer Judd Apatow have successfully created a romantic comedy that breaks through the usual limitations and rules of the genre. Bridesmaids proves that women can be as raunchy as men releasing the ridiculous upon audiences in original fashion backed by heart. Kristen Wiig has finally proved that she is much more than the goof seen on Saturday Night Live jumping to the top of the comedy genre brining the buddy comedy to the feminine arena. Wiig stars as a thirty-something year old women named Annie whose life is headed on a downward spiral. Her roommates are impossible to live with, her job sucks and her love life is nonexistent except for meaningless sexual escapades with a man named Ted (Jon Hamm, The Town). To top it off her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph, Away We Go) puts things into perspective when telling Annie she is getting married. On the bright side, Lillian has chosen Annie to be her Maid of Honor giving Annie something worth working for. Annie's excitement doesn't last long as she meets Lillian's diverse bridesmaids choices, Megan (Melissa McCarthy, CBS's Mike and Molly ), Becca (Ellie Kemper, NBC's The Office), and Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey, Reno 911!: Miami) along with Helen (Rose Byrne, Get Him to the Greek) who uses her wealth and power to takeover as Maif of Honor. Annie has hit bottom and with the support of a police officer named Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd, Gulliver's Travels) and the antics of female relationships, she embarks on a hilarious yet meaningful journey to rediscover herself.Bridesmaids differentiates itself from the rom-com stereotype with the clever cliché-free scriptwriting of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo. No matter how outrageous the jokes become, they are smart, fun and unbelievably believable. Consequently, the film controls the outrage allowing the humor to improve the story and support the almost perfect Apatow cast. For example, Melissa McCarthy acts like a complete idiot racking up the laughs giving male raunch a run for its money. However, the stand out performance and the best performance of an actress this year so far comes from Kristen Wiig's multidimensional melding of comedy and drama.How do you complain about a movie as unique as Bridesmaids? Well first audiences expecting to see a chick flick have no idea what they are getting themselves into and if they cannot take the raunch it is going to be a painful two hours. Also, while the film is titled Bridesmaids, viewers may expect a story based around more than one woman, when in actuality it is not. Even so, the only real problem with the film is its song and dance happy ending, undermining what could have been a great finale.Comedies bordering the two-hour mark usually have a hard time engrossing the audience as the jokes run thin and the drama ensues, however, Bridesmaids' comedy becomes smarter and smarter giving each of the bridesmaids a matrimonial purpose in Wiig's fasttrack to the A-List.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Watch it for Wiig, I didn't find anything else worth watching here.","Reviewed February 2012In some ways it reminds me of 40 Year Old Virgin for it's over the top gags, realistic and affecting emotions and an excellently written and performed central character. Through the movie, you laugh, you cringe and you connect. But sadly, by the end of it - you don't care.Annie (Kristen Wiig) couldn't get her life together be it her love life or her professional. Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is Annie's best friend from childhood who is about to get married and she chooses Annie as the Maid of Honor. Though Annie has the best intentions, everything she plans and tries backfires with some help from the other bridesmaids led by Helen (Rose Byrne) and she loses it at some point which leads to her getting fired. While the entire engagement to marriage episode is panning out, she meets a lonely patrol officer Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) who guides her to sanctity.It is Kirsten Wiig's show from start to end. I became an instant admirer from her role in Paul and she shot through to the top with this. Few women possess the comic timing like hers and an ability to be cute and awkward at the same time which is so required for these roles. Apart from Wiig and a little from Byrne, by the end I cannot say I have enjoyed it as much as other Apatow's treats.Watch it for Wiig, I didn't find anything else excellent here.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst movie ever!,"The only redeeming parts of this movie were the ones without the other women! A couple of scenes with Kristen Wiig alone were sweet - the ones that weren't attempting to be funny. But as it's marketed as a comedy for and about women and as that it is a massive failure. Does anyone in this generation have the ability to tell a story without attempting to make jokes out of masturbation and bodily functions? This was supposed to be a comedy for women, not 12 year old boys. It takes real skill and a real story to make those things truly funny and not just lame and sad.

"Poor acting, filthy, predicable and boring – basically a poorly made female hangover","Last week I was blackmailed into sitting through this chick flick which I'd heard (from guys and girls I thought I trusted) was ""hilarious"", but the fact that the opening scene almost made me hurl my face off, paved the way for yet another predictably awful cinema experience. I sat through the movie secretly making notes on my Android, got home, sat down to write this review and thought ""where do I start?"" and that's when I realised, ""when suddenly it becomes difficult to write a review on a movie I hated, I know I've hit an all time favourite"" (or not, as it may seem).The story basically follows a bride and her bridesmaids as they try and make it from engagement to marriage and for one reason or another ""things don't pan out the way you'd expect"" (but actually they do). Refreshingly though, the bride is not protagonist of this movie its one of her bridesmaids; personally I'm bored to death of watching bridezillas! The trailers do a good job making this squashed bike wreck look funny – I smile even now as I watch it again – oops – but believe me when I say those are the only funny moments in the movie.There's an uncomfortable silent-but-violent odour of ""the hangover"" all the way through the movie, the character profiles are roughly the same (the frustrated married one, the sensible one, the crazy one and the weird permed one) but throw in rich-lonely-bimbo and closet lesbian and you basically have 99% of womanhood represented in the movie. The other hangover whiffs are: the (wannabe) Vegas hen do, stolen puppies' v stolen baby, missing bride v missing groom.The acting came across more forced and scripted than an apology from Bart Simpson; most of the humour (ironically) is toilet humour and why oh why is there some limp, flaccid love story in mix? (Oh yeah, it's a chick flick). Again, maybe this is a girl thing, but I didn't understand anything the women said, I felt like I was watching a schizophrenic have a conversation with a pinball machine (maybe my man-brain just switched off as soon as I heard what I thought were women nagging). Why did Matt Lucas humiliate himself doing this gibberish? What was wrong with Chris O'Dowd's American/Irish accent? Was he meant to sound like bipolar, devil possessed Emily Rose with a speech impediment? By far the worst scene in the movie was the speech scene, I was cringing so hard I think I think my Buccinator (the muscle that makes you smile) went into spasm. The best scene in the movie was the street poo scene – again, ironic how toilet humour (ie man humour) got the theatre erupting.Finally, Melissa McCarthy was brilliant! Although her character was obviously a rip off of Alan from ""the Hangover"" she played it convincingly and naturally, it's no wonder she is doing great professionally (check out Mike & Molly and we all know she's in Gilmore Girls too). I personally prefer classy, sweet women, so the filthy innuendoes didn't impress me but all in all she's the only thing that makes the movie bearable. Ultimately, I'm an open minded guy ergo most chick flicks I wouldn't actively avoid watching, but this is the clear exception.p.s. I didn't even talk about the dumb British girl, endless woo girls, Rastafarian Father of the bride (huh?) and the Porsche guy (double huh?)...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Is this feminism,"This film has reached big audiences in the US and has also been commented on the newspaper's culture sections. Another kind of girl movie, it has been said.But the difference is maybe just the fact that the women here are doing the same things as guys have in just too many movies. There are the common stereotypes. The girls who have known each other since childhood, the disgusting and mean rich bitch, the overweight woman who anyway is ""a real person"". They get food-poisoned, drunk and have conflicts. You've seen it before, but that was about guys.Certainly there are funny scenes and Kristen Wiig is very good including much warmth.

There are a lot of American comedies that I find less than amusing nowadays and which seem to be focused on teenage boys and their bodily functions, but this female version really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. (Thank God for the Coen brothers! And for writers who understand that good comedy uses humour, subtlety, satire and wit rather than a sledgehammer to get a point across!) This film sets out to shock and that is, in fact, the only area in which it succeeds.The women in it are (mostly) so awful that if you were a guy you'd choose to be gay, and as a woman you would choose to elope!

The food poisoning scene was just stupid and gross and not very funny. I thought the Megan character was pretty funny...but on further reflection, only marginally.

Chick Flick Made Palpable for Men by Using Raunchy Humor,"Annie (Kristen Wiig), a down-and-out woman who's lost her business and boyfriend, is invited to be her childhood friend's (Lillian, played by Maya Rudolph) Maid of Honor. Coordinating the wedding is the insanely rich and pretentious wife of the bride's husband's boss, Helen (Rose Byrne), who from the get-go, tirelessly competes for Lillian's attention. In the mix are Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a housewife who is desperate to escape the confines of suburbia, Becca (Ellie Kemper), a clueless newlywed, and Megan (Melissa McCarthy), the groom's crass sister. The subtle rivalry between Annie and Helen eventually backfires on the both of them and it's up to the two adversaries to put aside their differences in order to save the big day.One of the more hyped-up movies of 2011, Bridesmaids is marketed as a raunchy, female version of The Hangover, which is understandable but unnecessarily deceiving. The only correlation between the two is an impending marriage. This is less about the bridesmaids and more about about its central character, Annie, a self-loathing, loveless character who projects her negative attitude on to anyone who has the misfortune to cross paths with her. They include customers in the jewelry store she works at, Nathan (Chris O'Dowd), the baby-faced cop she ends up romancing, and her own best friend. At times, Annie is difficult to empathize with because she's such a destructive force. She's so intent on sabotaging herself that she loses her job and drives away a man who only wants to see her succeed and be happy.You may not realize it right away but Bridesmaids is a chick flick that's been made palpable for men with some raunchy (though implied) humor and the really funny comedic relief of Melissa McCarthy. Kristen Wiig shows quite a bit of restraint, to the point where I wondered if this is the same ham of Saturday Night Live fame. I was disappointed, especially during the airplane scene, which was her moment to shine. It seemed like such a wasted opportunity, both for Wiig and her fans. Whether this was her choice or the director's, I don't know. McLendon- Covey and Kemper receive limited screen time, as does John Hamm, who plays Wiig's boorish, inconsiderate 'fuck buddy'.Besides McCarthy, O'Dowd and Byrne deserve pats on the backs for their performances. O'Dowd may seem out of place with his Irish accent but he manages to infuse some much needed positive energy. He's silly and lovable with amusing observations about life and his law enforcement profession. My favorite was the quip about the ugly carrot in every bag (and I just ate it). Byrne as the gorgeous, impeccably groomed trophy wife was perfectly cast, as well.The film clocks in at two hours and five minutes, thanks to jokes getting stretched well past their expiration. I like Kristen Wiig but her writing, especially the dialog, doesn't always gel. Sometimes, it's obvious a scene exists solely to showcase herself as 'the emerging female comedian' yet she never fully satisfies. Other times, the banter between characters is so unrealistic and outrageous that it's no longer humorous but outright awkward to watch. I squirmed more during the jewelry store scenes than I did during the much talked about diarrhea outbreak. Kristen Wiig is no Tina Fey but I don't hold that against her.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very funny female comedy,"Kristen Wiig is without a doubt one of the best members of the Saturday Night Live cast. She's had some moderate success in movies so far with supporting roles in Paul, Whip It, and a very small role in the comedy Date Night. I've been wanting to see her get a starring role for quite sometime now, but does it end up being good or not? In Bridesmaids, Annie (Kristen Wiig) is picked to be the maid of honor by her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Annie and Lillian have been best friends since they were young and Annie, getting to be her best friends maid of honor, should be lots of fun and a time to make some great memories right? Wrong. Once Annie gets introduced to another member of the bridal party Helen (Rose Byrne), all hell breaks loose between them. We get the two of them bickering throughout the majority of the movie and trying to one up each other to show Lillian how much better they are than one another. Along for the ride is the rest of the bridal party played by the likes of Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper from The Office, and Melissa McCarthy, who ends up stealing the entire movie.There is also a subplot involving Annie and a police officer played by Chris O'Dowd. While a few of the scenes between them feel unnecessary, O'Dowd comes off as sweet and funny in the nice guy role. Another subplot involves Mad Men's Jon Hamm but he feels underused and surprisingly isn't very funny in his role. One problem that I have with this movie is the back and forth with Wiig and Byrne. While both women are good in their roles the scenes where they try to one up each other just come off as annoying and make their characters, especially Bryne's, unlikeable.All in all, the movie ends up being quite hilarious overall. Wiig shows that she can be a leading lady in a comedy. Maya Rudolph continues to show off her comedic chops time and time again and we get a breakout star in Melissa McCarthy.Other than a scene involving gross-out humor the movie is a funny, raunchy, and sometimes sweet comedy that pretty much all women, and even a good bit of men are sure, to enjoy.Rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Refreshing...,"OK, so the idea that this is the female 'hangover' is not entirely the comparison to draw, but in many ways i can see why its said.What i like most about this film is it has seemingly drawn inspiration from a film like the hangover but has not just tried to make the same story with a female cast.For a start when you are working with ladies as the main characters the extreme comedy and gross out areas don't bring the same comedy value. Where comedy born out of misfortune requires you to love the character but also not care enough about them so as to find it funny when they fail in some way, its harder to strike that balance with a female without either making them too adorable or making them too bitchy. Its sort of sexist as a point but there really are one rule for one and one for another. For example, a guy gets a beat down from a girl in a scene and done right can bring a laugh. Can you imagine trying to pull a laugh from a guy beating on a woman? Ain't going to happen nor should it.I like that this film took a foundation with a feminine touch and obvious chick flick markers and then added to it genuine comedy moments that didn't rely on the gender of the character to emphasise the scene.It was good to not simply have a whiney tale of girl power, it showed that these were women who knew their own mind, had their own problems and made their own mistakes.I liked also how the character who was played for slapstick value in megan (very much initially in the Zach Galifianakis role as the odd ball future in law) didn't just stay as this freaky peripheral player but steps up to instill some much needed tough love and give an insight into the fact that her character is actually a very successful woman in her career... emphasising as ever that you don't judge a book by its cover.Overall the film paced perfectly with only a few noticeable exceptions where they felt a need to leave us wallowing along with the lead character a few too many times (taking a sledgehammer to a walnut, we already sympathised with her and liked her after the early scenes, it didn't need further pity plays), and it left us on a satisfactory conclusion.I would hope this film doesn't try and dip in for a sequel, as i cant see a great scope for one and will be simply a cash cow that will take the shine of the original film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweetest confection, a comedy binge","Wow, I'm left having to seriously question my gender after I so much enjoyed watching this comedic tour de force. On a second viewing too I was again crying tears of joy and empathy for the company of girls who pull this off so well. The writing is perfect, and the gross-out slapstick and wisecracks traditionally given to a bunch of dudes are doubly enhanced delivered by this feminine ensemble. Men are very peripheral here - the only more fully-drawn featured fella has to mostly remain on the stage margins. However Chris O'Dowd is perfect as the chatty, selfless but not creepy match for poor Annie. They have such a lovely no frills off-beat romance. This contrasts with the elaborate wedding the movie might appear to be about but of course is not. One cant but wonder if Annie has learned never even to entertain the idea of wedding in the future i.e. on the day she she bags her knight in shining armor. Is this movie devaluing weddings? A bit. Pehaps it's just life events challenge us all and we find ourselves viewing the wedding from Annie's perspective: essentially a loss of a friend with one's youthful hopes & dreams given away to a bland indefinite future. The downward spiraling situation of Annie's played by the waifish Kirsten Wiig serves as the central comedy fulcrum. Her friends are unable to pull her out as she stumbles around and observes so recklessly various absurd truths. She fights a lonely battle trying to stop her friend's wedding becoming a charade masterminded by loathsome Helen Harris the Third. But there's a naive lack of cynicism and mutual high regard in the air so that by the end, miraculously the value of the titular wedding has not been completely undermined, just a little though, quietly upstaged by Annie's unconventional romance. There's numerous mad and funny characters throughout like weird lodger Brynn played by Rebel Wilson. Ultimately it's the cogent story that has the touch of Jane Austin about it, the great bits of dialogue and the star-quality acting that distinguishes this film as top class.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny with Flaws in the Story,"Bridesmaids is a funny movie with likeable, but not reasonable character journeys.The story is enjoyable, but predictable. The same could be said about the character arcs. They were fairly predictable, with one exception. I thought she was going to be blamed for everything, but instead she had a redemption. My favourite character is Megan, who's hilarious the story of her is also very funny.The cinematography was good, there were a few beautiful shots, the editing was great, the pacing was perfect. The production design was great, especially in the wedding scenes.Even though the film is enjoyable, it has flaws. The character arcs are mostly predictable and not well-written.Braidsmaids is a fun watch and an enjoyable with fun characters, but nothing extraordinary.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very funny film and good script.,I thought this movie is very funny and well written.I like Kristen Wiig but sometimes on SNL I think she misses the mark but this movie she co-wrote and stared in is a home run.We laughed through out the whole movie and the crowd in the theater reacted the same way. The rest of the cast was also very good.For a comedy this also had a good storyline and plot with some substance other than slapstick.I would recommend this movie it is what we need in this day and age we are living in.Bravo I hope we see more of this from these women in the near future.I hope it does well at the box office!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Low Humor, Cheap Poop & Fat Jokes","I finally saw this movie after years of it being on my list and it was a big disappointment. Unlikable characters, extremely non-funny ""improv-style humor"", that tries to lift a boring script up with talented comedians to find funny in the moment. What is written is jokes that are basically what college kids would come up with while getting drunk after da club.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
this film sucks!!,"In my entire life I haven't been so much annoyed and irritated by a movie! Needless to say, my girlfriend and I walked out after 1 hour (the whole movie is about 2 hours long!) This movie is literally fart-poop-vomit ''comedy"" with no plot, poor acting, and no point at all. After one hour (with constantly getting worse over time) this movie reached the point in which bridesmaids are vomiting in close shots all over the place and over each other in the fancy bridal shop!! What can I say? At that point I took it as an insult to the audience, who has been so shamefully cheated by the trailers and false marketing to buy the tickets for a ''romantic comedy"". Instead, we got this disgusting and terrible movie which is a total waste of money and time and an insult to the common sense, after all. As another reviewer said: giving this movie 1 out of 10 can be considered generous!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Miserable, depressing movie",I can't believe that this is what passes for comedy nowadays. This is a depressing story of a girl who hits rock bottom and keeps falling. And falling. And falling. And just when you think it can't get any more miserable or depressing it does. It just drags and drags in a joyless manner the majority of the time. There are maybe two laughs the whole time and the rest of the movie you're cringing at the ridiculous things the main character does and the stupid way she ruins all the good things in her life. The only thing that's actually funny is the fat girl. Overall I think only sadistic people could enjoy this movie. Just don't see it if you don't want to see people getting diarrhea in their bridesmaid's dress.,,Anonymous,Romance
A lot of laughs,"For everyone whose life has hit rock bottom, or so they thought, we have Annie (played by Kristen Wiig). Working as a jewelry store clerk after suffering a massive business failure and living with two very, to say the least, eccentric fraternal twins despite being chronically late with the rent. Meanwhile, Lillian her best friend (played by Maya Rudolph) is engaged and to a man she's deeply in love with who makes a great living. And as her beast friend, Lillian enlists Annie to act as her maid of honor at her wedding. It's at the engagement party where Annie first meets Helen Harris (Rose Byrne). Helen's husband employs Lillian's fiancée and has become strangely close to her as a result.The other bridesmaids provide little more than comic relief while Helen, who plans on the order of a Martha Stewart clone on steroids, is the antagonist as she seems intent on usurping Annie's role as maid of honor and Lillian's best friend which, given Lillian's impending change of address, appears to be a position that will be vacant soon enough. During all this, Annie's romantic life is complicated by a waning entanglement with a man whose interest in her is mainly physical and a relationship with kind and respectful police officer whom she met thanks to a long-broken taillight.The story isn't all that interesting and the fact that only the audience sees things from Annie's point if view is near infuriating, in my opinion. That said, Wiig, Rudolph, Byrne and company are hilarious as the events depicted, though some seem meant to make the viewers cringe or test their gag reflex which runs counter to my personal taste. Funny, entertaining, and that's about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I was standing in the queue for the ticket and I was thinking, am I the only guy around here?

Awful!,"Could have been a cute movie, but went over the top with foul, crude and offensive language. The humor is sophomoric and seems like a movie that was written by Beavis and Butthead. The language is over the top foul. The behavior and reactions of characters is not believable, they get stuck in a scene and didn't know when enough is enough. This is not a movie that would appeal to most adults unless they have a very low IQ or the maturity of a 14 year old boy. It had a good premise with possibilities, but they decided to go to the gutter with it. I would not recommend letting children watch this movie and wouldn't really even want my teen to watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most laughs of any film in recent memory,"I can't say enough good things about this film. My wife and I were laughing out loud almost continuously throughout the entire film. I never realized from Saturday Night Live what an enormous talent Kristen Wiig is.The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, and Chris O'Dowd. The supporting actress who really stole a lot of our attention was Melissa McCarthy (Molly from TV's Mike and Molly). Her performance was completely uninhibited and frequently, fall in the aisle, hilarious. However, the scene outside the bridal shop with Maya Rudolph will be the one you will long remember after the movie is over.This is not a chick flick although it does star very talented women and the men, except of Chris O'Dowd, are mostly secondary. If this film is not an enormous hit, it will be because of men who refuse to see it. For those men who can enjoy a movie that doesn't include over the top action, you will be rewarded for seeing this film.My wife and I enjoyed Hangover very much and this film will be compared to it. Some time has past since we saw it so it may be unfair to compare it with this film that is so clear in our minds. However, we both think this movie is even better than Hangover. If you're not a prude, we strongly recommend you seeing this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Carrots at dawn,"Whatever else ""Four weddings"" achieved, it certainly spawned an awful lot of comic wedding movies. This is not perfect but it is one of the better ones, with generally good quality dialogue, and some committed acting by the protagonists. It's also strongly influenced by the films which get all their laughs from bodily functions and swear words. Kristen Wiig, the star, wrote it herself with help from Annie Mumolo (who puts in an appearance in the airplane sequence).Annie (Wiig) is to be one of several bridesmaids at her best friend Lillian's wedding (Maya Rudolph). Clever, arty Annie is fully expecting that she will play a major role in proceedings – choosing (or possibly making) the dresses, organising the bridal shower (what we in the UK would call the Hen Party), etc. However, Annie is increasingly sidelined by well-heeled bitchy snob Helen (the brilliant Rose Byrne), who manages to upstage her efforts at every turn. To make matters worse, all the other bridesmaids seem to prefer Helen's spectacular but somewhat derivative ideas to those of Annie.Annie also has personal issues. She has lost all her money in a cake-making venture, she has no boyfriend and no prospects, she lives in an apartment with a monstrous couple of siblings (Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson). Her 40-something life is going nowhere. On the plus side she has a one-night stand with Rhodes, a nice Irish policeman (Chris O'Dowd off ""The IT crowd""). She then ruins it by walking out on him while he is trying to persuade her to take up her cake-making again; despite the fact that they are clearly made for each other. She loses her job at a jewelry store after a hilarious exchange with a customer involving the C-word, and ends up going back to her mother (the great Jill Clayburgh). Meanwhile the preparations for the wedding are getting more manic and over-the-top.After a number of wacky incidents, this being a comedy, we know everything will get sorted out. There are some genuinely touching and surprising moments, as well as some which fall a bit flat (I wasn't overly impressed by the airplane sequence to be honest).A special mention goes to Melissa McCarthy as Megan, whose larger-than-life antics threaten to steal the show a couple of times. Despite some irritating mannerisms, Annie has wit and charm, and we want her to be happy. There seems to be ""chemistry"" between Wiig and O'Dowd. The film has some really funny moments, and some quite romantic ones. Anyway, I liked the film enough to watch it twice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolute Dross,"Bridesmaids2:10 mins of teeth itching drivel. I enjoy a good comedy i really do. this wasn't one it was desperate, obvious and weak. So much talent in this film to many really talented comedy actors and actresses and yet it was an effort to sit through it. Cheap Cheap jokes, vomit, pooh and schoolgirl competitiveness. Worst comedy since the mister Magoo film, Scooby doo or Dennis the Mennis. Baring in mind that they were all rubbish children's films. What irks me is all of the review on IMDb and all of the adverts that lead me to download this dross EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE RUBBISH!!!!What I don't understand is how it rated so high on IMDb if i could give it a negative number is would and it would be in the high double figures.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as funny as people are making it out to be,"I have seen funny comedy based films centered around women and this is not one of them. I might be the odd ball in the bunch, but this movie is not as funny or entertaining like people have been putting it to be.I can count only one scene that grabbed a few jiggles out of me, but the film as a whole, it does not deliver enough comedy to keep me entertained. There are too many dry un funny moments that made me not want to watch this any more. They created this film to become the female version of the Hangover and it never quite accomplishes its goal. I just not a firm believer that woman are not funny enough to carry a whole film by their self and to appeal to every person out there. Yes a few films will grab the attention of most females and some men, but appealing to the masses, I just don't think women comedy movies can do that. Chesley Handler and Ellen are about the only women I have seen enough of that can trigger laughter out of me and neither one of them were in this movie, so I wasn't laughin much during the film. This movie lost me in the first 30 minutes and I just punished myself to sit through the rest. It took forever for the movie to stir up some drama to actually punchier my brain for some entertainment. There spare ha ha moments, but nothing that causes great laughter. The women in this film try to hard be funny instead of being naturally funny and it shows on camera. They just become annoying instead of funny. This movie plays out like a two hour long SNL skit presented by Kristen Wiig and her bunch of humorousness friends. Kristen Wiig is funny to watch in some films, but never quite holds her own in a film centered around her. The plot of the movie was a good one, but the lack there of comedy and running time are the downfall and really kills the vibe of the movie. I guess I'm not the intended demographic for this movie, but I just felt like there was nothing worthwhile going on. I have seen a female wedding themed movie before , Bride Wars, and enjoyed it a lot more than this film and they sold the concept better than this movie. A lot of the jokes go on tremendously long and get annoyingly awkward. This is one of the only films that has been positively review during this summer and I for one feel the complete opposite of the critics and feel this is a huge let down.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Girls Just Want To Have Fun, Too","Throughout the years, gross-out comedies would revolve around groups of guys (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"", ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""The Hangover"" and now ""The Hangover 2,"" which I have no intention on seeing since I didn't like the first ""Hangover,"" ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" and ""Dinner for Schmucks,"" from more recent years) or just one girl who is the object of desire of many guys (""There's Something About Mary""). But now, there is a twist. The girls are the protagonists of gross-out.Raunchmeister Judd Apatow is the producer. Paul Feig is the director. They treated the ladies the same way men would get treated in gross out movies. The ladies would drink, cuss, tear each other apart, and would have so much fun doing all that.""Saturday Night Live"" alum Kristen Wiig is the star of the movie. She is Annie, a young woman whose life is on the rocks when her best childhood girlfriend Lillian (fellow SNL alum Maya Rudolph) asks her to be the maid of honor at her upcoming wedding. Her love life is not so lovely and she lost two jobs. She beds one man, but has the eye for a police officer who continually runs into her on the streets and everywhere else. Complications come when there are four other bridesmaids on the scene, and all of them duke it out.Expectedly, the best work comes from heavyset actress Melissa McCarthy as the tough as nails Megan, the sister of the groom. There is always that principle where the least attractive actor/actress becomes the most attractive when they get the best and funniest lines, steals the show from everyone else, and no one else can be as funny or clever, not even the leads. Surely enough, the filmmakers are doing her a favor where beauty is only skin deep, and they are right. The other three ""beautiful"" bridesmaids are Rose Byrne as Helen, who becomes a fierce rival for Lillian as the matron of honor as she is the trophy wife of the groom's boss, Wendy McLendon-Covey as the tall blonde Rita, an aggressive foul-mouthed stepmother of equally foul-mouthed children, and Ellie Kemper as Becca, the most sensitive bridesmaid who is newly married and feels the sorriest for Annie because she is still single. Lesson to be learned: Never take your beauty for granted. You can be sexy because of your brain.There are numerous gross out gags that pop up and keep you laughing out loud. But there is a lot of heart as well so we won't think it's just another rambunctious comedy. Due to Jill Clayburgh's recent death, her presence is the most bittersweet. She did have very funny lines as Annie's lustful mother, although she looked wan and weak. It was nice to have a funny comedy be her swan song for her distinguished and respectable career.Have a great time and laugh. Bring all your friends to see ""Bridemaids"" and you'll be glad you did.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hold On,"Greetings again from the darkness. Kristen Wiig is everywhere these days. If you don't know the name, you certainly know her face. She is credited with 26 projects since 2009 - and that doesn't even count her weekly work on Saturday Night Live. She is the new Tina Faye ... even though the old Tina Faye is still going very strong.While I have little doubt that the success of The Hangover was a driving force behind the creation of this film, Ms. Wiig's writing and acting talent elevate this mixture of chick-flick and comedy into one of the finest female film comedies in quite awhile. That's probably not strong enough praise since that category is a bit sparse, but as a guy who gets really tired of the formulaic chick-flick rom-coms and sappy dramas, I found the film to be quite refreshing.Sure, there are many similarities between this and The Hangover, but the key difference is that the element of female friendship is never far away from the often raunchy comedy we are witnessing. Women so value their BFF's and Ms. Wiig and her writing partner Annie Mumolo (seen as a nervous plane passenger) never lose sight of this.Also key to any group of female activity is the competitive nature and envious mutterings. They try so hard to appear happy for their friends, when often they are blinded by the current funk in which they find their own life. And look out when a beautiful, rich ""new"" friend enters the picture. The real fireworks begin ... even in the battle for the last word on the mic at the engagement party! I am not going to give away any of the punchlines or set-ups, but I will highlight the cast. Maya Rudolph is Lillian, the bride to be and lifelong friend of Annie (Wiig); Ellie Kemper (The Office) is Becca, the goody-two shoes newlywed; Wendi McLendon-Covey (Reno 911) is Rita, the bitter, frustrated long-time mother and wife looking for inspiration; Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly, Gilmore Girls) is Megan, the slapstick, gross-out comedy relief; Rose Byrne is Helen, the aforementioned seemingly perfect ""new"" friend; Chris O'Dowd (Blind Swordsman in Dinner for Schmucks) is Officer Rhodes, the nice guy who has a crush on Annie; Jon Hamm (Mad Men) as Annie's Porsche driving bootie call; and Jill Clayburgh (her final film role) as Annie's mom.Here is hoping Ms. Wiig continues to push the boundaries of creative comedy for women. I for one look forward to seeing women on screen as more than just love interests and femme fatales.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Had it's moments...,"This movie definitely had its moments (most of them involving Melissa McCarthy), but the fact that it was nominated for two Academy Awards is just silly. McCarthy was very funny, but not Oscar-worthy. And the screenplay wasn't anywhere close to being worth a nomination. Deathly Hallows 2 and Captain America (both released the same year) deserved more attention that this movie. Overall, the film was a raunchy mess with a sub-standard plotline and shallow characters. It would appear that the only reason this movie got the attention that it did was because it involved so many talented women. I'm all for female representation, but we shouldn't be nominating movies for Oscars just because we want certain people to win them. Do better Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Some Solid Laughs But Gets Carried Away,"So Bridesmaids was getting a lot of buzz when it came out and I've heard it referenced fondly many times since so decided to check it out. I think the the main draw for this film is that it is basically 'guy' humor (crass, vulgar, obvious, juvenile, etc) but played here by women. I guess that's empowering to some or just plain funny to others. It only partially worked for me> when the writing was good and genuine it was funny. However, the obvious and weak 'guy' humor was still obvious and weak and therefor not funny and having those parts played by women didn't magically make it funny. Having said all that, there are some genuinely funny parts here and the lead's emotional journey regarding her best friend's wedding are at times relatable and appreciated. As such, Bridesmaids is for a specific kind of audience and if you think that might be you then check it out and see what you think.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It finally happened - a movie without any redeeming features whatsoever,"I had not expected this movie to be one of the worst I saw this year. After all, it has a decent rating on IMDb, it's produced by Judd Apatow, and it was lauded as the ""female hangover"". What could go wrong here? As it turns out, pretty much everything. This movie managed to literally hit all, and I really mean all, the wrong buttons for me.I guess that at least something could be said for the premise, which basically is combining a fart comedy with a romantic drama. Somehow, though, it manages to take the very worst aspects of a drama and the very worst part of a fart comedy.First of all, save for one or two instances, the humor totally misses the mark. I think I smiled maybe twice during the entire two hour running time, which must be a new low on the jokes per minute scale. The jokes just don't work..the physical humor is just plain vulgar in a bad way, and the verbal humor, while probably supposed to be sharp, just comes across as pointless angry ranting. Also, just about every scene goes on for way too long, ruining any potential there might have been.For a drama, it also fails badly. First of all, just about every character with the possible exception of the police officer love interest, is self-obsessed, unsympathetic, shallow and just plain boring. It's impossible to care about these characters as they go through the horribly overlong (the movie is slow to a fault, as well) motions and end up at the horribly predictable conclusion.I suppose some will pass of this movie as ""clever"" or ""original"" but in the end it's just the same old romcom template which has been done hundreds of time before..only this time with no humor, no chemistry and a lot of poorly executed ""serious"" take on the subject.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great opening but downhill from there,"My girlfriend kept asking me if we'd go out to see Brides Maids which would also be enjoyable by us males as well. After having her beg just a little more I decided to go see it with her. The opening scene was memorable but after that it went downhill very fast, after about 30-40 minutes in the movie we looked at each other and I asked her what she thought of this movie. I was glad to hear she shared my opinion about this movie being annoying instead of funny... I guess the problem with the genre is that jokes for some people don't work for other. The key to make a great comedy is to have different kinds of jokes to serve different kinds of people. The jokes (or tries to make them) in this movie were just focused on one type of people. For us (and a lot of people in the same theater), they became annoying instead of funny.",,Anonymous,Romance
"First half, hilarious.......second half, cheesy chick flick trap","Can women be funny? Sure they can, but only when it's under 30 minutes. I'm sorry, i know that may sound sexist, but seriously, name me a female comedy that is made up only of women that is worthy of remembering? The only thing i can think of is when they roast somebody on Comedy Central.....hence why, because it's under 30 minutes. Anything after that, always tends to fall into the emotional cliché' side. Honestly, i'm rooting for you women....i really am. I want you to turn this tide.The first half of this movie is comedy at it's best. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. The pace and timing is spot on, very relative to ""The Hangover"", which is great. However, some of the comedic bits created this strange uncomfortable vibe between the characters. I know it was intended to make the scene even more funny, which in a way it did, but since they did it at almost every turn, after a while it began to loose some of it's luster. But, still funny non the less.So you got a great first half that has everyone in audience geared up for more laughs.....so you would expect a hilarious finish, right? Well, once again, they fell back into the cheesy emotional not so funny cliché' sequence that i hoped would never come. Case in point, take ""The Hangover"".....imagine right after Mike Tyson punches Allen, the guys sit around a mope about how much they have messed things up, instead of doing other hilarious tid bits. And that is the route this movie took. Yes, i understand that this is the one for the ladies......but come on gals. If you want a girl to girl movie, i'm sure blockbuster has an entire section dedicated to just that. Let's bring something new to the table. Prove that you can be funny all the time and not so emotional.Bottom Line......the movie started out with a bang, and looked very promising.....but then it slowly morphed into a giant cliché' trap. I'm sorry, but if you want me to buy your comedy, don't include a sequence where a girl bakes a cake that says 'I'm sorry' on it.....sorry, i know i spoiled a little bit of it, but now you know what to expect, because that's exactly what this movie turns into. It goes from hilarious comedy to cheesy chick flick. So is it bad? No, not really......but, it could have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Bridesmaids""  is a comedy hit.","Paul Feig has directed a comedy that will bring you to tears. He has turned the writings of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo into a side splitting comedy that just won't quit. It is not a ""Chick Flick"" as many may presume, but it is rather one hilarious scene after another as I have not seen in many years. The costuming is great. The casting by Allison Jones is perfect, and the cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is very effective. I don't know if he kept a straight face while filming, but it must have been a very difficult task. The audience should thank the producers for providing the audience with a full two hours of fun and frolic. I doubt that it could have been any better, and more just like it would be welcome from these truly professional comedians.

"Bridesmaids: A real, honest, hilarious celebration.","I know I'm a little late on reviewing this one, I was going to just axe my review altogether. However, Bridesmaids is a film that is simply too good to be ignored. The reason for this is because it so easily could have been a bad movie. It could have been fake, and unrealistic, it could have featured paper-thin characters with no depth. It could have had a lousy script, with PG-13-friendly antics and adventures. It could've featured ridiculous product placement, and could have involved no realistic conflict, with an even more unrealistic conclusion.However, it really doesn't do any of these things.Bridesmaids has a great line of actresses that make the cut, in every possible way, and proves that women can truly be funny, instead of portraying them, as they easily could have, as whiny bitches. Kristen Wiig is a comedic genius. She co-writes the script, alongside Annie Mumolo (who appears in the film as a jittery passenger on a plane, look for her), and these two ladies bring a hell of a lot to the table.Kristen Wiig, while having written a beautifully nuanced script that's funny, yet relatable, and therefore, a bit sad, is the star of the show here. She plays Annie, a lovelorn, broke, and generally unhappy woman whose best friend is getting married, and asks her to be the maid of honor. Whilst dealing with the bizarre and expensive rituals that come with that duty, her life begins to unravel. Friends, love, work, and life, in general begin to blur, and the mistakes of her past become full circle. She's a genuine character, she's not a cliché. As are the rest of the woman in this terrific film.Maya Rudolph (another SNL favourite) plays Wiig's best friend Lillian, who's in the middle of planning a wedding, and begins to drift from her lifelong best friend, Annie. Rose Byrne (who I love in Damages) has a surprisingly apparent comedic side, playing Helen, a member of the bridal party, who is Lillian's fiancée's boss's wife (or something like that), and she is essentially the woman who's (possibly inadvertently) trying to destroy Annie and Lillian's friendship.Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911! fame), gives a hilariously deadpan performance as Rita, a relative who is sarcastic, embittered, and generally dissatisfied in her marriage and resents her three sons. She clicks with Becca (Ellie Kemper, of The Office), a newlywed, who is extremely enthusiastic about becoming a wife and mother, who claims to have been ""so distraught"" when she was single.Rounding out the bridal party is Melissa McCarthy (of Gilmore Girls, and now Mike & Molly) as Megan, the groom's sister. She's the oddball of the group, being decidedly more rough-around-the-edges as the rest of the ladies. While she appears to be for this movie, what Zach Gilifinakis was in The Hangover, she is given room, as are the rest of the ladies, to make exciting, complex, and rewarding characters. But McCarthy is probably the funniest one of the bunch.It's already being referred to as the woman's answer to ""The Hangover"", or ""Hangover in Heels"", which I don't agree with. First of all, I didn't really like ""The Hangover"". For me, it was impossible to root for those four jackasses who weren't genuine, and felt clichéd and ridiculous. While this film certainly has its crude sequences, it's more about friendship, and how to react to things that happen in life that are not ideal. It's about how a friendship can survive whatever punches that are thrown at it.The fact that each of these ladies are given room to make great characters makes this film as good as it is. Given that they don't really whine, and they prove that women ARE funny, and can be hilarious, sets it apart from any other film like this, that has been made in the last decade. It also sets the bar for any R-rated American comedy to be released in 2011. Bring on the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
3 of the 4 points are for Melissa McCarthy,"I'm so, so disappointed. I wasn't that fussed about watching this but all my friends said it was hilarious, so many great reviews etc that in the end I couldn't wait to see it and was really looking forward to it. After renting it on iTunes at the bargain price of £3.49(!), I settled down expecting to enjoy a humorous couple of hours. This didn't happen and I feel cheated.I've given the film 4/10, three of these points are for Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan and provides all of the decent comedy moments and is possibly the only likable character in the entire film.The thing with films like this is that you need to like the characters, you need to want to see the downtrodden, unlucky in life and love underdog get their day in the sun and the happy ending. Unfortunately, Annie (Kristen Wiig) was such a bitter, twisted, jealous, vindictive cow that I was hoping more that she'd get hit by a truck. I didn't want to see her get a happy ending, she didn't deserve one. She was vile. I'd usually be laughing my head off in a scene like the one at the bridal shower but because the tone of the film is so nasty (struggling to find a better word but that's just what it is) I was completely stone faced.I didn't find the bathroom scenes offensive but I don't think they worked well at all and again, failed to make me laugh - I think it was a poor attempt to get a giggle and, again, where I'd be laughing in another film, this just didn't work.The writing is pretty bad, the dialogue is rubbish. Looks like a lot is improvised which can be brilliant with some actors, not with these. It just drew out an already boring scene and made me realise how damn irritating Kristen Wiig is.Just a shoddy, hackneyed, poor film. Don't believe the hype!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Best comedy film at this stage！！！,"Do not have to talk because there is no negative element in a perfect movie! Laughter from the first sex scene. The funny scenes to provoke the police car, great movie in the blockbuster movie is not experience. You throw sh○t at the boutique scene outside the imagination!

couldn't make it through the whole movie,"So I was pretty interested in seeing this movie, in the past I've been a big Judd Apatow fan and I like the idea of a female-centered comedy. I was excited when I saw the great reviews, which made it watching the movie especially disappointing.The movie was a pretty painful experience. It is filled with uncomfortable/awkward moments from jokes being dragged on too long, for example the toast at the engagement party (which I fast forwarded through when I couldn't take it any more)as well as fart/vomit jokes which I can't believe continues to appear in so many movies. Overall, the movie seems to paint a negative picture of women. I was surprised that this was written by a woman, it basically portrays women as sad, unable to function with out a man, catty and superficial. Anyway, can't speak for the whole movie given that I turned it off half way through, but I felt the need to write to save others the time.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
It does not forget about it's central theme despite plenty of embarrassing sight gags,"(2011) Bridesmaid

This brief synopsis only provides the backdrop to many embarrassing situations particularly the plane scene and after eating at the taco restaurant etc...

"Fun, Friendship, love.",Well crafted movie 🍿. I liked it. One time watchable for sure.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridesmaids was a nice showcase for Kristen Wiig who co-wrote this,"Just watched this hilarious and touching comedy with my movie theatre-working friend which stars current SNLer Kristen Wiig today. She also co-wrote and co-produced it. She plays Annie, a failed bakery chef who currently works at a jewelry shop whose best friend-played by her former SNL castmate Maya Rudolph-is getting married. This friend is now chums with someone in her new circle who has a little friction with Annie. I'll just stop there and just say that any comparisons with The Hangover are fine as there are some gross-out humor that can be both funny and maybe a little too much for some tastes. Still, the characterizations and relationships between are real enough that one does care for them. And besides Wiig and Rudolph, there's plenty of funny stuff from the supporting cast with the likes of Ellie Kemper of ""The Office"", Melissa McCarthy currently of ""Mike & Molly"", and Jon Hamm of ""Mad Men"" as a jerk of a boyfriend of Annie. In addition, a couple of former SNLers in Nancy Walls (Mrs. Steve Carell) and Melanie Hutsell also appear in a screamingly funny tennis match (though I only recognized the latter in the movie). So on that note, I highly recommend Bridesmaids. P.S. There's an appearance by the Maya character's favorite group that was a nice surprise especially with the song they sang. And this was the late Jill Clayburgh's last film role as Annie's mother. Incidentally, she hosted SNL twice during the '70s.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wouldn't say I'm proud to have seen this movie :),"I am not embarrassed about it either, well I had heard that this was fun and it might add up to being the female version of The Hangover.To some extend this is the female version, but it is also a British version, meaning that many of the jokes and the humor in general are more British, this isn't a bad thing at all, I love British humor but sometimes it gets a little to far out.This is a good and funny movie, but at times it tries to hard to make it funny and that ends up in scenes that are too much or over the top. It works in the small comedy shows, but on the big screen we don't need these brother and sister landlord parts or the one where they all occupy the restroom in different ways after food poisoning, well enough about that.All-in-all it is fun and entertaining, has great characters, funny sketches and great acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sexy, funny, outspoken, provocative, feel good comedy that touches your viewing emotions!","If your looking for a good laugh and want a feel good viewing time then please watch ""Bridesmaids"" it's one comedy film that most any would enjoy it's got a blend of emotion and drama to fill any viewer's taste. The film is a please to view for it's funny lines and crazy struggles and mishaps and it's spiced up just right with some sex appeal especially from Kristen Wiig.Set in Wisconsin it involves a in her thirties young lady Annie(good sexy performance from Kristen Wiig)who has hit a tough spot in her life, it all began when her cupcake bakery closed down and she had to then take a job as a ring shop clerk. Only matters get worse as due to Annie's outspoken sarcasm she's fired only making matters even more dark as Annie is cash strapped driving a high mileage rattle trap car, then she's put out of her apartment because she can't pay the bills. The only bright spots that Annie had going for her was looking good in her sexy colored bras(I love the scenes of Kristen in the light blue bra and the pink bra scene rocks!)and having no stings attached sex with any guy! Still all may not be lost she has the chance to be maid of honor at her best friend Lillian's(Maya Rudolph) wedding. Along the way getting to the big day is an emotional and funny ride for Annie and the ladies. A different and unique performance that is eye catching is Melissa McCarthy's turn as a tough and gritty outspoken gal who's just a big lovable squeeze of a bridesmaid.Overall pretty good film to watch plenty of laughs and sex appeal the film is outspoken and emotional with real life drama type of situations and it proves be happy with who you are as in the end you will reach your journey even if it is somewhat of a struggle.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't waste your time!,"I have only one word to describe this movie, AWFUL!!! This is badly written, poorly acted and edited and after about 30 minutes I wanted to walk out, something I have never had the urge to do in the movies before! The whole movie is one bad scene after another and seems only to rely on gross out toilet jokes and other disgusting humor that makes me want to wretch at the thought. It seems a lot of Hollywood movies lately are getting more and more daring on the things they get their actors to say and do. I'm all for realism in movies and I don't object to cursing or natural bodily functions being used in a humorous way but when whole movies seem to be based on these jokes it really starts to wear thin and just seems to be a desperate way to get audiences to laugh out loud. When you take away all the gross out jokes from this movie all we are left with is a nonsensical plot that goes nowhere, characters that seem unrealistic and one dimensional and a feeling that Hollywood has dropped yet another bomb into an already overflowing toilet bowl.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just the feeling that it was a steaming pile,a waste of time, an affront to script writers and movie-goers. That's it. No scene or chuckle or line comes to mind. This movie was so bad, I doubt it can make it into a cult classic selection for horrible films.I've seen comparisons to other films, like Wedding Crashers, Dumb and Dumber, and the Hangover. Each of those films had some redeeming qualities. Two of them are in my collection. This film may have been trying to be like those films, but it failed miserably, regardless of the impression I have that the actors did their best. Don't blame them - one may polish a turd forever and just have a shiny turd.I wouldn't use this film's DVD as a coaster. Seriously. Avoid it. I don't know if some people sincerely like this, or if there is a concerted campaign to keep the ratings up. The metacritic score of 39 is much more accurate, but still generous.

Great comedic timing.Rose Byrne as Helen was a humanized 'Karen'. She brought dimensions to a stale trope with a hilarious performance.Some jokes did fall flat and the romantic storyline seemed forced and tacked on and didn't really add much to the film.

I don't like to give away spoilers so I just leave it there, a friend is getting married (Mya Rudolph) Her childhood friend (Kristen Wiig) starts off planning it but one of her new friends in adulthood takes over and that's when the conflict begins.

Less than groundbreaking but fun overall,"Given the reviews and the comments by many of those who'd already seen the movie, I was expecting ""Bridesmaids"" to be a bit more of a raucous affair than it ultimately turned out to be. Yet, while it isn't exactly the ""groundbreaking"" film so many people had described it as being, there's enough you-go-girl sassiness and charm to make it a pleasant enough comedic experience.SNL alums, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig (who co-wrote the screenplay with Annie Mumolo), play best friends from childhood, Lillian and Annie, the former a career-woman who's getting ready to tie the knot with a wealthy banker, and the latter, an insecure bundle of neuroses with commitment issues whom Lillian has asked to be her bridesmaid. Into the breach steps Rose Byrne (Glenn Close's bete noire from TV's ""Damages""), as Lillian's snooty new friend whom Annie sees as a rival for Lillian's affections. The focus of the screenplay is mainly on Annie, as she goes about subconsciously sabotaging many of the traditional pre-wedding festivities, as well as her own chances at happiness.Though the women here are occasionally foul-mouthed and uninhibited in their behavior and topics of conversation, they really aren't as crude and vulgar as the media - looking for a look-even-women-can-be-as-bad as-men storyline - has made them out to be. In fact, the tone of much of the movie is sweet and thoughtful, as Annie copes with her very recognizably human feelings of inferiority and jealousy.Directed by Paul Feig, the movie alternates between broad slapstick and sophisticated satire without skipping a beat, though there is the occasional dry-spot to slow down the proceedings. And Melissa McCarthy (""Mike and Molly"") steals every scene she's in as a straight-talking tomboy who obviously flunked out of the Miss Manners School of Social Etiquette.It's not a great comedy by any stretch, but it's hard not to be won over by it in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's all stuff I've seen before, just with a different gender. Sure, it's funny at times, but it's also slow and clunky in some moments. I will give it that I do like the more restrained but still crass McCarthy but this is Wiig's movie and she owns it from start to finish.It's fun, I admire it for what it's doing but I can't say it was an overwhelming success in my eyes.

They were incredibly funny! The other cast members were not. Every scene with Ms. McCarthy was hilarious, especially the bathroom scene which she stole. As for the story itself, the conflict between the two bridesmaids was completely contrived, seemed to be almost tragic and not particularly funny. The actors were not funny and indeed there were moments when Maya Rudolph seemed like she was going to cry. Now if Melissa McCarthy had played the main bridesmaid and Ben Falcone her boyfriend, then the movie would have been a farce and would have generated a lot more laughs, but so much for ""what if.""

I was disappointed with Hangover II, and thought this would be more fresh. How wrong i was.... What really really annoyed me in the movie was the part in the engagement party where the two women were gushing over each other to speak, they changed places like a gazillion times, and kept talking, and talking, until the slightest humor of the occasion was completely gone. As far as I was concerned a lot of the other jokes just fell flat. I couldn't even tell if it was women writing these awful lines or men, giggling insanely as they attempted to make women just seem dumb, stupid, manipulative, bitchy, and so so.

Just adding some jokes about shitting yourself does not make it a edgy. The lead character is extremely unlikable, and though she acts like a complete dick throughout the film towards her friend and love interest she never apologies and for some reason they end up apologizing to her.The pacing was terrible, the film was way too long.

I ignored this film every time I saw it listed because I had confused its title with Bride Wars with Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway which I found irritating rather than funny, but when I eventually decided to give Bridesmaids a go because there was nothing else on TV, I got such a fantastic surprise. I can only think that the viewers who gave this film such scathing reviews had been expecting a rom com, and this is nothing of the sort.

Bridesmaids,"The 2011 film, Bridesmaids is a personal favorite of mine. This comedy romance film tells the story of two women competing for the title of the bride's ""best friend."" Annie Walker, played by Kristen Wiig is the maid of honor. She begins to feel threatened by the bride's new friend, who is also in the wedding party as a bridesmaid. Along the way, these two battle it out in order to prove their loyalty and friendship toward the bride (Lillian). I can honestly say from start to finish of this movie, I never once stopped laughing. The film centers on the comedic absurdity of women, however men and women can both get a kick out of this movie. I think I enjoyed this film so much because this was one of the first films I've seen where most of the characters are funny women. We see films like ""The Hangover"" and ""Step Brothers"" where the focus is on comical males. In my opinion, Bridesmaids switched up the style of the usually expected comedy. Although I find this film to be awesome, the box office seems to disagree. The movie itself still made a killing but compared to other high ranking films, Bridesmaids didn't come close. There are some inappropriate scenes for children, which takes away a large audience. On the other hand, there's nothing too crazy in this film where you would feel the need to turn it off. I believe this film deserved a lot more money in the box office and more recognition.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The apartment living was odd in that it seemed out of place, but much of this movie was that way. Interesting enough I had not read reviews until I wondered if I missed something only to find this appears to be a ""love or hate"" movie.

Better than I thought it was going to be.,"BRIDESMAIDSThis was actually better than I was expecting. I was thinking it was just going to be another romantic comedy that is only slightly funny... well, it was quite funny.The story is about a woman who is getting married, and when she gets her best friend to be maid of honour, one of her bridesmaids decides to try and outdo her and steal her best friend away from her. It then turns into a competition between these 2 women.The comedy is actually quite funny. There were a few moments that made me laugh out loud. The relationship between these women worked really well. All the cast gelled well and worked well together. The movie stars Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Chris O'Dowd & Jill Clayburgh. It was also good to see a couple of maneos in there. Matt Lucas and Terry Crews popped up in there.There were a few moments that were really gross... but they were really funny. The language used as well felt like it was there for shock value, and that was not really necessary.All in all, I enjoyed it. It was far better than expected and it is not as romantic as it sounds like. It really is just about these women trying to get along.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""This is so awkward.

"Wiig Tries Hard, But This Is No ""Baby Mama""","A moderately funny comedy that highlights the considerable talents of the under-utilized Kristen Wiig and makes you wish she had been given better material to work with.When Wiig and her ""Saturday Night Live"" fellow alumna, Maya Rudolph, are on screen together, the chemistry is palpable and makes one wonder why someone didn't think to give these two a buddy comedy along the lines of ""Baby Mama."" But instead, Rudolph gets little screen time, and the show belongs to Wiig. Wiig is a very funny comedienne, but the character she gets to play wears out her welcome early on, long before the movie wants to let her learn the lesson all such formulaic comedies must have their main characters learn and rebound for that happy ending. Therefore, the crash and burn that Wiig's character endures becomes pathetic instead of funny, despite Wiig's frantic efforts to wring comedy out of situations that don't lend themselves much to laughs.Still, the film is a diverting enough amusement for a Friday night, and there are enough laughs to make some of the more mediocre parts worth sitting through.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Bridesmaids""","Once upon a time, I'm looking for a new comedy. I was trying to get away from the mainstream comedies nowadays, I was looking for something different. When I first saw Bridesmaids, guess what I put it off as? A chick flick. The cover looked so bad and terrible, and looked like another pathetic attempt at humor. And guess what again? The movie has the same effect on you as looking at the cover, triggering you to say ""really?""Now, listen, Bridesmaids is surely not a bad film. In fact, at least it was something different. Different I mean in it's cast. The movie had spice in it's cast. It was all something different. We have actors all from Kristen Wiig to Melissa McCarthy. Now don't get me wrong, I love Melissa McCarthy. I whole-heartily think she's laugh-out-loud hilarious. But in this film she's basically a one trick dog. She thinks she can say a few lame things and cross it off as funny because that's who she looks out to be. Wrong. Her lines were cringe-worthy to say the worth. And she was the one with the most potential in her character, and than finished in last place.The film's humor was probably the best part of this film. It's a blend of warmheartedness and even it's own pinch of raunchy humor. Some scene, though, came off as an ATTEMPT but others had me rolling. Now this leads me to the next big problem we need to discuss. Even though the movie is a blend of genres, it never knows exactly what it is going for. It's like that clichéd scenario where you let your dog out and let him decide his owner. Except the dog/film doesn't know exactly where to go, so this entire 125 minutes is confused and desperate to find somewhere. I love diversity, but it's gets annoying and raunchiness and warmheartedness don't really click together.Expect the expected, Bridesmaids is critically-appealed but deeply inside another chick flick. It does nothing new, for me, and it never knows if it's a straight-up comedy our a raunchy chick flick. Whichever one, I knew the movie wasn't for me. And no, that doesn't mean I am sexist. The movie wasn't to my taste, how is that so hard to believe? I recommend for people who know what they are getting into, and actually really enjoy chick flicks. Bridesmaids can be considered a faithful one at that, but not faithful to my tastes. But who am I to say? Go see it for yourself.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not the rude, mindless comedy I thought it was","I don't know why I thought that this film would be one of those dumb in-your-face explicit comedies that seem to be the trend lately. Maybe it was the title, which made me think it'd be about a bunch of drunken bridesmaids having sex left and right. Maybe it was because the person who recommended it hasn't had the best taste in films. Either way, I watched it with low expectation - and I was pleasantly surprised.It's darker and deeper, with well-developed characters. All the bridesmaids have different backgrounds which result in their having different characteristics. The protagonist's character is well told and it's played really well by Kristen Wiig. We can sympathise with her 'going down the drain' life, even when she's being weird and crazy.The main event of the film is of course the rivalry between our protagonist and her best friend's NEW best friend, which are funny at times and frustrating at others. There's a good mix of drama and comedy in the whole storyline, but as the consequence, there are some awkward moments there as well - some funny parts are not realistic enough compared to the more serious dramatic parts. But hey, that's how life is - sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry. It's still a refreshing comedy compared to what Hollywood is dishing out these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure gold!,"Think of 'The Hangover', 'Due Date', 'Pineapple Express', etc. All those movies feature guys as the main role. The girls in those movies are usually either in the background or really uptight. So, I want to thank Universal for making a comedy that has girls in the main role! Girl Power!I thought 'Bridesmaids' was pure gold. It was absolutely hilarious! Mostly because of Kristen Wiig. I've been a huge fan of her for a couple of years now. I always thought her SNL skits were hilarious. Those only lasted about 3 minutes, while the movie lasted about 2 hours. She was beyond funny! I wished they would have showcased more of Maya Rudolph's funny side, and I wished they showed more of Jon Hamm, because he's, well–Jon Hamm. Standout for me would have to be Melissa McCarthy. She didn't look her best, but was too damn funny! I can't really say anything without giving part of it away.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of those few 2010s movies...,"That became instant classics. I think Bridesmaids is up there with every good chick flicks and Wedding comedies. Nobody can genuinely say it's bad. But they can complain about things that spoiled their fun, like Rebel Wilson and Matt Lucas painfully bad comedic timing... I think this movie is a one hit wonder to these former SNL starlettes. And studios shouldn't have been too greedy, trying to milk their fleeting popularity, with « sequels » that never caught this lightning in the bottle again. The main cast is hilarious and sexy, I agree. Wiig does her own thing, and she nails it. Rudolph is more « dramatic », but it fits her character. Byrne though, is my personal favorite. And showed her comedy skills, for the first time there. McCarthy, McLendon-Covey and Kemper all gave solid performances. And the supporting cast, apart from those two mentioned earlier. Were exactly how they were needed to be. Unfortunately it's a movie that aged a little, and knowing how overwhelmed by success, these actresses were on their following projects. You also feel the disappointment, of never seeing them at the top of their game, like they were then again. Which I admit, kind of spoils my fun, every time I rewatch this film. Six times and counting. I laugh, I sing along to all the great songs on the soundtrack, and always think officer Nathan is the perfect boyfriend.

An above average addition to the comedy genre,"Bridesmaids (2011) is a movie that I recently watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a bride who starts putting her wedding party together that includes her best friend as the bridesmaid and her fiancé's boss' wife as a bridesmaid. The two quickly become competitive but nothing seems to go right for the maid of honor and her life starts falling apart. Will the bridesmaids ruin the wedding or can they get their act together in time to save the day?This movie is directed by Paul Feig (The Heat) and stars Kristen Wiig (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty), Maya Rudolph (Licorice Pizza), Rose Byrne (Insidious), Terry Crews (White Chicks), Rebel Wilson (Jojo Rabbit) and Kali Hawk (Get him to the Greek).This is a film that had a lot of potential based on the perfectly selected cast, unique circumstances and a storyline with a good mix of comedy and drama. Unfortunately, the comedy is inconsistent and a bit cheesy. I did love the dress fitting scene and the evolution of the main character. There's also a worthwhile love story hidden in here. Most of the film is awkward, and makes you uncomfortable, but the ending was straightforward and predictable but still fun to watch unfold. The soundtrack was fantastic.Overall, this was an above average addition to the comedy genre that I would score a 6/10 and recommend seeing once.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really Disappointed,"Really disappointed in this movie. I loved Hangover, Superbad, The Office, Blades of Glory, etc, but this movie was not that funny.The whole movie is about a loser character being jealous and petty about her best friend's wedding. Instead of being happy for her new life and doing everything she can to make her wedding wonderful, she spends the whole time being jealous that other girls are prettier, richer and throw better parties than her. She only warms up to her ""rival"" when the rival looks uglier than her. Wow, how shallow can you get?To top it all off, the humor is not outstanding. There are about 2 good lines in the whole movie, and the slapstick is not outrageous enough that it's special.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bridesmaids,"As raunchy as any female flick could bear, BRIDESMAIDS is not just a female version of THE HANGOVER spin-off. It hinges firmly on a 3S lady's (single, seventies and stuck) personal mire, and elaborates a watchable diagram of friendship and, eventually a tad of love.The film manages a tug-of-war competition between our protagonist Annie Walker as her childhood BFF Lillian's maid of honor and an almost immaculate bridesmaid Helen (a new friend of Lillian) to the coronet of the best friend of the bride, the battle is inequitably brutal since Helen's filthy rich and such a phony, thus soon it plummets into a steep plight for Annie. However a fairly anticipated buck-up is congenially under the way, so no more melodrama and a woman's victory is all well-deserved.The film is a tailor-made vehicle for Kristine Wiig (who co-writes the script) and her comedic bent has grabbed the best platform to bloom and it is an awesome job! The hysterical turmoil of her life is surprisingly conceived with humor and self-mockery. Among the sidekicks Melissa McCathy is another feat on screen, her embodiment of life with her own weight is the best part in the film and expunges extensively the side effect of a hackneyed plot contrivance. Also Wiig's Saturday NIGHT LIVE co-star Maya Rudolph and an inscrutably dulcet Rose Byrne are adeptly cast. The great news is that the film has become the highest grossing R-rated female comedy of all time in USA, while a sad thing is that it is Jill Clayburgh's final film.It is also another triumph for the producer Judd Apatow (after the tepid welcome of FUNNY PEOPLE 2009), he is still able to pioneer the red-hot craze for the modern-day comedy and be innovative, I hope BRIDESMAIDS 2 will not be a disheartening cool-down as THE HANGOVER PART II (2011) did.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated Comedy,"In Milwaukee, the bitter Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a complete loser with a messy life: she is the sex toy of the womanizer Ted; she has a lousy job of seller in jewelry; she drives a junk car; she shares her apartment with two morons and siblings; she bankrupted her bakery business. When her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) invites her to be the maid of honor with four bridesmaids, Annie feels jealous and envious of the gorgeous and wealthy Helen Harris (Rose Byrne) and they compete to be Lillian's best friend. Meanwhile the police officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd) feels attracted to Annie.""Bridesmaid"" is an overrated comedy with a terrible story, scatological jokes and an envious lead character that takes the most despicable attitudes in the party of her best friend due to her envy.

My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Missão Madrinha de Casamento"" (""Mission Maid of Honor"")",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A leap forward,"""Bridesmaids are like matrimonial interns."" Conversations with other Women (2005)Is Bridesmaids a Hangover for chicks? In a small way, yes, but Bridesmaids is better, even in the scatological scene where a dress fitting turns into a hilarious disaster as the girls head for the nearest head. I remember a cruder attempt at fundament fun in Hangover.It's all about best friends Annie (Kristen Whig) and Lillian (Maya Rudolph) preparing for Lillian's wedding with Annie as a maid of honor who is clueless about arranging a wedding. The conflict arises when another maiden challenges her for best-friend status and maid of honor honors.Bridesmaids has its share of stereotypes: cute but amorously lost Annie (Kristin Wiig), plain but lovable affianced Lillian (Maya Rudolph), fat and randy Megan (Melissa McCarthy), perfectly pretty, wealthy snob Helen (Rose Byrne), et al. Yet amidst these types we've seen before is a story of loss and redemption not so heavily attended to in other Judd-Apatow produced romcoms.Director Paul Feig lets the pathos in when the comedy needs a rest, and writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo infuse the dialogue with an unusual intelligence. Unfortunately the off-beat wit ends as the film sags midway with Annie's emotional and amorous problems struggling with jealousy over Helen's high-end bridal arrangements and combat with selfish lover Ted (Jon Hamm) and blue collar cop Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd).The film revives when the requisite going-to-Vegas breakout happens even before the girls get there—on the plane in some set pieces about drugs and booze and flight attendants that sure beat Snakes on a Plane and Airport for a smart mix of slapstick and satire.Bridesmaids is a leap forward for intelligent comedy where characters overcome stereotypes to be memorable and insightful about the challenges 30-something women face in a society where their voices are more frequently heard above the din of dim-witted boy men.But the best was at the beginning when the girls are overcome with bad food that poisons their dress fitting and provides the best potty shenanigans ever, spilling over, so to speak, into sink and street.",,Anonymous,Romance
Drawn out,"Bridesmaids seems to have been so acclaimed mainly because it's not as bad as you might expect. It's often compared to The Hangover and not without reason, but the one area in which The Hangover truly excelled which made it stand out, is where Bridesmaids fails miserably - pacing. Each gag is drawn out over painfully long periods of time, and the movie is 40 minutes too long. It almost makes sense when you realize that the two leads are SNL graduates.That's not to say Bridesmaids doesn't deserve some credit. A comedy with an all-female lead cast is rare enough, and the movie has the unusual distinction of being a comedy directed at women that isn't a romantic comedy - in fact it's anything but, though it comes close at one point - and along the way breaks a lot of conventions about what a 'chick flick' should be, including some scenes of no holds barred gross-out comedy, of a kind that would fit right in with a male cast, but feels strangely disturbing with the female cast (and what does that say about our perceptions of gender?). Those are the moments where the movie is truly funny; and although the humor is low, in many ways it feels fresh, and as a comedy - in the big picture - it works and is memorable.When there's actual plot, though, it feels like the characters keep talking long after we got the point. Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and Rose Byrne all play characters of varying levels of unlikability and it's hard to care about any of them. The saving graces are Melissa McCarthy - the movie's only likable character, for me - Jon Hamm and Jill Clayburgh, whose scenes are shorter, funnier and more to the point than anything else. When Wiig and Byrne are bickering on screen, though, it's tough to remember why we have to root for either one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

What surprised is how well written the characters are, they have an excellent development through the course of the film, especially our main girl.

"Okay, but my expectations weren't low enough...","I expected this movie to be just another mediocre comedy with a few laughs here and there. Instead I found the movie to be fundamentally flawed and unenjoyable:The main character is an unlikable loser who is selfish, mean- spirited, petty and jealous. She has no apparent goals or aspirations, nothing to help the viewer feel sympathy or like her or find her interesting.Too much of the humor relies on embarrassing and gross bodily functions.Another portion of the humor just relies on characters over-sharing and making others uncomfortable with their whiny self-pity. This is not from the movie but to give you an idea of what I mean: imagine a scene where one woman says to another ""I'm having problems with my husband, he doesn't want to have sex with me anymore so I bought 5 vibrators! (blah blah etc.)"" Other person looks uncomfortable and stays quiet. The movie has several exchanges like that between characters and that is supposed to be funny or cute? It's just... not. Humor should be about presenting the audience with some novel unexpected arrangement of ideas or experiences, not rely entirely on making them wince and feel uncomfortable.Lacking plot and character development; The whole plot revolves around being a bridesmaid. Eventually the main character supposedly ""learns"" that she has take responsibility for the problems in her life. But the things that happen in the movie don't seem to show the process of her learning anything, instead it is just her being a trainwreck and wallowing in misery. At the end there is nothing tangible or demonstrable to show that she has grown at all.On the plus side: somehow it wasn't that bad. As much as there is to criticize, it's worth watching once. There are some funny moments, situations that make you think, some scenes that are poignant and have heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst movie I've seen for a while.,"My 16 year old daughter and I were having a girl's night in and decided to rent a film. We watched the trailer for Bridesmaids and it seemed the perfect choice. We settled down to watch and it started off bad and went downhill from there, to the point where I couldn't even make it to the end. I thought it was absolutely dire! The main character is one of the most annoying, unsympathetic characters I have ever seen in a film. No redeeming features whatsoever. I could find nothing likable about her - she was stupid, selfish, thoughtless and irritating in equal measure - completely unlikeable. The other characters provided a couple of isolated funny moments but that was it. I barely raised a smile throughout, and when the main character was on screen I could hardly watch. I am really surprised that there are so many positive reviews for this movie. I honestly can't think of one good thing to say about it. Dreadful.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

I didn't really like that one, but after seeing it I've started to spot these actresses from other films and realize they're actually pretty good. Especially McCarthy, she's becoming my favorite.Bridesmaids presents a crazy gallery of different characters who get into hilarious situations. There's an underlying theme of jealousy - who gets to be the best friend... Then all goes crazy and then everything becomes good again and yaaay! The end.

Good thing cops like pastry,"Annie's (Kristen Wiig) life spirals into chaos through a cascade of events spurred by the announcement that her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is to get married and she is to be her maid of honour. After failed business investments and a love-life in self-inflicted permanent hell (punctuated by masochistic nights spent with her egocentric prick sex buddy) she seems to have already hit bottom. Only to be proved entirely wrong, when Lillian's work associate, the sumptuous Whitney (Jessica St. Clair), collides head on with Annie in trying to fulfil the bridesmaids honours. The remainder of Lillian's ragtag team of the Brides little helpers is made up of foul-mouthing mom of three rascals Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey), goodie-two-shoes Becca (Ellie Kemper) and tomboy Megan (Melissa Mccarthy), the movies very successful response to Alan from ""Hangover"". The entourage is however secondary, as the movie really and truly focuses on Annie and her debacles with only limited time offered to the supporting cast.As chaos reigns laughter ensues. Sometimes in droves, but more often with a little smirk of enjoyment. The movie in the end does turn out to be a bundle of fun, but it does have a very weird mix of conversation based humour, subtle absurdities and situational comedy with immature fart and anal jokes coupled with people thinking that swearing equals being funny (both these points punctuated by the appearance of Matt Lucas of Little England ignominy). In the end not everything works in this slightly chaotic comedy unsure of which direction to best take. Add to that some some of the key jokes in the movie just dragged on beyond their expiry date replacing a good laugh with an internal suggestion for the editor to recut the movie. But after an uneven start our girls in pink really get going and break inhibitions to force out a tirade of laughter. The dramatic side of the story is also very well written, so you feel strongly drawn to sympathise with Annie, whilst simultaneously screaming at the screen for her being such an emotional moron. However irritating she is as a person, you somehow end up gunning for her and happy she found a pastry munching Irish cop to get romantically involver with..The ending left me slightly disappointed. Rushed and lacking the warmth of the build-up it really would have done better with some more minutes to prepare for the big resolution.Definitely up there with recent comedies such as ""Role Models"" or ""Hangover"", but for brief issues with pacing and bad jokes. The movie also feels way too engineered and sincere for its own good. Being the response to ""Hangover"" doesn't help it one bit in this regard.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Why did Paul Feig direct this aimlessly wandering script?,"This film has multiple personality disorder. There are some genius moments and scenes, but they are drowned out by extreme, crass, predictable, over-the-top scenes full of stale gags.

I Must Have Missed Something,"Bridesmaids (2011)** (out of 4)Annie (Fristen Wiig) finds her life falling apart all around her once her business goes down the drain. Not only that but she's stuck with two horrible roommates, has no money, a crummy job and is in a relationship with a guy who wants one thing only. Annie thinks everything is about to change when her lifelong friend announces she's getting married and wants her to be the maid of honor but soon Annie finds herself battling with one of the bridesmaids. I'll have to admit right now that I'm really not sure what all the hype was about. I'm sure some might say that the humor just escaped me because I'm a male but I think that would be tad bit unfair. I mean, I'm sure plenty of women enjoy male-buddy movies so I really don't think ones sex should matter. I had really high hopes for this comedy but throughout the movie it just seemed like I kept waiting for something funny to happen. There were a few scenes that had a smile on my face but there wasn't a single time where I really laughed out loud. I think the biggest problem I had with the comedy was that it was just so forced and so fake that not for a second could I find it funny. Just take a look at a sequence where the women are shopping for dresses after eating at a restaurant. They end up getting food poisoning and need to rush the bathroom but there's only one toilet with three women fighting over it. This is the gross-out scene that all R-rated comedies must have these days but it doesn't work. Also, there's a scene later in the movie where the group is on a plane and Annie, the only one stuck in coach, ends up getting the plane landed because of her actions. I won't spoil what she does exactly but once again it's just so over-the-top that you can't take it serious or laugh at it. I found the entire story to have wannabe touching scenes but none of them worked because they were just so corny and by the numbers. I mean, is there anyone alive whose not going to see the ending coming? The one spark in the film came from Chris O'Dowd who plays an officer who starts a relationship with Annie. I thought the quieter moments between the two were the best parts of the film and it's a shame they didn't have more of it. With all of that said, BRIDESMAIDS is still an easy film to sit back and watch. It's certainly not horrible but I just think it should have been better. Considering it was a huge hit obviously many people loved it but I'm just not one of them.",,Anonymous,Romance
not bad but....,I was really reluctant to see this movie even after hearing positive things. Mainly because of the all female cast. Not that I have anything against women its just mainly because I knew they would be making jokes more centered around girls and likewise to the story line. This could have been hangover with women and been hilarious but they did what I knew they would and put in romance and touching moments and jokes mainly centered at women.This movie is about a woman who has a friend who is going to get married and the friend asks her to be a bridemaid. They go to the wedding were craziness ensues.This movie was alright and it did have a couple funny moments but this is not a movie for me thats for sure. I will not be giving this another watch and I really only recommend for women or if you have a girlfriend who wants to see it and you know it will close the deal.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Easily digestible but highly amusing,"It's not a visionary approach to the theme of friendship that makes ""Bridesmaids"" a solid film, but rather its straightforward approach to the matter intertwined with flawless comedic performances. Kristen Wiig manages to portray Annie Walker in the most sympathetic of manners, despite irrational immaturity glooming over the character. And of course, Melissa McCarthy is a scene stealer whenever she appears. ""Bridesmaids"" is not without it flaws; especially the formulaic setup and unsurprising ending drags the film down a bit.

Entertaining (maybe some spoilers),"Bridesmaids directed by Paul Feig, written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig.Starring Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, and Chris O'Dowd.Let me start by saying expectations for this film were pretty high, and they were met to a certain degree. Bridesmaids is a fairly entertaining film, with several funny moments but also several WTF one's as well.The basic plot is that of Annie a woman who lost not only her boyfriend but also all of her savings. She then finds that she has been picked as her best friend's maid of honor, where she finds herself working through some weird rituals alongside a group of bridesmaids.This film has some nice direction (alongside other things) and some funny moments. It's pretty impressive considering the fact that this is Kristen Wiig's first leading role (I don't think she's very funny on SNL), and there's some funny moments from other members of the cast (especially Jon Hamm in a cameo as Ted a man that Annie has a sexual relationship with).One note of interest is that this is Jill Clayburgh's final film (the actress that played Annie's mother). Not the best way to end your career, if you ask me.Overall a pretty good time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wiig does a fine job of embarrassing herself in scene after scene while Rose Byrne as her poised nemesis does an equally fine job of stoking her insecurity and fostering havoc. In the role of the requisite funny fat guy ala Zach Galifinakis, Jack Black etc. Mellissa Mc Carthey fits the role perfectly with the same self assured dead pan flare.While the cast and the situations do hold there own in the zany department with guy versions Bridesmaids begins to drag with time outs for melancholy reflection and heart to hearts stretching the film beyond two hours resulting in diluting the full comic thrust and while it prevents Bridesmaids from becoming the bride of all comedies there are more than enough belly laughs for a good time to be had by all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Comedy heavy on the drama,"The most surprising thing about this supposedly female version of ""The Hangover"" (and ""The Hangover II"" which was apparently the same movie) is how much it is not a female version of ""The Hangover"". While to some degree a raunchy comedy, the movie deals more with the complexities of female relationship and dealing with personal failure in life more similar to Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"". The movie take a long, well- informed look at the waning process of longstanding female relationships as well as female rivalry. The rivalry between Wiig's Annie Walker and a far more successful suitor for her best friend since grade school Lilian (Maya Rudolph)is the better developed with very funny scenes of one-ups- manship (or one-ups-womanship). Annie's coming-apart-at-the-seams development after she loses first a bakery business, boyfriend and eventually her best friend is also interesting to watch. You cannot blame Lilian's or Chris O'Dowd's character turning their back on her as her behavior gets more and more erratic. While the strong plot carries the movie, there are some very distracting problems. Wisconsin looks nothing like Southern California where a lot of it was shot. State policemen act nothing like Officer Rhodes and would quickly get fired if they did. Melissa MacCarthny's Megan, which got her an academy nom largely to make the group seem less stuffy, makes no sense. Is she supposed to be the Zach Galifianakis screw-up from ""The Hangover"" or the international spy we hear about towards the end of the film. Wendy McLendon-Covey's Rita is an interesting character given that she foreshadows the miserable life that Maya's character (who seems a little old to be getting married for the first time) is destined for later down the road. The film does have some surprisingly darker moments before the obligatory ending dance number. In short, more substance here than you have been lead to believe although there are some genuinely funny moments.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's so forced and phony,"Sorry, didn't have the patience to sit out for this pretentious movie. First of all, the so-called ""best friends"" didn't play convincingly as best friends, they didn't look or act like good friends, even their facial looks and expressions didn't ring true to show that they could be very good friends. I really don't know how these critics and movie goers would consider this is a good movie, maybe hearing women's ""wise crackings"" are so exciting, because usually wisecracking is the words from the male? Not long ago we have a very boring movie, ""The Romantics"", also got the similar scenario and storyline, a bunch of male and female alumni as best friends all invited to participate a wedding and it turned out to be a vicious back-stabbing debacle. That amateurish and so-called best friends' wedding is no different from this ""Bridemaids"", but this one also sucks big time in my opinion; I might have to bang my head on the wall to turn myself into a moron to watch this pathetic movie. After viewed it about 30 minutes my wife finally lost her patience, pushed me with her elbow and suggested: ""This movie looks so pretentious and shallow, could we just leave now?"" ""Thought you'd never ask!"" I responded. So, another several ten dollar bills were down the drain. Those movie critics, I really want to kick their behinds.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Here comes the ""Bridesmaids"", all dressed in just alright","I am sorry to separate myself from most of the moviegoer audience, but I just did not feel the love of ""Bridesmaids"" and think it's the most overrated movie of the year. Now, don't get me wrong, I did not mind walking down the cinematic aisle with a viewing of ""Bridesmaids"". It did have its share of shits and giggles, especially the former in a most- talked about bridal dress shop scene. But the movie has been hailed as the top comedy of 2011 by many film critics, and I just don't think it deserves that ring of honor. ""Bridesmaids"" stars the always enigmatic Kristen Wiig as Annie, yea she is a bridesmaid and also the maid of honor of her best gal pal Lilian played by Maya Rudolph. Annie is intimidated by Lilian's new close friend Helen (Rose Byrne) who is an egocentric socialite who will stop at nothing to be Lilian's new best friend and dethrone Annie from that classification. Sounds like silly teenage girls battling for a ""best friend"" confirmation, doesn't it? Well, that is pretty much how it is in ""Bridesmaids"". Now, that is not what ""Bridesmaids"" is all about. There is the rest of Lilian's bridesmaids entourage- the bored housewife Rita (Wendi McClendon-Covey), the adventure-seeker Becca (Ellie Kemper), and the zany Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Director Paul Feig dresses up ""Bridesmaids"" with many aspects that have already been addressed in other chick-flick movies; the jealous friend, the villainous socialite, the crazy obese character, and the formulaic rom-com storyline. The primary romantic storyline in the movie is of Annie and police officer Nathan Rhodes. They are opposites that are destined to be together; and their boy-gets-girl, girl-loses- boy, girl-desperately tries to get boy again-in movie's final scene is a narrative feature that has been exposed way too many times in this genre. Sure, I am speaking now to forever hold this piece on what is awry of ""Bridesmaids"", but there was some positive uniformity in the film. Kirsten Wiig was very good as Annie, and the Annie protagonist is what made me want to hold on to ""Bridesmaids"" as much as I can. Wiig continues to get ""wiiigy with it"" as one of the best female comedic actresses in today's Hollywood. Chris O'Dowd no doubt was arrestingly charismatic as the witty-liner Officer Dowd. And it was very joyous, even though a bit heartbreaking, to see legendary actress Jill Clayburgh in her final performance as Annie's mom. Clayburgh passed away a few months ago. Wiig and Annie Mumolo scripted up the ""Bridesmaids"" screenplay with some funny lines, but not enough in the ""laugh out loud"" department. A lot has been talked about new comedy queen Melissa McCarthy's performance as the madcap Megan, now it was good but not to the level of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as it has been buzzed around. Megan sure did a bit of scene-stealing in ""Bridesmaids"" but I think it does have a bit of Alan-takeoff in them. You don't know what I am referring to, stream or Netflix ""The Hangover"" and ""The Hangover Part 2"", which it would be an exercise of futility because chances are you already saw them. Jon Hamm's performance as a womanizer who uses Annie for sex is one of the most pointless performances of the year, Hamm is a good actor and I don't want him to be a mad man towards me for my comments but his talents were wasted here. ""Bridesmaids"" is a recommendable feature, but there is not enough colorful-movie coordination for it to be proclaimed as a comedic classic. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is how real people meet and fall in love.John Hamm's bit parts are great - we just love to hate him.Melissa McCarthy was a wonderful discovery. I never saw her in anything else, but absolutely fell in love with in this movie.I'd think those who call this movie 'awful' are those who just don't want to see women act like this.

In short...It was awful.,"Not gonna lie, this movie is a huge waste of money. I had heard so many good things about it, and I was really excited for it, but I found that it was a huge disappointment. I'm a guy, so I will admit, some things I didn't find funny because it was targeted for women. However, I have NO idea why this movie was said to be ""The Hangover"" but with women. There is no comparison AT ALL.If you think it is as funny as ""The Hangover"", then you are an idiot. There were only like 3 scenes that could only make me chuckle, and the rest of the time I felt like I was watching a drama. Aside from the lack of comedy aspect of the movie, another reason why it wasn't very good was because there were so many plot holes left in the end. I was waiting to see if they would tie everything together, but they didn't.There was only one character in the movie that was remotely funny, and that was Melissa McCarthy's character, Megan. If the rest of the cast was at least half as funny as she was, then the movie might be bearable.

Question- Maya Rudolph as the bride,"There is something I don't quite understand. If Maya Rudolph is the bride, and she is a woman of color, why aren't there any other women of color as her bridesmaids? This seems to be such a deliberate oversight on the part of the Hollywood producers ad a negative view of the actress about her own race. I haven't seen the movie, but if she is passing for white then she has allowed Hollywood to use her as a pawn for benign racism. It is beyond belief that any African American even partly has never had any dealings with their own people unless they are in denial and totally identify with being white. Even if it is true, why capitalize on it. It shows great disrespect and embarrassment towards her mother, Minnie Ripperton, one of the greatest singers of all time. If I am wrong in this issue I stand corrected and apologize profusely. This reminds me the racist eras of when Elizabeth Taylor portrayed the role of Cleopatra instead of the likes of a Dorothy Dandridge or Eartha Kitt.

Together alone,"The Judd Apatow formula has worked well so far: lay out a moment of personal crisis that we know should be despairing for the microcosm of the protagonist but isn't because we're not yet aware of the full implications, at the outset posit this to be a kind of charm then allow him or her to swim to the edges of that microcosm with increasing awkwardness. Offset each new low with as much crudeness possible so that it sinks in a little later that we were laughing with pain. Finally express the life-altering realization with as much organic drama the specific world allows.So it is always the balance of the pie in the face with some emotional maturity in handling the aftermath that makes these work. And the transitions need to be smooth, from disastrous fun to self- examination. In the best of cases anyway, because he's also produced a slew of crap.It goes without saying that this is a notch or two above The Hangover, even though it's a similar scenario except with women having to handle the rite of passage. So we have a person who needs to pull together all her resources to stage an important event, she needs to plan, to lead, to be creative but responsible; of course her life is an emotionally disheveled mess, so it's a resounding failure that reflects on her. It reflects on the sex she chooses to have.But she is an artist we learn, a very talent baker dismayed by financial failure. We know that she will bake again before it's over, so it's all a matter of realizing her life is that pliant dough she needs to shape. And she needs to be slapped hard enough to discover the courage to begin to.There is an antagonist who makes every step of the way more miserable, but she is only the pretty picture that we first meet, a façade as fragile as she is. They become friends in the end. She discovers sex that is not self-reproach. Joy that is not ego.The only downside is that for all the slaps she has been dealt, she only wakes up when the fat, unattractive bridesmaid lays it out for her.Story-wise it's as poignant as Adventureland strained to be, but even funnier than Superbad because the passage is already from a mature world. So every mishap is a laugh that wounds deeper and vice versa. It's a world where polite appearances must be kept, and the smile be fresh and social in company.Being what it is, the film can only support so much talk; the bottom-line for me is that I am given preposterous stuff to laugh, without feeling I'm being condescended to like a total moron by the wrap-around into actual life.",,Anonymous,Romance
HILARIOUS and NOT a chick flick!,"It's been called a chick flick so many times that my husband was dreading taking me to see it for my birthday.

Great,"Annie (Wiig) plays a character going through tough times. In fact, you would think it's a drama based on how depressed she is.

Every single scene she was in was funny. Some of the other bridesmaids were excellent like Rose Byrne and Ellie Kemper.Every situation Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo (the co-writers) put the bridesmaids in allowed the women to do what they do best--be funny.For people comparing this movie to the Hangover, they are completely different premises with a few similarities.

"Having the Wedding Cake and Eating it Too.  It's a Women's World, After All.","Maybe gross-out comedy and chick flicks aren't usually connected, but that should all change with Paul Feig's Bridesmaids. The Judd Apatow-backed comedy boldly bucks that trend by carefully balancing emotional elements and hilarious jokes. What many comedies are incapable of doing these days is getting dramatic points across while simultaneously making the audience laugh. And that is just where Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig's screenplay succeeds so brilliantly. There is, of course, a brilliant group of actresses that puts her writing to work as well. This cliché-busting doesn't last the entire movie, however--it regresses into typical romantic comedy territory in the final third--but no matter, Bridesmaids is one of the only funny comedies in recent memory.Bridesmaids' wonderful central character is Annie, played by Kristen Wiig. Annie's life hasn't been every woman's dream. Her venture as a baker has failed completely, she can't afford her rent, she has occasional sexual romps with a man (Jon Hamm) who refuses to be her boyfriend, and she simply has no friends. Even worse is the fact that her best friend (Maya Rudolph) is getting married and has asked her to be the maid of honor. And to complete it all, she has to deal with a troop of other women helping with the wedding. The ensemble cast is rounded out by Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLoven-Corey, and Ellie Kemper.But just why does Bridesmaids rise above other female-driven rom-coms? The simple answer is Kristen Wiig. Her writing breathes life into normally one-dimensional misguided women. The more complicated answer is all of the actresses' ability to make each character seem normal. More often than not, women with waists the size of toothpicks prance across the screen in search of a male counterpart that they hoped to marry. This is not the case with the women of Bridesmaids. Those who have married or placed themselves in other traditional roles have found themselves to be stuck in harmful situations. Characters like Annie who haven't still have their own problems. It's not easy being a woman, apparently (please note that I'm male), and Bridesmaids certainly glorifies living the life of a ""real"" woman who actually faces problems.Bridesmaids was nicknamed ""the female Hangover"" when the trailer came out. That's not a horrible comparison at times, but most often, Bridesmaids is an original movie. None of the jokes are borrowed and while some of the characters feel like Apatow archetypes now, each woman seems new and enriched. Even the method in which punchlines are told is original. There are two sequences, one on a plane involving a drugged out Annie stumbling through first class and one in a fitting shop involving food poisoning and a white dress, in particular that are notable for being especially hilarious. The delivery is important: in both scenes, five jokes come together in one big punchline that caused the audience to roar with laughter. It's a grand but all too normal affair and it works for almost all of the movie.If Bridesmaids is the future of comedy, I look forward to going to the movies more often. Women are just as hilarious as men. It's a simple fact of life that writers often ignore. And all it took was Mumolo and Wiig to show us this. Equally emotional and sexual, Bridesmaids is a smart comedy that only comes once a year. Say ""I do"" to Bridesmaids. It's $11 that's actually worth spending at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
chick flick concentrate = NOT funny in the least,"This movie is being advertised as ""the Hangover for women"" and not your typical chick flick but I find that to be the most false advertising of all-time. Not only is this thing a typical chick flick, it's like chick flick concentrate. I honestly can't imagine many men laughing or enjoying this film if they're being totally honest. How this qualifies being called a comedy almost beyond belief. It's an average story about a ""relatable"" woman with issues that grows and discovers herself and true love over the course of a film. YAWN. Very little is funny in even the remotest of ways. Maybe the ending could be considered heartwarming but any praise this film generates has got to be from people desperately wanting it to be good or wanting it to be funny because, quite frankly, it's neither.It is, however, a strong contender for most overrated movie of the year. If you're a guy, do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague even on DVD. Many of us will get persuaded to see it like I did but don't say you weren't warned.I'd say the critics don't want to tell the truth about this film because they either don't want to anger the women in their lives or their female patrons.

A real flick of the summer,"The Hollywood summer has dawned upon us and the first set of movies has been predictably thrust upon us with loads of sequels along with the much anticipated sequel of Hangover 2. Hangover 2 will be a subject of discussion in next week's review. But currently among the crop of movies released is an apparent chick flick called 'Bridesmaid', which by the title itself should be a turn off for men.But contrary to the repeated studio chick flick cliché, this one deserves to be called the sequel to 2008 blockbuster The Hangover, rather than the rehashed turkey that is to be presented to the paying audience next week.The wedding scenario that is done to death gets a fresh look and this one does not hide behind the curtains of sugar coated humor. Co-written by SNL veteran Kristen Wiig and produced by guy flicks veteran Judd Apatow, Bridemaid produces some shock inducing laughter's in sequences that generally would require the viewing men to grow a vagina to go through the entire wedding season. Kristen stops at nothing from a hilarious food poisoning emergency during the wedding dress shopping to virtual breakdown of one the bridesmaid during the pre-wedding all ladies social gathering, the movie just turns the entire wedding episode upside down.The ever miserable love life of Annie (Kristen Wiig) becomes to a virtual breakdown of her life during the wedding of her 'since childhood' best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph). Her unprofessional work ethic at jewelry store left aside; Annie is pretty much miserable in everything. Jon Hamm is the latest of her boyfriends that she has been dealing with; who uses her as 'f**k-buddies' in his own words. She is sharing an apartment with British siblings who are outrageous in their own rights. Finally, for her the bottom point in her life would if she moves in with her mother, no prizes for guessing that whether it happens after all.Things really start to unravel when the wedding festivities begins with Lillian aligning Annie with a blockbuster team of Bridesmaids for her wedding. Special mention for Melissa McCarthy who steals the show during the movie characters every comic turn. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon- Covey provide enough support to deserve their place in the movie. But it is rivalry between ultra-suave & rich Helen (Rose Byrne) and Annie to be the Maid of Honor that provides the background for crazy wedding rides. The sequences of their rivalry are some of the best cat fight you would witness without reaching to an actual physical fight. The movie manages to pull off a genuine romantic angle to Annie's story with a budding romance with a highway patrol police officer who more than obliges to pull over Annie for her various driving offences.Bridesmaids provokes enough laughter from its audience to make them forget about the Hangover they are or would receive while watching Hangover part II; which is if not funny and original then is at least a cautionary tale for the makers of Bridesmaids to tread the waters of franchising the movie only after a few after thoughts about not slaying the chicken that lay golden eggs. A final mention to Kristen Wiig and her brand of comedy; it deserves to be mentioned among the likes Tina Fey and Julie- Louis Dreyfus.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favourites of the year so far,"I have seen quite a few movies released this year, some brilliant(Tree of Life), some great(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2), some good(On Stranger Tides), some disappointing(Green Lantern) and some really bad(Battle:Los Angeles). Bridesmaids is one of the brilliant films I have seen released this year, while there are one or two moments where the gross-out humour is a little tiresome, I haven't seen anything this funny and this original in a while. The production values are great, the cinematography is crisp and smooth and the scenery and fashions are very striking. The soundtrack also brought a smile to my face, as did the buoyant direction, the original and well-paced story and especially the sharp and acerbic writing. The characters are examples of those perhaps that initially you think am I going to like these characters, but the actors clearly make an effort to give them personality and likability. Of the talented cast, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy stand out, both these actresses are brilliant, but Rose Byrne and Chris O'Dowd are also terrific. Overall, a great film and one of my favourites of the year so far. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Painfully unfunny,"While it's good to see a female-driven comedy written by women (though produced and directed by men), it would be nice if the movie had some actual humor in it. Most of the characters are consistently petty, shallow, dishonest, selfish, and have rather ridiculous motivations for nearly everything they do. The pace is slow, the jokes fall flat, and the dramatic conflicts are oversimplified to the point of making the characters look incredibly stupid for not easily avoiding them. It is beyond my understanding how someone might consider any part of this movie to be a realistic or recognizable representation of ""real"" women, or of anyone.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Queen of Comedy,"The Good: This is one of the best comedies of the Millenium. There are so many quotables, set pieces, amazing characters, themes, heartfelt moments. I don't know if I've ever seen a film really explore female friendship in such an insightful and intelligent way. Unlike so many bad comedies that come after, Bridesmaids has a simple, yet solid story to base the relatable comedy on. Sure, most of us haven't pooped in the street, but we've all felt embarrassed enough where we might as well have. There's certainly improv here, but it doesn't get in front of the story, an unfortunate trend of hat continues today. Speaking of which...What puts Bridesmaids over the top are the performances. Everyone from Wiig and O'Dowd to the minor characters like John Hamm or Ellie Kemper are freakin' fantastic here. The cast is electric and full of chemistry. This is probably the funniest McCarthy, Falcone, Wilson and Maya Rudolph have ever been. So many people never quite hit the heights of their performances in Bridesmaids. I'd even extend that to Byrne and Wiig herself.Man, this movie just rocks. See it.The Bad: The movie is a tad long and like many Apatow films, there are a few moments of extended improv that could have used an edit. I also think the movie sorta peaks at the Shower, but that doesn't mean it's bad afterwards. It's just not as memorable.The Ugly: Feig has made a lot of bad movies after Bridesmaids. But if it takes 10 crappy movies for one Bridesmaids, I'd happily take it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not that funny,The most this film got out of me were two or three exhales but at no point did I actually laugh out loud. The humour is mostly unfunny and relies on slapstick and gross out humour such as characters vomiting on each other and shitting themselves on the street to try and make you laugh. The bride character has no personality either. However I think the actors did fine with what they were given; it's mostly the fault of the script.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance

There really is no story line here, its quite predictably trying to implement a female version of 'The hangover' and failing.I found it hard to understand why some people were laughing for some bits of this movie, I believe it may be tuned to a very American sense of humor.I can't remember the last time I paid to see such bad acting. The movie is overall quite depressing and painful.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply put: My most hated film of all time,"You ever have that movie that everyone loved and you despised with every fiber of your being? That's this movie for me.Something I've noticed in reviews for this film is that the word ""funny"" keeps popping up. Yet no one can name WHY this movie is funny. They just say that it is and we're supposed to take their word for it.I'm a man and I found this movie horrendously unfunny and miserable. It's not like the premise is unfunny, so why isn't it registering with me? For me, the movie fails because it only focuses on the negative aspects of these shenanigans. It only shows how these events affect our hero in a BAD way. This isn't funny, it's just depressing.I don't know who would like this film, and the people I do know who like it can't explain why. I'm not saying it's the worst film ever made, but it's MY most hated.

Garbage!  Run the other way from this movie!,"It's another one-idea movie that isn't funny and has some really bad acting! It must be embarrassing for such a talented actress as Melissa McCarthy to be in such a piece of excrement. Kristen Wiig is untalented and not funny (like her characters on SNL). Maya Rudolph is as obnoxious as usual. The other girls are instantly forgettable (thank God).Kristen Wiig's script is LOUSY. It rates right down there with Ishtar. They should have hired a real writer. The jokes are forced. They might be funny if you're 12 years old and get a giggle out of bathroom humor. And when is Hollywood going to realize that ""Akward"" character reactions aren't funny. They haven't learned it since Jerry Lewis did them all 50 years ago!I can't believe I actually bought the Blu-Ray for my wife. I can never get those 2 hours of my life, or my money back.

Hilarious,"I felt that this year was lacking a good comedy and this movie really delivered. With a full female cast and randomly Irish (and cute) cop, Chris O'Dowd it was in-your-face hilarious. It was funny in a way that appealed to both genders with not a huge amount of ""inside female"" jokes and while the patheticness of Kristen Wigg sometimes got a little painful it worked for the movie. You feel bad for her but she's just so funny that you can't help but laugh between her troubles.Another standout was Melissa McCarthy who delivered her low brow humor with enthusiasm and absolutely no shame. Wait till you get to the plane scene. Wigg is overshadowed by McCarthy's banter with her seatmate.You believed in each character and they were all unique and had depth. Even minor characters had motivation and dimension. And there were some funny scenes... I haven't laughed so hard I cried in a very long time but you get to parts and you can't believe how well it is put together.So go see this, if you haven't already.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny for those who can make light of a bad situations.,"First of all, I've never felt more compelled to write a review for a movie. I'm in the middle of re-watching this film for the first time since I saw it in theaters, and was appalled to find its IMDb rating only at 6.9/10.It seems to me that most people have a problem with the sad undertones of this movie, which were 'unexpected' because of the movie's comedic label. Unfortunately, you all missed the point, not to mention the genius of this comedy. The team of actors who wrote and starred in this movie are incredibly talented, seeing as they were able to pull more than one strong emotion out of the audience during a 'funny' movie.They are simply making light of Kristin Wiig's horrible rut with infinite well-placed gags: from thoughtful humor to bathroom/bedroom humor. By taking a potentially dreadful situation and making fun of it, the hope is only that the audience be able to do the same in their own life. If we can't laugh, or at least attempt to laugh, during hard times...how would we ever get through them?Are the best films not the ones that bring us great joy (aka comedy) and sadness (the over-empathy some felt for Kristin Wiig's character)?Sure it is sad. If I do remember correctly, I teared up while seeing it in theaters. I am a guy, and it's not like I over-empathize with female life issues. Some parts of the movie may seem 'devastating', but the genius of this comedy is their ability to come back from tragic moments with killer/smart/crass jokes and sequences.Hats off to Maya Rudolph and Kristin Wiig (come back to SNL!) for this stellar comedy that had me (and is currently having me, wink) giggling in unnatural amounts. Also, many thanks to Jon Hamm for being awesome. As always. And Mr. Ireland was pretty good too.Whatever your take, this movie is and will always be hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why Can't I Rate this in Negative Numbers?,"If you love comedies where women fart, vomit on each other and defecate in sinks and in the middle of the street, you'll thing this film is a hoot and a half. Unfortunately, I don't. This has to be one of the worst movies ever produced, and I cannot believe the ratings it is getting? The acting was atrocious. The writing was ridiculous (not in a good way) and the direction was drek, which fits in with the defecation scenes. There are no words as to how bad this really is, other than to say that someone should form a committee to gather up every known copy, put them in a rocket ship and launch them on a collision path with the sun.

Bridesmaids is the pinnacle of modern comedy.,"Comedy not being my genre (at all!) I always go into one with extremely low expectations. I remember watching this for the first time and was blown away at how much it entertained me. I may have only laughed once or twice, which in itself is an achievement for a cold soulless individual like myself, alas I couldn't help but smile throughout its runtime. Now approximately on my tenth viewing, I still can't wipe that grin off my face. The story is pretty formulaic, a group of bridesmaids trying to outdo each other in order to be the greatest friend to the bride. What sets this apart is the smart writing. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo outdid themselves. The dialogue is on point. Not once, not twice, all the time. There isn't a single line here that made me think ""ohhh actually that didn't work"". Sure the narrative is filled with scenarios that's just asking for slapstick comedy, but that's a given in any film of the genre. Whether it be the airplane fiasco, driving recklessly to get the attention of a police officer or the food poisoning bridesmaids outfit fitting scene (which, can I just say, is one the funniest moments ever). It all works! The genius writing makes for some memorable characters. Each bridesmaid has a different personality and are able to bounce off each other beautifully in order to create the laughs. All of the actresses were perfect, like honestly the best casting choices available. Kristen Wiig was painfully good. Rose Byrne is always a favourite of mine. Maya Rudolph was surprisingly funny. Even our very own Chris O'Dowd was spot on! Melissa McCarthy obviously was the standout. Director Paul Feig owns modern comedy, and Bridesmaids proves this. Some of the scenarios are stretched out for slightly too long in an attempt to force some more laughs. And apart from the formulaic plot, I defy anyone to say they didn't enjoy this...even on the smallest of scales! It's just fun to watch and has reinvigorated comedy. Perfect if you're feeling down or want a good laugh with friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It was super relatable for me and I completely changed my life the day after I saw this. It gave me hope and courage. I am only cutting two stars though because of 1.

I Can Relate,"At fifty-something, I'm no spring chicken, and when it comes time—on rare occasion—to go to the movie theater, I want something I can relate to.

Being a woman of some years, I've seen all my friends walk down the plank into matrimonial bliss. I've done it twice, now, myself...what can I say, I'm a statistic. Just the same, there were bits and pieces of Bridesmaids that hit home. I've been in five bridal parties in my life, and along with my first marriage (kind of skipped it the second time around), it makes a half dozen moments of memories. I really enjoyed the movie. I recommend it to any woman who has been a part of the ritual. It's alleged as the female version of Hangover, but from what I saw of that, it is totally different. Hangover just seemed like someone pushing the shock value button while Bridesmaids was a lot deeper. What do you expect? Women have more substance than men.",,Anonymous,Romance
Women rule in 2011,"When it comes to comedies, anyone can be the star. Women rule in Bridesmaids, and boy do they make some movie characters, like the wolf pack in The Hangover seem well behaved. Judd Apatow, the comedy wizard he is in the 2000's, has made realistic teen films like Superbad and dramas with comedic relief like Funny People. He is a multi-talented screenwriter, director, and producer, and his charm is shown off in Bridesmaids.Bridesmaids proves that women aren't as calm and collective as some other comedies make them out to be. They are not always waiting to pay the guys' bail when they do something that gets them thrown in the brig. They sometimes debate how they will get out of the brig. Hall Pass showed women can have more fun than the males, and Bridesmaids shows women can have fun doing the men's job. 2011 is definitely the year of the women.The plot: Annie (Wiig) is a failed bakery owner who's best friend Lillian (Rudolph) is getting married. Annie anticipates she will be the maid of honor, but feels shoved to the side when Helen (Byrne), the groom's boss, begins to takeover and plan the wedding the way she sees it.Annie, Lillian, and Helen are accompanied by Rita (McLendon-Covey), the foul-mouthed mother of three, and the hilarious Megan (McCarthy), the chubby and outspoken hilarity of the group which derives from her quick-witted remarks and very relatable attitude to some women.Knowing a lot of my mom's friends, I could pretty much play ""who's who"" and put them in the roles of the cast. I had everyone with a secondary part and an extra laugh at every joke beside everyone in the theater.If cut appropriately, Bridesmaids cut fit on Saturday Night Live, the show Kristen Wiig is currently cast on, called something like Revenge of the Bride Buffoons. Wiig is extremely talented, and seeing her in Adventureland, Extract, and Paul I can say I've never seen a bad movie with her in it. We can all forget MacGruber ever happened.Even with Apatow only producing the film, it still delivers the charm and relatable characters seen in every one of his films. Besides having tons of comedy, there always is some sort of human-being essence to these characters showing them as more than just actors with lines, but pre-existing characters that are three dimensional. It is almost more than a movie.Apatow is currently working on an HBO show, which is looking interesting, called Girls about a group of twenty something females and their separate lives. It seems like a younger Sex and the City, and if it keeps the format like Bridemaids, odds are it will be funny and clever.Bridesmaids proves women can be just a vulgar, obscene, hilarious, and dirty as men. It is by no means a chick flick, more like a raunchy comedy with a heart. It lovable even at its most disgusting scenes. Even the dress fitting scene is hilarious as well as disgusting. It is one big mix of fun.Starring: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd, and Terry Crews.

biggest let down in a while.,"I was so so excited for this movie, I was sure it was going to be hilarious. But at the end I was left somewhat disgusted and severely disappointed. This movie fell into the ever growing group of movies that claimed to be "" as funny as the hangover!"", and what a surprise, like all the others, its not. This movie did have a few funny moments, I can't lie. Also a cast of great actors who played their various characters really well. But the story line seemed sorely lacking material and dimension, which they seemed to try and make up for/cover up with really long scenes. They would consist of a couple jokes that stretched on and on, It constantly got to the point where if a scene started and I was laughing or interested by the end I was just left wondering how long this movie was and when somethings going to happen. I don't know what everyone else finds so hilarious, but I'm passed drawing on magazines or books making the cartoons and models poop like I did when I was seven, and I graduated high school a few years ago, so I feel like I've heard all these sex jokes before.

Finally I laughed as I used to do at comedies in my childhood,"Definitely, people nowadays are growing more and more different and apart; otherwise I couldn't explain why this movie has so contrasting reviews on IMDb whilst other movies tend to polarise the opinions. I found myself wondering how do those who hated it look or feel or think - maybe it would have been useful if they had offered examples of what they consider good comedies... Or maybe it's just the people involved in the movie that provoked the rebellious reactions? I did not know who directed the movie or that Kristen Wii is a SNL regular. And I enjoyed the movie as it was, not very elaborated but alive, kind in a surprising way. A zillion kudos to Kristen Wiig - I for one loved her character! Brought a lot of optimism and compassion in a world obsessed with perfection, rules, the right look, relationship, job...the right everything. The gross moments did not seem artificial, one could laugh at them shamelessly because the action slowly build up to them. And they were decent, I've seen comedies with out of order icky situations and it did not feel that bad way here. The character is great: we have a loser who cannot stop herself from saying the most daring truths in the face of strangers or friends and who can accept herself and go on with her life as it is, even when things go from bad to worse. Oh, I miss the times when people like this roamed free, and they were not relaxed only if they were stupid enough not to realise how inadequate they were!The others are also good, kinda cooky but still plausible. I know: in a particular way, the movie manages to be innocent, fresh, childish. Which is rare nowadays. Maybe I was heat struck (the negative reviews really made me wonder), but it sure felt that way to us. I recommend watching it free of analysis, comparisons and antipathies.",,Anonymous,Romance
Funny-Funny-Funny!!!,"I have heard a comedic film is the most difficult to do and be successful. ""Bridesmaids"" is a film that meets this challenge head on and pulls it off admirably.Annie (Kristen Wiig) is a down-on-her-luck 30 something who is barely scraping by after her bakery failed. Her lifelong best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), gets engaged and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Although honored she is chosen, Annie feels as if her life is on a rapid decline and Lillian's is on the path to success.Determined to do the very best job at planning all of the pre-wedding activities she arrives at the engagement party and is introduced to the rest of the bridesmaids. She finds a rival ""Lillian best friend"" in Helen (Rose Byrne) and the no holds barred competition for Lillian's approval leads to laugh-out-loud antics and situations until Lillian disappears on the morning of the actual wedding day. Annie and Helen need to bury the hatchet to find Lillian and hopefully get Lillian ""to the church on time."" The remaining bridesmaids, Becca (Ellie Kemper), Rita (Wendy McLendon-Covey) and especially Megan (Melissa McCarthy) are all funny in their own right and without their contribution the film would not be as worthwhile. John Hamm, of ""Mad Men"" fame plays Ted, Annie's on again - mostly off again relationship.The film works well and although there are some pretty silly scenes the overall experience is enjoyable and the whole audience seemed to enjoy as well.I recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"45 minutes too long, 2 hours you'll never get back...","First, this movie is a very shallow comedy. No comedy of this nature should be over 2 hours. It means that the funny parts are far too spread out to keep momentum, and shines too much light on the generic, contrived story we've all seen before. There were a few funny scenes and lines (all of them in the trailer), and the rest was BORING. Watched with my wife this past weekend and we both were very disappointed as we had been wanting to see this movie for months. I'm certainly glad we didn't spend $25 on it, and even free (on the video player they provided on our United Airlines flight) it was still a waste of time. There were other movies to choose from and we feel duped into watching this one. We even stopped watching the lame Cars 2 to watch this, and I kind of wish I had watched the end of that one instead.

It's because I was laughing so hard my knees started to buckle, my face started to turn sweaty, and I couldn't control an ounce of my body.

Never has a comedy been this good at tossing punchlines out of the sky.""Bridesmaids"" revolves around Annie (Wigg) who is chosen to be Lillian's made of honor (Rudolph). However, things aren't so easy when she got used by her ex-boyfriend, her cake bakery got shut down, and Lillian's close friend Helen (Bryne) is trying to steal the pedestal of friendship.First of all, let me just say, the acting is just fantastic. Literally every performance is pitch- perfect, and I think not one ounce of improvement is needed. Kristen Wigg seriously is one of the funniest female comedians, and she make jokes out of a phone book and still be hilarious. However, my favorite has to be, hands down Melissa McCarthy. I kid you not, every time she was on screen, my laugh-o-meter skyrocket, my heart strings were tugged at, and I sat there knowing I was going to have a great time. Furthermore, I know I've said this like a thousand times, but the movie is HILARIOUS. I can't stress it enough. Guy, girl, homo, hetero, bi, African American, Asian, Caucasian.

They have a great funny exchange early on. Melissa McCarthy is going wild and crazy. Rose Byrne is a good mean girl of the bunch. Director Paul Feig has stitched together the gross out modern humor to the female chick flick comedy. And it works. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo have put a lot of charm and heart in this story.

Excellent Movie,"Bridesmaids will probably be the funniest movie this year. That is a huge statement.Annie (Wiig) plays a character going through tough times.

There, we meet the antagonist along with some of the other bridesmaids.Melissa McCarthy was unbelievably hilarious in this movie. Every single scene she was in was funny. Some of the other bridesmaids were excellent like Rose Byrne and Ellie Kemper.Every situation Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo (the co-writers) put the bridesmaids in allowed the women to do what they do best--be funny.For people comparing this movie to the Hangover, they are completely different premises with a few similarities.

"Great Comediennes, Excruciating Movie","What do Bridesmaids and the Passion of the Christ have in common? Actually, quite a lot:They are both wildly successful. They are both extremely painful to watch. And finally, neither is really a movie, for different reasons. Passion is a slow-motion torture of Jesus Christ, filmed from every possible angle, as the basis and justification for why you should believe in Christianity. Which to my mind misses the whole point of Jesus' message, as does Mel Gibson apparently, based on his behavior.Bridesmaids really can't be described as a film either, at least in the sense of structure, plot, and acting. I am not being facetious. Watching this film, I started getting the very depressed feeling that I had seen its style before. And then it hit me that I had; in every Will Ferrell movie. Ferrell's movies aren't written; they're improvised. And Ferrell doesn't act; he improvises. Which is why I can never see another of his films until he changes. I wasn't surprised when I saw the outtakes of Bridesmaids: Outtake after outtake of unused improvised scenes, exactly like every Will Ferrell movie. Why should I sit down and write out a screenplay with characters, plot and dialog, and then to create a believable character, when I can improvise it in five minutes? Unfortunately this trend is spreading. Watching this film, I recognized many ""improv exercise"" scenes I used to see and perform in theaters: especially the ""top this"" exercise, which makes up the majority of scenes in this movie, which go on and on until it becomes torture. When you see them live at a theater, they can be funny if forgettable. In a movie, it falls flat and is painful. I felt relieved at the end of the film, not anything else. I had to go do something fun after-wards. I have seen Kristen Wiig do some very funny things live, so I know she can perform. Whether she can create a complex and believable character based on an actual script, and not an improvisation, is yet to be seen. I hope I do see it, because I think she can.But I hope I never, ever see another ""improvised movie"" again. Unfortunately, since audiences to go see them and they are much easier to make than an actual scripted film that is acted, there will be more of them. Too bad...",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A must see movie!,"Literally the best, most hysterical chick flick ever! I laughed so hard that I cried, multiple times. Every woman needs to see this movie. Even some guys were in the theater laughing too, so don't think of Bridesmaids as a strictly chick flick movie. The laughs are non stop, with good humor and a great plot. You fall for the characters and you will want to see this movie again. Even the trailer doesn't do the movie justice, because the movie is a lot funnier than the trailer. Worth ever penny to see it theaters, and I will most definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. As of right now, this is the best movie of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
insufferable,"The movie is insufferable.The jokes are crude - farting, puking, food in teeth, body hair, cursing, etc.if you think puking is fun, you can find other puking movie better than this one.The protagonist is insufferable.The protagonist lies every other sentence.If you enjoy people lying, there are funnier movies out there.She's insecure, lying, phony, awkward, epic low self esteem.The sex scene is just gross.The only reason I can think of anyone would want to watch this movie is schadenfreude.I can't find a single thing to like about her, so how am i going to care about this story?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"World, meet Kristen Wiig.","World, meet Kristen Wiig. Kristen Wiig, meet world. This is one uncommonly hilarious actress delivering a performance (of a script that she co-wrote with Annie Mumolo) that should endear her to audiences from here to Jupiter. In Bridesmaids, she elevates an otherwise formulaic comedy to heights of unqualified enjoyability.Wiig plays Annie, a failed baker who is slouching away behind the counter of a jewelry store and having occasional romps with a self-obsessed hunk (the ever-dashing Jon Hamm) who would sooner perform an underwater shark-flossing than commit to a relationship. She had hoped for more, but she has resigned herself to taking what she can get. She agrees to be the maid-of-honor in the wedding of her childhood bestie Lillian (played by Maya Rodulph), accepting all the rights, duties, and catty craziness implied therein. Her fellow bridesmaids make up a colorful assortment of amusing personalities. Not the least of these is Megan (played by the scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy) who suggests enthusiastically that the bridal shower be fight club themed. Annie is immediately upstaged by Helen (Rose Byrne), Lillian's sickly-sweet and effortlessly gorgeous friend from her fiancé's job. She's fashionable, rich, and endlessly capable of making Annie feel hopelessly inadequate.The group embarks on a journey towards matrimony that is filled with that winning combination of raunchy gags and tenderness that has become synonymous with the Apatow brand (Judd Apatow, the writer and director of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, worked as a producer on this film). Bridesmaids takes the Hollywood assumption that female characters in comedies must be sweet, supportive of, and secondary to their male counterparts and drops a deuce on it. Jokes about explosive diarrhea and projectile puking aren't just for the men anymore. Wiig and her fellow funny-women embrace the sorts of gross-out gags that would make the Farrely brothers blush and the results are side-splitting.But the movie never loses sight of the relational heart at its core. Director Paul Feig cultivates a sensitive balance between situational antics and the emotional center of the story. In less attentive hands, McCarthy's Megan could have been nothing more than another punch-line but she is instead allowed unexpected depth. Wigg imbues Annie with an air of magnetic unselfconsciousness that makes her sympathetic as she struggles to overcome one failure after another. Her jerky relationship with a charmingly affable Irish cop (Chris O'Dowd) develops naturally and is thoroughly satisfying as a result. These are well drawn characters being played by more-than-capable actors.Of these it is Wiig's star that shines brightest. Her comic energy combined with surprising dramatic chops result in a performance and a film that is irresistibly likable. Take your bow, Kristen Wiig, those cheers are for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally!  A Female-Centric Wedding Comedy Done Right After So Long!,"""Bridesmaids"" is a huge breath of fresh air after the atrocious, forgettable messes of romantic comedies that were ""Bride Wars"" (2009) and ""You Again"" (2010) to name a few. After sitting through those movies, which despite their bad reviews were actually modest box office hits, I truly assumed the wedding movie was dead. Wedding movies of late were either overly- sentimental fluff that could be used as wedding planners' promotional videos, or uninspired slapstick comedy where attractive women pull mean pranks on one another.""Bridesmaids"" is already being toted as an alternative wedding movie because it's co- produced by Judd Apatow, and has gross-out humor that decidedly appeals to guys. There is toilet humor in only one section of the movie, and it is funny, but it's not solely what makes the film great.Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are two of the funniest and most talented women to ever come out of ""Saturday Night Live"". I always thought they deserved the successful post-SNL careers that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are currently experiencing, and this movie may ensure they get it.Wiig, as the star and the co-writer of this film, turns in a great, poignant performance here as Annie, a woman who is down on her luck in love and her career. She once owned a bake shop that closed due to the recession, and she's in a hapless, artificial relationship with a cad played by Jon Hamm.Her best friend Lillian (Rudolph), on the other hand, is getting married and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. The trouble is, Annie is not quite as experienced in planning wedding festivities as another bridesmaid, Helen (Rose Byrne), who is a more recent friend of Lillian. Helen is quite a bit wealthier than Annie, and much more ostentatious and bombastic about her position in life, although more subtly.It's really funny how Wiig plays up how enraged Annie is over Helen, and Helen is indeed a character who is easy to dislike. Many other Hollywood writers would have staged a big fight between the two bridesmaids involving throwing food and scratching. The problem with a scene like that is it's childish. You really wouldn't see women in their 30's acting such a way, unless perhaps they're on ""Bridezilla"".More to the point though, the movie works because it really centers on how preparation for a happy event like a wedding can be really stressful on different involved parties for different reasons. Such planning also rekindles hard feelings in some people over where they are in life, and why they are not where they want to be. For that reason, you really empathize with Wiig in her performance. Fortunately, it also helps that her comic timing is spot on.There are also great supporting performances all around. Melissa McCarthy (TV's ""Mike and Molly"") steals a lot of scenes with some gut-bustingly hilarious lines, not to mention a gross- out moment involving a bathroom sink. Chris O'Dowd also turns in a memorable performance as Officer Nathan Rhodes, and has many genuinely sweet moments alongside Wiig. The late Jill Clayburgh was the perfect casting choice for Annie's Mom, and has some great lines that keep the movie down to earth. It's hard to think of a better final performance on her part.""Bridesmaids"" did occasionally fall victim to a few wedding movie clichés, such as one of the bridal party members getting cold feet the day of the wedding, and a big name musical act actually performing at the end of the film. However, there is so much this movie did correctly that many wedding comedies have done wrong, especially ""Brides Wars"".I should note, however, that ""Bride Wars"" was also co-written by a female former SNL-cast member, Casey Wilson, so it's not entirely fair to rip on that movie. Plus, Wilson is a very talented performer who happened to be fired from SNL before she really got to shine. Considering how well Wiig has done on and outside of SNL, it probably wouldn't hurt for her to give Wilson some writing tips.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extra Rauncy,"Lillian (Maya Rudolph) picks Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her Maid of Honor, but Helen (Rose Byrne) vies for the job anyway and things get way out of control.This could have been a nice movie regarding friendships if the inappropriate and disgusting parts were eliminated. And, there were many. Let's start with the inappropriate and almost x-rated sex act in the opening scenes to the disgusting parts: a woman in a wedding gown defecating in the street ; a woman defecating in a sink of all places; a woman throwing up on the head of another woman also throwing up in a toilet; and language, language, language throughout. Do women really talk this way when by themselves?Billed as a comedy, there was nothing funny in here unless the disgusting parts mentioned row your boat. Women wrote this screenplay and when that happens, they seem to have a tendency to outdo the men to come up with Super-Raunchy stuff and that they did.The only thing that would change these disgusting acts is that they be shown as promos on network TV during prime time. Now, you know that will never happen. The promos only show you the tame stuff and off you go to what you think will be a nice movie regarding friendships and then get the shock of your life.However, there is a nice boy meets girl scenario when Annie meets Officer Nathan (Chris O'Dowd). These scenes are pleasant. And, later when Annie needs Officer Nathan to help find Lillian and she does crazy things in her car toward that end, Nathan won't budge because he was jilted earlier by Annie. These scenes are somewhat comical. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't like this.Ready for more shocks? It seems that if your character behaves outrageously in a raunchy manner you get a Best Supporting Actress nomination.And, one more: there is also an Oscar nomination for Best Writing for Original Screenplay. Give me a break. (1/10)Violence: No. Sex act: Yes. Nudity: No. Public Defecation: Yes. Children spewing F-bombs: Yes. Language: F-bombs throughout.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious,"Kristen Wiig stars and co-writes this Judd Apatow-produced film. It's billed as a raunchy, female-centric comedy, sort of a girly Hangover (which I'm sure was the original pitch), but it's far better than one might expect from that description. There's a real story here, with very well written characters. And, while it's absolutely hilarious when it wants to be, the pathos Wiig wants you to feel for the characters works. Wiig plays a hopeless woman in her mid-thirties. She has recently lost her bakery, as well as her boyfriend. The only attention she gets from men now is from a heartless prick (John Hamm) who just wants her as a friend with benefits. She's further hurt when her best friend (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's engaged.Wiig is chosen as the maid of honor, but she finds that she's in direct competition with Rudolph's other close friend, Rose Byrne, who is wealthy and can provide Rudolph with a lot of things that Wiig (who works as a saleswoman in a jewelry store) could not. The other bridesmaids are played by Wendi McLendon-Covey (of Reno 911), Ellie Kemper (of The Office) and Melissa McCarthy (of Mike and Molly). Their pre-wedding adventures generally end with Wiig screwing everything up. Chris O'Dowd (of The IT Crowd) has a nice role as a police officer who gets involved with Wiig. Yeah, it's a predictable romance, but O'Dowd's character is well written and he's very funny and charming. The romance actually develops quite naturally. Jill Clayburgh's final role is as Wiig's goofy but understanding mother. McCarthy, a very large and confident woman, is probably the breakout performer of the film. Everything she says and does in the movie is a riot.Wiig may be playing a character that she's played before on Saturday Night Live and in many of her film appearances, but it's still perfectly funny. And with the great writing backing the character, I'd say the performance is quite excellent. Byrne, who could easily have become a harpy, is given several small details that give us an insight into her character (most notably her two step-kids, who hate her). The film is almost cursed with too many great characters. McLendon-Covey and Kemper pretty much disappear at a certain point of the film, which is unfortunate. McLendon-Covey, in particular, is hilarious when describing her three foul-mouthed, chronically masturbating sons. There are also several non-speaking roles played by people comedy buffs will recognize, like Tim Heidecker (of Tim & Eric fame) as Rudolph's husband-to-be, Lynne Marie Stewart (who plays Charlie Day's mom on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Rudolph's mother, and Nancy Carell (née Walls, Stephen Carell's wife and former Daily Show correspondent) and Melanie Hutsell (whom I haven't seen since the mid-90s when she was on SNL) play Byrne's and Wiig's tennis partners in one great sequence.About the only thing I didn't like in the film was John Hamm's role, which is far too two-dimensional compared to everyone else. He feels like he's in a much broader comedy (I think Wiig just wanted to share a goofy sex sequence with him; by the way, between this movie and MacGruber, Wiig is the queen of the awkward sex sequence). Director Paul Feig is best known as the creator of the classic dramedy series Freaks and Geeks, and he's directed for pretty much every great comedy series of the past decade and a half, including Arrested Development, 30 Rock, The Office and Parks & Recreation, so you should know you're in great hands there.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
very disappointing and insulting,"I had heard a lot about how great this movie was. After watching it I am totally disappointed and it irritated me how horrible these women where portrayed. The maid of honor is a whiny ""poor me"" who can't bring herself to any level of self respect. The best part was when the one bridesmaid slapped her out of feeling sorry for herself. The ""beautiful"" bridesmaid was just a self centered b***h. The competition between the two brings women down to such a low level that it made me sick!! Yes, it is supposed to be a comedy and not a lesson on how to be a good person but this went so overboard that I felt little redeeming qualities in any of the women. There were a few good laughs in the movie but I would not recommend it at all.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hell yes!,"You know what makes a movie like this so good? It is that the movie is funny. Not funny in a ha ha, that was good way but you look at the person next to you and you are both equally shocked at how good the movie really is. Do the actors do their job? is the script funny? is the direction good? The answer to all of these questions is yes.We have seen over the last 10 or so years some really funny movies, and all of them feature women as secondary characters who might be a little funny but the focus is never on them for too long. Here the movie takes what could be another piece of garbage about girls doing the things they do before they get married and elevates it to a level of greatness that only the best of comedies can achieve.Kristen Wiig wrote and stars as Annie, a down on her luck 30-something woman in Milwaukee, WI who is looking for stability after her bakery shut down. She has a job she hates working at a jewelery store selling wedding rings to people in love. She lives with the most vile brother and sister possibly ever and her best friend who she has known from childhood Lillian is getting married in Chicago to a rich guy with a great job. Lillian is still the same great friend that she has always been and no matter how much money or influence her new social circle affords her it doesn't change how she treats Annie and that is commendable and a nice change.The movie is great, it isn't afraid to be dirty and raunchy and it loves the weird stuff that the women all do. It makes the women here equals with anything you might see in other Judd Apatow/frat pack movies and it gets the tone right. It could be done wrong on so many levels but it doesn't go for the cheap way out and it makes the movie fun and inventive and very good.Cons: It is too damned long, I don't know why this is the case with all Apatow movies her either directs or produces but damn, cut it down please. The subplots are a bit much in a couple of places and could be tightened up but this is a minor flaw in comparison.Go see this movie, it will make you laugh and it will do it often.

depressing not funny,I'm a bit surprised people consider this a comedy. It is actually a sad story about a woman in her late 30's who has a less than stellar life. Everything that happens makes you feel pity and disdain for the main character. It certainly isn't funny. Some of the attempts at being funny are mostly just gross or uncomfortable. The main character does some pretty hurtful things to her best friend that aren't really funny at all - they are embarrassing for the main character. The groom and the love interest of the main character look like they are at least 10 years younger than the females. I can kind of see women in their early 20's being silly like them but at 40 that is really more pathetic than funny. I watched this with my boyfriend and he didn't laugh at all. He thought it was a little weird this was compared to The Hangover. Honestly this movie isn't even in the same leagues as one of the Scary Movie farces.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridesmaids (2011) - What a Raunchy Wedding Group!,"Judd Apatow and Kristen Wiig bring their hilarious minds to the test, and they have accomplished to make the first ever 'rated-R' chick flick comedy. ""Bridesmaids"" is an example of ""The Hangover"" with female actors, and it's what I would call it: ""Wedding Crashers"" meets ""Superbad"". Saturday Night Live's Kristen Wiig, plays her first feature film role, as Annie, a thirty-something who recently failed to make her bakery, is living in an apartment with lazy siblings, and has a sexual relationship with Jon Hamm. But anyways, her best friend Lillian, portrayed by Maya Rudolph, is getting engaged and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. Then, it afterward leads into hilarious situations, where Annie and bridesmaid Helen, portrayed by Rose Byrne, are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian. So, the whole movie just talks about the misadventures of bridesmaids, until the big wedding day. ""Bridesmaids"" happens to be one of the best Judd Apatow comedies ever, and it sure has its moments. From an unexpected food poisoning, to Kristen Wiig drunk on an airplane, and some good old-fashioned raunchy humor. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo provided a well-written script filled with raunchiness, which is a good idea for a chick flick. The cast is so perfect, that I have to explain each one personally. Wiig and Rudolph have their most hilarious and touching moments in the film, Rose Byrne is a beautiful actress that portrayed the role perfectly, Jon Hamm was a little annoying, Chris O' Dowd makes clever optimism in his portrayal, but it's Melissa McCarthy that stole the entire show with such raunchy humor, and a performance filled with deserving laughs. Now, in mixed thoughts, the movie is such a long 2-hour comedy, the entire second act took to long to develop, and some characters were too annoying. But even though ""Bridesmaids"" is so long, and has hilarious material that makes people gag, it's worth watching this excellent comedy for the unique script, and clever cast. Seriously, watching this movie over and over, can still make you laugh every single time. ""Bridesmaids"", in my review, ""a hilarious, and deserving chick flick"".",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Wiig and Company Deliver Honest Laughs in a Freewheeling, Character-Driven Farce","What I appreciate most about Kristen Wiig's comedy style on SNL is her refusal to pander to an audience. Portraying her gallery of solipsistic eccentrics week after week, she's never afraid to be unsympathetic because she exposes a truth that is smart and funny. Translating her gift to the big screen proves to be surprisingly fortuitous with her breakout 2011 comedy, which has already been dubbed the distaff version of the alpha-male mega-hit, 2009's ""The Hangover"". They share an ensemble approach, a sometimes raunchy sense of humor, and the context of an upcoming wedding but little else. What you won't mistake this movie for is one of those dreary rom-coms starring invariably Katherine Heigl, Kate Hudson, or Jennifer Aniston.Co-written by Wiig and fellow Groundlings alumnus Annie Mumolo and breezily directed by Paul Feig (""The Office""), this is a sharp, character-driven farce freed from chick-flick predictability and showing the unmistakable fingerprints of co-producer Judd Apatow all over it. The plot centers on thirtysomething Annie Walker who is not in the best place in her life. Deep into debt after losing the cake shop she owned with a boyfriend who subsequently abandoned her, she is already a bit unstrung when her childhood best friend Lillian gets engaged. She names Annie her maid of honor, but there's competition for the coveted role from Lillian's new bestie, the wealthy and pretentious Helen. Much of the storyline focuses on the tension between Annie and Helen over Lillian's preferential attention until the wedding day. Within this context, much of the humor comes from the preposterous excesses that come from the ""wedding industrial complex"" with Helen obviously having the resources to fund them including a ludicrously over-the-top Paris-themed shower.Along for the ride are the three other bridesmaids - Lillian's cousin Rita, a sex-starved mother of three; Becca, a newlywed who pities Annie for her single state; and Megan, the groom's unfiltered, adventure-seeking sister. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan (the diuretic bridal shop scene is a hoot), and the shenanigans are underlined by the obvious rift occurring between two best friends when one moves on with her life. Beyond her comedy set pieces (e.g., her increasingly hilarious efforts in attempting to get a traffic citation), Wiig turns out to be a resourceful actress as Annie and dials back her trademark neurotic lunacy just enough to make Annie's dilemmas humanly relatable. As Lillian, SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph (""Away We Go"") has less to do but does it with warmth and wit. Rose Byrne, who showed deft comic chops in ""Get Him to the Greek"", captures the haughtiness and insecurity in Helen with élan.However, stealing scenes with sheer abandon is a makeup-free Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan with such balls-to-the-wall force that it's hard not to respond to her uncompromised honesty. Her character is arguably the most mentally stable of the bunch. Wendy McLendon-Covey (""Reno 911"") and Ellie Kemper (""The Office"") have their moments as sarcastic Rita and naive Becca, but they aren't given much screen time to flesh out their funnier bits. Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"") really nails the blistering albeit charming indifference that his character Ted shows toward Annie's romantic longings, while Irish actor Chris O'Dowd proves likeably puppyish as her burgeoning love interest, a traffic cop constantly reprimanding her for not fixing her brake lights. In her final film appearance, the wonderful Jill Clayburgh is sweetly amusing as Annie's whimsically off-kilter mother. It all runs a bit too long at 125 minutes with the resolutions a bit pat, but still, this is one of the funniest movies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The huge problem: Melissa McCarthy. That unfunny hack just added to the crapiness of this film. Who cares about the bridesmaids? Didn't they show what would happen with Made of Honor?

Not the typical romantic comedy.,"This movie was absolutely hilarious! Funniest movie I've seen in years!And don't get me wrong, the storyline and such were great, but Kristen Wiig just MADE the movie. Definitely not the stereotype/typical actress in a 'female' comedy. It wasn't the typical romantic comedy and that's why men should see it too (although more women than men will enjoy the movie because we can relate more to certain scenes..?).Please don't compare it with 'The Hangover'. Just because it involves a wedding and it's from the perspective of women, doesn't make it the 'female hangover'. This is a different style. People will watch the movie with certain expectations/prejudices if u compare it with another movie.I don't get the negative reviews for this movie. The one's that gave them, are they mostly guys? If yes: then go watch Shoot 'Em Up again and sush! ;)The one thing that's bad about the movie is the title, because it makes you think that it's another lame romantic comedy with only women in the lead role.Oh, and is it me or is there a link with Little Britain (besides Matt Lucas of course)?

Melissa McCarthy's character is the really funny one, but Kristen Wiig certainly does some neat things, especially on the airplane. This is one of those movies that represents some of the best that comedy can be. It's true that there have been a ton of comedies centering on weddings, but this one knows how to time everything perfectly.

Ticks like a clock,"Movie critics are supposed to be the ultimate arbiters of cinematic taste. The stereotypical image of critic is one of a dead-eyed, cynical intellectual, looking down his nose at the mere trifles before him. This is the image I have to live up to: high-minded, snooty, and highfalutin. So, what can I do with something like Bridesmaids, a film so decidedly low class, brimming with fart jokes, innuendo, and other aberrations? Well, if the experience of seeing it proves anything, all I can do is laugh breathlessly and wonder when the barrage of laughter will stop. In the case of Bridesmaids, it never stops. Here is a movie you watch twice – first because it's good, and then again to hear all the lines you missed because you were laughing breathlessly at the previous exchange.The film begins with Annie (Kristen Wiig), a failed baker who is drifting aimlessly through her life. She's continuously late with her rent; she habitually hooks up with a man who treats her like an appliance, and (to make matters even worse) her best friend is about to get married. Bride-to-be Lillian (Maya Rudolph) enlists Annie as her maid of honor. The inevitable hi-jinks ensue as we meet the rest of the bridesmaids: repressed Rita, innocent Becca, perfectionist Helen, and the sturdy Megan. Take this rag-tag group, a churrascaria, and a posh bridal salon, and you'll get one of the most revolting, hysterical scenes in any comedy.At its base, Bridesmaids is a comedy of embarrassment, rooted in the steady decline of Annie as she descends into jealousy. The script (written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo) is incredibly knowledgeable about the dynamics of female relationships, culling out every possible chuckle and guffaw. The film is Kristen Wiig's bed for comedy stardom, and she succeeds without reservation, effortlessly toggling between the comedic and dramatic notes. Yet to say the film belongs solely to Wiig does the rest of the cast and crew a major disservice. The ensemble is flawless, and the direction unobtrusive. Timing is everything in comedy, and Bridesmaids ticks like a clock.I'll be shocked if there's a better mainstream comedy released this year. Is Bridesmaids derivative of The Hangover? Yes. But on a character to character level it surpasses that film, presenting likable, three- dimensional characters played by outstanding actresses. What makes Bridesmaids so refreshing is the fact that every one of its gross-out gags is rooted in the truth of central friendship between the main characters.

I Have Regained Faith in Hollywood,"The past decade has just been awful for Hollywood. The latest movies that have come out have had the same plot, only just with different actors and characters. It's gotten to the point that I won't even waist my time or money on going to see a movie at the theater anymore, simply because I know what's going to happen just by watching the trailer. But, this movie was a breath of fresh air! Bridesmaids was jam packed full of sight gags and slap stick comedy! Almost every line was joke and it kept you laughing right through to the end.Usually in every movie you have an actor that either doesn't fit their part or they just plain suck. The casting director for this movie has done their job and done it well! I didn't notice a single actor that didn't fit their part. Everyone was exceptional.I usually don't give movies more than 7 out of 10 stars, but this movie was thoroughly entertaining and has EARNED 9 stars!Overall, awesome movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"NOT the movie that was advertised, but still a good one.","I had heard rave reviews about this film, and was genuinely excited to see it. The trailers were great, and the premise seemed to be very funny; the anti-chick-flick, but done in a way that both sexes could enjoy.It was NOT, however, the film that the trailers made it out to be-- which is to say, 'The Hangover', except with a female cast. You know; a motley crew of misfit bridesmaids get increasingly deeper into raunchy and improbable situations, and hilarity ensues.While these were some of the elements, it's NOT what the film was about at all. This most definitely IS a chick flick, no two ways about it. So don't go into the film expecting anything else. The plot is firmly grounded in well-trodden chick territory (bitchy and undermining BFFs, nice guy vs. bad boy, picking a wedding dress, female depression and self-sabotage, etc.)... its all there, and a far more prominent part of the movie than the heavily-advertised slapstick elements.Now, with that having been said, it is still a damn funny movie. There were a ton of truly hilarious scenes, and really well developed and relatable characters. It's not entirely the film that the trailers want you to think it is, but worthwhile nonetheless.Instead of 'The Hangover' with women, a more apt comparison might be 'Mean Girls' with grownups... of some combination of the two. Which really isn't a bad thing at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a let down for me,"I can see that many people obviously loved this film Bridesmaids, but I found the complete opposite! I expected a hilarious film which was basically 'the female version of the hangover', but it was not at all.The humour was not consistent throughout. Yes there were bits that I did find very amusing, however it was only certain parts and not enough to keep me entertained.I don't have high expectations for films usually but this really disappointed me :/ I think the storyline was a good idea and I can see were the potential is for it. However, it wasn't fulfilled. So much more could have been done with it and I am shocked that the director did not.With more work this could have been the amazing film it is meant to be, which it sadly is not.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surprisingly soulful, but too long","Kristen Wiig, you deserve and Oscar, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that. Maya Rudolph, you shat in the middle of a busy street. That takes some serious balls. In general I really liked this movie, and that ""like"" would be love were it not for the fact it sometimes dragged and let the air out. Could have been a crisp 90-100 min film, but for some reason that's verboten nowadays unless you're a small indie. Judd Apatow, I blame you. You're clearly great at what you do but you make us sit though epic comedies and it does the films a disservice. Overall though, I laughed, I felt for the main character, and I thought the film was surprisingly soulful. A generous 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow this movie is really bad!,I thought this was supposed to be the female version of Hangover. Like Hangover it made a ton of money at the box office. And like Hangover there will probably be a sequel or two. But the similarity ends there. Whig & Rudolf are from SNL and this feels like one very very long SNL skit. Ms. Whig is on her way to becoming the next Adam Sandler. I can't believe this movie received Academy Award nominations and a movie like Drive didn't (well maybe one for sound). Melissa McCarthy is very strange and because she is so different from most of the comedy actors working today she is very watchable. You never know what she might do next. I get the impression she will do anything for a laugh. A good example is the sink scene in the upscale wedding shop. When she hosted SNL she also took a lot of chances. I hope she starts to get better material in the future.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't know how much of this was improved versus being written but it all feels to organic and the cast chemistry is fantastic. I laughed so hard that I cried through most of the movie. It's so not a ""Chick Flick."" IT's SOOO MUCH MORE!The best part of this movie is that it's not gender biased. The cast is mostly female but, they are unapologetically raunchy. Think Sex And The City meets The Hangover. Judd Apatow just found his next major hit. The guy is just a comic genius.And it's not just the dialogue that's funny.

Just what was so funny..,"Annie's best friend, Lilian, has just gotten engaged, and Annie has been picked to be Lilian's maid of honor. Annie finds that the other bridesmaids are very different from her personality. Aside from that, there are a lot of other things going on in her life.

The movie could have been funnier if the jokes were toned down a bit. But they weren't. I found some of the jokes to be tasteless. I also found that I didn't feel anything for the characters.

Not everyones Bride(smaids),"This movie does divide people. It is very foul mouthed and it does not care if you like the language or the way the characters act in it. I do respect if people feel offended by it. Unfortunately that will cloud their view of the underlying themes in this. Just because it is crass and vulgar, it doesn't mean it's pointless.Quite the opposite is the case. You have strong themes of friendship, envy and growing older to bare (well our characters have to bare those things). Not to mention the whole wedding thing, that is quite a big deal for every woman. I didn't enjoy every joke, but I liked the way women handled themselves in this. Our main character has an arch and you can clearly see her progress through the whole film (and all the jokes).Again, if you are easily offended this is not for you. Don't expect it to be a female Hangover either. And then you might enjoy it too :o)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A BRIDESMAIDS To Celebrate,"TV's Saturday Night Live has long been a proving ground for some of the top comedians who have often gone on to greater fame. Witness John Belushi (Animal House), Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places), Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Will Ferrell (Anchorman), and Tina Fey (30 Rock) among many. Certainly a few have failed in films like Deuce Bigelow, The Ladies Man, and MacGruber. Current female SNL player, Kristen Wiig, joins the ranks of the former with Bridesmaids, an occasionally gross, yet heartfelt tale of self worth and ultimately love. After numerous supporting roles in popular films like Adventureland and Whip It, she has made the big leap into stardom, and she co-wrote the screenplay too! Annie (Wiig) is an insecure, single woman working a miserable job at a jewelry store and whose love life consists of impersonal sexual romps with a narcissistic playboy (Jon Hamm). Her dreams of a bakery having failed recently, she has horrible roommates and a doting mother (Jill Clayburgh) nearby. When her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and asks her to be her bridesmaid, Annie prepares the female bridal party for gowns, showers, and the reception. When Lillian's wealthy, 'perfect' friend, Helen (Rose Byrne), elbows her way for attention and begins to take over the wedding preparations, Annie becomes jealous and overdoes things in a display of one-upsmanship (or rather womanship). In a series of confrontational events, Annie sinks further into verbal ineptitude and embarrassment in front of her best friend. Along the way she gets pulled over by an Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who takes a fancy to her; what puzzles her is why any man would be nice to her? It all culminates at a pre-wedding reception where Annie unleashes her anger and frustration. Things get worse for her at work and her apartment, and as her world comes crashing down and she becomes an outsider to her best friend's wedding, Annie's fate takes a dramatic turn amid friendship and love.Audiences have been well aware of Wiig's physical and whimsical skills as a skit comedienne. What this film does is show an entirely different spectrum of her abilities as an actress and writer (with Annie Mumolo directed by Paul Feig). By playing a sympathetic character with flaws and yearnings and surrounding herself with a roster of talented actresses, Wiig has positioned herself as an every woman who has had life's ups and downs, but mostly downs and creating such pathos that the payoff at the end is more satisfying. The scenes between Wiig and O'Dowd, who make a terrific couple, are genuine and really hold the story on a firm emotional footing. As one of Lillian's friends, Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) steals every scene she is in and provides the film with some of its funniest moments in support. Even Byrne shines as the manipulative, scheming friend while Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey round out the wedding party. As Annie's mom, Clayburgh performs a sweet, final career note; this was her last film. Jon Hamm is only in a few scenes but is quite effective as a chauvinist jerk.There are numerous funny moments. A toast to Lillian and her fiancé by Annie and Helen develops into dueling testimonials that become silly and outrageous. When Annie gets stopped by a policeman, she displays her talent for physical comedy in conducting a drunk test. A scene where she sits at her mom's home alone watching a video of Castaway's scene of Tom Hanks losing his 'best friend' Wilson is a hoot. On the plane when Annie mixes prescription medication and alcohol, she becomes obnoxiously and amusingly uninhibited, and there is a running gag with McCarthy who thinks her seat companion is really an air marshal. Bridesmaids a film that is honest and direct about its subject matter and its consenting adults, and it has moments that are crude such as the food poisoning scene at the wedding boutique and some sexual gymnastics between Wiig and Hamm.The film is a bit uneven in places but when it hits the right notes especially towards the end, when a major character like Annie undergoes a transformation, it feels genuine and at times heartfelt, and we are the beneficiaries of something more than a pedestrian comedy. When her relationship with Lillian is threatened, Annie reacts in exaggerated, desperate behavior. She even has trouble accepting true intimacy from a good man because she has never been treated so nice. It's really about Annie being able to connect in a meaningful way with another human being. In fact, Annie's plight and desperation shares its DNA with Bridget Jones's Diary.With its predominantly female cast, this Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up) co-produced film delivers the laughs with feeling. Don't think of this as just a 'chick flick' but rather an entertaining, contemporary comedy that contains just a bit more estrogen. And do stay for the closing credits if you want a bit of raunchy fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Classic!,"I admit, I only went to see this film because of Kristin Wiig and Maya Rudolph. I'm a HUGE SNL fan. But after watching the movie, I really enjoyed it. It wasn't overly funny because they managed to balance the film out with a serious tone. I thought that Kristin and Maya compliment each other's comedic talents perfectly. I loved how it was witty funny. The improvisation brought the film together. I also really liked the message and the focus of the film. That friends always stick together no matter where in life they are, a true friend is always there for you. So if you have a best friend go take them to see it! I also loved how it's not just a chick movie. I saw a couple fellas in the theatre (not with any girls!) and they were laughing just as much as we were. Its classic slapstick comedy done right. I would definitely watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Women being very funny, very sweet and very rude!  You got to love it!","Synopsis: Down-on-her-luck Annie becomes maid of honour for her best friend Lillian's wedding. Fighting and bonding with the other bridesmaids, Annie attempts to deliver the best wedding she can.Kristen Wiig is officially a comedy Goddess. The co-writer and star of Bridesmaids takes centre stage after years on American television's Saturday Night Live and being sidelined with smaller roles in recent comedies like Paul and Date Night. Here she is barely off screen and is a hysterical joy to watch throughout. Funnier than the entire cast of The Hangover (either of them), she would be enough to single-handedly split your sides, but with an ensemble this brave and funny and writing this hilarious, Bridesmaids is a laugh-out-loud comedy that deserves to rule this summer. The sisters are doing it for themselves!Bridesmaids is very rude, occasionally very sweet and often ass-clenchingly awkward. If you think gross-out comedy belongs to boys, wait till you see these girls at their dress fitting. If you think men being mean to women is funny, wait till you see it as written by a couple of women. If you think the writer/producers of films like The Hangover push the boundaries of taste, wait till you see these girls get angry. But most of all if for some reason you think women, can't be funny, give yourself a slap and go see this film!The story might follow a fairly conventional path with the romantic-comedy trimmings resulting in an ending that lacks much surprise. However the narrative is tightly constructed and Annie really 'hits bottom' (allowing for countless awkward and self-deprecating moments) before the film delivers its predictable resolution. The script is brilliantly written with a touching and believable relationship between the two best friends, Annie and Lillian. The comic set-pieces escalate in a consistently hysterical fashion, standouts being the dress fitting and a plane journey that allows Wiig to show off what a gifted comedy performer she is. The script crackles with witty and memorable dialogue, much of it delivered by Wiig, but the supporting cast all get their own moments to shine as realistic and funny characters.The best reason to see this film is Wiig. There is nothing she won't do in this film for a laugh. Whether it's flailing her legs in the air in the opening sex scene, toilet humour, acting drunk, selfishly ruining parties, or swearing at a young woman, all vanity is left behind. Wiig's performance is consistently hilarious. As writer she has rightly put herself up-front, giving her a vehicle to finally show off her comedic prowess. The supporting cast are excellent with particular standouts being Melissa McCarthy as Megan (in another unflinchingly funny/awkward performance) and Chris O'Dowd as a sweet cop. However despite the presence of a couple of male British TV stars (O'Dowd and Matt Lucas), the women get all the best lines and even Matt Lucas is totally outshone by his look-a-like 'sister' in the film. All give solid, believable and occasionally completely over the top performances, but they are anchored by a sweet script that (like so many other Judd Apatow produced/directed movies) isn't afraid to poke and prod at the state of people trapped in unhappy marriages.Paul Feig directs effectively, drawing riotous performances from the cast and keeping the pace brusque throughout. Like many recent comedies that are produced, directed or executive produced by Apatow, the film is over two hours, but unlike some others, Bridesmaids does not drag or sag after the half way mark and its story feels full and not overburdened by an abundance of improvisation.The film is a sweet look at female friendships, the madness that surrounds wedding preparation and could be seen to deal with the pressures put on modern women to conform, succeed (in both love and career) and above all get married! Wiig's lovable loser clearly does not have enough respect for herself and the audience will find themselves rooting for her to make big changes in her life. However Bridesmaids is a comedy; there's no message of self-empowerment and marriage and heterosexual romance are still held as the aspiration for modern women.Aside from the overly familiar romantic comedy elements the film should be enjoyed for the hilarious script and the performance of a brilliant ensemble of very funny, very entertaining women. It is hugely refreshing to see a film with female performers totally lacking in vanity that is this rude, this vulgar and this amusing. Written by women, starring mostly women but aimed squarely at both men and women, Bridesmaids deserves to be a huge comedy hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like smearing yourself in your own stool,"After seeing this movie, or rather after seeing the first five minutes, both I and my girlfriend concurred that if there was any time there would be a legitimate reason to slit ones wrists, then it would be during or after watching this fart in your face movie.What the X$!? are people on, to actually enjoy such a worthless waste of film ? And to be nominated for two Oscars ? Put down your crack-pipes people!There isn't even a valid point to point out the horrible movie-angels and horrible way it was filmed. How unsympathetic, how hideous and pathetic this stool smear was. This stank of so much desperation in trying to make the audience laugh, that it would have been less embarrassing to try to explain how you ended up jerking off to two girls and a cup. It sure did feel like you were a cup!Now I'm not bent on using this kind of language, but I have never seen a movie that has made me want to travel back in time, to commit suicide drastically, just so that I would never have to accidentally see this mentally and emotionally challenged crap of a movie.Now even atheists have reason to believe that there is truly a hell to watch out for. Drag this out for all eternity and you will never commit a bad deed for the rest of your life!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delivers the laughs but remembers to keep the warmth and heart in there too,"I'd not had my fill of Judd Apatow movies when it came to Bridesmaids being released, but to be honest I was wondering how he managed to get as much success as he had and I had not loved his films as much as everyone else; so, although he was only executive producer of this, it was enough to make me wonder if it was worth the money. I went anyway and was pleased to find that the film not only did his style of humour but did it in such a way that the viewer is along for the ride and cares about the film rather than being on the outside, which I had found can happen with some of his own stuff.Bridesmaids follows a group of women mostly in their mid-30's and focuses on Annie, who is semi-trapped in a f-buddy ""relationship"" because it is at least something even though it is not what she wants. When her best friend gets engaged, Annie finds herself in a battle of one-upmanship with Lillian's new friend Helen (who is quite wealthy) in terms of showering the bride-to-be with love. At the same time as losing these battles, Annie's unhappiness also ruins other aspects of her life. It is a fairly relatable tale, even for men but more importantly it is very funny.In terms of the majority of the film what we have is a serious of comic misadventures for Annie as nice ideas turn sour; a pre-fitting meal turns into a terrible toilet-related experience, a fear of flying sees her drunk at 40000 feet and so on. All of it is pretty much par for the course (indeed the female characters even talk in the ""dude"" language of Apatow's films) but yet it works because it has energy and imagination in its execution. The script is tight as a drum and the awkward aspect of the comedy is well used. What really made it work for me though, was that I felt the film had a genuine heart and warmth to it that isn't always there with similar films. I understood Annie and also cared for her, so I had a connection to the film beyond waiting for the next laugh. Although the comedy did involve nudity, sex, bodily functions and swearing, it never felt cruel towards the characters or that any of the characters were simply written that way to get a laugh. Even with Megan, she was a funny character, but she was still a character I liked rather than just being the butt of jokes. I laughed frequently throughout but at the same time still cared about the characters.The cast are all good even though it is the oddest cast selection I have seen in quite some time – so many odd sources, so many faces I know from TV (some of whom never even had a word to say). Wiig is really relatable and funny, with just enough edge of pained loneliness to carry that side of the film; OK she should pay 50% of her fee for this to Tina Fey because of how much of Fey is in her performance, but it works nonetheless. Rudolph is really natural and the rest of the group all have a similar air of realism. McCarthy is hilarious, even in little asides she is great; Kemper sort of repeats her Office turn to good effect; St Claire is funny in a limited way while Byrne is just a perfect bitch with money and fake smiles. The supporting cast beyond this are such an odd mix of names and faces that even a few days later I'm still thinking ""how did all of that come together"". Firstly the male lead is an Irish comedian famous for a UK sitcom; O'Dowd does a great job and I thought he had an easy chemistry that worked so well with Wiig, but he was still an odd find. Matt Lucas is here too, and there's Terry Crews in a tiny role (Everybody Hates Chris), and the N.General from Deadwood (Ajaye), and John Hamm, and Michael Scott's old boss David from The Office (who doesn't even get a word); it is an unusual cast to say the least but yet it works because everyone (even small roles) are on point.Bridesmaids is not too different from similar pack comedies that deal with grownup ""dudes"" struggling with adult life, but yet as an end product it is stronger than these similar products. That the stars are women is neither here nor there, the difference is that although the very funny comedy is based on bodily functions, sex and exaggeration as normal, Bridesmaids remembers that it helps to like the characters involved and that it helps to give the film at least some heart and warmth. It is this sense of charm and warmth that made the difference for me – not only was I laughing frequently, but I actually liked the film for how nice it was as well.",,Anonymous,Romance

Funniest Comedy In Years,"The finest lead female cast since The Descent back in 2005, Bridesmaids boasts the talents of Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper, then throws them all together for the ultimate wedding comedy that has fiery confrontations, shocking behaviour, drunken antics and a lot of one-oneupmanship. Every time I watch this I'm in tears laughing, howling uncontrollably because of the jokes and perfect delivery. Kristen Wiig's awkwardness and eventual competitiveness as Annie is great stirring on the fire and tension for Rose Byrne's Helen, Byrne is at her best and as you've never seen her before. Melissa McCarthy simply steals the scene as Megan, I cried with laughter as she went through the story of how she fell off a cruise ship, and immediately after that comes the defining moment of laughter that is the endless wedding speech from Annie and Helen. Wendi McLendon-Covey is hilarious as a foul mouth sick of her kids mother whose incessant bitching about them gets more hysterical as the drinks come in, Ellie Kemper's best moment as Becca has to be her explanation of her sex life whilst on a plane to Vegas, and Maya's Rudolph's poo in the street in a wedding dress scene is outrageously brilliant.

Worst movie I've seen in a long time,"Few movies compel me to write reviews. I am writing this one as a warning.

People spending thousands upon thousands to look good, and thinking everyone should not mind spending a ton on dressing up, on attending or throwing multiple parties and then on at least two gifts.

What they gave me was an absolutely unbelievable script that was amazingly humourless and painful. ...but not in a good way.I was hoping for a simple, stupid comedy, but I just got a simple, stupid, depressing, laughable attempt at a movie.

"Sold itself as a Hangover for the girls, but both sexes will enjoy this comedy","""Bridesmaids"" is uneven at times but there are a lot of laughs and a lot of heart present too. My problems with it are that some of the gross out humor feels out of place and most of the jokes that don't work are related to some kind of body function. There are times where movie feels like it's being something else instead of just being itself. Thankfully, most of the gross-out jokes are dropped (along with some of the excess characters) a third into the film and it starts to focus more on the leads, their relationships between each other and the humor that is generated when everything starts to go wrong right before the wedding. It isn't perfect but once it gets going you'll appreciate the genuine relationships on the screen. You'll laugh a lot and it will amuse both men and women.

"Effortlessly hilarious, great characterization","Bridesmaids is a hilarious piece of social realist comedy; behind the dull patina of day-to-day suburban life for a group of Midwestern women is a constant stream of fearless, hilarious one liners. Mainstream critics largely applauded the film also, for building up it's sense of character arc and having a bit of comedic depth, the film celebrates the diverse identities of modern American women, and the casting is excellent.As with most funny comedies, Bridesmaids riffs on a relatable theme. Central character Annie Walker is in her late thirties, driving a bombed-out second hand car, depressed, incapable of finding a decent relationship, and already has a few age wrinkles. Her lifelong friend is getting married and Annie's stricken with jealousy because her lifelong (read: former high- school) friend is basically being stolen by an American socialite trophy wife; a young, attractive second partner to an anonymous businessman who's away from home most of the time.BE AWARE: virtually ALL Hollywood films feature a male protagonist, with female cast members appearing only to react to or enable a plot point in relation to the central male ego that the narrative serves. In Bridesmaids, the leads are all female, and the male characters mostly exist unseen or somewhere else in the story.The film goes a tad sentimental in the closing scenes, ending as all such films do, with a romantic conclusion - Bridesmaids isn't really about romance though, more the idea of life's failures and a type of crass, caustic humor that's very funny because of it's disarming honesty.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best comedies of the 21st century,"Bridesmaids is one of the best comedies of the 21st century along with Borat and About A Boy.

Downright Awkward,"Marketed as a female version of "" The Hangover,"" ""Bridesmaids"" is far in comparison. ON the one hand you have a movie about four friends who drink themselves into the most elaborate, dangerous, and hilarious situations; all while completely unaware of what is occurring. Then you have ""Bridesmaids.""Where do we begin? From the beginning of the film you just feel bad for the main character. You watch her daily routine and social interactions like a fly in the wall and just feel... awkward. It's awkward, because you almost feel embarrassed for her. Kristen Wiig's character is bitter and unpleasant and never lends herself to be liked. Even when you feel bad for her, it's hard to sympathize because her problems stem off of her simply unlikable personality. She finds herself in awkward situations that are simply the result of her own bitterness.Thefilm does lend itself to some isolated laughs, with several ""caricature"" characters that lighten up the awkward, distilled, feeling that is the rest of the film. THe most likable role is played by actor Chris O'Dowd, and you honestly feel bad for him. He's a genuinely nice guy who once again falls victim to the main character's bitter nature. The isolated comedy, comedic characters, and O'Dowd's character are the only things that saved this film from being completely terrible.If you like ""The Hangover"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" do not expect the same out of ""Bridesmaides.""",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I literally hated this movie. Not only was it not funny, but the scenes were uncomfortably awkward and hard to watch. I've never left the theater in the middle of a movie, but this was the closest I came. I only stayed because the movie had such great reviews, and that made me think it was going to get better.

Perfect Girl Movie,"Date: 10 June, 2012 -First Time Watch- Yes, this is definitely the perfect girl movie that provides laughs, sarcasm, and a touching story. The story focuses around Annie, a woman living in Milwaukee who discovers that her best friend, Lillian, is getting married. While Annie is happy for Lillian, she can't help but be sad too especially when she is introduced by Lillian's new friend, wedding planner expert Helen. Thus beginning a power struggle between Annie and Helen as they both try to impress Lillian and give her the wedding of her dreams. While I thought Kirsten Wiig did an amazing job playing Annie, I couldn't help but love Melissa McCarthy's portrayal as Megan, who makes a joke or gesture that makes you laugh every time she's on screen. But, was it Oscar worthy? No but it was still fantastic. Overall this movie is good but not fantastic.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not only is the humour terrible but the plot is very one dimensional and it keeps dragging on for 2 hours! The main character (Kristen Wiig who co-wrote this tripe) is very frustrating and none of the characters are believable. What were Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo thinking??!!

I'm a guy and I hated this movie,"This movie is long, far far too long. Every 20mins or so there is some problem that the main character faces which you know will take at least another 20mins for her to overcome. This happens roughly 6 times, which makes the film the wrong side of two hours long.I found myself truly engrossed in the main characters happiness, hoping beyond hope that she makes something of her life and finds the guy of her dreams. This was mainly because it would mean the film could be over.If you're looking to go somewhere dark for a couple of hours to get some sleep I suggest going to see this film as nobody is likely to be laughing so it will be very quiet, and there will be plenty of room to stretch out too as many people will have left in the first 10-15mins.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

She acted superbly but Her character was stupid and lost through out the movie or i should say that about the whole script. And just to have a happy ending things were sorted out without much effort from her. This is one of those movies that would give the worst meaning about Life and especially Women.

Whereas ""Bridesmaids"" delivers a funny script, a great story, a fabulous cast, ""The Hangover Part II"" feels forced, shallow and stilted.Kristin Wiig is great and did a fantastic job both in her role and as the writer of the movie. It soo good to see female comics and writers score a success for a change, to shut all critics up who for some insane reason think that women cannot write or direct ""raunchy"" comedies!!! Ever since ""Away We Go"", Maya Rudolph has been a revelation (not that she wasn't impressive before). I want to see more of her in movies, but good smart ones, like ""Bridesmaids"", not some crappy run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.Then there is Rose Byrne...I have a soft spot for her and I have loved her in ""Damages"", great acting, just like in ""Adam"" and ""Get Him To The Greek"" and now ""X-Men: First Class"". Besides being talented and smart there is a smouldering sensuality and sexuality just below the surface if you look carefully and really take her in...ahem OK this is supposed to be a review not a Danielle Steele novel!

Eeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhh........,"Kristen Wiig does a good job, but tires on you eventually. If you like some of her SNL work with insecure characters overwhelmed with anxiety that climax in awkward moments and dialog- this movie is full of them. However, as they say, too much of a good thing starts to become not so good. although I liked the character, it just was too much too often. The movie also has some parts that start off funny, but wear on you because of how long the scenes are stretched out (i.e.. the speech at the first party). Too repetitive a shtick in too lengthy of intervals. Also, Maya Rudolph is under utilized considering her comedic presence.As far as the overall comedy in the movie, it's a real stretch. I like funny gross stuff just as much as anyone else, but when you crutch the majority of the movie just on that element of humor it loses its appeal. It seemed like every other scene had a gross sexual overtone. Using some real comedy (situational, wit, dialog...etc) as opposed to relying on puke and crap would have helped balance the movie better.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Defines the meaning of a pure comedy.,"I would say that this film is the best in the comedy genre and that too female comedy. It relies heavily upon the acting and the amazing story. The story is a perfect mix of girl fights, jealousy, love and their guilt. This is the best film that any girl can expect. It would be very difficult to surpass what this film has created. The story revolves around the lives of few girls, one of whom happens to be married soon.

The main actresses gave good performances with a few laughs. The best scene in the whole movie was the scene of one woman trying to get arrested.

Hilarious,This movie is what the Hangover movies should have been... funny. I can't recall seeing Kristen Wiig anywhere before this movie but I'm going to keep an eye out for her. I never spoil movies in my reviews by telling you what the movie is about especially when I love the movie. This movie is a laugh fest from beginning to end. Well written and never a dull moment. Even though we have an all female cast in here this isn't a chick flick. There is some romance in the film but it is very minimal and works in the story and isn't forced into it just to have it in there. I heard they're planning a sequel to this movie but without Wiig. I could see that working if it is super well written but I really think Wiig would be missed. In this movie she basically plays the sane person that reacts the the madness around her coming from the other crazy female cast. I guess the only good thing about Hangover is that is brought these kind of comedies into the mainstream light.GO RENT THIS NOW.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Girls Just Want to Have Fun (too) -- and it gets even better with repeat viewings!!!,"How one feels about the raunchy female kink-fest Bridesmaids also hinges on how much one likes (and/or can tolerate) the old Wilson-Phillips standby, ""Hold On"" (for real). The song is an admitted guilty-pleasure to many (including myself); but Bridesmaids shouldn't be quite the guilty pleasure as that song as there should be NO guilt in liking this female driven Judd Apatow-production (thanks to him we have Superbad, Knocked-Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Anchorman, Step Brothers etc in our video libraries!!).It is a rare female-driven bawdy comedy along the lines of The Hangover (but NOT as graphic or extreme) that is smart, crafty and emotionally-driven with a mature-comedic performance by its star, Kristen Wiig (SNL, Knocked Up, Whip It). Wiig's Annie finds her life spiraling downward after her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph - SNL, Idiocracy, Away We Go) becomes engaged and her life appears to be approaching ""perfection"". I MUST say and stress that Wiig is a marvel here and her bridal shower meltdown is one for the record books (cookie, anyone?!). Wiig may have been around for years; but this performance solidified her as a comedy star.With a ""new"" best friend (Rose Byrne - Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later, Insidious, ""Damages"") who steamrolls into Lillian's life, Annie feels abandoned and alone when all of her thoughts and concerns should be focused on the upcoming nuptials of her best friend. The drama that plays out behind the film's comedy is surprisingly sophisticated and grown-up and very realistic. Add to this comedy-drama some fine-supporting players as in the UNCREDITED sleazy/sexist Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"", The Town, The Day the Earth Stood Still); a still radiant but SADLY late Jill Clayburgh (Love and Other Drugs, An Unmarried Woman, Running with Scissors) in her last role; and a perky Ellie Kemper (Somewhere, ""The Office"", Get Him to the Greek) and Bridesmaids has a little bit of everything for everyone (although fellow supporting player Melissa McCarthy of TV's ""Mike & Molly"" takes it a bit too far).Even if the film is all-about Annie and her fellow bridesmaids ... I think the story of ANYone being ""left behind"" as a friend moves onto the next stages of his/her life is a universal one. Wiig's performance captures the fragility of a scared individual who's life has not turned out according to plan ... but as the story (and song) can attest -- if one can ""hold on for one more day ..."" things may change.Life does come at us one day at a time ... it is too bad that films like this come around much less often. I must say that I highly enjoyed Bridesmaids after seeing it ONE time; but my opinion has only gotten stronger and improved with each subsequent viewing! I think this movie is something rather special.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Superbly acted, believably scripted, and delightfully vulgar: all in one.","Today, I got out to see Bridesmaids, a raunchy female-driven comedy that stars Kristen Wiig as Annie, a woman in her 30's, living in Milwaukee, and crumbling under personal crises. She's gone through a bad break up, has been forced to shut down her bakery, and has also been chosen by her recently engaged best friend, Lillian (Played by Maya Rudolph), to be the maid of honor at her wedding, but due to this wedding, Annie fears that she may lose the one relationship she's been clinging desperately to, and along the way, discovers that she needs to get her own priorities in line.Director Paul Feig, and especially screenwriters Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig delight in blending real human flaws and quirks with gross out gags and snappy one-liners, while still being able to retain control of character development. The movie is very sweet and thoughtful, and it's also the funniest movie I've seen this year, so far, even if not everything in the picture works. It has a slight tendency to drag, and a hit or miss romance subplot between Annie and an Irish cop.But where would this movie be without its great ensemble cast? One of the main cast standouts is obviously Wiig. She gives it her all in a quirky, and quietly subtle performance that holds the whole movie together. She proves she's got lead star chops to spare, so I'll be waiting in line for her next movie.Not to be forgotten is co-cast standout, Rose Byrne, who plays Lillian's rich, over preparing friend, Helen, with whom Annie is constantly competing with, and whenever Byrne takes the stage, she doesn't disappoint.Then there's Melissa McCarthy, who earns some of the biggest laughs in the movie as Megan, the raunchy sister of Lillian's fiancé. They're just the tipping point of a great cast that also includes Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, as well as the final film appearance of Jill Clayburgh. These cast members give it their best, and Bridesmaids benefits immeasurably from that.I'm gonna give it *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Hilarious with a Positive Cast,","Bridesmaids is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot, a ton of very funny scenes and an outstanding comedic cast. The films storyline is certainly nothing original, but a cast that were clearly very interested in this script and very likeable, dysfunctional characters make this movie very enjoyable. Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rosa Byrne and Chris O'Dowd, among many others, offer great performances in this film. However, the breakthrough character of this movie, for me, is without a doubt Melissa McCarthy, her character is simply hilarious, and is certainly the most quotable, everything she says or does is simply gold. Bridesmaids is a hilarious movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.After her best friend gets engaged, Annie is given the difficult task of being Lillian's maid of honour, but the other bridesmaids prove to be her biggest concern in organising the wedding.Best Performance: Melissa McCarthy",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridesmaids revisited,"In my defence I didn't get ""The Hangover"" either, the brother to the sister here. This, for me, was an overlong, only occasionally amusing modern comedy peopled with that contrasting combination of weird and supposedly normal people, put into supposed comedic situations by a bachelorette party staged for a prospective bride. Thus we get the creepily strange fat couple that rooms with Kristen Wiig's Annie and the even more overweight (the bigger the waistline, the stranger the persona appears to be the rule here) groom's sister with a penchant for puppy dogs and a flair for picking-out air-marshals on plane-flights who attempts to bond with Wiig at her lowest ebb. The story, if I can call it that, is told from Wiig's point of view and starts immediately with her engaging in casual sex with a guy who kicks her out of bed by morning and to whom she's no better than his number three shag. Some humour does emerge as she gets into a bidding competition at the engagement party of her best friend's Maya Randolph's new best-friend, the super-rich, super beautiful Helen, well-played by Rose Byrne but after that the humour gets scatological at a posh bridal-wear shop, drunken on board an aborted plane flight to Vegas and finally kooky and at times surreal encounter with an off-beat cop with whom she makes an unlikely connection. Of course it all ends up happily at the wedding, her best-friend credentials to the bride re- established as they belt out Wilson Phillips' feminist anthem ""Hold On"" and she gets reunited with her cop but by then the laugh count had dropped even more. I'm vaguely aware that this strain of humour mixing gross, crazy people with so-called normals is all the rage - I've not even mentioned Jill Clayburgh as Wiig's, yes you guessed it, wigged-out mother, or some of the other bridesmaids who drop out of the picture after an hour or so, but this slacker humour just doesn't float my boat, especially when it runs way beyond 2 hours in the telling.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Really good film,"Surprising in several ways how much I enjoyed this, expecting it to be a film for a female but it was far from that, in fact to the contrary it with much emphasis on a dry humour it was probably more suited to a male audience.It was pleasantly refreshing to see, in the main, a more written based comedy rather than the simple visual and crude masturbation type gags of Hangover & the In Betweeners. I had to check a couple of times on the level of English imput into this film, as the style of humour was unlike anything I'd seen out of the States and after too many attempts to count have probably laughed more than three times at a film from outside of the UK or Australia for the first time since Airplane.It's not to that standard, but can be applauded for at least half a dozen genuinely funny scenes, good characters and further refreshing to see it written by females. One of the criticisms, if any were that having watched the additional/deleted scenes there were several that probably warranted a place in the film and would have improved it.7/10 is extremely low, given some of the recent films that pass as comedy on a rating closer to 8.

Title doesn't make sense,"I really enjoyed this movie and laughed out loud in the theater. A lot. It was like the female version of The Hangover in a lot of ways. However, this movie isn't really about bridesmaids; rather it's about a woman (Kristin Wig's character) waking up to her current lifestyle, hitting rock bottom, and finally taking responsibility for herself. Where the Hangover stuck to the main plot throughout the entire film, Bridesmaids flips back & forth between Annie's personal/love life and her role in her best friend's wedding. It was a good mix of emotion and comedy so I never got bored and was always surprised.

Great honest performances,"Bridesmaids really is what is seems: a funny, loose, entertaining and interesting movie with well developed characters that use a simple story to show the relationship between them and also their personal crisis, all centered by a woman that is living the worst moments of her life few days before her best friend's wedding.Bridesmaids is being compared to The Hangover (2011) which isn't fair, because this one may seems a chick flick but it's not just for having more important qualities. The Hangover is just a male celebration without any other interest than just make audience laugh and have fun with absurd situations involving male culture and cliché comedy situations effectively used.Written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, the movie is not absurd. The female culture is there for sure when talking about marriage crisis and all that bridesmaids culture, but it's just a background story. The personal dramas, the difficulties to achieve some objectives in life, relationship crisis between love and friends, the feeling that the world is conspiring against your wills... all of this is universal and everyone goes thru it at least one time in life. The movie shows it all in brilliant small doses without being corny for the effective use of comedy moments to relieve what would seems melodramatic, also it's not cheesy because there are amazing performances by an ensemble cast that most of the times use improvised dialogs and moments, making the movie flows naturally and with no pressures or high intents to be funny.Kristen Wiig shines and gears entire movie, her performance is stunning. Being or not being based on personal experiences, her character fits her perfectly. Rose Byrne also have her important moments and proves one more time that she's getting better with each new work. The other supporting characters are well placed, even some of them being a little underused.Predictable? Yes, but loved it anyway. It's impossible not be fascinated by so charismatic characters within simple and at the same time amazing funny and heartfelt moments that never requires more than great honest performances.As another one said: ""It's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Shallow, hollow and silly unfunny comedy about the dreadful ""wedding"" planning","It is astonishing to think that this piece of shallow silliness got two Oscar nominations. However, it works very well as an indicator of the sorry state of contemporary society. The story revolves around Annie Walker, a most annoying woman who would be a perfect character for a cheap sitcom.Annie alleged best friend Lillian is getting married and that horrendously stressing event that is an American wedding must be organized. Countless chick flicks have been there, only to underline how the true meaning of getting married and any shred of happiness are lost in the process of having so much ""organized"" fun.In this case, wedding planning is complicated by the presence of new BFF Helen, a rich, good looking woman who is stealing Annie's thunder. Not that Annie has much thunder. She works as a shop assistant, lives with a grotesque couple (in the movie for no reason whatsoever) and is sabotaging her relationships. Despite all this, some sort of happy ending is on sight.The whole movie is peppered with overlong scenes (Annie on the plane, Annie with flatmates...) scatological language, poop, vomit and vulgarity. Even the late Jill Clayburgh, actress of a certain class, is not spared.This cringe-worthy movie was produced by Apatow and co-written by Kristen Wiig, who is also starring – and appearing in every scene - as main character Annie Walker.If you know a bit about movies, this can explain why it is so bad. Apatow is the king of crass, vulgar, unfunny comedies. Wiig wanted to make clear she is the star. Unfortunately, like most female comedians, she seems to think that the only way to make women ""funny"" is to degrade them. Surely they get plenty of humiliations in this movie, but this does not make the movie funny in any way.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not really funny...but why?!?,"Maybe it'a because I'm a guy? I just don't get the appeal of this movie. I've watched it twice now...I don't get the humor...and this movie should be in my wheel-house.

This really was a recipe for success...but for me it just didn't work.Maybe their over the top humor was just too unrealistic or maybe it was the catty nature of the women in the bridesmaids party?I can't pinpoint it.

Hilarious!!!!!!,"I was worried because the reviews were so good, and sometimes when expectations are high going in, you are disappointed! But this was not the case here!!! This movie was hilarious from beginning till end!!! Kristen was awesome, believable, relate-able. Melissa Mc Carthy stole the show for sure!!! This movie was over 2 hours, but it did not seem too long at all. There was never a dull moment! I saw this twice, once with girlfriends and once with my husband and another couple. The second time, my friend's husband was laughing louder than any woman in the theater!! There is raunchy jokes, potty humor and language in this film. If you are not into that, you may not enjoy this! Personally I loved it and would could watch this again and again!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Worth the $10, but you could wait till DVD release!","So I saw this with my mom, which is the perfect person to see it with. As this movie encompasses nothing more than an uncomfortable intro, a warming middle section, and an ""I have a cramp from laughing"" ending.From the beginning scenes you couldn't really tell if you would enjoy this film or be suffering through 2+ hours of I want to be funny but I am not really! The best friend chemistry between Maya Rudolph and Kristian Wiig was hard to find. Despite this however, out of no where you find yourself smiling. And it turns out that smile was the movie stretching your face muscles for some strong laughs that last through out the film. The film follows in the tradition of the ""Hang Over,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" and ""40 year Old Virgin."" But it stands on it own by presenting a strongly funny all female cast that could be the beginning of a new comedic voice(Kristin Wigg). Just wish it could have been about a 1/2 hour shorter.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great comedy for all to enjoy,"What I loved about this film mostly is these ladies don't mind not looking glamorous if it means they will get a laugh. This is a rare thing, Hollywood women rarely are seen in an uncompromising state. Taking a film like the hangover, the women are sensible and the men make complete fools of themselves. Heaven forbid the ladies look like they have fun, its a rather stifling look at women in comedy, especially when you look at romantic comedies where the female leads rarely make much of a lasting impression.Enter Bridesmaids which is unashamedly funny, there are so many laugh out loud moments that some of the slower moments can be forgiven. The lead performance by Kristen Wigg is fantastic, as a neurotic down her luck girl, with a sharp tongue and a magnet for disaster. Bridesmaids works in the same way The hangover did, a great ensemble in that each bring something different to the table. Though at times I felt more could have been done with the supporting cast, Kristen Wiggs character is so much fun its only a minor grievance.The film is a laugh riot that should appeal to everyone, despite it looking more like a girls film, it is genuinely universally amusing. In fact there is enough gross out humour to compete with likes of American Pie.Bridesmaids is without a doubt the funniest film I've seen this year, though the ending I felt was a little bit too neat any negatives are fairly minor and are made up for by so many laugh out loud moments. I would rather watch this a thousand times than watch the hangover part 2 again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bridesmaids Revisited - a wedding movie with more punch?,"The acting in this film is excellent; despite the comic and crazy dialogue, there is a lot of subtlety in the delivery. Lead actress Kristen Wiig is superb as Annie, the maid of honour, working fluidly alongside a talented and well directed cast. Interestingly, the only actors that didn't fit for me were Annie's English flat mates, Gil and Brynn (played by Matt Lucas and Rebel Wilson), whose inclusion is baffling - those scenes could easily have been edited out with no detriment to the final film.Unlike other wedding films, this one has a bit more bite and language - so a welcome change for a genre that was in danger of being dominated by slush. An excellent comedy that has a bit of soul and keeps the laughs coming.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bridesmaid takes a twist on the typical wedding-focused film!,"""Bridesmaids"" does an excellent job recreating the typical wedding- focused romantic comedy by switching the focus from the bride-to-be to her bridesmaids. Instead of having to worry about the bride being left at the altar, the audience's concern is placed on the power battle between maid-of-honor (Kristin Wigg) and bridesmaid (Rose Byrne) in their attempts to woo the bride (Maya Rudolph). The events leading up to the big day highlight the ridiculousness and humor in their actions.Lillian, the bride, chooses life-long best friend, Annie, to be her maid-of-honor alongside her husband's boss's conniving wife, Helen. Helen's mission is to compete for Lillian's friendship and upstage Annie's efforts whenever she can get the chance. However this wedding couldn't be taking place at a worse time in Annie's life. Annie resorts to being unhappily employed at a jewelry store after her baking business fails. The wedding can't help but remind her that she's single and struggling to find a significant intimate relationship. Ted (John Hamm) further lowers Annie's self-esteem by keeping her around as his personal booty-call. Annie can't help feeling threatened by the constant input from perfect, glamorous Helen. The rivalry between the two provides endless entertainment for the bridal party.Writers, Kristin Wigg and Annie Mumolo, crafted the script to include two different kinds of humor. The first contains the simpler, stupid jokes that are expected of a romantic comedy. This is evident when Annie's roommate pours frozen peas over herself instead of using them as an ice pack. The classic usage of food stuck in one's teeth and awkwardness in the bedroom are also presented. On top of this, the uniqueness of this film is accentuated, with Wigg and Mumolo's use of crazy funny. Annie completely loses her professionalism at work when she yells at a young girl for wanting to buy a friendship bracelet. This convention of insanity is seen again during the bridal shower when Annie overreacts and trashes the party. The combination of these two elements makes the film's humor unforgettable.The key performer and bridesmaid in this film is Saturday Night Alumni actress, Kristin Wigg. Director, Paul Feig, makes use of the character, Annie, by taking her on the biggest emotional journey of them all; it completely outshines the experience of the bride. The viewer wants to sympathize with Annie's character because her low self-worth disadvantages her from the start. Annie learns how to ""fight for her shitty life"" and become aware of the things that are important to her. Although she was not thrilled about planning a wedding she steps up to the plate when fellow bridesmaid, Helen, tries to take over the show.Overall the film provides a hilarity that is not normally produced by romantic comedies. Although there are a few tangents to the main plot, it keeps the audience's interest from the very beginning with its lively script. The film goes beyond the surface by displaying the bridesmaid's motivations to succeed in the wedding for Lillian. Even ""evil"" Helen becomes a person the viewer wants to get to know more about.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

More enjoyable than the rating on IMDb,"We set out to watch the female equivalent of The Hangover, we were wrong. And gladly so. This film was far more entertaining than we expected. At the time of viewing IMDb rating was only a 7, so this left us with a low expectation. Pleasantly surprised, and Kristen Wig was fantastic. We finished up wondering what all those who rated this lowly actually expected. Great movie, entertaining and light. The laughs were nicely spread out through the movie and at no stage did it lag. Some great supporting cast with the guy from the English TV series The IT crowd and also Matt Lucas from Little Britain. Don't expect them to be funnier or get too much limelight. the star of the show is Wiig. Obviously a very talented and underrated artist, writer, comedienne, actress, producer and not bad on the eye either.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointed!,"I'm wondering how this film earned Academy Award nominations for best supporting actress (Melissa McCarthy) and Kristen Wiig for original screenplay. They didn't win the awards but I'm wondering how this film got nominations in the first place. Wiig wrote and played the main role of Annie, a failed baker, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her best friend played by Maya Rudolph is getting married and she's maid of honor too. The previews made the film look funny but it is actually sad and awkward at times. Annie feels and acts like a failure because she had low self esteem. McCarthy is always a hoot but I didn't understand her character as the groom's sister. Wiig is talented in her character's self- deprecating sense of humor. I just wished the film had more funny moments. This is first rate cast including the late great actress Jill Clayburgh as Annie's mother in probably one of her last film performances. The trip to Las Vegas was a total waste in actuality.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Decently Funny and Heartfelt, A Bit Chick-Flicky, Not Really Gross","So, you all know the story. Kristen Wiig plays Annie, the oldest best friend of Lillian (Maya Rudolf), the bride. Annie is down on her luck after her bakery goes out of business, and she has a cad of a boyfriend played by John Hamm. Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor. However, Lillian now has another close friend named Helen (played by Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, beautiful, thin, and sophisticated. So, Helen begins to dominate the wedding activities like picking the dresses, planning the bachelorette party, hosting the wedding shower, etc. Annie's bridesmaid outing to a Brazilian Steakhouse is a big flop, and everything Helen does is beautiful. Annie gets really jealous and ticked off by Helen and after many problems, gets kicked out of the wedding by Lillian.This movie was just decent for me. Fairly funny with a few times where the crowd did burst into laughter. However, it was not laughs from start to finish. The characters were pretty well developed, and it was a bit chick-flicky. Annie has some pity party moments, and near the end Lillian and Annie sit on Lillian's bed and talk over all Lillian's bride panic problems. That was a bit ""womanly"" emotional stuff to me (a guy).A pleasant surprise was Chris O'Dowd playing a cop, Officer Nathan Rhodes. He pulls Annie over for broken tail lights on her car. Nathan is charming, funny, believable, and sincere as he falls for Annie.Other reviewers complain about the toilet humor and sex in the movie. I did not see any problem with it. The toilet issues relate to food poisoning, and are limited to one scene. There is relatively little sexual content. A couple of scenes of Annie lying next to a man in bed with no action or body parts. Just lying in bed. A few humorous bits of dialog here and there about sexual topics, but nothing really graphic or gross.Worth the $1.50 I paid for it.",,Anonymous,Romance

Finally Females,"The soulfully, relatable comedy is nicely blended with over the top crass, crude humor. The amusingly unique movie plays out from the female standpoint and mentality and that differs from movies of this kind that are typically based upon the male psyche. It is up there with the best of the irreverent, nasty comedies of this genre such as the Hangover, Knocked up and Superbad.By creating a cynical theme, due to the melancholy, jealousy and nihilism that the friend believably feels from the occurrence of her bff getting married, a crass/slapstick comedy evolves into a dark and sophisticated one. When a Bff gets married resulting in the inevitable ""growing apart"" while at the same time the friend not getting married feels as though she is going nowhere a soulfully bluesy mood resonates. The acting amongst the main characters, especially their connection with each other was well done.The assortment of side characters and bridesmaids were well developed. We really cared about these supporting characters since their own histories, and idiosyncratic personality traits created complex eccentrically believable personas. Especially amusing were the heavy set bridesmaid and the policeman.Finally the typical plague that frequently decimates movies of the genre, the overlong sappy ""tie things neatly together"" moments, did not go on too long. Instead what was wisely focused on was crude, slapstick humor, developed side characters and real connections between friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

You just have to divine the odor,"For awhile I thought I'd lost my bearings on knowing what makes a film popular. I'm relieved to say it was just temporary. The film which made me question my ability was ""Bridesmaids"". An outstandingly tacky and outrageously badly acted piece of work if there ever was one.Guided by all the positive reviews from the usual media suspects, I watched this film with others. Quite early on we were throwing popcorn and booing: We must have got the wrong movie, but no this was it!The first inkling that reviewers had acted like lemmings in gushing all over this movie was the IMDb score. It is low for a highly acclaimed, mass audience film. The next and more telling indicator is the review in Variety which rated it pretty bad!Lastly, in a film festival forum (now a YouTube video) the director of Bridesmaids was asked what his formula for success was? He said not following the script! Hey! It had a script, could have fooled me! You can't knock its success though, Bridesmaids has grossed over $250m!Here's the insight. When the lady who gets over 50,000 viewers on YouTube watching her dog fart was asked what she would do for an encore, she replied add another farting dog on her show!There's a market for this type of entertainment.

Kristen Wiig's (Annie) character with her dry humor and side commentary, and Melissa McCarthy's (Megan) character with her in-your-face-but-likable manner, were the most hilarious.

A smart and funny movie--not just for women,"A very funny movie, ""Bridesmaids"" is more than just a female take on ""The Hangover."" Although the movie did contain some thematically Hangover-like elements (general silliness and buffoonery), one scene in particular—and I'm talking about the scene when the bridesmaids all go shopping for their dresses after having dined at a questionable Brazilian restaurant—manages to outgross even some of the raunchiest ""guy"" movies. Kristen Wiig is hilarious (as always) as the main character whose life is spiraling to rock-bottom (loser boyfriend—played by an uncredited Jon Hamm at his absolute smarmiest, lousy job, bizarre roommates) just as her bff (Maya Rudolph) is planning her wedding with the assistance of a new buttinsky bff, played with appropriately haughty aplomb by Rose Byrne. Melissa McCarthy is offensively hilarious as the earthy sister-of-the-groom who lacks any sense of tact, and Jill Clayburgh (in her final film role) is quirkily earnest as Wiig's mom. Although the film devolves somewhat into a typical happily-ever-after master narrative (Wiig's character really can't be happy until she finds a man—luckily, that man is played by the handsome and charming Irish actor Chris O'Dowd), its sharp sense of humor and caustic wit definitely make it worth seeing.

Slow and unfocused comedy,"I can hardly find something interesting in one of the few movie I stopped watching after some 80 minutes. Good comedies know that you can't have the right rhythm with a total length far beyond the 90-minute mark. OK I knew it was a bad idea to get the 'Unrated version', i.e. some marketing ploy to make you feel you'll get an exclusive product when buying the DVD while it's only the original professional cut inflated by dozens of minutes that were originally thought useless (and most probably counter-productive).Still, at over 2 hours Bridesmaids is clearly overlong and you can tell it from the very start. Scenes lead to other scenes without the rhythm ever picking up. The lead is mostly pathetic, and it's rarely pathetic-funny, and even then the hurtfully pathetic annihilates the good jokes. With such a slow rhythm you also have plenty of time to see the ensemble cast is only made of one-dimensional characters.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's not what you think it is!,"It doesn't happen often that I would give 10 stars to a movie just like that but this one deserves it because it got balls, balls on what many viewers hope to be a chic flick which it is not to my satisfaction.

Haven't we seen them all? Haven't we seen them enough? I sure did and this movie kept surprising me the entire 2 hours. I didn't really know where it would go, I didn't know why it is going where it is going, and while it was crossing several lines of good taste it was surprisingly touching.This movie got Kristen Wiig in the lead, she is not cut out for a romantic comedy, she is weird on SNL and she was weird in this movie and the role was perfect for her. This movie isn't even a comedy or a drama it is pure satire and it shows women doing men stuff. I am sure that is upsetting a lot of men and makes them insecure. The movie provides rare insight for men what women think about us men in bed and what they dream of, it is not another Cinderella Story and that is the charm about it. It was refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) from her dark side, it actually fits her brilliantly and even me as a guy was charmed by Chris O'Dowd in his role as officer Rhodes.This movie features plenty of scenes with profanity which I wouldn't dare to laugh at if it was done with men but since these things happened to women I simply loved it since I have never seen it before. This was a new kind of movie to me and I can only recommend to see it if you like dark satire and when you are not ashamed to see bad things happen to good people, if you are the type of person who likes to see one of those streamlined romantic comedies you will be disgusted. You certainly need a brain for this movie because it doesn't have a dramatic soundtrack that tells you where to laugh and where to cry it has no music whatsoever, it let's the characters act it out and that suits this movie quite well, however there are people who need a soundtrack since they don't know the concept of sarcasm and satire and they will end up confused.I quote one of the other reviewers since he analyzed it brilliantly, this is the ultimate anti chick flick. This is a love it or hate it kind of film, the reviews clearly show that, it is new and provocative and in 10 years the same people who are ripping this movie apart today won't remember why they did it. As time goes by movies evolve and cross more and more lines, this movie is a front runner when it comes to that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meh,"I don't get it. I don't get why people actually think this film is fresh and original. A female version of the Hangover - hardly. I especially didn't get it when two Oscar nominations materialized. (really Academy?)Look I'm a guy who likes juvenile, gross-out films (provided they are moderately well-written) and I also like chick flicks. (I've watched 27 dresses more than once... granted I think it's cheesy - but familiar cheese.)Bridesmaids is a film that tries too hard to be a juvenile, gross-out comedy with heart that it forgets to string out a plot that makes sense or develop characters that I either care about or in the very least am entertained by. To punch up the ""comedy"" and make it more ""Hangover- like"" was merely to add the gross-out humor. (Oh look she's pooping in her wedding dress... haha).Specific plot and characters issues have been pointed out in previous reviews.But make no mistake, put any other cast in this film and it would most certainly have been universally panned. Bridesmaids is a case where the cast has elevated what is obviously an extremely bland script and made it to... at best a C- quality straight to video piece.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laugh out loud in a London movie house,"As a British guy I am glad to report that this 'chick-flick' made me laugh out loud several times in the normally reserved arena that is the London film circuit. Understated performances by the ensemble cast really bring out the humour and largely avoid the in-your-face obvious gags which can be a let down to a sophisticated audience. Not that this film is without elements of quite medieval grossness, but these are played straight which actually adds to the comedic element and furthermore they do not dominate the film. Wisely they have avoided stereotyping the characters and you actually come to care for them warts and all, this has the added bonus of sustaining interest during the 'serious' moments also. Bridesmaids has a multi layered comedic approach which will appeal on many levels. There are a few weak scenes but these are more than compensated for by the overall work. In conclusion this film manages to wrap up a meditation on the nature of friendship and love whilst ladling out the laughs, go see!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bridesmaids is fantastic!,"I went to watch a screening of the new comedy bridesmaids with very high expectations and I can easily say that this has been one of the best films I have ever watched. I'm usually not into comedies, but this film made me laugh out loud several times and can't wait for it to come out on D.V.D. Previous reviews I have read raved about it, dubbing it as the female Hangover, so I am very happy that it was as good as I had hoped it would be.The characters were all brilliant, the script was entertaining and best of all this film proved that girls can be just as bad as boys. Not only this, but actress Melissa McCarthy also deserves credit for her fantastic role as Megan, who will have you in stitches with her brilliantly funny mishaps and disasters during the film. I am delighted to say that this is a brilliant film and one of the best I've seen for a long time!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gross out yet touching best friend flick,"Bridesmaids implores you to, 'Save the date', as the all-female cast glare menacingly in their pink meringue frocks from the poster. For all its gown fittings, cake tastings and bachelorette frolicking, Bridesmaids really brings it with the toilet humour. This is definitely not one to take your mother or a first date to. You'll know what I mean once you experience the pillow bitingly graphic sex scene that opens the film. I should warn the fainter of heart that this seemingly lady friendly, wedding-themed, rom-com comes from the creative loins of one Judd Apatow; the man responsible for gross-out genre hits including, 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad.Perhaps not so well known this side of the pond is the film's writer, Kristen Wiig, who has successfully helmed the team at Saturday Night Live alongside the likes of Tina Fey since 2005. Honing her craft as part of the infamous Los Angeles comedy sketch group, the Groundlings, Wiig is comfortable among a cast of like-minded women who you will just about recognise from bit parts in various indie flicks and alternative US comedy series. A notable scene stealer comes in the form of Melissa McCarthy; a regular on US cable, she does a 180 degree turn from her usual style to portray Megan, the groom's masculine yet predatorily hetero sister. McCarthy is hardly a rose between thorns though amongst this cast of truly glittering comedic performances.In fairness, I could describe Bridesmaids as the all-girl version of recent hit, The Hangover, but in truth, it's so much more than that. Sure, it follows the fool proof plot of, best friends forever-one gets engaged-they both set out to plan the best wedding ever-jealousy sets in-a rift arises-then all is forgotten with a heart wrenching reunion, but what else do you want from a light-hearted rom-com? Having seen both, I can attest that the script is infinitely more natural and less cheesy than the Hangover and I give full credit to the aforementioned Wiig. Admittedly, the in your face toilet humour does seem more jarring when delivered by females, but that says more about the Neanderthal mentality of us viewers. You will be shocked to see the bride, Maya Rudolph, defecating in an unthinkable location and even women's' the irresponsible drunkenness seems somehow more upsetting, but Bridesmaids is a trail blazer in this sense. It's nothing we haven't seen before in cinema, it's just being said from behind a particularly beautiful bridal gown.For those of you expecting a reprisal of that hallowed, long anticipated girls' night out to the cinema of 2008 (and, undoubtedly, again just last summer for the sequel) be aware that Bridesmaids is the anti Sex in the City. In my opinion, and I loved SATC 1 and 2, this is a good thing. Bridesmaids doesn't skimp on drama or laughs, yet manages to create authentic relationships between relatable women. It's surprising to find a film that subtly imparts touching life lessons alongside diarrhoea and vomit explosions but Bridesmaids delivers just that. Tell your boyfriend from me that I promise he won't be bored and please, for the love of god, don't eat before you watch it.",,Anonymous,Romance
A 10 star rocking chick flick,"At the start of Bridemaids, I didn't know what to expect besides comedy only because several friends told me about the movie , so I decided to give it a try. The movie is about a group of ladies involved in their friend wedding. Basically, the two bridesmaids fought for the most attention from the bride.The movie is clearly for females, which throughout the whole movie they did the craziest but funniest things ever. My favorite part of the movie is when they were at the bridal shop looking at gowns and all of a sudden everyone stomach turned, this part had me crying laughing. I definitely want to see another movie similar to this one in the near future with all females. Bridemaids is definitely a must see.........",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laboured and unamusing,"As a middle-aged Englishman I admit that I may have come to this late and am highly unlikely to have formed the target demographic. I will also admit to finding Kristen Wiig very attractive and genuinely funny .... in other things.Having said that, this is overlong and pointless. The humour is as subtle as a sledgehammer and, at points, just unpleasant. The characters lack charm to say the least and the whole concept of 'showering' this, that and the other is lost on me.The largely female cast are a disparate variety of ludicrous characters and I felt unable to feel empathy or interest in any of them. The male characters are largely there to make up the numbers and are similarly limp and creepy.Without any meaningful storyline, it came across as a series of unfunny sketches concerning a pathetic, sad single woman approaching a certain age feeling sorry for herself and being nasty to her 'friends'.It drags on and on - lots of self-examination and navel-gazing, tears and the predictable making-up and clichéd ending.Charmless, graceless and such a waste.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

A great movie worth watching,"The movie gives us a wonderfully presented glimpse into female friendships, their fickleness, their fragility, their volatile nature, their foundations, and their strength. All the actors and actresses, even the most minor ones, play their roles in such a way that they make it possible for the viewer to forget they aren't real people in the real world.The comical aspects aren't forced, they emerge and arise naturally from the plot's development. The scenes with sexual banter and/or bodily functions aren't the basis of the movie's humoristic side; they're merely a backdrop adding an ""Oh my!"" to the overall atmosphere.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The worst movie I have ever seen,"This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen by far. The humour was very over-the-top, characterization was inconsistent, character development was lacking or not there at all, and the plot was tremendously sad and ""oh-woe-is-me"", relationships between characters are confusing or without explanation...This was set up to be a movie like 'The Hangover' but it flopped big time. I can see where the intention to go was at the beginning, but the writers or whoever decided to go in a totally different direction and make it awful. If you are going to watch this movie, I suggest you pick something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Don't waste your time,".About four hours into this movie my wife said to me : ""Just how much longer does this go on?"" OK, perhaps not four hours - it just felt like that.It impressed me how good the cinematography and lighting were, for an amateur movie. And that's what it seemed to be - an amateur attempt at humour.I'm the last person in the world to be thought straightlaced, but the constant use of asshole, bum, c*nt and the like doesn't of itself make a comedy. There has to be humour somewhere in there as well, not just shouting, grimacing and a shitload (to repeat a word used in this dire production a zillion times) of overacting.To be fair, there were in this two hours of misery one or two brief instances of near comedy: unfortunately I was so bored that I can't remember them accurately enough to give the timeline points so that you are able to skip the rest.A further thing - and this is not unique to Bridesmaids, but is becoming almost standard - is that so much of the dialogue is delivered in such clipped, drawled/back of the mouth Californian accents that I found only 30% of the lines were understandable. Diction now seems to be a forgotten art.I won't mention any cast names to avoid embarrassing them: suffice it to say that many of them must have been running short of scripts to have agreed to appear in this slow motion, infantile, disaster..",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the funniest films i have seen in a while,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Bridesmaids. An all female comedy is the kind of film that would not normally appeal to me but thankfully Bridesmaids turned out to be on of the funniest films i have seen in the past 12 months.The story revolves around Annie , who's life seems to be passing her by while her best friend , Lillian is getting married . Although Annie is a lifelong friend of Lillian ,a new friend Helen has come along and has decided to plan the wedding to the horror of Annie.If you thought the first Hangover film was funny then let me tell you , this was much funnier. Some of the scenes had me laughing out loud and the one where they get food poisoning in the wedding dress shop had me in tears.Kirsten Wiig is brilliant in the lead role and she really shows what a talented comedienne she is. There are some cameo rolls from Matt Lucas and Chris O'Dowd that are impressive too.Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining but hugely overrated,"I'm seriously shocked by all the hype surrounding ""Bridesmaids"". I understand the Best Picture Musical/Comedy mention at the Golden Globes, because the competition there is always quite weak, but the nomination for Best Picture of the year at the PGA's? Sorry, but I don't get it. I didn't dislike the film at all, though. I thought it was a rather funny comedy with a good screenplay and better acting, hence the relatively high mark, but that's it!I admit that the scene with the teenager at the jewelery store, Annie's breakdown at Lillian's bridal shower and the plane incident were hilarious. Kristen Wiig does a really good job and carries the whole film so well it's astonishing, considering her lack of experience as a leading lady. Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy are highlights as well. The latter, though, is receiving way too much praise in my opinion for her performance as Megan. She is definitely one of the best parts of the film, but I think her character is too one-dimensional to be getting that much attention.There are a couple of things I didn't really like. First, the food- poisoning scene. I thought it was too much and not funny at all, actually. The other thing that didn't do it for me was the whole romantic storyline. I felt they gave it too much screen time and that the film could have easily got rid of it. I would have preferred if it had focused only in the relationships between the bridesmaids, which is the best thing about it.Finally, I must dedicate a few words to Jon Hamm. How come he wasn't even credited? He was hilariously funny as Annie's ""sexual partner"". Sure his screen time is reduced, but he's a real scene-stealer!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"DISAPPOINTING as a comedy, OK as a drama/comedy.","Let's start this off by saying, I think Maya Rudolph is a fantastic actress and have loved her forever. That said....this movie was so criminally mismarketed that I can't believe anybody walked out thinking they got what they walked in to see. This film is a very touchy feely personal journey piece, not the gut busting laugh out loud comedy that was in the trailers. Had I gone in expecting a drama/comedy, then I would have been OK, not thrilled, but OK with the movie. Throw in that Melissa McCarthy was beyond awkward in most of her scenes... can't believe she is the same actress that is great in Mike and Molly. Overall, just a very disappointing comedy that left me wishing I had skipped it on the video shelf.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably overrated,"This film is about a woman who is asked to be the maid of honor at her friend's wedding. Her life spirals downwards from then on.""Bridesmaids"" is said to be the female version of ""The Hangover"", because apparently it is outrageously funny. With that expectation in my head, I found ""Bridesmaids"" a little disappointing. ""Bridesmaids"" does have laugh out loud moments, which consists of very crude toilet humour.Some say that comedies do not need character development, but in this film you really need some character development, as it is about the interaction of a group of newly met friends. Unfortunately, there is little character development, so I don't really know who the bridesmaids really are. Helen is the only bridesmaid that stands out, all the others are just to fill up the screen space or to make Kristen Wiig pretty. The story is quite slow for a comedy, and a joke is repeated over and over for minutes. It appears to me that ""Bridesmaids"" is just a vessel for a high profile one man band comedy for Kristen Wiig. I think ""Bridesmaids"" is overrated, but still enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Few Rom-Coms I Can Enjoy,"Of my entire DVD collection, there are only a handful of romantic comedies because, no offense to fans of the genre, most of them are total crap. Predictable, corny, and shallowI would rather suffer through a Uwe Boll marathon than watch the average romantic comedy. Leave it to producer Judd Apatow and rising star Kristen Wiig to actually make a romantic comedy worth watching. It's a chick flick that despite it's themes of female friendship/bonds, weddings, and relationships, is still funny enough for men to enjoy. Any doubts in my mind were erased when I saw this film in theaters and a scene was so disgusting that it caused a group of elderly women who didn't know what they were getting into to leave the theater muttering about how filthy the movie is (for the record, it was the infamous dress shopping/food poisoning scene). The movie follows the character of Annie (Wiig) as her life essentially falls apart around her. She hates her job, lives with a pair of obnoxious roommates, and the closest thing she has to a relationship is ""no strings attached"" sex with a man who laughs at the thought of an actual relationship. She holds on well enough until her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's gotten engaged. Of course, Annie is going to be her maid of honor but there appears to be some competition in the form of Lillian's new friend/wife of her fiancé's boss, Helen (Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, tasteful, and impeding on Annie's territory. As the wedding draws near, the two butt heads over everything from the dresses to the wedding shower, but there can be only onewait, wrong movie.Kristen Wiig deserved this movie. She's one of the best talents to come from SNL in recent years and she's provided some hilarious supporting performances movies like MACGRUBER and PAUL. This movie is her chance to be a leading woman and she knocks it out of the park. I love the awkwardness Wiig infuses into her characters; her character feels really genuine in this movie. She's struggling to get by and luck just isn't on her side. She means well as she tries to help Lillian plan her wedding but her plans just turn into disaster, and Helen is there to take advantage of every misstep. I feel like I've seen Rose Byrne has been everywhere lately; I know I've got at least 2-3 other films she's been in this year. No complaints though, because she's great. She's proved her comedic chops in GET HIM TO THE Greek and she continues her excellent work here. She's snotty, overbearing, and self-centered without coming off as a caricature. And then there's the A+ supporting cast giving their best here: former SNL alum Maya Rudolph, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Ellie Kemper. Melissa McCarthy stands out as probably the funniest bridesmaid in the crew. She's been compared a lot lately to being the Zach Galifianakis of the BRIDESMAIDS team and it's pretty accurate. She's the schlubby, socially inept goofball of the group and steals most scenes. Finally, there's Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm as Annie's love interests and opposite ends of a spectrum, both providing some great laughs (especially Hamm).Earning almost $300 million worldwide, BRIDESMAIDS was a blatant success and proves that romantic comedies don't have to be mass-produced from the same mold. I'm hoping the cash this movie banked will convince filmmakers to put some creative energy into future rom-coms instead of flooding the market with cheap garbage. I'm glad to see Kristen Wiig getting so much attention from this film and I hope that means she'll be getting more leading roles in the future. This movie is hilarious and has a lot of feeling behind it. If there is a comedy where men and woman can come together and both enjoy it, it's this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Raunchy and Raucous, Bridesmaids Can't Shake its Feminine Core","A genuinely funny script that didn't really need to go the gross-out route, it doesn't suffer for choosing to do so anyway. At its best during a rapid-fire first hour, the humor cools off noticeably when the drama llama rears its head during the home stretch, like it suddenly decided not to fully commit to any one specific identity. Though it occasionally presses too far over the line separating awkward humor and legitimate discomfort, the flick's lively, personable cast is never far off, life preserver tucked under one arm. Loaded with all-stars from every corner of the comedy spectrum, the jokes are delivered with predictable credibility, with many cast members also showing a surprisingly strong set of dramatic chops to boot. Despite a sappy, lovesick ending that seems to stand in contrast to its initial character, this is a witty, charming, raunchy little bundle of joy that's as good as you've probably heard, no more and no less.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's a girl!,"It turns out I'm a girl. I did not get the hype over The Hangover at all, and I laugh at a lot of anything and everything. I just found it dull, predictable, and completely forgettable. I was truly reluctant to go see Bridesmaids because it was so hyped as the woman's Hangover. Ugh. Furthermore, my own bridesmaiding memories are neither endearing nor funny. I broke down though, having gone through everything else I wanted to see in the last several months, and went. What a wonderful surprise.I liked that it wasn't one cliché laugh after another, but very genuine huge laughs in the right places. Loved that there was an actual plot to it that was pretty real in amongst the escapades that were over the top for the laughs. If this is the girly version of the current comedies, maybe I am a girl after all.** SPOILER ** My only criticism is maybe just a preference. I knew from right after girl met boy that boy will catch girl in the end. Too predictable / overdone. Not sure how I'd change that because I am also tired of the All Men Are Jerks themes in some 'women's' comedies, and Rhodes served to show us a decent guy who was not a pushover. Will have to think about what else can be done to prevent that predictability.** end SPOILER **Last comment. Love that they all looked like real people and all gorgeous.",,Anonymous,Romance
If you have not seen this - watch it!,"I went to see this film when it first came out with six other girls and I was surprised at just how funny this film was! I expected it to be like every other chick flick.I know lots of people claim this is the female 'The Hangover' but it is so much better. The acting is great, the relationships between all of the characters are so natural you can almost relate to them. Rose Byrne was especially good, her portrayal of Helen was spot on, with the fake smiles and laughs. Kirsten Wiig and Maya Rudolph are known to be good friends and it is shown greatly in this film. Melissa McCarthy does steal the show here and fully deserves her Oscar nomination - she's hilarious. You almost wish you knew someone like her because she provides over half of the films' comedy.I guess the plot outline is fairly basic and predictable but you hardly notice it because the humour in this film shines through in nearly every scene.Overall, if you have not seen this, watch it - it will make you laugh all the way through.

"451th Review: Rude, Crude, and Seriously Laugh out loud funny...","Bridesmaids is the funniest straight-up comedy that this viewer has seen for a very, very long time. Sure, it's rude & crude, with a sentimental side, and it's all delivered with such verve that it triumphs.The plot is exactly what the title says - Bridesmaids, and every one of them is portrayed well (We really liked Melissa McCarthy, know from the Gilmore Girls and Mike & Molly, who gives it 100% - she is the OTT character and rather than nauseate she brings her wonderful energy to this and it works). Director Paul Feig, best known for TV comedies The Office and Freaks and Geeks does a really nice job.There is scene after scene of laugh out loud lines, and we can't remember the last time a comedy made us laugh this much, instead of just smile.Bridesmaids is definitely not just all focused on sex and relationships, there's a good measure of life in there too. The situation comedy is nearly as sharp as the lines and generally work well - it's the wit in the script and the comic timing that really makes this though.Honestly, if you coped with American Pie there is nothing worse here - and for my money this there is an honesty about being female, single, and over 30 that makes this more than just the laugh-fest it is.A funny and fun film with a great ensemble cast that you'd have to have missed the last 20 years to find offensive - made us laugh....a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't know why it's called a comedy,"When this film came out it was hyped as the funniest film of the year. The reviews looked like it's a comedy - not so. I managed about 15 minutes of excruciatingly painful, cringe inducing, embarrassingly pathetic characters, beyond banal scenes and unrealistic dialogues before giving up on this ""funniest comedy of the year"". This film couldn't be less funny if it tried. What happened to comedy I wonder? Since when disgusting dialogue and gross slapstick is so universally funny? Comedy is supposed to feel good - not grossed out, uncomfortable and cringing. The suits seemed to have completely taken over film making and it is truly unfortunate for those of us who like a good story and a laugh. I sincerely hope that the corporate bores will hit a wall one day and will be forced to loosen up the grip of their greedy paws on film makers a little - and that we will see the likes of Live Nude Girls and Bridget Jones Diary again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Always A Bridesmaid And Never A Bride.....,"To Start off I absolutely Love the Song, 'Hold On' by 'Wilson Philips' so much so that to me Personally it's not only the most redeemable of the film. But also I think this song serves as a Great Inspiration to those that are Struggling with Some Kind of Addiction, and no Shop or Chocolate does Not Count, I'm talking about real Addiction like Drugs and the like. And not only that but using this song as inspiration to Stay Alive when you're feeling so Depressed that you just want to end it all, and I think you get the idea.So anyways the Second Positive that I could give is that do really do like the relationship between some characters be it Good or Bad. And I also enjoyed the Character Arc of the the main Lead Annie. And the last Positive that I could give is that a couple of the Humour did actually land with me.And now for the Negatives, the first being of course almost all of the Humour did not land with me personally. And speaking of most of their jokes seems to be Sexual in Nature. And Good Golly Miss Molly I found that the two main male characters in the film was really useless and annoying AF. One of the main males main 'Goal' of the Film was to get Oral Sex from Annie one of the main lead. While the other for whatever the reason I just found his Accent really annoying for some reason. Nothing Against People with that accent in real life mind you. Sorry I don't really recognize the accent. Not trying to be Racist or anything because I'm not like that. And the only likeable character that I like is not really a male lead at least he doesn't feel like it, is Annie's Boss. And speaking of annoying characters I also found Annie's former Female Roommate and her Brother not only really useless and annoying but kind of in the Dumb side to say the least. This film just feels one noted with very little to no story or substance even for a Comedy Film. And for me personally there is this one scene I thought could have been done better a lot better in the Dumb side to say the least. This film just feels one noted with very little to no story or substance even for a Comedy Film. And for me personally there is this one scene I thought could have been done better a lot better in fact. And there is this one emotional scene or at least supposed to be emotional just didn't feel that way as I truly felt nothing for any of the characters in the film, at all any point. And I'm a Big Sucker for that type of emotion in Media mind you once when the Studio(s) get me to care about the characters that they have created. And finally I feel the Comedy in the film where deliberate even for a Comedy Film, just to get the laugh out of you. And hare's what I mean for example instead of the Buttons on a Character's Shirt Popping by accident. They would have the said Buttons on the said Shirt of the same Character Popping all because that Very Same Character was Wearing a Shirt that was Clearly Way too Small for her and thus 'Accentually' Exposing her Blue Bra in the middle of a crowded street or whatever.Overall= Despite all my Problems with it I still go back and watch it again after a long Break from, all because of the 'Hold On' by 'Wilson Philips' although I have admit some times I go to YouTube and watch the Music Video to the Song there, when I don't have time and I really feel I need that Inspiration from that song.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
