Some Of The Best Acting I've Ever Seen,"This movie is unequivocally carried by its stellar acting performance from its leads. Throughout the movie, you will feel the emotions of the actors and actresses on the screen and what they are going through. And the story itself does a good job at trying not to paint a black and white picture of a divorce instead making it a grey affair where both the man and the woman are in some part in fault. This is one of 2019s best acting and you need to see it just for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A witty and sad portrait of modern marriage,"It is refreshing to see a film that can both warmly respect and ruthlessly dissect the institution of marriage. While every marriage is unique, there are universal scenarios that can signal their demise. Two of these are central to Marriage Story (2019): the film forensically examines what happens when one partner's ego swallows another, then shows the destructive force that is unleashed when lawyers come between otherwise still-caring partners.The storyline is simple, linear, and dialogue-heavy. In the opening minutes we see respected theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) and his increasingly successful actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) in the middle of a marital mediation session. He is opening a new play on Broadway while she will be taking their young son to Los Angeles to star in a TV pilot. The session stalls despite their obvious regard for each other and their commitment to avoid lawyers in a marriage split.Classic marital tension lines become palpably clear. Charlie and Nicole met when he was a high-profile director and she a theatre novice, and this imbalance of egos remain embedded in all aspects of their relationship. Although a loving father, the self-absorbed Charlie had an affair which is now being weaponised as she asserts her identity and needs. She decides to engage a lawyer forcing him to follow suit or lose custody of their young son; the communication drawbridge is pulled up as the lawyers amplify every marital issue into a war cry on an ever more blood-splattered battlefield.Nothing new here, you might say, except for two bright lights in a dark place: Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. He is perfect in playing the broad faced deer-in-the-spotlight hapless male, confused over his marital and parental mess-ups...but he sings a beautiful song. She is brilliant in playing a wife no longer willing to be invisible despite still loving the man she married. An ensemble of lawyers include a benignly caring advisor (Alan Alda) and ruthless warriors who take no prisoners (Laura Dern and Ray Liotta).You don't need to be a divorce voyeur to find this well-trodden story highly absorbing, mostly because the two stars make it hard to take sides. Charlie's weaknesses are not unforgiveable and his love for his son and wife continue. Nicole has a right to her own independent future but still feels strongly about him. If lawyers were not involved, things could be very different. Marriage Story is an insightful, witty, and sad portrait of how easily a marital fairytale can turn to a nightmare.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredibly depressing...but with some AMAZING performances and a great script.,"If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching ""Marriage Story"". I am NOT saying it's a bad film, in fact, it's amazingly good. But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving...and it's painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce....but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly....and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again...this is NOT a criticism...it's realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes....and I am sure I wasn't alone in the theater!Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances....so amazing that I'd be shocked if they aren't at least Oscar-nominated for this film. Well done in every way...and one of the better movies of 2019.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I lived a version of this movie, and it hurt.","I didn't expect this to mirror how my ex wife and I had to go through the stages of divorce so accurately. My son was only 2 when we were divorced and all of the ups and downs and petty fights and anger that we had for each other was exhausting but we went through it all just to fight for him, who we both love more than anything. We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn't really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected. It made me cry numerous times thinking of how hopeless and angry I was for so long and in that I feel like this movie deserves every accolade it gets. It felt genuine and painful but with hope at the end. It's real and powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sadly too realistic depiction of a family going through divorce.,"Surely this must have drawn heavily from writer/director Baumbach's own experiences. He was married to Jennifer Jason Leigh and they have one son, plus before they divorced in 2013 he began a relationship with Greta Gerwig in 2011. So he probably lived much of what is depicted here.The two principals, Adam Driver as Brooklyn stage director Charlie Barber and Scarlett Johansson as actress Nicole Barber, are superb in their roles. While it seemed like they were happily married for 10-odd years, with an 8-yr-old son, Nicole began to more and more feel that her own desires were being ignored while as a married couple they always did what Charlie wanted. When she gets an opportunity to take a TV role in Los Angeles she also decides that it is the right time for the two of them to split up. Charlie is blindsided.It is often a hard story to watch because even to the end it is clear that, in spite of the required animosities during divorce proceedings, Nicole and Charlie have a bond and care deeply for each other.My wife and I (both having gone through divorces of our own years ago) watched this on DVD from our public library.",,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best of 2019,"Marriage Story directed by Noah Baumbach is an extremely well observed portrayal of two people who once loved each other and are now going through the painfull and ugly process of separation and divorce with a son torn between them.Thanks to the great script this process is shown in an impartial way where both sides are relatable. The acting by Driver and Johansson is phenomenal and arguably the best i have seen this year. They are nailing the quiet moments as well as the loud.I only had some minor issues with the movie. I think some of the side characters like Charlies lawyer and some of the people working at the theater are stereotyped. Also the humor felt sometimes forced and out of place.Marriage Story is a pretty great movie and one of the best of 2019. If Ingmar Bergman is too bleak for you and Woody Allen too quirky, this movie sits right between them and you will love it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as emotional as I thought it would be,"When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn't feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I cried four times,"I bursted out laughing just to burst out into tears a scene later. And so on. It broke my heart into pieces and then healed it. Noah Baumbach shows his screenwriting genius once again, whilst every single piece of acting from leading Driver and Johansson and from all the supporting actors is absolutely impeccable.2020 Oscar winner ladies and gentlemen, that's what I hope for",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best portrayal of a divorce,"I was glad to catch this film at the Virginia Film Festival last weekend. Baumbach's semi-autobiographical film offers a realistic glimpse into a divorce. His writing was also phenomenal, as I found every scene vital to the plot. The script was effectively heart-wrenching and was carried by two awesome leads, at their best. Although the movie was heart-wrenching, there were also other moments when Baumbach offers the audience a laugh, while drawing them back to vulnerabilities of the main characters. The cast was magnificent. Apart from the powerful performances by Driver and Johansson, the audience is able to find depth within each of the supporting characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
May Be the Best Screenplay of 2019,"Noah Baumbach's movies have often been hit or miss, but Marriage Story does feel different as it's perhaps as personal of a story as he's ever done or will do. Beautifully acted and superbly written, you can make the case that this is one of the best films of the year & may win the big prize in February. But perhaps its most impressive accomplishment was being relatable for people who've never been in a similar situation. But Baumbach's script deals with very human issues that create a film that feels like it has real stakes. It doesn't feel Hollywood-ized even though it's based on a famous Hollywood couple. Instant recommendation from me.9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A beautifully poignant essay on divorce with stand out performances amongst all the leads.,"The movie the attorneys didn't want to be made.In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides.It's a sad old movie in which the couple's divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness.In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it's the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them.That said my wife and I both fell for Driver's side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach's own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it's not quite as agnostic as we thought.It's a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes.But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy.But overall it's both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That's one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long.Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver's one take performance of Stephen Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man';s lack of commitment. It's an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman's typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score.Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off.Also of great note is laura Dern's performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda.It's a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Watch Kramer Vs Kramer instead,"My Review - Marriage Story
My Rating 6.5It's disappointing when I'm a fan of the main star Scarlett Johansson and I'm not rubbishing her portrayal of Nicole a sulky pouty ,irritating and self obsessed actress .
Nicole want out and is not the slightest bit interested in trying to save her fading marriage even though it seemed quite obvious to me that the couple still were attracted and somewhat affectionate to each other.Then we have Adam Driver as the husband Charlie who strayed once according to Nicole ,although this is never really established it just seems that Nicole thinks she's invisible to him and not valued while it's clear if it wasn't for Charlie's success as a stage director she wouldn't have a stage career at all.Why am I even trying to explain 2 hours 17minutes of a tedious couple screaming ,yelling and outdoing each other's accusations and revisiting each bump and grind in their tedious relationship. I felt so sorry for their young son Henry and hope his Dad got custody.The acting is good especially Laura Dean as Nora Fanshaw the self interested crass Hollywood divorce lawyer who encourages Nicole to go for broke and Ray Liotta as Jay Marotta the even more greedy New York lawyer Charlie ,who never wanted to go through court and nasty legal battles engages on his behalf when his wife decides the opposite.Another Netflix one month Cinema release the film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 29 2019 and began a limited theatrical release on November 6 and exactly one month later December 6 (to qualify for Awards season) began digital streaming on Netflix to great critical acclaim but not from me .I much prefer a far better film on the subject of a marriage breakup the brilliant 1979 Kramer Vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep it had style substance and two much more interesting characters than Marriage Story and told their story in 1hour and 45 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Live together, being apart or Kramer vs Kramer reboot","The movie is brutaly honest and feels brutaly real. I don't condone everything being said or done. By neither of the two main characters. But motivations are clear and the story is really well told. The drama unfolds and it does not seem to be made up, rather really slow burning and quite reasonable (well as reasonable as some of the things can be).Having said all that, the performances really are something. Both leads have their say and while we seem to stay focused on the man mostly, both have winning arguments. As I already have suggested in my summary line, this can be viewed as a modern day Kramer vs. Kramer movie. Not sure if that is what they set out to do or thought of, but I only mean it in the best possible way. This really brings home certain things, even if you never lived them",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Human and delicate,"""Marriage Story"" is a film about a couple which is going trough the phases of a divorce. The best thing about this movie is that the characters, the two protagonists in particular, have a very human taste and they seem like real people feeling real emotions. And thanks to the excellent performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson these emotions are able to touch the heart of the viewer with all their power and at the same time with a delicate taste. As far as the theme of the divorce the movie is a critic about the process of it, on how it makes the couple waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want. And another aspect ""Marriage Story"" manages to get right is that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not everytime) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults.
""Marriage Story"" is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score: check this one out!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Interesting Comment on American Divorce,"Although every story is individual, the film captures a couple of important general realities about the state of modern divorce:1) Many divorces shouldn't happen and that includes this divorce as it was portrayed.The couple had plenty of regard for each other which was demonstrated in several portrayed interactions between them. The divorce appears to be mostly motivated by their differing professional aspirations. No matter how justified these may have been, in my moral judgment they should have been secondary to providing a stable home for their child. Perhaps the saddest aspect of our modern society is that many of us fail to realize that life is best experienced by subjugating our own needs to those around us, most particularly within our immediate family and even more particularly to our minor children. This form of narcissism seems more prevalent in show business where successful careers depend on self promotion and that may explain why people in that occupation appear to divorce at a higher rate.2) Our legal system exacerbates the divorce experience for those who have assetsIn most cases at the time that the decision to divorce is made, the ensuing pain is underestimated by the couple. Rather than the anticipated experience of freedom and removal of a burden, the loss of companionship causes considerable pain and grief which is most often redirected as anger toward the other spouse. If the couple have assets and hire attorneys, it is in the financial interest of the legal professionals who are billing hourly to take advantage of this acrimony. Many family law lawyers are like the Alan Alda character in the film and do their best to address the emotional needs of their clients despite this financial reality but there are others who do not. Too often divorces cause huge financial pain for both parties.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tying each other's shoes,"Never has a depiction of tying shoelaces made me so emotional. This film was an incredibly realistic depiction of divorce and the extreme toll it can take on both parties. Simultaneously an exhausting film it is also very humorous and true. Both of the main actors gave the most amazing performances. Although everyone wants a happy ending, life seldom works out in the way hoped for. This film gets dark but there is a bright yet stunted light at the end of the tunnel. Neither wife nor husband get what they had ultimately wanted yet they both are content. There is a strange serenity that sets in at the end of the film.

Humanity in one movie,"This movie shows perfectly what relationships are like. It manages to capture the good and bad, makes you feel happy and frustrated and sorry and angry.

A subtle and impressive study in when love comes to an end,"""Marriage Story"" (2019) written and directed by Noah Baumbach was a visceral experience. First off, this is a difficult film to master - the premise is incredibly simple, and thus, excellent writing, direction and acting is necessary in order for the film to shine - and it certainly does, in my view.Charlie and Nicole, portrayed by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, respectively, both give the performance of their careers with emotionally complex and very demanding parts that they both mastered in my opinion.The writing is very intelligent, seen in that the couple who are separating still sense the immense connection that their earlier love has established.A fine film that reminded me, just how precious love really is.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is one of the best performances by Scarlett and Adam Driver was amazing too.
I guess Scarlett would've highly related to the script because she had several divorces in the past, so she knows how it feels during that phase, the heartbreak, the excruciating mental trauma you go through and that can be seen in her performance. She's so natural in the emotional and verbal fight scenes.

believable look at marriage that's bolstered by terrific acting,"With their impending divorce on the horizon, an L.A. based former teen actress and a self-absorbed N.Y.C. based theater director confront the many cracks in their relationship, and try to recall what they once loved about each other while vying for custody of their son.

A thoughtful mediation on marriage is beset by a few awkward moments in the script, but the up and down themes of love, family, parenthood, and all the emotional baggage that come with them are genuine, and it's acted with great conviction. Johansson and Driver both dig deep and give career-defining performances, along with a standout supporting turn from Dern as Johansson's cutthroat divorce lawyer. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
Life is messy.,"I've always found both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver kinda cold and there are parts of Marriage Story that feel like that. Two people working successfully in the theatre. A couple, the lead and the director, a team, but one that's lost it's way. A complicated relationship, that she's wants out of, he doesn't and neither does her mother, sister, theatre company, because they don't see what she sees. 8 year old Henry is caught in the middle, except he's not really. Despite going through a divorce they still like each other, respect each other, want to make it amicable, but their lives around them are what causes the complications, namely lawyers. What is it with Americans and lawyers? Anyway, neither Johansson or Driver are cold here, the world around them is, caricatured even, infectious negativity, but they are the warm, sincere, beating heart of this really sad film. It's heartbreaking and painful to watch as they try to navigate their way through this difficult time and frustrating that they don't help themselves, despite seeming more than capable.

Their performances are as intertwined as they are fragmented, and they bounce off each other with effortless chemistry.Marriage Story is a powerhouse of craft on all fronts.

"Adult drama on divorce, elevated by two incredible lead performances","Noah Baumbach's down-to-earth take on the pitfalls of divorce for two young parents is bolstered by emotionally weighty performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both of whom do some of their best work ever here. There is also a strong supporting cast, including Julie Hagerty as Johansson's mother, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta who both give witty performances as the jousting divorce attorneys on opposites sides.The film's emotional labyrinth is gradually negotiated by the two leads and includes a pained, stately soundtrack that hits all the right notes. Another plus is the film's lush cinematography that gives an unhappy story a surprisingly sunny aura. Even though we are watching two people during the worst period in their lives, the world around them seems comforting and warm.Usually, Baumbach's filmmaking style can be very blunt, sometimes even downright tactless. But here, his signature tone feels right at home as he portrays the frustration, heartbreak and fury that is the battle of wills of two people struggling to reach one another. It's not always easy to watch but it will leave a mark. As tough as this is to digest, it's still a work of excellence. Strongly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simply Incredible (In a Beautifully Complex Way),"The movie is called ""Marriage Story"" because it's a more appealing title than Divorce Story. But that's what the move is: the story of a divorce.In the opening scene, the two leads, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, at the top of her game) and Charlie (Adam Driver, likewise) read from their lists of things they love about each other as we see beautifully spliced together examples matching the words. It's a charming, funny, and heartwarming open, and it in no way resembles the anger, frustration, and occasional vitriol these characters will spew at each other over the next two hours of the movie.It turns out the letters were written after a suggestion made by the couple's mediator. He explains that he likes to begin with a positive note because of the harsh negativity that soon will follow. Oh how right he is.The couple continues to reassure each other and themselves that they want to remain friends and keep this breakup amicable. They have no need for lawyers until they do. That's when the situation becomes volcanically contentious.The lawyers know how the divorce game works, and they're hall of fame-level players. They gather all possible ammunition from the party they represent, then they hurl them at the other soon-to-be ex-spouse like a box full of live grenades. It's brutal to watch. Clever framing from director Noah Baumbach displays the discomfort and pain this causes each spouse to see their significant other lambasted mercilessly in court. Neither of them wanted things to go this way.As gut-wrenching as many scenes can be, laugh-out-loud humor slips its way into just as many moments. Give credit to Baumbach's writing as much as his stellar directing. Surrounding all scenes, both crushingly sad and delightfully funny, is unceasing truth and fairness. Neither Nicole nor Charlie is made out to be the villain. They are both presented as fallible characters who are good people who happen to be dealing with one of the most challenging situations human beings can face. Divorce can bring out the worst in people and it does here. Which is what makes it such a miracle that Baumbach manages to keep both lead characters so empathetic. Baumbach's work is award-worthy in both the writing and directing departments, as is the acting of the two leads.Netflix has been searching for a best picture winner for a few years now, and it looks like it might finally happen. ""Marriage Story"" is not only one the best movies of the year; it's one of the best of the last several years (and if this movie doesn't win, Netflix also boasts ""The Irishman."")I'm sure ""The Irishman"" is fine, but I can't say for sure yet because I'm still too intimidated by that three and a half hours runtime.

"Chance for Baumach to be honest, instead a very dishonest film","I think it is nice that Noah Baumbach met and got close to Greta Gerwig in Spring of 2009 during the filming of Grenberg, when she was playing a woman who was having an affair with a older man in a film Baumback wrote. She's 25 and the male lead is 40 in the 2009 film. Except Baumbach was married during that year of close work. Maybe knowing this helps illuminate aspects of this ""story"" that are totally absent in the 2019 film.When you are in the film business, as screenplay writer and gaining fame and power from a first couple of hit films, and you are getting a divorce about a year after ""meeting"" and working ""very closely"" with an actress who is much younger than you or your wife -- while your wife is pregnant -- and then divorcing your wife -- perhaps it is a good idea to write a film which that ignores those inconvenient facts. I guess. I mean if you got a typewriter why not whitewash what is transparently proffered as your story to make it about mutual alienation and not something more tawdry (and more typical behavior of men in Hollywood).But I'm sorry: as an audience member I don't want to be lied to. Therein lies the problem with Marriage Story. It was an opportunity to be honest yet it is a profoundly dishonest film. In fact it is deceptive narcissism of a very high order. Exploring the truth would have taken courage and would have been brilliant and real drama.Sure we all lie to ourselves, but frankly I don't want to hear, or watch others' lies about their marriagse. An unreliable narrator is one thing, it is a good plot device, but not when sold as a reliable one.OK on the positive side half of the acting, specifically by Johannson, is great. Adam Driver seems sedate, but he is ok in this.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Divorce Rape horror story cloaked as a dramatic Marriage Story,"One of the most sobering and important movies of the year.A lot of people are dancing around the point of this movie. Why? Let me make this simple: Marriage Story is not about the difficulties of divorce. It's a public service announcement (PSA) story created by Noah Baumbach to warn us of the perils of Marriage, especially as it concerns fatherhood.Now the following isn't a spoiler because with very few exceptions aside this is how divorce works --There are no villains in Marriage Story, only two flawed human beings, but make no mistake about it... the wife makes out like gangbusters here, as they almost always do. She basically got everything she wanted and more. She got the Kid, at least half of everything, and essentially made her ex-husband have to relocate to L.A. so he could be a father to his son.It's a very sobering film that should be made required viewing for all guys.
Noah Baumbach did a great job writing and Directing. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were both really terrific, though I think that Laura Dern was the real standout in a scintillating supporting role. She totally deserves an Oscar nomination.The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because it's so simple and straight forward. It's a very well executed, but vanilla slice of life Marriage Story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

At the end of the day...,"I think they both had their faults, they were selfish and unable to reach a compromise, which eventually led to their respective lawyers aggressive take on the case. At the end of the day, they were a couple that simply lacked communication.

That's the reason I couldn't completely sympathize with Charlie.

What can you say?! It's heartbreaking.,"It's taking me 4 years to finally watch this movie. It's taken me this long because while I wanted to see it very much, I really didn't want to feel bad and I suspected this would make that occur. And I was right! It's sort of this era's Kramer vs. Kramer with a similar storyline about good people with a huge life decision to make prompted much like in Kramer, with a wife wanting more out of her life. It has superior writing, directing and acting. I'm not sure that this is as good as that one was, but I haven't seen that excellent film in quite a few years and they are not in competition. This is an very strong film about two people who have not stopped caring for each other, but whose lives have drifted in different directions and the big complication, as in Kramer vs. Kramer, is a small child caught in the middle. This is very well written as usual by Noah Baumbach and it is beautifully acted, though I really don't think Laura Dern gave an Oscar caliber performance as good as an actress as she is. The always interesting Adam Driver is very strong & Scarlett Johansson gives the finest performance of her career. She is at times heartbreaking, but then again so is he. There is some fine supporting work by Alan Alda, Merritt Weaver, Julie Haggerty & I loved the small appearance by the always wonderful Wallace Shawn.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Generic, mediocre, blend, stereotyped boring","I've tried my best to watch this movie, but simply couldn't keep my focus and attention to this badly scripted, non-creative directing, bad scenario and bad cast. I specifically didn't like the narrations from the both sides or either side of the married couple. I think if a movie needs narration to help it going, then it'd be such mediocre way to make a movie. A movie should not use some lame method as an audio book, if you need the actors to stand on the sideline to narrate and at the same time to act, that's just stupid. It only exposed how mediocre the screenplay writers are. The narration or talking-to-himself -or-herself formula is widely used in the Korean movies. Instead of acting, they used talking to himself or herself to tell the audiences what they were thinking. Narration, likewise, should only used in documentary films, for commercial movies with virtual characters, narration method should be the less the better.I also didn't quite like the male leading actor who actually looked quite dumb and his voice quality was just terrible. I don't know such a mediocre actor would have become a quite hot commodity recently. He just looked dumb, there's nothing on that face could allow me to accept all the roles he played in his recent movies. He just couldn't melt, mix and transform himself into all of the roles he played. He is always HE but not the roles he played.This movie also telling me one thing: Time flies and flies so fast. The leading female actor was once so lovely, young and energetic, but now, she seems suddenly transformed into a tired, spiritless middle aged woman and a very plain one; a very tired face to look at.This is a terribly scripted and poorly directed movie. The casting job is also terrible; so many old faces appeared in this movie and none of them just couldn't give me any realistic feeling of the roles they played. Their long existences in the Hollywood movie industries have already nullified their acting, no matter what roles they played in any movie, they just looked the same. Not quite understand what I said here? Well, go see ""The Irishman"" and ""The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)"", watch those old actors, all of them have become such formulaic and boring actors, no matter what kind of roles they played, they just used their stereotyped and trademarked, never changed acting formulas to waltz through all of the movies. They didn't transform themselves into those roles but only show their own selves again and again, the voice, the accent, the dialog, the body language, the facial expressions they delivered never changed.Sadly, this actor who played the husband role in this movie has already given the doomed impression as those old actors, no matter what the roles he played, he just looked like He, an never changing image outside of the roles or characters he played. And he didn't even looked like a believable husband in this movie. A big mediocre blend plain face with Jackie Chan's outdated hairdo. ""No cheek will be left dry?"" Well, better have your eyes checked soonest.Oh, by the way, if you are really interested in the ""Divorce"" genre movies, besides ""Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)"" that one viewer have already recommended, ""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin - A Separation (2011)"" is an even better viewing experience. Or, if you prefer a 3rd kind of dramatic divorce story, try ""War of The Roses (1989)"", see how a divorce would become so ugly but with a guilty pleasure to watch. Don't forget to check out these movies first on IMDB.com",,Anonymous,Romance
"Oh, boy, that was depressing! / A homage to divorce","Couples don't divorce, families do. That's why the description of this film on IMDB does not make any sense: ""Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together."" When a couple decides to end their marriage, they throw their family to the garbage. This film is a homage to divorce, and that's why I didn't like it.Although with stunning performances, the film is entirely depressing. Why they call it a comedy-drama is a mystery to me. I didn't laugh even once. The message of the film? Don't fight for your love, destroy your marriage, scratch your spouse's eyes and wreck you children's lives.I'm sorry, but I think that to stay together and try to reconnect after a crisis requires a lot of braveness, courage, infinite love and forgiveness. I believe in fighting for your love and not in separation. And when you've decided to have kids, separation can't even be an option. Unless you are in a highly dysfunctional marriage (abuse, drugs, persistence infidelity), grow up and work on your marriage. Divorce is a failure. Stop treating it like something that is OK. Children carry the scars of divorce all their lives, and couples lose for ever the opportunity of reconnecting and growing. Since 50% of the people who marry today get bored after a while and seek divorce, I'm sure my review will not be liked, but I don't care.Some say this film could be Woody's. Of course not! Woody Allen's films are a 1,000 times more brilliant and deep that these 2 hours of depressing boredom. Others compare this film to Kramer vs. Kramer. Also not. Kramer vs. Kramer, although talks about divorce too, is a very deep and good film.The music of Marriage Story, BTW, is really annoying. The direction, meh.

I saw this movie yesterday, thinking that it was going to be a masterpiece. After half an hour, I noticed that I didn't care for the characters.

The most genuine representation of (partly) flawed relationship I have seen,"Although this is not Noah Baumbach's first dive into the divorce theme (The Squid and the Whale, 2005), Marriage Story has to be his personal masterpieceMarriage Story shows how a recently separated couple deal with their divorce. We see actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) try to make sense of what is next for them, why the relationship failed and how their lives will change going forward. All this whilst fighting over where their son should live in an uglier-tan-expected divorce proceedingThe reason the movie involves the viewer so much is because of how real it all feels. This I can only assume is due to an outstanding script. And of course top notch actors.
But the script is so refreshing - there is an argument between the couple that lasts easily for 10 minutes. A whole scene where, much like in everyday life, the argument continues to escalate and go off in tangents which have absolutely nothing to do with the original discord. That scene and Nicole's quasi-monologue at her lawyer's office really stuck with me.If you like down to earth movies about true relationship in the mundane world, that Marriage Story cannot be missed.Netflix put out a title that I sincerely hope makes it to the nominees for Best Movie, it's just outstanding",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow... just wow,"First thing to say is how beautiful the soundtrack was and it brought back to my childhood, the film shows the beauty and reality of marriage while showing how perspective in relationships is integratal and we must all take a step back. Adam drivers performance was breath taking, showing compassion and drive to always improve at everything he does. With his role as father being influenced purely out of love for his child and his work as a director being his outlet for control. On the other hand it was nice to watch scarlet Johnson actually use all her depth for once instead of a patriarchal Hollywood avengers film where she's there for her looks and not much else. Her ability to display how damaged she was by the breakup was breathtaking as she was able to manipulate us into feeling bad for both her and adam.

An improvement,"This is a lot better than Mr Baumbach's deadly 'The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)', over which it's better to draw a veil. There is another film lurking in the shadows, however: 'Kramer vs Kramer', of which 'Marriage Story' might be considered a kind of 30-years-have-gone-by update. The ambition and unselfconscious self-obsession of Adam Driver's character is shared by Dustin Hoffman's in the earlier film. But Scarlett Johansson's character is allowed not to feel as guilty as Meryl Streep's for believing that she could be a better mother if she could be a whole person. Baumbach gives Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda very good speeches as a trio of lawyers explaining how the courts will stitch the opposing parties up.There are some funny lines and one really excellent scene in which the leads tear into each other, no holds barred. But it's Driver's raw delivery of a Sondheim song that will probably impress most.I wish I'd've liked it more, but in the end the travails of those in Mr Baumbach's navel-gazing world are not perhaps as universal as he might like to think.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very good, but not for everyone","It seems every few years a film like this comes out, one that explores the breakdown of domestic bliss. It's usually a marriage, but occasionally it's the relationship of parent and child. I've often wondered who the films are for.Are they for the people who have experienced this kind of pain themselves to relive, knowing they aren't alone in the experience? Are they for people who have been blessed to never experience such pain who get a voyeuristic thrill (or maybe compassionate insight) into others' experience? Are folks just there for the acting?Watching MARRIAGE STORY, I am inclined to believe the answer is all and none of the above at the same time. This is a deeply painful and hard to watch story that for some may bring all I list above, but for others with the exact same backgrounds may prove triggering.It's important to know which you are before you start it, because this movie will take you on a very emotional and at times dark ride. If that's something that, when well written and acted, gives you pleasure or purpose as a viewer (I don't judge) then I recommend the movie. If it's something that reminds you of or could pull you into your own past pain, I think its ok to appreciate it from afar, but skip it. No one would blame you.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Marriage Story,"And who starring Adam Driver in the role of husband Charlie and Scarlett Johansson in the role of wife Nicole, which revolves around a genius theater director and his actress wife who are going through a divorce that began cordially and then turned to the Duke conflict, the movie tells the story of their divorce more than he tells the story of their marriage, which lasted nearly ten years, During which Nicole and Charlie went through experiences and errors that made their marriage impossible.The film is real and shocking, and its director and author Noh Bumpach stated that it is like a personal project that was inspired by his own experience and the experiences of those around him who had experienced a divorce after a successful and satiated marriage, a heavy movie on the soul from its extreme realism, especially in scenes where the conflict reached its dramatic climax, An ordinary and repeating story in all countries of the world, not a story of an American couple, but rather that the eagerness of the two parties for the best interest of the child between them makes the movie close to your heart even if you are watching it in one of the third world countries.Nicole and Charlie, who were always related to each other, and who were one until Nicole decided that she was satisfied with being part, just part of the entity, and does not have a world of her own, despite all the love that you know she has for Charlie even if they separate, the movie is quiet and long but you will not You feel bored, especially if you are part of a marriage relationship, and you know that everything that happens on the screen is real in some way, and that the two parties do not make trouble, although in parts of it you will sympathize with one of the parties more than the other.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The humanity, sensitivity and candor in Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's performances coupled with an exemplary script provides for a grounded film unfolding with endless layers of depth that mine the audience of emotional catharsis.The simple title: Marriage Story aptly encapsulates the film. It's not a divorce story, It's about a marriage of dichotomies and dualisms. NY vs LA, stage vs screen, work vs play, family vs friends, actor vs director, performance vs authenticity. It may be hard to comprehend that throughout the film as we witness Charlie and Nicole fall apart but its in the final sequence that Baumbach really reconciles the dichotomies. He tenderly reveals to the audience that it was not his intent to show how different each side of the dualisms, but to shine a light on the overlap, the grey areas, the messiness of trying to draw lines in the sand.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Alda is priceless,"Marriage Story is a slightly misleading title, as it is not as much a story about a marriage, but is in reality, more of a divorce story. It is not a romantic comedy (romcom), but is maybe the avant garde of a new genre, the divorce comedy (divcom).Despite the main characters being relatively loathsome, self-absorbed, and otherwise squarely falling into that mythical status of upper-middle class, it is difficult not to stumble along with them for their journey to at least try to become more self-aware. This is accomplished through laughs and cries, songs and dances, and attorneys.ScarJo and AdDr are no Hepburn and Bogart, yet we get an inkling they could be a Taylor and Burton with a few more highballs. The real bravura comes from the side scenes with Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, all of whom would likely have seen success as attorneys had life's mysterious quirks nudged them that way.It's nice to see Mr. Liotta in movies again, no longer trying to quit smoking, no longer extolling the virtues of savoring tequila, his face looking so tight he could have gotten whacked in The Irishman without the youth-enhancing algorithms.

One of the best movies of 2019.,"It's hard to find words to describe why ""Marriage Story"" is amazing. Everybody already said everything the needed to be said. It was a truly powerful and emotional journey that deserves to be revisited again and again. The strongest aspects of the movie are the writing and the performances and you can say that the story has been done many times before, but it goes so deep in the way it explores the characters that i found it fascinating to watch. You understand the two main characters, since their motivations are very clear and if you going to side with one character over the other - this does not mean that the other character doesn't give some valid points.The scene where Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver) are arguing with each other was fantastic. That alone was the best scene that i saw the whole year. It was truly heartbreaking and hard to watch. If it was directed by a different person, then the scene would not work and it would have come out very cheesy and it could have been very hard to take it seriously.The only problems that i had with the movie is the performance of Julie Hagerty (Nicole's mother), which i wasn't a huge fan, but i don't think that everyone will have that problem; Nicole's sister didn't play a huge role in the story and the movie had to remind us that she's still here and the score by Randy Newman was 40% great, while the other 60% was repeating the same track over and over.Even with it's flaws, it's still one of the best movies of 2019 and i cannot wait to see it again.

anatomy of a divorce,"'Marriage Story' directed by Noah Baumbach has been compared by many people to 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'and I can't help suspecting that this comparison was encouraged by or even originated in the PR machine of the film's producers. There are indeed many similar traits: both films belong to the genre of 'divorce films' and have as protagonists couples who have serious reasons to break up but also maintain strong emotional bonds; in both stories there is a child at an age at which the separation of parents cannot remain without the sequels who becomes the main subject of the custody dispute and divorce settlement; lawyers play an important role in deepening the conflicts; in the lead roles in the two films appear well-known and highly talented actors who combine their magnetism (of attraction and rejection), managing to create difficult-to-forget broken couples on screens. It remains to be seen if this recipe will work with the same success at the 40-year interval that separates the release of the two films. Matching the five Academy Awards collected by 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' is a challenge.What has changed in the dynamics of divorce and the attitude of society in the 40 years that separate the two films? Charlie and Nicole, the divorced of 2019, could ultimately retain their affection and share the responsibility of child custody without lawyers or the institution of marriage, but eventually the social pressure brings them in the situation of the classic couples in legal conflict. As in the 1979 film, it is the wife who initiates the divorce, but the world has changed and the reasons have changed. Joana Kramer (Meryl Streep) was leaving Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) because he was too busy with his professional life and neglected his father and family duties. Charlie from 'Marriage Story' (Adam Driver) is an almost perfect husband and father, but the marriage suffocates Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) whose career as an actress stagnates in the shadow of the talented theater director who is her husband. The characters in Noah Baumbach's film are equal in professional aspirations, and in the affection that continues beyond the legal conflict and the legal separation, and also in the responsibility of the breaking up of the marriage. In fact, maybe they should never have married, that seems to be one of the possible lessons of the movie.I am convinced that there are many different interpretations and opinions, and that 'Marriage Story' is currently being discussed in many families, circles of friends, social networks. One of the merits of the film is that the situation presented on screen and the rich and complex characters of the two main heroes open the appetite for such discussions. The acting performance of the two is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson plays one of the best roles of her career - she is assertive and vulnerable, ambitious and skeptical of doubts, a devoted but catchy mother, and an actress who does not give up her dream of success and achievement on screen. I know Adam Driver less, I have seen him in 'Star Wars', here he shows that he can play excellent and earthly roles. Some sequences suffer from excessive verbosity, but the actors manage to execute them with great vigor. I saw with great pleasure also Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, in the roles of lawyers of both parties, secondary but also key roles in the development of the story, both acting with aplomb and with a well-dosed sarcastic criticism. I was less excited about the insertion of the musical sequences towards the end, they do not fit well with the rest of the movie, they are too little for a musical and useless for a family drama. Despite less successful parts and ideas, 'Marriage Story' - which might have been called 'Divorce Story' as well - manages to captivate because of the topic and of the remarkable acting performances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Johannssen and Driver should not have done this movie,"Seen at the Viennale 2019: Definitely, I should have fallen for this one. I love the acting of Johannssen and of Driver in all their previous movies. I was aware that it might be easier for Driver to play a character role (and I was right). But Johannssen did not fall short behind to hit the right keys in her emotional outbursts. Sadly, the script did not work out to create an convincing setting for the story about the divorcing of a grownup couple. I did not understand, why the lawyers got such an important part in the story. The static camera work did not help either, and so did not the clean stage setting. Also the television aspect ratio of 16:9 freezes the acting in a narrow space too small for the big screen. Maybe this movie works out in a better way as Netflix stream on Iphones. On the big screen it was disturbingly unsatisfying and a waste of the talents of the great actors Johannssen and Driver.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cliches from left to right,"Woody Allen did all that before but with more inspiration and better music too. This piece including all actors with maybe the exception of Laura Dern is a total sentimental bore - like really bad boulevard theater from the fifties ;-) That there are so many great reviews unfortunately doesn't bode well for the state of mind we currently have in this country. Obviously written and produced to get some Oscar recognition it fails on every level. Scarlett Johansson - really, what a let down. Midlife crisis maybe? Adam Driver? No, surely not. 2hours and 16 minutes because it's a 'drama' - lost time. All in all forgettable. Did I mention the constant syrupy music poured over every scene? Randy Newman - what was he thinking. After everything said though - it's never the fault of the actors and whatever hired hands, the disaster lies in the hands of the writer/director.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie really captures your attention all the way even though the theme is so mundane to me (I am a sci fi fan).

The quarrel scene is so epic I cant put it into words. Laughed and cried throuhout. This movie is for real and I want to curse but imdb wont let me.

"A more balanced approach to a divorce story, one of the year's best","The script makes a commitment to presenting both parents involved in the divorce responsible for both the marriage ending and the escalation within the legal system. The film works hard-in a tender realistic way-to avoid turning this into a battle of the sexes movie and the story comes across as fair *and* informed by reality. It is lacking some of the nasty MRA/Manospherean subtext that can crop up in films like this, i.e. Kramer Vs Kramer. Best of all the film has nice running sense of dry humor that really helps sell this as an authentic story. The film isn't even a dramedy but there is enough of a comedic energy present to make the tragic elements hurt all the more. The script is a tight piece of writing that is clearly been informed by lived experience.The cast is quite good. Driver turns in one of his best performances. There is a entitled edge to his performance that rings genuine for the character he is playing. Johansson gives a tour de force of tenderness, anger and inner strength. She can be quite a good actress when given the proper material to work with. It was nice seeing Alda again in a role of the voice of wisdom.The film's visuals and direction do not stand out in anyway. That is ultimately a good thing; there is a restraint here that puts the story in italics.This is a very good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Doesn't get any more realer than this,"Writer and director Noah Baumbach nailed this film, especially in the accuracy department. What made this film even more of a winner and so convincing were the perfect performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, of whom I wasn't a big fan, until this performance. For that matter, even the other all-star actors were exceptional and convincing in their performances. I did however feel the 137 min runtime was way too long and the pacing could've been faster. This film needed to be trimmed down/paced faster to a max 110 mins. There was some unnecessary fluff that should've ended up on the cutting room floor, specifically the ending singing performances. Plus I would've named this film ""The Divorce Lawyer Story"". Nevertheless, it doesn't get any more realer than this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is my pick for best film of 2019.,"That's right, I put this movie above my other favorites of this year like, Once upon a time in Hollywood, The Irishman and Knives out. But there is a reason for that. This is the first film that I've watched in a long time that left me emotionally raw. Divorce is something that has impacted my life up close and personal on two different occasions, and the effects stay with you long after. But what's most important to remember is that even though divorce can be painful, it is ultimately necessary in order to move on with your life and not cause you or the person you once loved anymore pain because at the end of the day, we're all still human. Scarlett Johannsson and Adam Driver are absolutely perfect as well as soul crushing in this movie. I personally don't care about the Oscars, but I can guarantee that this movie and their performance's are gonna get a lot of well deserved recognition. Noah Baumbach has made a modern masterpiece that is equal parts funny, heartbreaking, and completely authentic. And this movie easily gets a 10/10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The ending is a curious thing , personally I wanted a different ending and I think a lot of people would've agreed but even if it's not what we wanted we liked it because we could see the love between them and how they knew each other but this is a realistic movie not a fantasy one and in real life we only love once and we will always love that person even though we are not with them.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but takes a fair bit of patience,"Charlie and Nicole are separating. With a young son to think about they intend to do it all fairly and amicably with no animosity. But then the lawyers get involved.I watched this expecting a much more gritty exposition on relationships than the cheap romantic dramas which seem to litter the cinematic landscape. My favourite romantic dramas tend to be ones where things don't work out (e.g. 500 Days of Summer, In The Mood For Love, the marriage-breakdown story in Love Actually) as they make for much more original and interesting stories than your usual trite happily-ever-after stuff.Initially Marriage Story is quite disappointing though. It moves at a snail's pace and nothing really happens until about 40 minutes in. Viewer patience is rewarded though as things do get much better eventually. Once the parasitic lawyers get involved the plot becomes much more interesting and the pace speeds up as the situation spirals out of control. It also demonstrates that divorce only ever benefits the lawyers.These plot developments do also take the movie into unoriginal territory, as Kramer vs Kramer already covered the trauma, trials and tribulations of a divorce, and did it better, covering it more intensely and engagingly.As the movie goes on it becomes more profound and engaging and the ending is very powerful and emotional. The performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson also help drive this quality, especially towards the end when their relationship is at its nadir. The confrontational scene between them near the end is superb.A tighter first Act and this would have been a much more engaging and compelling drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marriage Story is an American comedy-drama film on divorce written and directed by Noah Baumbach and released by NETFLIX in 2019 and nominated for Oscars 2020.,"The film is starred by Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johnasson (Nicole) both nominated for Best Actors in a Leading Role as well as Laura Dern (Nora) for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.
The story talks about divorce between Charlie and Nicole.Since I have seen the trailer I felt in love because I lived a version of this film in my own life and I looked back at my middle childhood and so I think to know what use to happen when your parents don't love each other any more.The two main soundtracks by Randy Newman are very sensitive and powerful because they turn out to be exaclty Charlie and Nicole's personality.Even though they broke up they still take care each other because of their similar and complementary character. (For example Nicole makes Charlie fell comfortable even in embarassing things.)The photography director Robbie Ryan used neutral color to make clean and tidy scenes.Acting is simple, sweet and meaningful like the scene in which Charlie cannot open the pickle jar and Nicole is there to help him. It is so cute.
I constantly wondered how it could be possible that Charlie and Nicole wanted to get divorce while I have been watching the film.So, why should the film win the Oscar?The film should win because these are normal stories that could give an important and valid example to follow.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An earnest and poignant portrayal of divorce,It is pathetic to see that imdb has kept it in Comedy genre. This will mislead a lot of people like me who are not actually fans of Hollywood comedies.Such a foolish idea! This is rather a very poignant and realistic tale of separation of two beautiful people. This is not for the Avengers lovers. This is rather a slow paced drama created with much empathy and sensitivity. The protagonists are superb in their roles. Adam Driver in a low key role excels. Scarlett Johansson as always is brilliant. Do not miss this even if you are happily married.

Performing As...,"This is a movie about being performative. Sure, actors do that all the time. But in this case the main characters are performing artists who can't recognize it in themselves.

As Enjoyable As An Actual Divorce,"I watched Marriage Story today and I kind of wished I hadn't. It's been just over 6 years since my separation/divorce from my former partner of 17 years and this film was about as enjoyable as actually going through a divorce. It admirably hits mostly all the right notes but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable. ScarJo is an engaging actress but lacks a centre that would suggest something soulful beyond that; this could be intentional on Baumbach's part. She is eventually out performed by Driver, though predictably, the film is weighted in favour of his character. The supporting players are fine with interesting contributions from Merrit Wever and Julie Hagerty as ScarJo's family; the spectrum of divorce lawyers is nicely covered from Alan Alda to Ray Liotta and Laura Dern, who may be in danger of becoming too much of a good thing or, at least, the same thing. (It will be interesting to see if her Marmee in the upcoming Little Women is an original creation or just another cross between Amy Jellico and Renata from BBL.)Mostly this reminds me of Michael Haneke's Amour, a film I described as ""Disneyland for people who've never dealt with end of life issues."" Similarly, if you've ever been through a divorce, there's nothing in Marriage Story that makes the viewing of it at all edifying.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"a very disturbing, depressing, and difficult to watch eye-opener movie; learned a lesson or two from it","This was a very disturbing, depressing, and difficult to watch eye-opener movie from Noah Baumbach. So this IS what divorce in real life looks like and FEELS like? I felt HORRIBLE by just watching it; I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be the people going through a _______. Thank these parents for sparing the kid's feelings and psychological well-being because if they had not they would have traumatized him for life.After the movie ended and the credits were rolling and ""Shouting and Shopping"" by Randy Newman was playing, I was just in a daze. It is never claimed in the movie, but this film must definitely be based on real life events, most likely on Noah's own _______.My own thoughts on the couple:
This marriage was never meant to last because each party wanted a different line of work in a different coast of the U.S. from years before they ever even met. One party got their way meaning that the other party gave in. One party was completely selfish and self-centered and focused only on their career goals, and completely failed to see and allow the other party to pursue their career goals. The other party was very selfless and VERY patient for as long as humanely possible until it was no longer humanely possible to forget their career goals.They should have never fallen in love with each other since both parties wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite parts of the U.S., but unfortunately they did since love can strike anywhere and anytime when you least expect it and cannot be controlled.And to make matters worse, they made a third party that tied them together.I sided with one party thinking they had been patient and selfless and felt disgusted by the other party who had been so selfish and self-centered from day one and not only that but completely failed to see the other party's wishes and desires even after such party explicitly spelled them out for them.But I also realized that this marriage was never supposed to work in the first place since both wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite sides of the country. They should not have married and made a third party. But LOVE can strike anywhere and anytime when you least expect it, so this marriage story could not be helped.Moral of this story: do not fall in love with someone that wants to work in something completely different on the other side of the country.I watched this movie knowing absolutely NOTHING about it. I knew it was a Netflix movie and that it got an Oscar, but that is it. So the whole plot was a complete shock to me.Conclusion: very difficult emotional film to watch; it surely is based on real life events and it portrayed well how horrible a _______ is. I learned a valuable lesson or two for the future.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wasn't a fan of Randy Newman's score which I felt was slightly overused and played at some inappropriate points which took me out of the reality of the film.

Individual Performances Carry The Day,"When I first saw the trailer for ""Marriage Story"", I was intrigued by the concept and cast. When it started gaining buzz and racking up award nominations in droves, I knew it was something I was going to see. While there were certain parts of the film I enjoyed very much, overall I found it slightly lacking in one key area: drawing real, visceral emotion out of the viewer.For a very basic overview, ""Marriage Story"" is a tale about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), a married couple in the beginning stages of separation/divorce. Not wanting to make things too messy for son Henry (Azhy Robertson), Charlie & Nicole want to keep things civil--until the lawyers get involved, drawing some passion out of the all sides.Easily the best part of this film for me was the acting from Driver and Johansson. They both give performances that are very much award-worthy and complement each other perfectly. At one point, Driver absolutely brings down the house with his rendition of ""Being Alive"", while Johansson is a wonder to watch slowly unfurl her emotions as the movie progresses. I'd have no problem with either of them taking home some hardware during awards season.The problem I had with this film, however, is that it seemed like every time it looked to be kicking into a high emotional gear, something would happen to stop that momentum in its tracks. The lawyers (played by Laura Dern, Alan Alda, & Ray Liotta) are the most egregious examples of this, as those scenes constituted easily my least favorite ones of the whole experience. They sort of turn the proceedings into ""Divorce Story"" rather than ""Marriage Story"", which throws things off track.To me, the best scenes in the movie are when Driver and Johansson simple co-exist on screen together. They might end up talking very calmly with each other at first, but then the escalation continues and by the end they are screaming in frustration/rage. These are the types of scenes that win awards. Like I said, it's too bad that momentum kept getting interrupted.For whatever reason, it just felt like this film was about a half-step ""off"" for me the whole way. Like all the ingredients were there for it to be really emotional, but rarely did they coalesce properly and actually do so. Like I said, the acting in the piece should be rewarded handsomely, but in terms of the film/plot as a whole, I can't quite put this one into my upper echelon.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Average movie on marital discord and child custody battle,"Five things come to my mind.1. This movie is long excessively sentimental, mostly boring tale of divorced parents each seeking custody of their child.2 Though an year late, I wanted to see the film for the much awarded acting of Laura Dern. I wasn't disappointed. She plays a lawyer with elan, poise and chutzpah besides being stylishly articulated.3 It is hugely reminiscent of the classic
"" Kramer vs Kramer "" which had set up high standards for this type of storyline. This film is however nowhere near.4. Director Noah Baumbach must have known that his film will invariablely be compared to "" Kramer vs Kramer"" and fall short of expectations.5. A thought crossed my mind that in such cases the child suffers the most of mental trauma.On an impulse I decided to see "" Kramer vs Kramer "" again before writing this review. Man, what a movie!But back to this movie. The acting of all 3 Adam Driver, Scarlet Johansson and Laura Dern is quite good. Adam is particularly impressive when he breaks down after an argument. They are however let down by a weak screenplay which lacks pace and punch. It's all about incompatibility in couples and this must be unconvincing to the huge number of married professionals happy with their lives. But Adam is no Dustin Hoffman and Scarlett is no Meryl Streep to pull it off realistically. No doubt the legal jargon fits in well but the oversentimenality spoils it. No tugging at the heart strings seen in any scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
True existential horror. An honest spirit-crusher.,"To sum this up as a cautionary tale would be discrediting it. It is a lot more than that. One thing I have not heard anyone else do is call this a horror movie... however, from my perspective, this is true existential horror (though, that is also what heavy drama is). A great quantity of it, if not all of it, is spiritually crushing to experience, especially knowing that all of this could happen to each and every one of us, and thus the movie is a phenomenal accomplishment. Wickedly performed by the 3 leads, namely Scarlet Johansson, Adam Driver, and the legendary Laura Dern. You hardly notice the film is 2 hours and 15 minutes as the writing is so locked-in, the acting is so organic, and it is directed and edited so well - everything runs smooth as a lazy river. It very much felt like this movie was born from somebody's very real experiences - a film that hits this hard generally only can be, and after doing some research, I see that it is in fact based on director Noah Baumbach's actual divorce (with Jennifer Jason Leigh of all people!??! I love her! Ahhh! She saw the movie and praises it - that speaks volume about her character IRL! Legend!).I haven't been attached to someone spiritually for about 3.5 years - lately I often desire something along those lines, but Marriage Story was one of the only things in a while that made me step back and think, wow, maybe I really am better off alone. After the emotional roller coaster that this film takes you on, Driver performs a song towards the end of the film, which within 20 seconds stood out to me beyond 99% of songs I have ever heard in my life - something about that song hit me hard. I knew there was a lot to it - turns out my instincts were right. I won't go into it here but you can add ""Being Alive"" to my favorite songs of all time list. There is a layer of dryness with a screaming soul beneath it that I have not witnessed in many other songs before - Driver gets it and delivers it in a context that somehow feels transcendent. This scene seals the deal and makes this movie legendary. It goes beyond a movie - it breaks a certain type of wall, not the 4th, maybe the 5th...it's a movie, but it's also biographical for multiple people, it's also an homage to a history of documented pain, it's also the human experience as a whole. The only reason I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10 is because this isn't the kind of movie you want to watch over and over. It hurts too much.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Go, take a bath, read WAR AND PEACE, take a trip around the world, these poor characters will be waiting to suffer for your pleasure whenever you like.Is that even a movie as we understand the word? With the constraint of time removed, there's no need to limit the length of the...show. Nor was there much evidence that the film makers had. The leads are brilliant performers; they indulge in long, one-shot monologues, they inhabit their characters, it's a brilliant supporting cast, the leads each sing a song from Sondheim's COMPANY, and by the end of it, it seemed to have gone on as long as my 18-month divorce had. As soon as I left the theater, I began to trim the movie in my own mind, and soon had taken half an hour from it without losing anything from the story. True, you wouldn't hear Miss Johanssen, Julie Hagerty and Merritt Wever sing ""You Could Drive A Person Crazy"" in my version, showing the enormous range and ability necessary to winning awards. But you could go on a date, eat a meal, see the movie, and get home in time to get to work the next morning.Oh, concessions could have been made. An intermission could have been put in. It wasn't, because it was never made with that in mind. So, no, I don't think it's a movie, even if I did see it in a movie theater.Was it good? As someone who went through a bad divorce, it was too raw for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Netflix at Its Best,"Marriage Story is a realistic, grounded, heartbreaking, depressing movie; yet somehow you find joy in it. Most people at least know someone who's been divorced whether a friend, a brother/sister, or even theid own parents. When watching this film, it's almost like your feeling the pain of both spouses, what they're both going through, how they feel, and they're real humans. None of this could've been done without a great screenplay and acting. Baumbach's storytelling and directing carries a good chunk of the film, bringing the pacing and tone together. One thing that is phenomenal about this film is the opening, where Charlie and Nicole are describing each other in these long, expressive monologues; that alone is easily one of the best scenes of film in 2019. Both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give real performances; showing off the simple extent that an actor can take while acting yet pulling so much of the intellectual and emotional force. However, the musical score is a little obnoxious and doesn't fit the tone and Laura Dern's performance, while well acted, is kind of overhyped for what it is. But, if your looking to cry a little and learn something about the world... watch Marriage Story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Exceptional film ***** London Film Festival 2019,"This is a once in a era type of film. Noah Baumbach storytelling / directing is exquisite. It has all the ingredients of; When We Were Young meets Squid and the Whale, though in all honesty, its far more sophisticated in the depth and the weaknesses of the human condition. To be a little too real is to admit that my parents seperated and I suppose this film was healing in a profound and heartfelt way.

"Hard to Watch, but certainly breathtaking","Poignant, heartbreaking, and stunningly realistic, Marriage Story takes typical break up stories to a whole new level. The film is downright emotional, with no shading away from the darker sides of the issues it knows it holds. These issues, however, don't technically take the film down in quality really, but the dull moments are extraordinary dull, and at times the film can certainly be hard to watch. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are absolutely fantastic, providing both brilliant and utterly harrowing portrayals, that are certainly more than memorable. The supporting cast is more than good as well, the script is shockingly deep and harshly honest, and is quite brilliantly shot. In the end, Marriage Story is hardly just a plain piece of cinema, but a work of art. Noah Baumbach has created something utterly brilliant, and though at times it may not be quite a entertaining or very enjoyable experience, it is certainly a more than memorable one, and provides for one of the great cinematic achievements of the year.

Barber Vs. Barber,"A couple gets divorced and lawyers are a**holes. There, that's the movie. I watched the first 25 minutes, then skipped around a bit and overall sat thru a good four-fifths of it while writing this review. This is just every divorce/troubled marriage movie ever made: Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Possession, Scenes from a Marriage, like half of what Woody Allen does. More boring everyday banality, a movie heavily in debt to the aforementioned Bergman and Allen (Alan Alda, who starred in Allen's 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' appears here as a lawyer. Scarlett also appeared in two of his movies) but nowhere near as good, no matter how badly it wants to be. A lot of it is courtroom proceedings/lawyer meetings and talk talk talk that I frequently spaced out during. Of course there's the ""powerful! Gripping! oh so moving!"" argument scene like you've seen in all the aforementioned movies, and it doesn't really go anywhere at the end. I'm getting fed up with Noah Baumbach's mediocrity. He may be a fine writer, but a pretty unexciting director. He's trying too hard to be Woody Allen (his debut was the infuriatingly boring time-waste ""Francis Ha!"", which was very Manhattan-esque), but without the humor and nostalgic charm of Allen's early work. This adds absolutely nothing new - screw the hype - I'll probably forget this one in a week.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Deeply Emotional Film,"I don't like to write exaggerated stuff on the internet, hyperbole if you will. But, seriously though, Marriage Story is one of the most personal and emotional films I have ever seen, driven by solid direction and a great script, but mostly by two powerhouse, really outstanding performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johnson. It's a very simple premise, it's a movie about a family going through a divorce. But it's executed extremely well, to the point that I swear I even forgot I was watching a movie. During the scene where Scarlett Johannson's character is explaining to Laura Dern, who is also awesome in her role by the way, why she wants the divorce, that part of my brain that always wants to analyze movies, was gone and got to the point where I was just watching, not even Scarlett Johannson, but a heartbroken woman explain why she wants to go through with the separation. It's great. And it's done in a very tasteful way to give us both perspectives, we get to see what Adam Driver is going through and also what she's going through, so we get to understand both sides. It's not like one is the bad guy and one is the good guy, it's never like that. I loved this movie, it brought one or two tears to my eye, outstanding performances like I said and would highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful and realistic depiction of a struggling marriage,"The plot, dialogue, and acting are all extremely nuanced. Driver and Johansson deliver the best dramatic performances of their career, and Baumbach's writing has matured significantly since The Squid and the Whale (which I also enjoyed). The movie is dialogue heavy but I was glued to the screen for the entire performance and the two hours flew by too fast. Whether you have been directly affected by divorce or not, this movie is a wonderful microcosm of the human experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterpiece from start to finish,"Noah Baumbach wasn't on my list of best directors of all time, not even on my radar, until I saw this film. On Netflix, of all places, which has been known to produce a lot of unappetizing garbage. This film, however, takes the well-worn concept of a failing marriage and makes the 2 hours it takes to explore that marriage worth every last second. You don't feel particularly biased toward either side of the marriage, and there is no clear hero/villain for you to condemn/cheer for. It's exactly what these kinds of situations end up like in real life, and the movie portrays it flawlessly. And that's just talking about the actual script and cinematography; if you're also factoring in the absolutely best performances I've ever seen from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson then the film rises to even new heights. Marriage Story deserves all the praise it gets, and more. Congratulations, Noah Baumbach, you've made an incredible film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you are married it will seem like it's telling the story of your life - you've been through this n that when you thought you were the only one going through it.

The divorce process that is shows you is really ugly and it tells you what the ugly is. This IS A story and it was a sad one, told very well.

99% Accurate to real life,"I think this film was almost flawless, having great acting from Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and more supportive roles such as Laura Dern or Azhy Robertson. The movie has a great score; music coming in just when it was needed but not staying it's welcome. The story was great and so accurate to real life situations (not over-exaggerating things at all). The one 'problem' I had (which was barley a problem) was that 1% of accuracy. I think the film could have shown Charlie (Adam Driver) being more emotionally unstable; they did do this many times, yet I think that could have made it more common or more significant when it did happen.
The last minor bump i have is that someone who in their life has not experienced what this film shows may not connect to the film as much as someone who has. This could make the experience not as emotional as the viewer may not be as sensitive about the story. I think this is why maybe bringing more of that emotion into the film could help others understand/connect with the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Baumbach delivers a raw, realistic stunner! [+81%]","It's wonderful to see a filmmaker like Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg) tackle a simple, basic subject and elevate it to greater heights. He has displayed the ability to convert a raw, realistic marriage-divorce saga into something so deep, mature, hard-hitting, and engaging. The brilliant writing (by the director himself) is backed by exemplary performances from its entire ensemble. Marriage Story did remind me of Asghar Farhadi's A Separation at certain points, but it's a film that's wholly American in its texture, its perspectives.Adam Driver (as theater director Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (as theater artist Nicole) are both stunning in their own right. They make their characters appear extremely grounded and believable and it gives us the feel of watching the divorce proceedings of a couple that we have seen and known very well. While the core theme of a couple going through a divorce may not seem like fresh material for feel-good cinema, Baumbach actually makes it look earnest. The film opens with the two of them reading out (in their minds) what they love about each other only for the viewer to realize that they're sitting in front of a mediator.It's a solid hook for an opening scene. You're immediately drawn to the lives of Charlie and Nicole. You want to know what drove them to the point of separation when they just spent ten minutes talking in length about each other's strengths and adorable qualities. Baumbach takes the rom-com route to tell his story but in a strictly sensible fashion. The exes want to keep things friendly for their son Henry, but they soon realize that they're drifting away from each other. The lawyers of the splitting couple, Nora (Nicole's lawyer; a splendid Laura Dern), Jay (Charlie's first lawyer; a pointy Ray Liotta), and Bert (Charlie's second lawyer; a calmer Alan Alda) keep adding further layers to this increasingly hostile wedge.The dialogues score brownie points. They're razor-sharp, filled with sarcasm and double entendre, and delivered with potency by each member of the ensemble cast. It also goes on to show the intensity of love, relatability, and understanding between husband and wife who slipped up in their personal lives while tending to their careers. Baumbach makes it clear that the institution of marriage lies in its basics: the prolonged eye-contact, the haircuts, the tying of the shoelaces, the making of breakfasts, the monopoly sessions, and more along those lines.And oh, not to forget, there's a fair bit of comedy too, the kind you wouldn't expect in a film such as this. I love the way Charlie reacts to multiple people telling him L.A's got 'more space'. I also love the way Nicole's mom and sister prepare themselves to present the divorce petition to Charlie, just the way scene rehearsals (for theater or cinema) would look like. Marriage Story is incredible in the way it offers clarity to the arguments of both husband and wife before the decision is made. Its straightforwardness is incomparable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
husband and wife,"The film Marriage Story to me is a about a realistic depiction of a Husband and wife relationship. At the story's core it examines the relationship closely between the two and how for better or for worse husband and wife communicate with each other. Of course this would not be possible without the strong lead performances from Johannson and Driver. It is great that the two actors clearly don't need to rely on the Marvel films and the star wars films respectfully and here bring very emotional performances . Clearly, it is easy to see that that the film explores the idea, "" How far are you willing to go to maintain a healthy relationship?""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely Heartbroken,"I am absolutely heartbroken. Noah Baumbach's newest venture Marriage Story is a deep take on marriage falling apart as the family violently attempts to stay together. Marriage Story stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson who play growingly estranged husband and wife. Charlie (Driver) and Nicole (Johansson) have spent years raising their son and working creatively together in a New York Theatre company, but their irresolvable differences have pushed them towards divorce. Although they wish to end things amicably, bloodthirsty lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) steps in and pits the warring parties against each other.Marriage Story masterfully showcases the hurt divorce spreads over families each day. As an audience member, I was physically pained to watch Charlie and Nicole's relationship disintegrate even though they both so desperately wanted mutual happiness. This strong emotional drain is due to two main elements, Baumbach's impressive ability to write natural conversation and the lead actors beautifully played roles. Baumbach crafts scenes that are not too dissimilar to early American Independent works that captured life as it really happens. He plants clever ""ticking time bombs"" into every scene that drive the plot forward like an unstoppable train. Driver and Johansson are believable to the point of ridiculousness. I truly felt as though they actually loved each other; I felt the pain behind their words. Most importantly, credit to both writer and actor/actress, I never sensed melodrama.Marriage Story is falls into the category of once every few year character-driven masterpieces. The last of which was Manchester by the Sea. These movies move you, forcing the audience to reevaluate their intentions and their outlook on the world. Marriage Story is a must for movie lovers that could only have been better if shown on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great acting, but character and plot writing lacking","I expected this movie to be moved more than it was. Adam Driver is a real stand-out, but both leads had more to offer that the writing did not flesh out. Neither character were particularly flawed or inspiring and thus, neither were very endearing when they really could have been. My parents got divorced when I was 7 so I don't think it's the lack of context that's missing for me.I compare this to something like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where the actors are raw. I feel that Noah Baumbach did not get the best out of the actors, who are capable of more. The plot was extremely slow in many parts and the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter, without losing any value.I'm basically agreeing with one of the previous reviews that the acting was great, was the writing was mediocre when it could have been amazing. So much potential in a drama like this and so sad to see the wasted talent.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very Good, Not Great","Why did this film get so many Oscar nominations? Good question. Yes, I do think it was well done with some excellent performances, but not as spectacular as the Academy and others seem to believe.
One of the things that troubled me was I thought the character of Nicole changed much too quickly from being ""wimpy"" and dependent to being assertive and her own person. Literally it seemed to happen overnight.
Also, I wasn't expecting a film called ""Marriage Story"" to be about a divorce, but of course it was about a marriage leading to divorce.
I also want to comment on some of the reviews I've read here by male viewers. Several of them seem to feel that Charlie, Adam Driver's character, got the raw end of the deal in the film. One reviewer even referred to the ""gynocentric world"" we live in. This made me realize something: that it's in the area of children that women for the most part have an advantage. Perhaps it's the only area in which this is true. How anyone could call our world ""gynocentric"" when women have been oppressed and still are for centuries all around the world. shows a male ignorance of the particularly heinous type. But it was kind of heartening to realize that yes, there is one area of life in which women do have an advantage, or edge.
The film is worth seeing if you want an emotional experience because it does deliver that. Beyond that? I don't think so.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Once the lawyers are involved in divorce or whatever case might be,"The divorce would suddenly turn ugly. The lawyers would try every way to make a big deal out of it and try very hard not so easily to settle it in more civilized way.What we got in this movie are a couple who already stayed together, lived together so long. Their family life was as common and ordinary as most the normal married couples in almost any country. They knew each other's good and bad elements, and they've already adjusted themselves to accommodate each other, and they both loved their kid wholeheartedly. Until the husband's Alpha male chauvinism got the high ground, until the wife suddenly realized there're things that she couldn't bulge so easily from her more and more demanding husband. But the husband's ego simply couldn't swallow the sudden change of their marital environment, a climate change in their home.
And gradually the situation deteriorated until to a point of no return.Then lawyers got involved, common laws were implemented, lot of people who related to the couple, the husband and wife also got involved. Once things have turned from bad to worse, the dignity, the face, the whatever would suddenly become so important, so they and everybody started to hurt each other, and the lawyers they hired were circling like vultures and vampires, they smelled blood from a rotten corpse of a marriage, grasped any piece of the rotten meat they could snatch.A once a perfectly synchronized couple, a normal Papa, Mama and kid family was then tore apart. All the intolerance, compromises, niceties, love and good memories were tossed out of the window, the home and the negotiation desk presided by lawyers on both sides became the battlefield. The husband, the wife and especially their kid, became the casualties, the wounds were so deep and wide open, no ambulance could save them in time; they were all the modern day victims from a broken family, not from the gunshot of bullets, but unspeakable, indescribable of all shortcomings as a human, inconciliable, uncompatile, inconciliables blind fury and stubbornness. They were manipulated by their own lawyer to attack, to hurt and retaliate before they were attacked or hurt by the person who sat on the opposite of the negotiation table.My wife told me after she watched this movie: ""Marriage, in the end, only means when you become old, there's someone beside you, a company who dine with you, to take a walk with you, to check on you at night to see if you are still breathing, to accompany you to see the doctor, to pick up your medicine refills for you. The most miserable thing that could ever happen to you is you eat alone, sleep alone; even for the purpose of more peaceful and undisturbed reason, you both decided to sleep in a separate room. I can only say for myself that EATING ALONE, SITTING ALONE and TALKING ONLY TO YOURSELF are the most miserable, pathetic and hopeless things that you have to face and deal with it when you become old. Marriage, is just finding a lifelong person to accompany you when you become old.""And I have to add just one more line: ""Forget about your kids, your siblings, your....They are just irrelevant 3rd Parties.""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Love Story Told Through The Lens Of A Divorce,"From the director of The Squid & the Whale, Frances Ha & Mistress America comes a love story told through the lens of a divorce. Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach taking inspirations from his own life and pouring details of the separation process he himself went through into the script, and the result is a very personal, evocative tale.The film captures the awful, ugly, messy & emotionally devastating side of marriage dissolution with utmost sincerity. Baumbach's script is as impressive as his direction and his own personal connection to the material allows him to be aware of where to draw the line and not get carried away, thus keeping things grounded & authentic at all times.Helping the writer-director translate his story from script to screen are Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson, both bringing their fragmented characters to life with fervour in what's arguably the finest performances in the careers of both. Packing a strong emotional wallop, their renditions unfold like emotions steadily rising to the surface until it finally explodes.Laura Dern also manages to stand out with a smashing input, and steals almost all her scenes while that annoying kid gives the audience a reason why they shouldn't have one in the first place. The plot structure & execution resembles a theatre play, camerawork is fluid, employing long takes & close-ups in ways that only pulls us in. And thanks to smooth editing, the narrative flow remains streamlined.On an overall scale, Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach delivering on every front, and ranks amongst his best directorial efforts. What strikes out most about his latest work is that he captures the mundanity with same zeal as the story's vital segments, and addresses the themes of loneliness, heartbreak, agony, frustration & regret with an understanding, compassionate eye. One of the finest films of the year & certainly amongst the best in Netflix canon, Marriage Story comes strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance

This film, on the other hand, is really a poor attempt to portray dysfunction and fails, even as it wails, and wails, and wails.It gets two stars for good acting by Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, who are not even given top billing. Scarlett Jo and Adam Driver are painful to watch. Sometimes scenes begin without taking any particular direction, or adding anything to a wafer-thin story.Also the purposeful homage to Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" was a cheap attempt at elevating this thing.

Marriage Story,"An Uber-realistic take on a subject that is so personal to so many people in so many ways. It doesn't deliberately dramatize any element, but instead focuses on the two lead characters, which comes back and reflects on how a divorce can have an impact. The film carries a strong sense of melancholy, yet you still feel this connection as if they are drawn apart by circumstances but not because of love. But isn't how most people are? Most people don't actually know what they want and just get carried away by the waves. By the time you wake up, you realize so many things could have been avoided but you are so far gone already that there is no turning back.

Although we have tried our best to deal with this relationship in a gentle and slightly lyrical way, it is still shocking. The two lawyers argued fiercely about the play and the long quarrel that followed, which made people sad and heartbroken. From the separation we should consider, gradually evolved into I hate you, must leave you immediately. It's really watching everyone from love to hatred, and even malice to each other, more ferocious.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Emotional masterpiece,"Marriage Story is bittersweet. Revolving around a painful divorce, this film finds the beauty and love hidden behind that pain. Although these combating former partners are no longer right for each other, they still mean a great deal to one another. Marriage Story examines the complexities of relationships, the shortcomings of our divorce system, and the process of rebuilding. It expresses extreme emotional vulnerability yet finds moments of genuine levity as well. Plus, the performances of Johansson and Driver (and Dern) are absolutely electric, making Marriage Story a perfect storm of relatability and empathy. Viewers are guaranteed to feel something.Meanwhile, the careful craft behind Marriage Story highlights its strengths. The reserved editing holds on actors for extended lengths, letting their authentic performances erupt uncut. The cinematography uses physical barriers to symbolize emotional distance, while maintaining an unrefined style that feels intimate and natural. The music is minimal (allowing focus to remain on the actors) yet distinctly fits the melancholy tone. Similarly, the sound design is quiet, helping the emotional beats echo loudly. Lastly, the direction unites these aspects into a delicately balanced bittersweet mood that strikes the heart. Overall, Marriage Story is an emotional masterpiece.Writing: 10/10

"""it's not as simple as not being in love anymore""","Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. (Written by Netflix)Marriage Story is one of the best if not the best films that talk about two couples who get separated/divorced. Everything about is real and genuine especially the dialogues. It also has very few comedy in it so the film doesn't seem dull/boring which gave the film a special taste.Firstly, in my opinion, this is Scarlett Johansson's best performance so far. She succeeded in giving us that great character of the wife Nicole. She gave us one of the best long take scenes of the film, especially that the film has many of these scenes. But, this one specifically was the best because it was focused on her and just her, it felt so real/genuine with her beautiful acting. Adam Driver also gave us one of the best performances of his career for sure. anytime when he was crying or shouting, it all felt so real. In any scene where the two actors were together, it felt like a boom because both of their performances were better than the other, and the famous scene where the two were having an argument, proves it.Secondly, Noah Baumbach is such an amazing director and screenwriter. When you watch a Noah Baumbach film, it will be obvious because his scripts are written in a way that would make any scene or dialogue seem so real/genuine. His way of directing too is so unique and amazing especially in this film, the cinematography and the transitions were so smooth and well done. This film's dialogues really reminded me of Frances Ha (2012) that was directed by him and written by him & his partner Greta Grewing who is also an amazing screenwriter, and we saw how amazing she is in Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019) that were both directed by her. Noah Baumbach & Greta Grewing are some of the best directors & screenwriters.One thing I didn't like about the film is that I felt like sometimes the story of one side only wasn't being told as much as the other side which seemed unfair and we didn't get to know what this person thinks or what their opinion is as much as we did with the other side. Also, I felt like I needed to know more about their backstory or about other situations that would explain to the audience more about their relationship/love. But, all reasons for the two getting divorced were very reasonable and presented in a way that people nowadays would relate to which made the film unique, related, and so real with all of its dialogues & scenes.A beautiful film that's filled with great acting performances, directing, cinematography, and a little bit of comedy to cool down the energy of the film.My rating is 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marriage Story,"There is always a dialogue in my mind when I watch a movie: do you know what is the saddest thing in life? Love but not, get but not love. It's not sad, it's just life. When you die one day, what you remember before you die is these, which can be called regret. Then what is sorrow? Maybe you clearly love someone, but you can't understand everything about him, so you mistakenly interpret his kindness as cowardice, his care as stubbornness, his boredom as betrayal, and your two people's past as mistakes. Is this the essence of marriage? The essence of marriage is loneliness. Just like the essence of life, people always want to achieve something, always want to stay with someone, or become someone, but finally they put their whole self into it. Is love destined to be false? There is nothing more real than love, so a person must bear his loneliness alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Modern day ""Kramer Vs. Kramer""","I've been a great admirer of family dramas; and still my mind is accustomed by the freshness of ""Junebug,"" I watched recently. Well, ""Marriage Story"" delves into the lives of a couple on the verge of divorce and fighting in the court for the custody of their son. Pretty familiar from ""Kramer Vs. Kramer,"" the story is portrayed in the modern lifestyle.The greatest virtues of the film are the performances from the lead, Amy Driver in a very restrained and spontaneous role, and terrific Scarllet Johanson as a candid woman with a bit of attitude. The drama has a freshness and is moving despite a bit of its slow beginning. Despite its overall charm, the fight between the couple in the apartment is a bit overly done, screaming and banging for the Oscars what it overall seems. Following the films like ""Kramer Vs.

Scarlett Johansson is also very impressive in her role and especially in scenes that are focused on her. However, the reason for this not being a 10 is purely due to Driver out-acting Johansson in many scenes in my opinion and it tells in the way she tries to up the ante herself leaving her exposed in the role.

See. The film shows us the busy and complicated life of an ex-couple that was not working out for a long time. Noah Baumbach delivers a dynamic, generous, sometimes publicized and sad work, and often in a single scene a complex, confused and angry reality of theirs. The film recognizes with sensitivity and empathy how people fail as couples, parents and people, how they go and how they come. The soundtrack is full of sensations and sensations, in the scenes it works excellently, with heartbreak, loss and melancholy, but it doesn't convey the feeling that it will get better, good things and better things to come.

The best acting I've seen since broke back mountain.,"This movie is for film people and actors. Average viewers will probably find this slow or boring, they are wrong. Film is not subjective. This is how to write a script, this is how you direct a film, this is how you act. This movie is a masterclass of everything it takes to make a great film. Noah Baumbach is easily one of the greatest film makers of the modern age. Definitely walking in the steps of Woody Allen with some Paul Thomas Anderson thrown in for good measure. I cannot recommend this movie enough if your a real movie buff.

But what really makes this movie what it is, the absolutely insanely brilliant directing and editing. I loved editor Jennifer Lame's work on the 2018 supernatural/psychological horror masterpiece Hereditary and even though I haven't seen any of director Noah Baumbach's films, Marriage Story (2019) is proof enough for me how much of a great director he is, and I'm intrigued to explore his whole filmography.

The amazing Adam,"""Marriage Story"" unfolds with my 7/10 rating, and I must admit, I liked it. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver deliver powerhouse performances that tug at the heartstrings, making their characters' pain and vulnerability palpable. The film editing weaves a poignant narrative that explores the complexities of love and divorce, with director Noah Baumbach's insightful touch. Its strength lies in its raw and authentic portrayal of a disintegrating marriage, offering a message about the cost of holding onto resentment. The music, composed by Randy Newman, underscores the emotional turmoil, and the cinematography captures the intimate moments and stark realities of the characters' lives. ""Marriage Story"" is a heartbreaking and honest examination of the human condition, a reminder that even in the most painful of farewells, there's a glimmer of hope for new beginnings, and my liking for it is as enduring as the enduring bond between two people, even after love has waned.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well acted scenes do not pull together,"Noah Baumbach is one of those filmmakers that is highly regarded in the ""Art House"" community for his semi-autobiographical humanistic films. These are domestic dramas heavy on dialogue - the type of film that ""A-List"" Actors swarm to perform in for the acting challenges it brings. His latest, MARRIAGE STORY, is no exception as it follows the dissolution of a marriage and the struggles of the 2 main players involved. The husband and wife are written realistically (according to Baumbach) with moments of pathos and moments of repulsion thrown in at equal measure.So, naturally, Baumbach (THE SQUID AND THE WHALE) was able to draw 2 of the better performers working in film today to play the leads - Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver - and they deliver the goods (along with Laura Dern) - all 3 were deserved Oscar nominees - and the performances of ALL of the actors on screen are worth watching.But...that's about all this film has going for it. For I found the first hour and a half of this film tedious with (at times) preposterous dialogue that looked good on paper - and was enthusiastically performed - but wrang (at least to me) as unrealistic. Consequently, this film is filled with well acted scenes that I kept saying to myself - ""that was a well acted scene and that was an interesting choice that that actor made in that scene"", but I found that these disparate scenes in this part of the film did not hold together as a movie. It seemed to me a series of acting class scenes and not a film.And, for that, I blame Writer/Director Baumbach. This film, purportedly, parallels his divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (HATEFUL 8) and it shows. It's a little too ""on the nose"" and ""inside baseball"" for my tastes. The dialogue, at times, was ""too cute"" and the pacing was deliberate - which is a nice way of saying ""slow"".What saves this film is the performances. Johannson dominates the first part of this film and she brings her ""A"" game, bringing a strength and awakening purpose to her character that will have you rooting for her - at the beginning. The first half of the film (for the most part) is Johannson's film and is what gives her her Oscar nomination (she won't win), but she deserves the nomination.Laura Dern is also Oscar nominated for her role as Johannson's Divorce Attorney. Bright, funny, articulate and a shark in the courtroom and boardroom, Dern's character was fascinating to watch onscreen. While I thought this performance was ""fine"" and I was ""okay"" with it getting an Oscar nomination, I kept waiting for the ""Oscar scene"" for this supporting character - and about 2/3 of the way into the film this character had that moment - and Dern killed it. I would now say Dern is the deserved frontrunner for Best Supporting Actress (ironically, over Johansson who is ALSO nominated for Supporting Actress for JoJo Rabbit).This scene propels the last 1/3 of this film into interesting territory - a place that this film had not gone to thus far. I was sucked into this last part and I think it is in no small reason due to the fact that this part of the film is driven (no pun intended) by Adam Driver's character. I've always found Driver to be a fascinating actor and while his character was not front and center much in the first part of the film, he commands center stage in the last part and I could not take my eyes off of his powerful performance. In a strong year of Best Acting performances, he shines and I would be happily surprised and satisfied if he won the Best Actor Oscar.Alan Alda, as usual, brings an interesting character to the screen as does Julie Hagerty (remember her from AIRPLANE?) as Scarlett's mother. The surprise to me was the strong play of Ray Liotta as one of Driver's lawyers - it is his best work in quite some time and shows he does have some acting chops. Finally, good ol' Wallace Shawn (the ""inconceivable"" Count Visini in PRINCESS BRIDE) was fun - and annoying - in his scenes.So...if you want to see some good acting in scenes that I am sure will end up as good scenes in an acting class performed very strongly, then check out MARRIAGE STORY. Just make sure you are well rested. A fast-paced romp it is not.Letter Grade: B (for the strong performances)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Heartbreaking Masterpiece,"Marriage Story is directed by Noah Baumbach and stars Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Azhy Robertson and is about the struggle and eventual split of the married couple played by Driver and Johansson. I love this movie. Noah Baumbach' direction is some of the sharpest I saw in 2019. You can tell he put time into every single detail which for some people might not mean anything or maybe it's so seem less that you don't even notice that it has an effect on what's happening. He does this thing with the movie where in the first half he kind of makes you side with Johansson, while in the second half he makes you side with Driver. You can really see that they are trying to work things out so that they're family isn't torn apart and so that their kid isn't affected negatively. Even if you haven't been through that you might be able to connect. Johansson gives the performance of her career in my opinion as she brings this humanity and vulnerability to this character which many other actresses could have easily not gotten through with the emotion or make her the villain some how but Johansson finds the perfect balance here and could not see anyone else playing her character. Adam Driver gives another amazing performance here. I truly felt for his character as he's getting dragged into this legal mess that is a divorce. I gotta give props to Ray Liotta and Laura Dern who make me hate their characters but still make them so human and understandable. The look of the film is unique with the framing of the film making it seem like it was filmed in a video camera and so does the color in the film. The score too is incredible and I have to say without the music of Randy Newman some the emotional scenes could have felt cringeworthy or unwarranted but thankfully they land. I watched for the third time recently looking for flaws and I could not find a single one. I am going to give it a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A more suitable title would have been a divorce story, or something along those lines. The movie itself was filled with a couple of emotions, most of which were draining and depressing. It shows extensively just how much you can lose in a divorce, emotionally, financially, mentally and all the ally's you can think of, which is quite sad.

'Marriage Story'- a review,"'Marriage Story' showcases the rough experience of going through a divorce. At he same time, however, there are moments where love and affection are present but never really touched upon. I find it ironic that the title of the movie includes the word 'marriage', when it's an antithesis of what a marriage should be. In fact, outside of the two lead actor's divorce, it seems like the image of the perfect relationship is never shown. Most of the people we meet come from a poor relationship as well. The film, as could be expected, is driven by the acting. I would say that everyone in the movie did a great job. The acting gives a sense of realism and emotion that just captures your attention. An outside variable that makes the movie that much stronger is how divorces have become quite the norm. Perhaps you know someone that's divorced. Maybe the causes of divorce aren't the same as in the movie, but just the circumstances that come into play really make you feel sorry for the characters. As far as filmaking goes, I would say that long takes are frequently used in the movie and give a great purpose. The thing about long takes is that they are only great if the audience is unaware of them. So the performances are so well, that they should make you forget about the fact that it's one take. Overall, it's a powerful movie that isn't that big. The impact it makes is just amazing.",,Anonymous,Romance

Marriage Story,"Despite the proliferation of channels such as Hallmark and Lifetime. Good films that show a realistic portrayal of a breakdown in a marriage and the subsequent divorce are few and far between.The Oscar winning Kramer vs Kramer was 40 years ago. The black comedy The War of the Roses was 30 years ago.Based on director's Noah Baumbach's own experiences of getting divorced. Charlie (Adam Driver) is a New York theatre director. His wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is an actress who has recently moved back to Los Angeles to make a television series and taken their son Henry with her.Although the couple agreed to divorce amicably without involving lawyers. Nicole then hires a hotshot divorce lawyer in LA, Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) who tells Nicole thaty being LA based would be advantageous for Nicole. In turn Charlie lawyers up. First he goes to a veteran attorney Bert Spitz (Alan Alda) whose advice seems to vary a lot but at least he sees the need to come to an agreement. Charlie then goes for the more pumped up and expensive Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) and both sides end up slinging mud at each other.I suppose most of the male audience will sympathise with Charlie and would be more willing to see events from his point of view. He is an up and coming theatre director with a show moving to Broadway. Charlie is confused as to why Nicole has gone legalistic. He fears losing contact with his son, he realises the expense of getting divorced and that he will end up footing the bill.Most of the female audience will sympathise with Nicole. She has fallen out of love with Charlie, she now feels held back and thinks she can do better in LA. She suspects Charlie might have had an affair.I watched the movie with my wife and she certainly sided with Nicole.Marriage Story is a mature and intelligent movie. It doesn't take sides. Despite Charlie's and Nicole's best intentions of an amicable separation. They then repeat the same mistakes which thousands of other divorcing couple do the world over.There is some humour in this movie, at times it is sad and raw. I did find the film overlong and the early part of the movie was slow paced.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Trash,"This should be titled Divorce Story. Pure trash and completely narcissistic. When Ricky Gervais told hollywood that they have no clue of the real world, this movie is a perfect example of that. It is just a narcissistic trash movie of themselves.

A heartbreaking film,"I honestly don't ever want to experience what these characters endured. The way this film portrays divorce is both hilarious and heartbreaking. At times you feel bad for the husband and at times the wife. They're both awful people, yet good as well. Its complex, the characters are complex, and that's what makes it great. The performances from the entire cast are incredible. The cinematography is eye candy. Some scenes just hurt to watch because you could feel the pain from the characters.

Got the mood right,"Fairly accurate for a divorce story I'd say, acting was spot on. Would have given it 10 stars but then Adam Driver randomly started singing a song near the end which came out of nowhere and was weird to watch. Good film",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Authentic performances in the best screenplay of 2019,"Director Noah Baumbach has created a beautiful piece of cinema with Marriage Story. A heartfelt and honest retelling of a divorce between two patrons of theatre, the dance between leads Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) is captivating cinema. Their interactions span quiet conversation to explosive argumentation, and they move seamlessly between the two thanks to a razor sharp script. The real art, however, is the infused comedic elements: they are subtle and disguised, but are welcome in snapping the viewer back to the realities of each situation.The couple's lives are a myriad of compromises that increase in complexity: whether to live in NYC or LA, who their young son Henry should stay with, and who's career prospects warrants the next jump into the unknown. Their divorce proceedings are amicable to begin, but external parties circumstances muddy the waters and soon every detail is scrutinised and manipulated. Watching the divorce lawyers have the argument they themselves cannot wrestle with is a bizarre concept, but shows the soullessness that breaking up a marriage can require; on top of this, the lawyers know nothing between them is personal, but that couldn't be further from the truth for Charlie and Nicole.The leads (and, indeed, the majority of the cast) are superb in their casting and performances. Adam Driver is already an actor I hold in very high regard - his flexibility and comedic qualities are a true gift, but his compassion and anger when acting are so believable. I feel some remorse for Johansson, in that she is largely known for her one-dimensional requirements to play Black Widow in the Marvel franchise, but this sort of work demonstrates her real talent in more weighty roles. The snap of the script is made even more impressive by knowing that virtually nothing is improvised - Baumbach has their hesitations and outbursts orchestrated to the finest details.Cinematographically, Marriage Story uses unique angles and environmental features to accentuate each shot and the feelings conveyed: the attitudes of the arthouse couple inspire these frames, where open plan rooms alongside continuous shots are effectively used. Some scenes are also filmed with shallow depths of field to make the subject sharp and resolute, a technique given additional power by the grainy effect applied to the footage. Classical compositions often accompany the emotion of the moment, but some scenes are bereft of music to let the viewer decide the mood for themselves.Baumbach's directorial methodology might be painstaking, but the rewards are clear to see. His vision is infectious, and he demonstrates such a unique style that, even if you cannot empathise with the story from personal experience, you become drawn in. Both Driver and Johannson may be in line for some heavyweight nominations come awards season, and any victories would be, in my book, wholly justified.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Watch ""Kramer Vs Kramer"" instead, it's much better acted, more touching and with more spark, wit and punch.","Noah Baumbach is known for slowburning movies. Some work, some drag a bit on. This movie surely is ok, but it always feels as if the actors are acting and are not the characters themselves.Watch ""Kramer Vs Kramer"" instead. It is much better acted, is more touching and has more wit, spark and punch.Still interested in ""Marriage Story""? It's about the ENTIRE process of a divorce. No surprises. No real drama, besides lots of uneasy, (boring) moments of bickering.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Empathy reflected in script-writing, acting and directing","'Marriage Story' is inspired by the experience of its own director. Baumbach himself has been divorced from Jennifer Jason Leigh and has used his parents' divorce as inspiration for his previous film. He said, ""I have a real connection to the material ... but I was also at a time in my life where many of my friends were getting divorced. I saw it as an opportunity to do something more expansive, so I did a lot of research. I interviewed a lot of my friends, and friends of friends, and then also lawyers, judges, mediators."" Adam Driver perhaps has shown one of his best performances yet, having most well known for a HBO TV Series 'Girls'.The opening and closing scenes work as sequences and works well together, without giving away the plot of the film. Most of all, this is a film that looks really realistic since it is based on quite a lot of research. People do not have to be married to understand this film as the film will definitely show us how it feels to be main characters, Nicole and Charlie. The film also built empathy for both characters even though they are experiencing divorce. This is something really rare as divorce is often depicted as husband or wife's fault but never both. Here's a review of how the film uses editing for empathy, which really works well with the script-writing, acting and directing of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It deals with some pretty tough subject matter, it's about a couple going through a divorce, but it also has light moments of comedy. It feels very realistic. It's also really well-shot and well-edited. This is one of those rare movies where there really isn't anything bad about it at all. Well, maybe the score is a little weird and distracting sometimes. It's composed by Randy Newman and sounds right out of a Pixar movie. Wallace Shawn of The Incredibles and Toy Story fame is even in it. It seems out-of-place sometimes, but the rest of the movie is so good I think I can overlook it. Overall, this movie is a must-see and I hope it wins some Oscars!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Finally A Non-Cheesy Marriage Film About Real Marriage,"I really enjoyed this. It hit home hard as well as my parents both got divorced; amicably, when I was a teenager.Therefore I can relate to the many difficulties of a love-hate relationship and it being really under such huge strain when they no longer love each other.The acting is epic. Adam Driver switches on character modes in the blink-of-an-eye. From being super-aggressive douche to kind; emphatic and caring and then a withering mess. It must have been a really emotional movie to shoot.Scarlett Johansson is also a powerhouse. Excellent narrative. Script is superb. Lots of emotional acting. No action or CGI and stuff so if you want that it's not for you. It's just a straight-up epic drama playing out a couple's torn relationship and seeking bitter sweet compromise.It's shot wonderfully. I love the way you feel that you're in the room with them. The support cast is excellent; particularly Ray Liotta; Alan Alda; Wallace Shawn. Julia Greer and some powerhouse exchanges from Laura Dern at either Ray Liotta or Adam Driver. Wow.It's so refreshing as it's not at all a cheesy Hollywood romance script even though it's set there and it could 100% so much have been that.The depth and how accurate it is is bloody scary and 100% realistic. It's especially emotional for people who experienced divorce at a young age.Acting is incredible. Script is superb. The casting is another level. The freshness is there and it's not a full-blown cliché drama but real and authentic.The last few scenes are incredibly emotional and he realises what's important. It's really humbling and refreshing.

Beautiful,"Marriage story is a rare kind of movie. It's not that typical type of fast pace where you don't feel connected to the characters or involved in the story line, but its also not slow paced where you'd get bored. Marriage story is like a memory. It embodies this beautiful story, this relationship. It really doesn't glorify anything. It's unpredictable. It's not a typical, soppy love story. It's raw and it's emotional. It's so real that it makes you sit and think. It also makes you cry, and cry, and cry. Not in predictable times of the film, either all the way through or a whole lot at the end. The movie just sets up this love story, and you naturally want these two people, that are so perfect for each other, to just be together. But ultimately things happen and that's what this movie shows. You can't help but just feel so sentimental for these people and this relationship that once was. The ending tore my heart out, it just made you think what could've been if only the therapy session had gone a different way.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
flawless,"In terms of being a romantic drama, this film is perfect. There's nothing, no choice or decision by Baumbach, no line, nothing, I can complain about. Baumbach crafted a staggering drama, full of love, humor, pain and sadness. It's a film about life itself, about the transience of life and how we spend this time with our beloved ones, how they are part of our lives and how we carry them in our hearts, even if they are separated from us.It's that calm, down-to-earth style, in which Baumbach delivers us his story, with his small parts of humor in it, where you even have to giggle sometimes. It's never too much, it's always on point - and when needed, the film gets emotional. The ""argument-scene"" in Driver's apartment is probably one of the best scenes i have seen (or ""scene"" lol) in a long time.With all that composure, that calmness, the film has the ability to be incredibly powerful and move you to tears. I cried, like I nearly never cried in a movie before, asking myself, how a film, how fictitious characters could move me to tears like that. It's amazing to see that movies still have the power to do so and I'm very thankful to Noah Baumbach for creating this great piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A portrayal of divorce that excels.,"The sheer brilliance of Noah Baumbach's film 'Marriage Story', surrounding the divorce of Charlie and Nicole Barber, is astounding. Every aspect of this film was well thought out, from the direction to the writing to the sets, with Baumbach crafting his piece exactly as it should have been. The most notable driving force of this movie is the acting - with career-high performances all around. Scarlett Johansson was magnificent as mother and wife Nicole, showcasing a powerhouse of emotion through an incredibly convincing and authentic performance. Adam Driver gives perhaps his best performance of all time as Charlie, so immaculate and raw that I was fully immersed in his character right until the end. Any other year and he should have won the Oscar. The confrontational scene between Charlie and Nicole has stayed with me as one of the most moving and powerful scenes, if not the most, I have ever witnessed in a film. The script was perfectly written and the narrative executed brilliantly on the screen and I found it impossible to be unengaged. I cannot praise this film highly enough, it is an incredible piece of work from everyone involved who went above and beyond. Do not let the synopsis or nature of the story put you off, because you will not regret watching this one.Worth the watch? 1000 times yes, an essential for fans of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The acting makes the movie,"Adam Driver, just wow. His best acting in any movie by far. Scarlett also did a great job, probably her best acting, at least that I can recall. Their argument scene had me crying my eyes out. I'm tearing up now just thinking about it.I would have given this a 9/10 if it weren't for the ending that felt very painful. I would have liked the couple to get through their difficulties and get back together by the end, as it's clearly communicated how much they actually still love eachother and want the best for their family. This movie was so good, that it would have been awesome to end on a positive note, with a message of hope and a happy ending.I could have understood her choice to actually go ahead with the divorce if he was indeed abusive and repulsive, but he wasn't. Also the guy she ends up with at the end was bland and ugly looking, nothing like the dashing handsome charismatic Adam Driver. That for me was an extra bit of salt in the wound, that such a gorgeous and amazing woman as Scarlett would end up with a bland boring guy instead of the amazing guy that is Adam. But oh well, that's the sting in the tail of this movie, the heart-wrenching journey they go through and the bitter ending.Overall, a fantastic movie that really stuck with me, albeit one that I don't feel I can re-watch very easily, largely cause of the painful feelings it invokes, especially as how my own parents went through a similar kind of thing, and I grew up in this kind of scenario, as I'm sure is the case for a lot of people watching this movie.I'd put this into my Top 100 must-see movies. A really hard-hitting, stunningly acted, amazingly delivered Oscar-worthy gem. 8 or 9 out of 10, that would fall flat without Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannsen's jaw dropping acting.Noah Baumbach did an incredible job with the script and directing.

I get that this is trying to be a ""real"" view of a family life going through a divorce, and granted I am lucky to say I haven't had that experience but I felt it was a little bit pretencious or the message went way over my head because I don't agree with all the 10 stars reviews nor with the 1s

The movie has a lot of scenes that show how these two characters are suffering but the suffering is mostly self inflicted, especially the Adam Driver character is showed to be very clueless and innocent but he is not clueless. He understand exactly what he is doing but doesn't try to understand what his wife needs.
The things start getting too extreme when lawyers are involved and both main characters realize that it's not worth fighting in the court, and have amicable separation in the end.

It's so easy to forget that sometimes movie stars like Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are actors first, stars second. They want to perform in well written and directed stories but the truth is these types of films are a rarity these days. So yes, a story told before but because of the acting it's told in a new, enlightening way.

An emotional and surprisingly tender story about divorce,"""Marriage Story"" stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a married couple who are at the end of their marriage - Scarlett's character, Nicole, wants to go out on her own and make a real life for herself where she doesn't feel like she's under her husband's shadow. Her husband, Charlie, found success with his newest play that he directed, and is preparing his cast and crew for their Broadway premier. Charlie and Nicole are going in two separate directions - and with their young boy in the middle, the long, arduous process of divorce begins. And we get to witness every minute of it.With a premise that's ripe to be used to pull at the viewers heartstrings and subject them to two hours of emotional abuse, ""Marriage Story"" is instead a surprisingly tender and touching story about a couple that still deeply cares for each other, even in the midst of their separation. There is no Oscar-baity, overindulgent tragedy porn here - instead, you get a nuanced and well-balanced story that feels true to life in its premise, if not totally in its thematic execution.Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave incredibly dedicated performances that, I imagine, must've taken some sort of emotional toll. It wasn't easy to watch them as a couple that is unraveling at the seams, and it probably wasn't easy for them to play these roles, either. Both of them give very understated performances where the emotion is mostly hidden inside and brought out through facial reactions, actions, or the lack thereof. When words are thrown, they can be used as weapons, readily fired to inflict emotional harm on their opponents. And while the verbal battles made for good viewing, my only complaint about them is that, at times, the dialogue did feel like dialogue, and did not feel very natural - this movie has a decidedly cinematic tone in it's dialogue, and doesn't necessarily feel realistic. In this case, I didn't see that as much of a problem, as the story beats and performances as a whole certainly did feel realistic.Director Noah Baumbach crafts ""Marriage Story"" with an almost theatrical flair, which is fitting, as Adam Driver portrays a theatre director in the film. And what I mean by this is that the movie can feel like it's going from scene to scene without much finality or resolution - at many times during the movie, a scene will transition to another with a simple fade out and fade in. The constant usage of this did slightly bother me, as many scenes did feel like much more could be explored, and instead they would simply, and literally, fade away to another sequence. However, this didn't detract from the overall story the movie is telling, which is a good thing because the story does come full circle in an emotionally satisfying way.This is not a movie that sets out to break your heart, and oddly, this is almost an uplifting movie in many ways. ""Marriage Story"" is a film that may make you cry, but ultimately tries to show you the humanity and love in situations that are seen as the pinnacle of sadness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Shoeties,"This movie has been on my watchlist for a while and I regret not watching it sooner.It's honestly a little difficult to find bad things about this movie. I loved that the movie has a theatre vs tv focus to it as it creates a natural hierarchical relationship between Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver), our main characters. The geographical setting between LA and NYC also act as a device for characterization and try to highlight the difference between them.Johansson and Driver both showcased captivating performance, with some beautifully written lines throughout. I'm not sure if I could say that they had chemistry as a couple (perhaps this was intentional - if they felt like they had too much chemistry, divorce aspect could have been challenging to convince to the audience) but they did feel like a real couple during their fighting scene. Honestly, not a single cast in this movie was lacking in any sense. I thought they were all extremely convincing, especially the lawyers (Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta). I also thought the movie was very comical when it needed to be with scenes like when the theatre company just gossips in full volume. Noticed great subtle cinematography with scenes like Charlie and Nicole closing a door between them.The ending scene at the end where Nicole ties Charlie's shoes is a key scene. It communicates to the audience that even after a divorce, you may not be in love with your ex-partner, but you could still love them. The old saying ""Don't be sad because it's over; Be happy cause it happened"" is cliche but really felt suitable in this movie.""Marriage Story"" is closer to ""Divorce Story"" because most of the movie does narrate around the plight of divorce rather than the happiness of marriage. It's very difficult to be fair to both sides institutionally and it can definitely cause some damage to the child if there is one in the picture. But in the end, I think the movie is titled ""Marriage Story"" because every good story needs a good ending. How you handle that ending may show what the whole story was like. People may end up in different places in after a divorce, but at least this movie highlights that no matter how messy the process was, the end result can still be ok and leave you with lasting complex emotions. I've never been married and I don't feel like I have ever loved to this depth. But ""Marriage Story"" still managed to make me experience a glimpse of those complex emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Never Quite Takes Off,"This was an enjoyable movie, particularly if you like relationship dramas of wealthy people. And they are wealthy, although the film goes through great pains-and artifice-to distance itself from the clichés trappings of upper middle class life (so prevalent in 1980s Woody Allen movies) The production design is very pared down, as if the characters are so creative that they have no time for nice things, unlike those vulgar Wall Street people Anyway, good, emotional stories are in short supply in the movies these days, so ""welcome"" Marriage Story. But make no mistake about it, Marriage Story is very mechanical from the start. It announces its intentions immediately with Scarlett Johannson lit like Bibi Andersson in an Ingmar Bergman movie pose: this is going to be a story about motivations and emotional drivers with lots of fighting and tears-even male tears (!) Driver and Johansen are well suited physically. His performance outshines hers because he is the superior actor. She never quite escapes into her role and is clearly the movie star doing serious. When she acts, the words are flung back onto the page. The difference Is most pronounced during their epic argument which never really takes off emotionally. It all seems like a paint by numbers. In the annals of Breakup Porn, Kramer versus Kramer still wins. It has a lot more authenticity and heart and ½ dozen memorable scenes. But again, I did like Marriage Story. The supporting cast was marvelous, really too many to name. I fully expect a Supporting Actor nomination for Laura Dern and maybe even Alan Alda. He is a great reminder of how many wonderful octogenarian actors there are out there. Speaking of Oscars, I don't know about the leads. Perhaps it will be Adam Driver, who with his big odd face and imposing height, really is the next best hope for actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Film Review - Marriage Story (2019) 7.8/10,"""It is an actor's haven built upon Baumbach's coruscating script, both Driver and Johansson are induced to bare their emotional quotient to the fore, and together they entrain the most visceral, poignant effusions that leave audience helplessly riveted; Dern is munitioned with the most acerbic remarks about gender divide and she reels them off with flying colors, her Nora's high-flying confidence and astuteness doesn't erase the warmth and empathy when she confabulates with her client, she is lethal in what she practices, but that doesn't make her less human, that trick surely needs a performer of Oscar-calibre to pull off; a barmy Julie Hagerty and an even barmier Merritt Wever are priceless comic relief as Nicole's mother and sister, respectively, and Alda, as a benevolent lawyer that Charlie eventually supplants with a ruthless one (Liotta), is physically smitten with involuntary tics but is perversely touching in elucidating his philosophy, and a shaggy-dog story he doesn't finish.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Intimate and heartbreaking,"A truly beautiful film with two outstanding performances from Driver and Johansson. Detailing the increasingly fraught divorce proceedings of the couple, Marriage Story provides an intimate insight into their lives and their attempts to create some semblance of normality for the sake of their son.The real standout of Marriage Story is the performances. Driver and Johansson were fully deserving of their Oscar nominations, both putting in some of their best performances. I felt every emotion alongside the pair of them, finding the pain and anger that each of them expressed to be so incredibly real and believable. Alongside these two powerhouse performances comes a superb supporting cast, particularly Nicole's family who provided some delightful comic relief.This comedic element is another triumph of the film. It escaped being a very sombre film through its clever and subtle comedy, which added another layer to the film and further highlights the talent of Driver and Johansson in creating such light and dark in their work.What also struck me about Marriage Story were the constant close camera angles which delivered a connection to the characters and enhanced the intimate feel of the experience. This really drew me in and, alongside the solid script and outstanding performances, made me connected to the film and engaged in a way I hadn't anticipated.Everything about Marriage Story felt so real. It was this realism and rawness which earns it a solid 9 out of 10 and makes it a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Classic drama, taken to a new level","Let's face it. Baumbach is clearly a fan of Woody Allen, later Ingmar Bergman and Sydney Pollack. He's classically schooled.
This is no news, though. We could see it sip through in his earlier works; the humanism, the humour and the great eye for details. Both in the form of cunningly interspersed metaphors and everyday things. While the dialogue is excellent, the visual language communicated is just as subtle and balanced.
We follow a couple and their son. Her an actress, him a theatrical director, during the excruciating escalations of their divorce. Seemingly without them anticipating any of it. A plot like this could easily be bland and repetitive without the writing and directing from someone like Baumbach.
When it comes to acting, this kind of movie needs experienced and highly talented participants. Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and the whole cast deliver just that. And more!
This is one of those movies where both cast and crew exceed themselves and thakes their art and career to a whole new level.
All this to the beatiful and fitting musical score by Randy Newman.

Domestic Blisters,"Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson looks like they have reached the end of the line in the marriage department. More a question of growing apart than exerting cruelty upon one another she moves to LA to do a series while Charlie a theatre director remains in NY. What remains important is access to their son and the semi-amicable break-up gets ugly when it gets litigious.Marriage Story is a high gloss soap opera in the tradition of Kramer versus Kramer featuring fine performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansen as the marital combatants. The split is not due to unbridled hatred for each other but lack of communication in which there is more frustration than rage. Writer director Noah Bombach's real villains in the piece are the down and dirty lawyers (played with relish by Laura Dern and Ray Liotta) and the divorce laws that can bankrupt both financially and morally a family.Driver and Johansen display an excellent discordant chemistry with each other amid sterile settings that Baumbach applies some subtle incidentals to but the argumentation eventually grows repetitive with some moments contrived, others rushed and sloppy such as the one in which Charlie is being served. Piling on the suds Randy Newman contributes a score of heart tugging strings and woodwinds that give the impression you are watching a Hallmark Channel film with four letter words. Outside of the lead performances an overlong, banal coast to coast melodrama that goes in circles.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Expertly acted, but to far from my life to hit home","This movie is for sure one of the best when it comes to acting and it's not surprising it several of it's actors was nominated for Oscars for their performances. However the ""story"" is too far detatched from my own life for this to hit home. I've never been married (and as such never divorced either), I don't have any kids and most of my imidiate family are still in their first marriages, including my paretns and grandparents. Still I know several firends who's parents are divorced, as well as some of my firends and some coussins, so I'm not virgin to the subject. Still, while I'm sure they all had their problems that they had to deal with (hence the divorce), I don''t know anyone who dragged lawyers into it or had to fight battles over custody of the kids or alomony and the like. Outwardly it all seems pretty smooth. It's either ""Ok, we'll keep living close to eachother and as long as we are both clean and decent parents we split 50/50 whenever possible, and we each pay for the time the kid spends with us, not more, not less"", or it's ""We won't live close to eachother anymore, so let's decide one palce were the kids go to school and the other can see them on alternate weekends and longer periods over school breaks, in which case we'll work something out for how much the kids clothes and school material and toys etc. costs and split it"". Maybe it's a cultural thing, since I live in Sweden, or maybe american movies/tv-shows just like to focus on the worst aspects of humanity and extream bad cases of divorce, or maybe everyone who I know who has been through one was just lucky exceptions, but this whole paying 100's of 1000's of dollars to bring in lawyers to sit in a room shouting at each other, not giving room for any acctual conversation to happen seems so surreal and unneccessary that I just can't find this movie very appealing. The court room scenes was also my least favorite parts of Kramer vs. Kramer, but at least that movie was maily about a father and son bonding, which still made it an overall positive experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Life in ""Marriage Story""","Not so ironically, Writer and Director Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" is about divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie Barber. They have a cute 8 year-old son Henry, played by resilient Azhy Robertson, who struggles with a learning disability.Charlie is the intense copious note taking Director of avant-garde theater in New York. Nicole is the former teen sex comedy movie star, who forsakes Hollywood stardom to act in her husband Charlie's theatrical stage productions.At the impasse in their marriage, Nicole accepts a TV series role in Los Angeles. She brings son Henry with her to Los Angeles, which is also home. Nicole lives with her Mom Sandra, played by whimsically wise Julie Hagerty, at her parents' home. Mom was the former Hollywood actress. Apparently, her late husband, Nicole's Father, was gay. Hence, that marriage also ended in divorce.On the other hand, Charlie grew up in the Midwest, raised by abusive alcoholic parents. So there's that. Although, Charlie occurs as rather anal retentive, controlling, he's a good kind man. Sandra loves him like a son. He's the good father. Perhaps, not the good husband. Apparently, he had an affair with his stage manager. Rather, Charlie might not be the good husband to Nicole.While in Los Angeles, Nicole hooks up with prominent divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, played with charming ferocity by Laura Dern. Nora reassures Nicole, ""What you're doing is an act of hope."" She seems to have genuine compassion for Nicole's suffering.Yet, clearly Nora has her own cause: ""The idea of a good father was only invented 30 years ago..."" Apparently, Nora has been deeply hurt from her own past marriage. So it's really not about Nicole. It's all about Nora. Just saying.As the movie opens, Charlie and Nicole work with their marriage Mediator. They're getting divorced. Each holds a letter that they wrote about what they love about the other. Director Noah brilliantly opens in flashbacks of Nicole and Charlie's life together, with Scarlett and Adam in narration. Clearly, Nicole and Adam love each other, are good parents, but perhaps, are no longer in love with each other.In the heart wrenching arc of ""Marriage Story"", Nicole tells Charlie that she no longer loves him, that she hates him, what he stands for. Angry Charlie screams, ""I want you dead!"" You see the sadness in Nicole's eyes. You witness the suffering in Charlie's eyes. I cried. Charlie literally drops to his knees.Yes, Charlie crossed the line. Yes, he was enraged. Yet, he occurred more wounded than angry. He was terrified that he lost the love of his life. That he lost Nicole. That's the profound humanity and brave vulnerability of Noah's ""Marriage Story"". No, Nicole and Charlie are not bad, people, who deserved what happened. Rather, life happened. Sometimes, life doesn't turn out the way we hoped, even with our best intentions. In this touching humanity Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are sublime.Early on, when talking with her attorney Nora, Scarlett's Nicole said that she ""got small"" with Charlie, that somehow her life got marginalized. Scarlett is so authentic, so courageous in her words and in her silence. Yes, she loves Charlie, but that hurts too much to continue to do so. Scarlett is awesome.Adam is simply amazing. He makes bold, compelling choices playing Charlie. Whether he flippantly comments on Nicole's haircut or when he struggles with the child car seat in his rental. Yeah, he's imperfect, and he tries so hard to do his best, to be right. Adam is profoundly vulnerable in Charlie's distinct humanity.In a scene with son Henry, Adam's Charlie remembers what made him fall madly and deeply in love with Scarlett's Nicole. There is beauty in imperfection, in their failed marriage. Life goes on. Yet, love is still the possibility. That's the power and poignancy of ""Marriage Story"". It's my very favorite movie of the year. Just saying.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
MARRIAGE STORY (2019) - 9/12/2019,"Upon rewatch, this film remained astonishing. Noah Baumbach has always had a knack for portraying the mundanity of life with such great detail and grace, and Marriage Story is yet another melodrama that shows how skillful he is. Marriage Story is a delicate dance of paradoxical emotions, weaving together themes of love, loneliness, heartbreak, and regret in such a manner that perfectly reflects the imperfect nature of human relationships. Adam Driver kills as Charlie, but Scarlett Johansson destroys as Nicole. Their performances are as intertwined as they are fragmented, and they bounce off each other with effortless chemistry. Marriage Story is a powerhouse of craft on all fronts. It is completely arresting and intimate. Baumbach reminds us how delicate love is, and that - amidst all the chaos that comes with it - there can always be beauty even in despondency and heartbreak.Mitchell Bulfin",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The honesty makes you cringe,"Scarlett Johansson is so unlikable in this movie but I guess that's the point. Depending on what character you most associate with, you may feel different. Adam Driver gave a fantastic performance as did Laura Dern in a supporting role. All the truth and ugliness behind why some relationships don't work and how complicated that split can be with kids and extended family. There doesn't have to be a big event- someone cheat on the other, gets sick, etc. Sometimes you just grow apart or realize how you've been held back by your relationship. The viciousness of the divorce lawyers is a necessary evil but that doesn't make it any easier to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Well Written Film in a Long Time. I cried...,"One of the best and most emotional films of the year. I cried. I haven't seen any of Noah Baumbach's previous films but I really want to now after seeing this film. To start off I want to talk about the two main actors, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, they are incredible. Their performances are perfect, not only the best I've seen this year, but some of the best I've ever seen. Scarlett's character was one who is asked to showcase a lot of emotion, and I was shocked to see that she was attempting to hold back that emotion for a good portion of the film which made her performance all the more real and powerful. And not held back in the sense that the emotion is not present, but rather in a sense that it's realistic, because when she's speaking around other people it makes sense why the character wouldn't want to cry in front of them. I thought it was so brilliant that she found the perfect point where it looked like she was tearing up but not quite crying. And Adam Driver just brought so much passion and expression to this role. He really immersed himself deep into this character to the point where I forgot I was watching Adam Driver acting and I instead just saw the character. And I think the best kind of acting is the kind where you stop seeing the actor and you just see the character. Quite frankly both of them deserve to win Oscars for these roles. I love Joaquin Phoenix and he's long overdue for an Oscar, but I think Adam Driver deserves it more. The writing for this film was superb, the script and dialogue were perfect. Quite honestly I think this is the best screenplay of the year, I hope the Academy honors it with an Oscar as well. Noah Baumbach did a good job directing as well, there were plenty of long takes that really captured the power of the scene. This film is very character driven and dialogue heavy, it's a very quiet film, nothing miraculous is happening on screen. When it comes to heavily dramatic films such as this one, there's a lot of directors who would attempt to make a lot of scenes over the top, overdramatized, and larger than what they really are or should be. But Noah Baumbach portrays this story about a divorce and all the dramatic scenes in a very realistic manner that never felt over dramatic or went too far, and I thought that was absolutely brilliant. As far as the characters go, they are flawless. They are the most fleshed out and deeply explored characters I've seen this year. They are incredibly interesting and complex. Quite honestly this film showcases a story that's been told before, but it makes all those films that came before it look shallow and underdeveloped. The film doesn't explain the characters to you, it just presents them, and it doesn't take sides with either one, because they are so complex that quite honestly there isn't a good guy or bad guy in this scenario. They're simply just two people who aren't good for each other and are just not working. Whichever one you found yourself siding with, in the end the film makes you realize that it doesn't matter. The score from Randy Newman was also fantastic, it complimented the visuals and conveyed the tone of the film very well. The best aspects of this film were the acting and the writing, so you should see it on those merits alone, and it's on Netflix right now so you can watch it in the comfort of your own home. I thought this was one the best and most powerful films of the year and just so well written.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Scenes From a Broken Marriage ...,"40 years after ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", here comes Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"", a well-written, well-directed and certainly well-acted movie tackling the difficult subject of divorce and through it marriage, responsibility... and love. That the film is a major Oscar contender doesn't surprise me but I like what that critical acclaim reflects: a movie about divorce must obey to higher standards of filmmaking than any drama subgenre; many are masterpieces such as Farhadi's ""Separation"" or Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"".The point of a divorce film isn't to take sides, you've got to show two persons with their strengths, flaws, the qualities they take for granted and weaknesses they don't suspect. The three-dimensionality you bring up to the characters and the way they interact through conflicts, tenderness or awkward moments have the challenging complexity of an emotional Rubik-cube game. A quote in ""Marriage Story"" says ""crime lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst"" and that's the point: marriage movies insist on flaws that are only flipsides of qualities.And so the film starts beautifully with two monologues from each of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlet Johansson), describing what they like best in each other. The descriptions insist on so many details that it's impossible not to relate to both of them, I often brew tea I end up not drinking like Nicole and I'm a bad loser when it comes to games like Charlie. The opening monologues are exposition masterstrokes (with a twist at the end), allowing us to know about the couple, their roles as parents and their jobs: Charlie is a theater director who found a muse in Nicole, a previous TV star who abandoned her dreams for Charlie.Together they had a child named Henry (a reference to Justin Henry who played Billy in ""Kramer""?), the kid played by Azhy Robertson, is obviously the sinews of the war. Since Charlie lives and works in New York and Nicole stars in a TV show shot in L.A., much more they married in L.A. and it's Henry's birthplace, there's more at stakes than a matter of custody. Charlie wants Henry back to New York but Nicole's rising career is in L.A.. The battle opens with promises never to go to court but we know it's a matter of inevitability. The trick is that no one wants to accuse the other of bad parenting, nor to brag about being the better parent, it's all about saying what's best for the kid.But can any parent be that objective when it comes to the child? Spending more time with his mother, Henry's bias leans in her direction while Charlie becomes the stranger who does his best to accommodate him. It takes someone who's gone through divorce to understand Charlie's situation. I see my own daughter twice every month during weekends and half the holidays, and whenever I see her I feel forced to satisfy her caprices, which is not the right way to educate, but since you're put in a situation where you want to live the moment to its fullest and not spoil it, you spoil your kid.And when the kid behaves badly, you almost take it as an affront... and must endure people who pretend not to judge your parenting and you know they do. That's the paradox of divorce, you try to display the best parenting and yet it might be perceived as the worst like in that sequence where Charlie is being observed and does his best to avoid complications... that ultimately happen. Divorce complicates relationships and I'm glad a film could show it so remarkably, with brutality or humor.I saw ""Kramer"" with my then-wife and she ended up (to my surprise) rooting with Ted while I kind of empathized with Joanna, especially her suffocation through marital commitment and wish to find herself. It's important not to make a conflict binary and this is why the ""character study"" is important, why we should understand someone's inner personalities. Charlie is an artist who's dedicated to his art in a disciplined manner, Nicole is a dreamer who needs to be her own master. Together they love each other but here's what I said about Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"":""While loving someone is a genuine feeling, being married implies duties whose applications might interfere with our inner personalities. Whether it's sex life, success and dreams, they can be undermined by marital life. The danger is to start looking at the man or the woman of our life as the one who's sinking it into the abysses of routine and conventions.""That's how Nicole started to look at Charlie and vice versa, that's the way she describes him in a bravura speech where she tells her lawyer (a scene-stealing Laura Dern) how she feels about him, and a later moment where Charlie vents his anger on Nicole and culminates with a wish to see her die, before busting into tears. I love that he regained his composure and said ""sorry"" and that Nicole didn't even take it badly, it's for subtle moments like this that I think the film should take home a few golden boys. Driver has a raw natural magnetism and Johannson is given the most difficult role and both are perfect in acting naturally and also unnaturally. The best 'actors' being the lawyers.As someone who went through these stages of bargains through love letters, these moments where we cry ourselves to sleep, anger when we blame the other for failing the marriage vows and we realize we won't see our children regularly, when we even miss the in-laws, the film is poignantly cathartic even in a resigned state.And I mentioned the notion of ""acting"" in marriage, maybe the real act of fidelity in marriage is to be faithful to yourself in the first place. What Charlie and Nicole achieve at the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The key is in the subtlety of the acting and direction,"Heart shatteringly subtle movie about a couple going through a divorce that does not rely on over the top acting in theratrics; but the genuine reflection of two people going through a period of separation. I was wonderfully surprised by how much I enjoyed Marriage story and how much it affected me emotionally. I was particularly invested in those scenes of almost mundane frustrations that don't rely on actors crying and screaming but the subtle hints of frustration.Adam Driver has quickly risen the ranks as one of my favourite actors and this is the role that he was born to play, there is a sequence of scenes in this film involving him having to deal with a series of events that Adam Driver plays brilliantly, so accurately reflecting that frustration of just wanting to get something over with. I was mesmerised and absolutely burrowed into that emotion that was not over the top, but real.I loved how this film portrays both sides of the argument and never paints one person as a bad person, as the audience we get to unravel how exactly they fell apart in their marriage but never once does it point fingers at one character nor paints them as bitter or hating each other. There is always a sense of hope in the details of the interactions between Charlie and Nicole that almost develops into a 'will they/won't they' situation; which was fascinating but I am glad that wasn't the direction they were taking, because realistically this isn't something that would happen. But it is the fact that despite them having a failed marriage these are still two people who care about each other and most importantly their child, and going through this strenuous and almost paradoxical circumstance of lawyering up and family court does not change that. It is these subtle moments that makes me absolutely adore Marriage Story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

MARRIAGE STORY: Two extraordinary actors can make a boring premise something great.,"Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are going through a hard divorce when Nicole decides she wants to stay in L.A. but Charlie doesn't want to leave NYC. Charlie and Nicole both want something, and it's the best for their son Henry (Azhy Robertson).I want it to see this movie even though I find it quite pretentious and I usually don't enjoy movies called Oscar worthy. The premise of the movie also seems pretty boring, a movie about a couple experiencing a divorce but watching both sides of view without antagonizing any of the parts involved... Unusually, it sounds good but not really that entertaining to last more than two hours.I was so wrong. This is one of the best movies of the year. Everything in the technical aspect is perfect, the director knew what he was attempting to achieve and it did it amazingly. Not a single second in this movie doesn't look amazing. But that's not what I treasure about the movie.The acting is absolutely incredible. Some scenes are pretty long and I find myself surprised how Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver can deliver those amazing performances. I cried in four scenes, and I was always expecting what would happen next. The script is brilliant; they cause you to empathize with both characters even though they both have issues and weaknesses.I totally recommend this movie. It's full of heart in every aspect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"At its best, this movie is searing. It pinpoints many of the little talked-about aspects of divorce that seem the least significant but hurt the most.","Driver and Johansson will surely receive all the nominations for their great performances in this film, but Laura Dern and Alan Alda also deserve tons of credit for the job they do. The story is well written for both the husband and the wife's perspective. It almost hurts to watch it at times but in the best way possible. The audience is somehow led to root for both sides, accepting both characters' strengths and flaws. An extremely well-acted, and pretty well-written film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mediocre Marriage Story,"This is a pretty mediocre movie about a less than interesting divorce. As is often the case when the director is also the writer, this movie suffers from a weak script and a dearth of strong tweaking. For a film about marriage - or is it about divorce - Marriage Story has little to say and offers little insight into marriages or troubled relationships. Scenes play out as if it is fascinating for the director watching behind the camera, but for the audience many scenes just seem to go on too long, or peter out, or need to be pumped up. Surely the biggest problem with the movie is that the motivation for this particular 'drama' is unclear. Here we have a youngish couple with a child, both with careers in the same business, who seem to be at a crisis in their marriage. But how we got there and the magnitude of that crisis is unclear and remains vague throughout the film. We see one stab at counselling and then bang it's off to melodrama-movie-style-divorce. For all the naturalness that is attempted here the behaviour and situations these folks find themselves in - and their subsequent behaviours - seem quite fake and unreal. Again this problem is due to a contrived script. The child custody element of this story (shades of Kramer v.s. Kramer) also doesn't work very well because at the heart of it is an immature, spoiled, selfish, neurotic and irritating child who seriously needs a firm hand and a haircut. And whereas the actors seem game, the scenes with the child actor feel stiff and constrained. The adult actors do a great job from Ray Liotta and Laura Dern and Alan Alda as the lawyers to Adam Driver as the husband. But Marriage Story really belongs to Scarlett Johansson who yells, laughs, cries, wipes away tears and basically owns this movie what there is of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
👌🏻,"Wow, the movie was great. I haven't watched any movies of Scarlett Johansson besides her portrayal of Black Widow and I must admit I was surprised. The way she portrayed Nicole Barber was just great. Adam Driver was a great actor as well. His portrayal of Charlie was just great. I like how in the monologue they gave us an idea of how the story progresses and how the character's personality fits in the narrative. Also, I would like to applaud the director and writer, Noah Baumbach. This is my first view of his work and I'm really impressed. Some people may say that the film gets boring because of the dialogue and stuff, but the content of it makes the story more realistic in my opinion. And don't get me started on the acting -- it was just pure raw emotion. I teared up tons of times. The movie overall portrays the proceedings of getting a divorce, it became very interesting as it showed more side of jurisdiction, specifically when it comes to child support. Both parties fighting for their rights and trying their best not to ruin their children's life.Overall, I'd give it a 8/10.PS: I'm new to writing a review. Please do share your thoughts on how I'll improve in terms of being a critique. Also do point out things I've missed or should emphasize on my review. Thanks, y'all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Impressive But Unsatisfying,"I enjoyed this film for the most part. It was intelligent, smart, moving and often funny. It didn't seem to know if it wanted to be a drama, a comedy, or a satire on the American way of divorce. There were serious weaknesses. I didn't care about the two main self-absorbed characters. Scarlett was actually very poor in some scenes where she had to spout interminable monologues. She doesn't do voluble anger or outrage very well. I found the scenes with the kid boring. Alan Alda and Ray Liotta were both great but neither had enough screen time. Rewatchability factor probably low.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marriage Story (2019),"Directed by Noah Baumbach. Starring Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, Azhy Robertson, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Merritt Wever, Brooke Bloom, Wallace Shawn. (R)More accurately, ""Divorce Story"" (or at the very least, ""Marriage Autopsy""); shows the detailed--and sometimes agonizing--process of spouses (Driver, Johansson) separating while struggling to remain on reasonable terms and share custody with their child (Robertson). Incisive and bitter yet deeply humane and ultimately compassionate, writer/director Baumbach has created a stirring, sharply-crafted examination of irreconcilable differences, the toll of wreckage and the shared hurt, where blame is felt, weaponized, and ultimately beclouded. It's an imperfect creation, to be sure, with certain scenes and moments that veer off course (the ""knife trick,"" lawyer Dern's speech while prepping her client for court questioning, etc.), but there are plenty more sequences of raw honesty, understated power, and relatable discomfort that ring true. Driver and Johansson both give bravura performances, as good as they've ever been before, and it's a testament to the angles they choose and the confidence in the characters they portray that neither one can (or would) claim any kind of ""victory,"" Pyrrhic or otherwise, once the smoke finally clears.86/100",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant!,I found this movie utterly heartbreaking. The acting is so good and so believable! It's a devastating story that made me so sad to watch. I highly recommend.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The middle-aged and the restless,"Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" begins with a slideshow of a man and a woman over which we hear narrations, each of them describing themselves and praising their family qualities. These descriptions are carefully written, their qualities grand beyond family life, is like they are trying to sell themselves for a job interview. But no, these are husband Charlie (Adam Driver) and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and the descriptions are what they each wrote about the other. They are in a counseling office--they are getting a divorce.Two qualities make this movie great. First of all, is the balancing act between the two parties and the second is its unpretentiousness. ""Marriage Story"" has no subliminal meaning, the divorcing couple don't act like some sort of higher symbols--what you see is what you get. The balancing act, though, happens on multiple levels. For starters, is the fact that Nicole and Charlie still love and collaborate with each other despite the divorcing act--which started without lawyers--becomes an interstate case between Los Angeles and New York--two polarizing states, both geographically and culturally. Then, is the fact that you don't know who to root for. The divorce is as complicated for the viewers as it is for the characters.The reason for divorcing is nothing too tragic--typical middle-to-upper class stuff. Charlie is an acclaimed theater director respected on Broadway and despite not being born on the East Coast he is ""more of a New Yorker than a New Yorker"" according to his wife. Nicole is an actress playing in his productions but who feels the need to break free. Her ambitions are more Hollywood and LA than NY. They also have a son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), caught in between. Happily, he is too young to suffer too much.All the performances are astounding. Driver as the workaholic but caring husband, Laura Dern as Nora Fanshaw--Nicole's LA smart, upper-class feminist lawyer--but Johansson steals the show. Her ability to direct her emotions--crying, angry, laughing, regretful--is brilliant. Her performance truly is theatrical--tragic, dramatic but not overly-dramatic. A definite Oscar contender. Throughout the movie, as the divorce escalates, there is clearly a slight bias towards Nicole, but Baumbach's on-point writing is careful so that Charlie doesn't come off as a complete loser. His career is thriving and his unusual friendship with his mother-in-law offers some of the funniest and warmest moments in the movie. She is the one who secretly recommended him an affordable lawyer. She wasn't doing that because she is against Nicole, but because he likes Charlie too much.While this movie is straight-forward, there is a particular lengthy scene worth mentioning (no, is not the fighting scene albeit it was perfectly executed). The scene in which an appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry is as strange as such an experience is expected to be. Such things involve the evaluator watching the family's natural behavior but can anyone act naturally under such conditions? The scene ends with a clever ""accident"" caused by such a procedure and it no doubt lead the evaluator to many misunderstandings.""Marriage Story"" is no doubt a movie that could happen to only a middle-to-upper class couple. Charlie and Nicole--the middle-aged and the restless--are people who are both artistically-inclined and privileged enough to want more specific things. And with a child bonding them, their official separation feels like it exists only on paper. But sometimes that is enough. Even if, in the end, a winner was declared, Nicole's career was floating and Charlie was surrounded by his friends and peers, they both lost.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't think I was supposed to laugh that much.,"Full disclosure: my parents divorced when I was 8 after my father had been abusive most of my life. He made my mom bleed on multiple occasions, and in one of those occasions, I was actually the one to send him to jail because i told the cops what I saw. Why am I telling you this? Because 'marriage story' was hailed as this 'dark depressing film'. It wasn't dark, it wasn't depressing. The music was melodramatic, but that's about it. In fact, I'm still not really sure why the characters got a divorce except for the fact the wife may have wanted to get under his shadow? I mean, neither of them were bad people. They were only coaxed to be by their lawyers. Maybe that was the whole point of the film-to show how lawyers can take something civil and make it nasty. Who knows? I'm still really confused by this film's hype. I thought it was a dark comedy and laughed a lot. It was ok. Certainly no acting awards are deserved here, but again my point of reference about a divorce is REALLY REALLY ugly.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Incredible performances elevate an honest portrayal.,"Marriage Story is a beautiful composition, plagued with heartfelt drama, severe emotional cuts and bruises, and a heartwarming honesty that relies heavily on the magnificent performances of its two leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson. Their performances elevate a very emotionally intelligent script, that knows in which moments to strike deep and clean, with resonating strong moments such as that powerful climax which will keep getting praise for years and years to come. Another standout is that musical number, with words almost as tragic as its performance, a solemn attemp by Adam Driver, whom has found his niche in demanding dramatic roles that require passion and strong intensity.Scarlett Johannson gives a firm portrayal of a woman, wife and actress who lives by the shadow of his theatre director husband, drawing an accurate sense of an overlooked woman, whom despite being successful professionally, is still heavily damaged by a loveless marriage.Marriage Story is not all about the performances, it feels like a real, authentic story, with a true and honest ending, which most of the times it is much more valuable than an happy one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two yuppies get divorced for no reason.,"I watched this after reading the rave reviews online. Adam Driver shines, but that's about the only thing that makes this half worth a watch.

I was also quite disappointed to learn in the first act that they are both actors. This could've played much better if they were ""normal"" people, as opposed to pretentious theater snobs.

Full of love despite being about a divorce.,"'Marriage Story (2019)' is full of love despite being about a divorce, taking time to establish that its focal couple don't stop caring about one another just because their marriage has drifted to an end. The piece is chock full of emotion, ranging from domestic bliss to raging agony, and it's ultimately rather nuanced, maintaining a sly sense of humour throughout most scenes. There are no winners or losers, just fallible people fumbling through their upturned lives. In this way, the affair is rather refreshing. It tells a simple tale with (comparatively) small stakes but makes it utterly compelling, equally as heart-wrenching as hopeful. The two leads are at the top of their game, proving you don't need a lightsaber or a leather suit to truly connect with an audience. Indeed, you don't need them - or any other weapons - to craft what's nearly the most devastating fight scene of the year. The experience is pretty universal, something often experienced but rarely seen, and it's incredibly effective. It's also rather affecting, hitting home hard on a number of occasions. There's not much else to say: it's a well-made and engaging drama that deserves to be seen. This sort of thing doesn't grace the big screen as often as it should, which is why it's a shame that it has been relegated to a limited release before its Netflix debut. Its only flaw is that the occasionally over-played, mile-a-minute screenplay doesn't always give its events enough time to berate - though, it often does - and that its 'both sides' perspective sort of leads to a film of two halves in which you don't fully connect with either party because you tend to leave their perspective. The screenplay is great and you do care about the characters, don't get me wrong. It's just that those areas are clearly weak-spots - minor weak-spots but weak-spots nevertheless. Overall, the movie is great. If you own Netflix, you've no reason to skip it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

As someone who went through a divorce I can tell you it brought back so many emotions and bad memories.,"Marriage Story (2019) is a movie my wife and I watched together on Netflix. The storyline follows a couple that are very different but find beauty in that, get married, have a child and pursue happiness. Unfortunately, it does not work out and they get divorced. The divorce process is worse than they anticipate and things get ugly even if they respect each other and try to maintain a friendship...they quickly discover their ability to be friends will be challenged and so will their attempts at coparenting...This movie is directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) and stars Adam Driver (Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Wallace Shawn (The Princess Bride), Julie Hagerty (Airplane) and Ray Liotta (Goodfellas).The storyline for this was very depressing but also very realistic and sucks you in.

love and life,"""Marriage Story"" At the age of 17, I was basically on the sidelines of marriage. The smallest conflicts and contradictions in life make me say the most vicious words to my loved ones. We have opposite words, even though it is not me Deliberately, but when the trivial life breaks through the sanity we have maintained, when the conflict between the two gradually deepens the evil words, at this time, the most terrible self usually hides behind. Life is just such a story without much modification, but often full of sadness. When Charlie finally saw Nicole's letter, they still loved each other so much. Then all words turned into tears in the corners of the eyes, but now we realize that it is too late! In the seemingly ordinary 'marriage relationship', the film injects thoughts and questions about sexual relations. It's really hard to see such a movie telling a heartbreaking divorce story in such a gentle way. Should we really think about when and why did we become hysterical? It 's not just a wonderful story. The performances of Adam Dreyfus and Scarlett have added a lot to this film. I even saw my shadow from Charlie in the future. A really good movie is so much without praise. The most real emotions are needed to let the audience in front of the screen think about themselves and their lives. This may be the greatness of the movie as the seventh art!

In terms of actors, the widow's performance has been very stylized, and she can't get out of the set she has already been in full swing; and the male lead Adam is the treasure actor.

"If FRIENDS had a spinoff, and Adam Driver was cast as Ross Geller...","Flanked by an allstar supporting cast, watching this 135' reminds me of Woody Allen films that has comedic moments but end up a bittersweet story about breakups with people whose fundamental difference is Hollywood vs Broadway - it was perhaps never meant to be.At times, especially the scenes with the amazing Alan Alda, feels like Woody Allen comedy, and in other scenes with Ray Liotta & Laura Dern it becomes fiery courtroom sparring. While the acting is great by both Adam Driver and Johanssen, the bickering becomes overbearingly long-winded - as if a fun guest had over-stayed their welcome by making their host listen to the same joke and the only difference being how they lead into the joke... In the end, I feel the only things great are snippets of the two leads performance, and almost all the scenes with Alda, Liotta, and Dern, made me wanting more.This could have been a great bittersweet comedy about being in love while you cannot even like each other enough to break bread without fighting over small things like how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste. I can only blame the script and the director for this oversight. While the improv singing and end scene allowed Adam Driver to shine, this would have been a better story for Woody Allen or Whit Stillman to tell... in fact, probably Rob Reiner also would have made this better than the overrated flick it is.As to Best Actress performances for 2019, I'd say this one holds no candle at all compared to Renee zellweger in JUDY (2019), but I digress...",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Making Money on Unhappiness,"The Marriage Story does not attempt to teach, does not explore new issues, especially for people who have experienced divorce and the division of financial assets and child custody. The movie scratches the souls of viewers by dramatizing the tenacious claws of the legal professionals that make money on human disappointment and conflicts.The Marriage Story starts from at the breaking point of a marital relationship. Love has expired, but careers have advanced. For the main characters to get through this chaotic stressful process, therapist and legal advisors are called upon to ameliorate the situation. The beginning of the movie starts with the introduction of each character through the use of the opposing spouse's description. It creates a bridge of understanding for viewers, regarding the marital relationship. However, the break up, without legal action is unavoidable. That's why a significant part of the movie concerns legal intervention at the final point of the marriage.The movie dialogue, especially that of Laura Dern's character, is particularly brilliant. Her monologue that most people deprived from fatherhood (God is father, father is on the heaven, accordingly children do not need to see their fathers - is a pretty persuasive rhetorical hook) sounds so argumentative, despite certain critics of the Christianity could be found (negligence in faith-based issues, presumption of inequality and etc.). Much of the lead characters exposition is reeled through the legal proceedings. Certain scenes look like the remake of Revolutionary Road (2008) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). The sad part of the movie that it never shows situations where a win-win deal is possible.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love and hate a sad heartbeat,"""Story of a Marriage"" is a difficult film to evaluate, since its core is to talk about the end of a marriage, the American-directed feature Noah Baumbarch is good but it didn't touch me, his sentimentality is strong, especially in the third act, but it is a contextual film, people who have experienced the same trauma will identify more and feel their pain, feeling and anguish at the top of their skin, which I was unable to feel.As the name suggests, ""Story of a Marriage"" deals with the breakup of a relationship of an established couple and a child, the long brush outlines the reasons for the breakup but focuses on showing the consequences of a breakup, his drama sometimes escalating. too much, and its hatred and ramifications are strange in the very sense established and created by the film, but as already had, its conclusion is beautiful and poetic, a charming third act that concludes and circumvents its errors very effectively.The direction is simple but has an exquisite use of the camera and framing, always highlighting the distance of the couple and opening up to monologues and views, which are always filled with great performances, the whole cast is fine, Adam Drive and Scarlett Johansson has phenomenal chemistry, and both actors are great in their roles.""Marriage Story"" is a good movie, it deserves and will take some Oscar nominations, but again, it's a very contextual movie that needs a previous viewer experience, those who don't have that traumatic experience, will see the qualities of the movie but will not feel all your sentimentality.

"Poignant, real and convincing performances","Marriage Story - Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) could have been a star after a successful debut film, but chose to join Charlie (Adam Driver), a talented and rising theatre director whose vision she shares and eventually marries. With the passage of time Charlie grows prolific with fame, maturity and authority, whilst Nicole settles down to become the leading lady of his productions and creative pursuits, living his dreams as hers too. For many years, she remains agnostic to her own aspirations, becoming Charlie's muse, wife, a mother to the lovable Henry and a caring housewife.It's business as usual until Nicole realizes that she has sacrificed far too much of her own self for Charlie but the latter has taken her devotion for granted. In the process, she has lost her individuality and almost forgotten who she actually is, and he doesn't care. She decides to file for divorce from Charlie amid the seemingly happy and stable status, taking him off guard completely. Marriage Story is a narrative of the common people shaken up by the disruption of a happy matrimony and a humdrum life. It is a deep dive into the character of a stereotypically patriarchal and almost misogynistic head of the family who believes everything is normal as long as the family seems to be happy and old, unfulfilled promises made aren't being dug into. It is also about the predicament of a child who is facing a family meltdown, watching helplessly as the parents drift apart.The treatment of the sombre subject by the writer and director Noah Baumbach is the strength of Marriage Story, it is kept natural, sans melodrama. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson bring out the depths of their respective characters with ease and conviction. The sequence where the couple finally confronts each other releasing the pent up agony and frustration is hugely believable and poignant. Laura Dern's essay of Nicole's lawyer Nora Fanshaw is sterling, especially the scene where she counsels Nicole about the perceptions about mothers and their model code of conduct.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ugliness of divorce beautifully told.,"Marriage Story is based on the divorce of Writer-Director Noah Baumbach and actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (who I just watched a couple of days ago in Annihilation, another Netflix movie.) It also borrows from Baumbach's parent's divorce, and also from Scarlett Johansson who was going through her second divorce when she was approached for the film. Laura Dern is also a divorcee (shared the same lawyer with Scarlett which Dern's character is loosely based on,) and Adam Driver's parents were also divorced, so when Baumbach said this movie is theirs as much as his, he acknowledges the integral inputs they all gave in making this movie. For a drama, it's not dragging and had its funny moments but it also showed the very ugly side of divorce. One character said: ""Criminal lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst."" It's a business in making look people bad, hitting each other on technicalities and if necessary, go down to the level of magnifying small mistakes as life-threatening ones, all in the name of getting custody of a child they both say they love very much.The movie is very much about Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, both of whom bear an uncanny resemblance to Baumbach and Leigh. Adam who I first saw in HBO's Girls, I thought I hated him but also fell in love with which is a testament to his acting ability. In 2019 we saw him both as Kylo Ren in Star Wars Episode IX and Marriage Story, and there's really no way but up for him in the years to come. Scarlett Johansson is good as usual, but her comment about being able to play whatever role she wants still rubs me off in the wrong way. Laura Dern was superb, shining brightly even as a supporting role. Her performance here is a mix of her The Fault in our Stars cool mom and her 'Big Little Lies' vicious mom. It even has a dash of the cunning Vice Admiral Holdo from Star Wars Episode IX.The heart of the movie is the confrontation between the couple. It became more impressive after reading how it was done in 50 takes in two days. They had to finish each take before starting over, and no improvisations were allowed. Everything was scripted, even their pauses. From time to time the director will hand them notes to elicit a different reaction. Other highlights include the scene where Driver's character reads the letter Johansson's character wrote describing him and the litany of Dern's character as to why women are held to higher standards: women are compared to Mary who did everything for Jesus while men are held to standards of Joseph who was an absentee father. Compelling stuff right there.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"This movie seems to be less about the people involved, and more about LA and NY. I got that vibe watching it. A couple is getting divorced, and we are introduced to their lives. But they don't seem to be the main attraction here. They have long winded speeches which really go nowhere and make no difference. And they meet people who are also just people who make no difference. It's the entire painting that's important, like an abstract piece. There's a story sure, but it's something else above it all that's going on. Not sure what it is actually.The movie is good though. It's about a husband and wife getting a divorce. The man is an acclaimed playwriter, and the woman is an actress. There really is no plot. They get a divorce, and have to adjust. That's it.I thought Scarlett was incredible in the scenes I paid attention to. She has such a unique look I wouldn't call beautiful, but a smile that would catch anyone's attention. Adam Driver is just a guy, stern and serious. Just an ordinary, nobody type guy. It also has family stuff involved in it which is nice too.I liked it. I thought it was great. A good watch. I would definitely watch it again sometime.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A solid divorce story!,"I will have to start by saying that this is my first Noah Baumbach film and I have to say it didn't disappoint me but didn't reach my expectations as well. The three basic reasons for the success of this film is Noah , Scarlett and Adam. This movie is an acting ring having Scarlett and Adam competing with Noah as a referee and he handled the match perfectly. But I felt that Adam's performance was way better than Johansson's in every scene they were in it together I couldn't take my eyes off him even the master scene between them he won at the end of that scene with a K.O. Scarlett is doing her first awesome performance but I can't say it is one of the greatest performance ever but I can relate If she won the Oscar this year cause of the lack of powerful performances in Leading Actress category. The screenplay and the way Noah told this movie felt like I were in the 60s of the 2010s! The scenes and the looks of it made me feel most of it that it was in the past a really perfect look for each scene. The screenplay almost concluded everything that has to do with the divorce matter and lawyers interference in the whole subject and turning it into was. However, the movie had boring moments and the sexual stuff in it especially for Scarlet's character felt unnecessary on the contrary it is frequent with men which was represented by Adam's character without getting to show it. Also If the score of the film was stronger, it would have added to the scenes a make a better value for them but it was silent most of the film and even at the master scene itself. Didn't feel the kid much in this film or his acting too. In the end, a good movie to watch but I don't think I would watch it again. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Noah Baumbach's finest film till the date!,"Regrets held deep down the lane of emotions and ego can often lead to a larger impact than what is usually imaginable & Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story,"" a film with highs and as many lows, reflects the very realistic modern-day story of instinctive and very natural love alongside a forceful but understandable differences of opinions.But as they say, no life is perfect. The very word of ""imperfection"" is an integral part of any human being. And Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) were no different. After years of marriage and a kid of 7-8 years age, Nicole finally decides to move on, citing the selfishness of a normal busy businessman Charlie. And that's where, with a simplistic plot coupled with great depth, the film starts to question your mindset and righteousness. It keeps deceiving the audiences throughout and boggles the minds with numerous scenes that may lead to an emotional attachment....... With two fictitious but highly relatable on screen characters. And then there were the bunch of lawyers, who Charlie even went onto call ""assholes,"" is a perfect example of all the troubles that couples face during the divorcing saga. But is the mental burden the end? No. How the entire society is impacted alongside your kid and how a relationship instinctively ends up lasting forever are well and truly showcased in the most appropriate manner possible in this film.Credits to the the fantastic screenplay and even more fantastic direction of Noah Baumbach! But can we take away anything from the technical department? A huge no. The scoring by Randy Newman, cinematography by Robbie Ryan & editing by Jennifer Lame were top-tier. The usage of 35mm made the film looked more relatable than ever with all the actors looking much larger and closer, and therefore leaving a more mental impact. The off-white coloring helped capturing the essence of Los Angeles and New York alike magnificently. In the end, it was the spot-on dramatic background scoring which played a key-role throughout the film. Most importantly, the dialogue writing, supported by a wonderful yet compact cast selection, was on point. The way Noah Baumbach used metaphors via storybooks, body language and all held the artistical values within but the pace intact. Kudos to each one of the makers in the film for being able to deliver such a masterpiece!All in all, Netflix's ""Marriage Story"" is definitely one of the finest divorce dramas ever and missing it is something I definitely won't be suggesting. Although, it may not be for everyone, partly due to slight bit of profanity and how the theme is adult-centric. But if you decide to watch - be sure to be prepared for an extraordinary emotional rollercoaster ride of lots of differences and other factors (relatable for many)!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Very Unique Story,"Of course I knew this was going to be a good film, but for the most part I was unsure what would make this film so special, unique, and good. The answer is that it's just a normal story of a family divorcing, and the parents trying to work it out with their child. The whole entire story is sort of depressing, because it focuses on the breaking of a family that was once strong. The first few minutes of the film start off with good vibes, but the rest is just full of hate, and dealing with their son and who wants to spend more time with their son. It's a simple idea, but nobody has ever been brave enough to show a story like this in a film, that's what makes it unique. It dives into the feelings that the parents have and the innocence of the child throughout this process. Another aspect of why this movie was so good, was the directing. Directing in small ways can really make or break a film, it defines what a film is and it can turn it into a piece of art. Throughout the film, there were several monologues that were crucial to the storyline and very emotional. As these were taking place, the camera would slowly zoom in, or it would not change its view to give the audience an outside look at what this character was really struggling with. The final piece of this movie that defined it for me was the acting. Both Adam Driver and Scarlatti Johansson were incredible. I was surprised because Laura Dern also did a great job. They all made us feel their emotion and made us want to help them in some way, it was truly amazing. A very unique experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The way the story is told and acted will move everyone who watches it. After the introductory speeches even I, a person who is hard to move in movies, was deeply affected.
Since both points of view are shown to the audience, you can understand how the relationship between the characters got to the point where it is at the moment. And you can see how all of this could have been avoided, but accept what is happening.

"A decent film about the transformation of a relationship, but it is not a romantic movie","This is a film about the complexity of relationships - how two people can be so deeply connected yet so utterly disconnected at the same time. While the film focuses on a tiny window through the entirety of a decade long relationship, it was a transformational moment, the culmination of years of communication breakdown and growing apart. The divorce lawsuit gave both a chance of reality check - through the eyes of the lawyers and the judicial system, they were forced out of their own narrative to re-examine what happened to their relationship, which roles they played in the sequence of events, as well as how to go forward with the best interest of the child in mind. In the process, they also went from being self-centric and directing emotions outwards, to being more inner looking and empathetic. In the end, decisions about relationships are highly personal and subjective. Good or bad, relationships can never go back to where they were once upon a time. The film captures this aspect of life very well.The actors did a phenomenal job and the music choices are excellent. However, I do feel at times that the film dragged a bit. In additional, beware that many emotional and plot transitions are subtle, yet closely connected. The actors delivered that brilliantly, but not every viewer caught those slight shifts in the details, which is reflected on some of the confusion or frustration about the movie expressed in the reviews written here. It is not a film about romance, or evil lawyers, or parental responsibilities. Unfortunately, the trailer is a bit misleading and some viewers probably had a different expectation going in.All in all, this is a well-made film and I recommend it to people who are interested in movies about relationships that have healthy amount of realism and maturity.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Netflix Has Come Along Way,"The story of Charlie and Nicole... One, a highly respected New York Theater director and the other, an L.A. Actress who, in a period of burnout, leaves her L.A. life and moves to New York where she meets, works with, and eventually marries Charlie.Narration starts the story, where the two characters describe all that they love about each other while we see examples of those words depicted on screen. We then come to find that these ""narrations"" are actually the written words each has been asked to write about each other as they begin the process of divorce. A beautifully well crafted and concise way of introducing the characters, establishing their love for each other, and why they married without delaying the main focus of the story... the pains of divorce.Charlie and Nicole wish to end things as peacefully as possible. However, self-interest (or perhaps a bit of self-preservation) for the lives each wish to live beyond marriage interfere with those goals. The process of divorce, particularly when custody of a child is involved, picks at the wounds that led to the divorce, making it easier to forget what people may have once loved about each other.Most divorces are a result of paths going in different directions, realizations of things that you may not have seen during the infancy of a relationship. Careers, ambition, feelings of self-worth... they all come into play and are depicted as fuel for the gradual demise of their relationship.Now, enter the many vultures that surround these two looking to divorce. Divorce attorneys that you almost feel have developed their approaches or styles, perhaps based on some bad divorce they, themselves, had gone through. They do not always seem to have their client's best interests in mind. Their aim to score the win for their client simply fans the fires of pain that may already be encircling the soon to be ex-couple.Without going further into plot, the biggest success of this film is how each character is a sympathetic character but at the same time, guilty of sins that may have led to current events, signifying there is no ALL Good or ALL bad... no main villain.. but simply two people whose paths intersected at one point, met each other's needs for a time, then ultimately drifted in different directions.At the center of all of this is their son, who clearly loves both mother and father, who has some connection issues due to distances between father and son, both geographically and emotionally. But through it all, the son serves as catalyst for the rising contentiousness of the interaction between mother and father as they fight for custody.All told, the story progresses to a moment that showcases some of the best acting I've seen from BOTH actors to date.I would love to comment on the ending but I hesitate, not because of spoilers, but because I almost feel that the uncertainty of how it ends is part of what gives the ending a satisfying feeling.Not since Kramer vs Kramer has a film about divorce given such a painfully earnest look at divorce. Fair, yet honest, and, at times, emotionally gut wrenching look into divorce. This movie is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love my sprawling city, but this film made me want to leave forever and move to Manhattan.Such typical east coast snobbery here, the shots of NY included the esoteric theater (or should I say theatre) company and the jazzy bar where the pretty girl you know is signing a tune... it was so romanticized and hence saccharin. The shots of LA were mostly of Adam Driver's character having a miserable time in a miserable apartment, surrounded by gritty mini malls. These places exist as part of the tapestry that makes LA diverse and interesting, and yet there is so much natural beauty too.Geographical diatribe over, the film packs a powerful performance punch by Adam Driver.

Why do we love those who we eventually grow to hate?,"I used to go to parties that my parent's friends would throw when I was younger, and many happy memories were had when we would go in the summer time. Unfortunately though, all good things must come to an end as the people who would host the parties eventually got a divorce and thus the parties ended, and despite the fact that they weren't my parents, I felt like as if my parents were getting a divorce. I always felt empathy for my friends that I grew up with whose parents got divorced rather it be for one reason or another. I fortunately never had to suffer through a divorce, as my parents have been happily married for almost 30 years now with no intention of seperating, so I didn't know how I would react to this film.Marriage Story is a film that I would call an 'actor-driven movie.' Much like films such as Good Will Hunting, 12 Angry Men, or A Few Good Men, Marriage Story is a film that's reliant on the actors and their performances. Not many movies like Marriage Story are made anymore, where actors are just given room to explore what they can do and I think that Marriage Story joins the films that I mention above as one of the best actor-driven movies that I've ever seen. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson aren't even acting in this film, which might be the highest praise I could give. I felt the blur of emotions that Driver and Johannson convey throughout this movie and I felt like these were real people, not actors playing a role. It's simply some of the best acting I've ever seen from Driver and Johannson, the rest of the cast are also strong, with a motherly like performance coming from Laura Dern or a grandfatherly performance coming from ol' Hawkeye Pierce himself, Alan Alda. Another thing that I loved about this film is how it doesn't allow you to take sides, the film showcases both of the main character's virtues, as well as their flaws and you can feel the frustration that they feel towards each other, but also the love that they still have for each other, despite everything that's happened. If there's a motif for this film, it would be that it makes you feel...a lot.There's no such thing as the perfect film of course, but much to my surprise I only had two problems with this movie, one being the performance of Ray Liotta, who becomes a bit grating as the abrasive lawyer though, to the film's credit, I think that was the point, and a scene where Driver's character sings, and while Adam Driver surprisingly has some good voice chops, I felt that it didn't really service the film in any meaningful way.Luckily, the film wasn't the 2 hour and 16 minute depression fest that I initially thought it would be, Noah Baumbach shows skill in littering in some humor and light hearted moments to balance with the bittersweet, somber tone of the film. There's also Baumbach's masterful use of tension that illuminates most of the scenes that Driver and Johannson share, and not in a suspenseful way, but rather in this lurking, uncomfortable sort of tension that's just itching to get out. Another thing that I expected to see was fighting, and there wasn't much of that, except for two instances...just two. But then again, most of the film is carried by that sense of uncomfortable tension.Marriage Story is a film that deals with a number of difficult topics and emotions, but it is a film that deals with its themes and emotions with a sense of grace that makes me want to seek out more of Baumbach's work in the near future. It was simply wonderful, and you would do yourself a disservice if you don't see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautifully filmed raw human nature,"I am not even close to getting married at the moment but if I get there this movie will be my guide of what not to do since the reasons this marriage got to an end are the things I'm afraid of happening to me too.
The movie itself is just as it has to be. It's simple, it's raw, it's beautiful. Everything is so human, so real you can feel it familiar yet everything the couple does and how human they are - just like us, watchers - makes you feel uncomfortable even about yourself. This film is heavy.
The actors are amazing I already adored both of them but they are just wow playing together.It's the kind of movie I wanna watch over and over again because the actors and the filming are incredible yet I'm hesitating because I don't feel ready to get my emotions flipped over again soooooo I think this will be my new go to ""I feel numb and wanna cry it out"" movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good Film, But A Tad Long","MARRIAGE STORY is a good, realistic story that keeps you intrigued from the beginning to end. The acting and writing are both excellent, and the directing is very good. Filmmaker Noah Baumbach has come a long way.His earlier films were good and they've consistently been so since then. This is perhaps his best so far overall, though by only complaint is the length. Longer films are fine, but this feels just a tad too long for what it is. Still very good thought. Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's A Hard Watch But I Have I Zero Regrets!,"Charlie (Adam Driver) & Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are a married couple who have finally given up on each other and agree to get a divorce. No matter what they do to correct the once happy marriage (including counselling) the end results remain the same. Marriage Story allows us to witness the lifestyle and personal challenges that come to both Charlie and Nicole as they question the future for themselves and their only son. Things become even more tense and dramatic when both partners seek out lawyers in the pursuit of custody of their son.When I first heard that actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were playing a married couple on screen I couldn't imagine how that would work. But as I began watching the film, I couldn't get over how convincing the two are as a married couple. The two show great chemistry which thankfully is kept consistent throughout the entire film. Even when the two are arguing or disagreeing, you can actually feel that the two people are connected and were once married. Marriage Story easily has some of the greatest performances of 2019 and not just from the leads. It also provided a top notch supporting cast who were surprisingly entertaining whenever they appeared. Some of the supporting cast actors included Laura Dern, Ray Liotta & Alan Alda who all played lawyers throughout the film. Each actor, just like the leads, was solid and extremely convincing in all areas.Another key strength is the dialogue and script. It's quick, snappy and on top of that, it just feels so real. Considering this is classed as a drama I never found myself bored during the story. The way the actor's delivered scripted lines sometimes even comes across as fun amidst the dramatic moments. It's quite surprising the way this film juggles between the positive moments as well as the sad ones as we watch everything going on with Charlie and Nicole.Marriage Story is well directed and has a good audio track as well as visuals. At no point did the shots disappoint me or feel out of place. Everything here is enjoyable and comfortable to view for the whole duration. The film has done a great job at providing small transitions between selected scenes which can make it feel like a stage play. Another fun effect is the use of jazz tunes to uplift the tone of the film after a tense moment.In a nutshell Marriage Story is surprisingly enjoyable considering the film's themes and topic. Even if you think this type of film isn't relatable to you, I still highly recommend it. The film's performances are absolutely surprising and had I seen this in a cinema, I would have stood up and applauded it.9.6/10

"Painful and hard to watch, in a good way","Adam Driver deserves the Oscar win. He is the clear frontrunner imo.The movie itself is really good, albeit with an unsatisfying ending.I cried throughout the movie. It really hit me hard, as I can very much relate to the situations presented, particularly as my parents divorced when I was 2. All the pain and upheaval was well captured in this movie, especially by Adam Driver (one of my fav actors) who gives the performance of his career.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Love Story About Divorce,"I think the first film I remember crying at was Kramer v Kramer; I don't know how old I was, but I remember being in the same room as it when the TV was showing it one Christmas. I don't think I fully understood it - but I know what stayed with me so powerfully was the way I sensed it articulating something of my own fear of my own parents splitting up. Not that I ever had any reason to think that would happen - it didn't. But I remember the fear.Many years and 20 years of my own marriage later, Marriage Story doesn't evoke the same fear, but it does evoke both a kind of sadness as to the way it portrays what so many go through, a kind of recognition of the sort of slow escalations that all of us experience in almost any sort of relationship. It's the simple - yet complex - story of a couple's marriage in breakdown ... they start in couple's counselling and ends in divorce, following the negotiation of the details along the way.It seems odd to cast the film among the performance industry - he is a theatre director, she an actress; at times that's in danger of tipping the film into the sort of conflicts most of us don't have to deal with, but in the end there's enough truth there to make this feel like an 'everyman' sort of relationship.The whole film hints occasionally at the heightened realities of musicals - the framing, the tight close-ups and tracking shots following the long speeches of one or the other, maybe even the colour palette at times suggesting the 1950s/60s musicals golden era. When Adam Driver's character, near the film's end, sings a Sondheim song in a bar, that sense is bought closer to the heart; like musicals, the film is unashamed in trying to move us and does so.Much of this is quite remarkable - Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are outstanding, both of them simultaneously sympathetic and repellant, highlighting the reality that the film doesn't force us to choose one side or the other; or if it does, the way we jump is down to our own biased, not the film's. The film's standout moment, an argument that starts amicably and ends in words that can't be unsaid, is the sort of sequence you feel as if you're privy to someone else's private pain, laundry that should only aired in private hung out for all to see. It's remarkable in performance, direction and writing - and everything else besides.The film also mines comedy out of some of the most painful situations; the moment Adam Driver's character is served with divorce papers is almost farce-like in its execution, yet the tonal shift within the scene never jars. Much within the film is funny, because people are funny; there's always a hint of joy, even in the midst of great pain.This, I think, is where the hope in the film comes from; given where we are almost certain the film will end right from the first scene, the light touches of humour and the moments of clarity amidst the recriminations, claims and counterclaims point us to the human capacity to be better versions of ourselves even when so much seems to be falling around us. Like the best films, it's never one thing entirely - it's a love story about a divorce, a drama with very good jokes and comedic scenes, a musical with only one song. It's a film about one particular relationship, that allows us to see every relationship (not just marital ones) in a fresh light.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Both heartwarming and heart-wrenching,"A wonderful and practical story that is heartwarming and heart-wrenching at the same time. Crisp and plain filming and editing style that brings the phenomenal acting delivered by Nicole and Charlie. A perfect balance between comedy and story-telling, which effectively brings the audience through the supposedly solemn process of the marriage with a light tone. Movie seems to be mainly rooting for one side of the relationship though, would love to hear more from Charlie's side of the story such that the principle cause of divorce could be explored more profoundly, but the inner struggles of the process of divorce are articulated very well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Excellent performance, but fail to relate on many levels","Marriage Story is a good film but an overrated good film. It's at times great, but it doesn't work for me on many levels.As someone who is going through a divorce myself, I just can't identify at all with Nicole. From the very beginning her grounds for divorce seems incredibly flimsy. Do a couple who are clearly still in love with each other decide to end it for the reasons given in the film? I can see why so many are labelling them as hipsters. Well... And Charlie at the end of the film wants to move to LA. Well... Are we supposed to sympathise?As for the plot, there are just too many similarities to Synecdoche, New York. So the wife has decided to move to a far away place, and taking the child whom the husband fears he will never see. Then the husband is a theatre director who got a MacArthur grant, and is the love interest of a ""lesser"" female member of the theatre crew. And then a condescending female professional (lawyer / therapist) provides comedy relief. I mean, am I supposed to immerse myself in the plot when I am counting similarities of this plot with another plot?And then there's more. So Nicole is an actress turned successful female director. How wonderful, guess who that reminds me of? I really hope Gerwig wouldn't mind getting written into a divorce drama while Baumbach is still with her. I am hoping Scarlett Johansson is not going to be the big screen witness to another director couple divorce (well she's technically not on big screen in Her but hey).So you see, there are just too many elements stopping me emotionally investing in the characters. Critics love it for the in-jokes, maybe. But to be honest these in-jokes are just plain annoying and pointless.I like films with a stage play feel when it's done right. Marriage Story has good rhythm and excellent performances but I feel the wit is missing. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson have both probably done their career best here. Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are both totally enjoyable. The intense dialogues and monologues are definitely great but they are just soooooo obviously vehicles for ""outstanding performance of a lead role in drama"".To be honest, I doubt people will remember Marriage Story in 10 years. Maybe drama students will. As this film feels incredibly like a drama class exercise.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Depressing and preachy,"Marriage Story is a depressing tale of how divorce turns people into the worst versions of themselves. The dialog includes preachy/pedantic dialog in which the screenwriter speaks through the characters instead of letting the ideas come out more naturally. For example, her lawyer preaches about how women are treated differently in the courts, which is true, but we are left feeling as though we are at a protest rally rather than in a consultation. Similarly, his lawyer preaches about how the system is set up to make merciless adversaries of the spouses, which also may be true. In both cases these ideas could have been presented more naturally through just telling a story. While Driver and Johansson are good in their roles, the overall movie is a miserable experience.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Inspired by Bergman, but very much it's own success","Even before Noah Baumbach showed us the article with Nicole and Charlie titled ""Scenes from a Marriage"", the movie screamed of influences to Bergman to me. The main characters are a theater director and an actress (like in After the Rehearsal). There are shots that evoke Persona. And the basic story feels like stuff that happens between episode 3 and 4 of the Swedish television series. The actual divorce in Bergman's film is largely glossed over, skipping from the admission of infidelity to the final fight that leads to signing of the divorce papers, but it's the sole focus of Baumbach's film. Aside from all the Bergman influences, though, this is a very good film.The movie uses a framing device that works incredibly well. The first ten minutes of the movie are two letters written by each of the main characters that details how they love the other, however they were written at the behest of a mediator for their divorce, trying to establish a ground floor of emotional contrast from their current situation. The problem is that the letters never get read. Nicole hates what she wrote, but Charlie is open to reading it. Yet Nicole barges out of the office before anything can be read, her rage at the very exercise.She has good reason to be angry, having discovered that Charlie had a brief affair recently while he was also unhelpful in moving them from New York to Los Angeles where she wanted to get into television work. He, though, almost single-handedly made her a serious actress after bringing her onto his theater troupe after her one big credit of ""girl who takes her top off"" in a teen sex comedy, while she also hasn't had sex with him in a year. Let's just say, the situation is really messy.The mediator was their effort to settle the divorce without lawyers, but everything goes sideways when Nicole moves her and their son to Los Angeles and she hires a high-priced divorce attorney. Suddenly even the question of whether the family is based on New York or Los Angeles comes into question, a turn of events that Charlie simply can't believe. He's behind the ball, trying to play catchup on California divorce law and get a lawyer while suddenly needing to establish a residence in Los Angeles.The process is the punishment in this film, and both Nicole and Charlie get punished (with heavy implications that this is the fault of the lawyers). They end up dragging each other through the mud with the central point being custody of their son. Charlie is shocked at how easily Henry adapts to his new life in Los Angeles while expressing nothing but disdain for his former life in New York. Charlie does everything he can to try and reconnect with the child he suddenly finds that he's on the verge of losing, all to little avail.The movie is at its absolute height, though, when Nicole and Charlie fight. There's so much hidden anger within the relationship that comes out in that famous fight where Charlie beats a hole in the wall. The scene really hinges on the acting talents of Black Widow and Kylo Ren, and both Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver rise to the occasion, delivering blistering performances of pure unadulterated rage. It's a marvel to behold.The messiness of life ends up sorting itself out and a truce of a sort ends up falling into place. It's a messy end to a messy story, but the journey is harrowing and sad. The ending of the framework comes when Charlie finds Nicole's letter from the beginning of the film. These were two people who did love each other, who got a lot from each other in their relationship, and who not only decided to split but who also let their acrimony against the other determine the course of the divorce, damaging both of them in the process. The portrait is incredibly compelling and a wonderful look into an ugly process that never seems to have a winner.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful film about the collapse of a marriage,"For me, there are several reasons this film is a 9/10. To elaborate, very few films, only a handful, for me are a 10/10. For a film to be 10/10 it must be perfect, this film was sadly so close but was, however, let down by odd sound mixing at the beginning of the film that lasted for a while.1) The Acting
The acting is superb, some of the best of this decade. Incredible. The crying, the shouting, the slight show of frustration, the happiness and desperation they show to one another over the decay of the relationship. The acting is something that elevates the film to such a high degree and allows the characters to feel very real.2) The Story
The story is well formulated. Now, I am not an avid romance film watcher, thus I cannot say if the story is unique in the sense of talking about divorce.3) The Characters
There are no characters in this film that feels off or out of place. All acted well and non felt still. The sister of the wife (Scarlett Johansson) did feel a tad bit over the top/comical. Otherwise every character had a depth to them. A motivation that made sense and both had benefits and flaws like people do.4) Cinematography
The cinematography isn't anything overly special. However, it does the job and is some instances looks very nice to beautiful.Overall, very well made film that I would recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's clever, but not in a bad way.This calendar year, any calendar year, movies that actually prick my emotions (in real time) are very rare. Spanish-language Our Time, and Pain and Glory, did it. Here, ScarJo and Driver got to my emotions, a couple of times.The money scene, a full-on donnybrook between the divorcing couple, is terrific.
