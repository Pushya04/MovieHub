Absolutely hilarious,"Ryan gosling had me in tears at times, even Russell Crowe had me laughing. It was hilarious with a good story. I didn't really know what to expect when putting this on because I've never even heard of it, but I'm so glad I found it. Was just a solid film all round, I have absolutely zero complaints or anything negative to say about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absurdist parody of neo-noir private detective movies,"It's an absurdist parody of neo-noir private detective movies set in 1977 in Los Angeles, California. It follows a barely competent, recently widowed private eye named Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and a bodyguard tough guy named Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe). Holland lives with his 13-year-old daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), in a rented home since his house blew up from a gas leak that killed his wife.They both become involved in a complex plot in which they try to find Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), a young woman sought by violent men for unclear reasons. As the bizarre plot unfolds, they intersect with Amelia's mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a high Justice Department official, and Judith's assistant, Tally (Yaya DaCosta). They also encounter three hitmen pursuing Amelia--Older Guy (Keith David), Blueface (Beau Knapp), and John Boy (Matt Bomer). A porno star, Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), also makes a brief appearance at the film's beginning.""The Nice Guys"" is off-the-wall with lots of physical comedy that borders on cartoonish, making the frequent violence seem less real. Angourie Rice is great as a kid who's smarter than her father but hampered by higher ethical standards. The script is funny, and Gosling and Crowe carry their roles well. It is pretty sexist. But if you like neo-noir, you may like this take-off.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A raucous buddy comedy and stuff.,"I'm sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that ""Kingsman"" did.It's 1977 Los Angeles. Star Wars has premiered. Disco is in full swing. And porn star Misty Mountains has just died (spectacularly). It's pretty disturbing then that dodgy licensed private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired two days later to find Misty by the slightly kooky Mrs Glenn (Lois Smith, the equally kooky doctor in ""Minority Report"") who saw her through the windows of Misty's home. Never one to turn down a pay check, Holland takes the case and the trail leads him to search for a missing girl called Amelia (Margaret Qualley). This leads him right into the substantial fists of the 'heavy for hire' Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe), who's been hired by Amelia NOT to be found. But it's clear that Amelia is at the centre of a tornado of intrigue, since her mother Judith (Kim Basinger) is head of the Justice department and there are some heavies from New York and Detroit looking for Amelia too.As the film's tag-line admits ""The Nice Guys"" are ""far from nice"", and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"". (And that comparison is 100% valid since - and I honestly discovered this after I wrote that - director Shane Black (""Iron Man 3"") got into cinema by writing the screenplay for the original ""Lethal Weapon"" back in 1987). But ""The Nice Guys"" has an edge that those films of the 80's couldn't have got away with. Subtle it ain't. There is a lot of violence, a bit of 70's porn and some fruity language that sensitive viewers may find offensive. (All in all, it's a bit of a surprise that it got away with a '15' certificate in the UK).But it's also insanely funny at times. Some of the sight gags are laugh out loud material (and I don't tend to act on that often in a packed cinema). You might recall in ""Diamond's Are Forever"" that a Vegas hood tosses Plenty O' Toole out of Bond's hotel window. ""Good Shot"" quips Bond. ""I didn't know there was a pool down there"" responds the hoodlum. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable.Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry together (although the degree of acting required by Crowe is debatable: he looks and acts like he seems to in most media interviews!) Some of their dialogue appears distinctly ad-libbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. And Matt Bomer and Beau Knapp make memorably crazed villains. A role that unfortunately does irritate is Qualley's: the character of Amelia is supposed to be a bit crazed, but her speaking part is 120% off the scale.The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Holland's morally-centred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene she's in. A young lady to watch for the future.1970's LA is nicely realised, with nice little subliminal drop-in shots: a Jaws 2 poster; Tower Records; the original Hollywood Tower Hotel. And the film naturally attracts some banging' 70's tunes to the soundtrack, with Al Green peerless over the closing titles.But it's not perfect. The plot is quite impenetrable (I'm still unclear exactly what the relationship between Misty and Amelia was). And Black's screenplay (written with Anthony Bagarozzi) over-eggs the pudding of the final showdown scene. But while it won't be to everyone's tastes, I thought it was a blast from beginning to end: a guilty pleasure of bad taste that begs for a sequel. I would go to see the Gosling/Crowe show again. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far.Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review and provide feedback on your views.

Ryan Gosling as a ragdoll,This was an ecstatics spectacle. Ryan Gosling just keeps falling off and tumbling and walking out unscathed in search of the truth. And the beautiful vibe of 1970s Los Angeles is brought it to perfection.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Cast all brilliant.,"My British/Irish humour puts me at variance with US comedy. This film was funny because of the subtlety and great acting. I rarely like films when a child tags along because often the child behaves with a pretence superior to the adults but in this film the young girl was outstanding and can be taken seriously and believable.
This is one easy to follow adventure with lots of funny bits. The story is not the star, the cast and the way they blend is well done. Rarely do you see a film when the whole cast are brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Nice Guys,"I'll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black's original works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish, but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to suddenly turn very basic, with things ""falling"" into place almost too miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stupidity as an Art of Comedy,"The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is a excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes — absurd in a comic way. The gags are all unexpected; I was constantly asking myself ""What the hell is going on?"", and then burst into laughter. The plot could seem weird at the beginning, but it's not the main point in this movie, it is only used to create a context to the jokes. People in the theater couldn't stop laughing. There is a new and original joke every two minutes. Russell Crowe plays his part very well, but Ryan Gosling's performance is already cult. All is in the look in his eyes, and that stupid expression on his face. Two stupid and impulsive men in an outrageous world full of porn stars and guns, fighting for...money. And truth, of course. Always the old truth about some kind of conspiracy (the only weakness in the movie). Hopefully, Shane Black doesn't insist too much on that and concentrates himself on the constant jokes. I guarantee you, you will laugh a lot. I know I've just watched an excellent movie when I feel sad during the credits, because it's already over. And then, it's just pure happiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gosling and Crowe star in one of the most underrated and hilarious,"The Nice Guys is an absolutely fantastic film from beginning to end! Every scene in the movie has at least 3 jokes that will make you belly laugh, and the action is well shot and choreographed. Additionally, Angourie Rice is also great in this flick, as she puts on one of the best performances any child actor has. Did I mention how funny the jokes are? The villains are great as well, even if they are extremely intentionally cliché making them so much better! That aside, the film provides the audience with a genuinely well thought out and well executed mystery. All in all, is this film fantastic? Yes. Is it funny? Absolutely. Should you watch it?

Lolita,"This movie has a Lolita complex. Really odd. Wanted to like this movie but turned it off about halfway. Enough is enough.From the adult film star who is roughly 15 or 16 years old, to the daughter who is probably 13 saying dirty things during the party scene, hell even to the 11 year old boy who talks dirty, this movie is really odd. The acting is fine, the script is standard Hollywood except for the placement of children throughout it. The opening scene is great and it pulls you in but the rest drags and you're left wondering wtf the writers were thinking. Where are all the parents watching stuff like this?",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Laugh Out Loud Comedy,"The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy, except instead of cops, they're a private investigator and a contract tough guy who find themselves both looking for the same girl, who's gotten herself wrapped up in political and pornographic intrigue. While there are a number of action sequences, The Nice Guys is focused more on delivering humour and jokes based around a couple of reasonably well-developed characters and a mystery that's a little absurd and off- the-wall.The comedy on offer here is quality stuff. The Nice Guys isn't just the latest Apatow or Rogen production that seems to just recycle jokes from other movies. Many of the jokes are well- thought out and some of them are actually clever. There's also a number of more slapstick moments, but none of them come as hammy, including the sight of Ryan Gosling fumbling with his gun and cigarette while sat in a cubicle. The comedy can be a little dark at times though, so if you like lighter laughs, The Nice Guys probably isn't your kind of movie. On that note, I was quite surprised at the amount of violence, gore, and nudity in play. Thankfully it's only gratuitous when it needs to be (which in this movie basically means for comedic effect). People do die, sometimes gruesomely, and there are a lot of boobs and constant talk of sex and pornography, sometimes from kids. Again if these kinds of things offend your soft heart, avoid The Nice Guys.Talking of kids in this movie, one of the earliest lines refers to how kids these days know too much and act too grown up. This is a subtle theme of the entire movie. The line in question refers to a thirteen year old girl who chats up a guy three times her age for some weed, and another scene has a kid on a bike talking about his big dick, but more prominently is Angourie Rice who plays Holly, the PI's daughter, and shows a massive amount of maturity in every scene, often showing up her father in smarts. I would love to see a sequel set a number of years ahead where we follow a grown up Holly continuing her father's work.The father himself, Holland March, is Ryan Gosling on top form. Most of the roles I'd seen him play were super serious ones, and his mumbling, tortured personas, while fantastic, started to grate. Here he is completely different. He's a silly, fumbling idiot a lot of the time, and provides the most laughs. His sense of comedy timing is perfect, and his slapstick antics are flat-out hilarious. That's not to mean that he plays the fool. In a lesser actors hands, that's exactly how March's character would have come across, but Gosling manages to balance all the over-the-top comedy with something a bit more grounded. While he shows a lot of signs of idiocy, he also shows some intelligence that helps us believe his role as a father and detective. Unfortunately I can't level the same praise on Russell Crowe who I can't decide whether he phoned it in for the paycheck, or tried too hard. When it comes to comedy, Crowe is Gosling's opposite; almost entirely unfunny, even when his lines do a lot of the legwork for him. He's not a complete failure, but he looks awkward and uncomfortable more times than he doesn't. Margaret Qualley as the missing girl is also a bit of a swing and a miss. Her hysteric lunacy comes off more as a hormonal teenager shouting things she doesn't really mean, than a girl who believes fully in her claims and is determined for the world to know what she does. Thankfully there's Keith David, Matt Bomer, and Beau Knapp who more than make up for her in the supporting side of things.I never really laugh out loud when I'm by myself, especially in the cinema, but The Nice Guys had me chuckling heartily with alarming frequency. It's not a perfect movie, not even a perfect comedy, but it's right up there amongst the best comedies, for certain. I found it hilarious, and that's all that really mattered. I give it a solid 8/10 and would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Movie,"The Nice Guys is written and directed by Shane Black and stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as two detectives who try to solve a case regarding a missing girl and the death of a porn actress in Los Angeles during the 70s.I'm a big Shane Black fan ever since my childhood, with Lethal Weapon being one of my all-time favorites. After that I followed his career, and I have to say, he is a really great writer/director. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is another great movie which he wrote and directed which some might argue it brought Robert Downey Jr. back in the center of the attention, and before the whole Marvel business started. Black is great at writing buddy comedies with crime and mystery touches and The Nice Guys is one of his best works to date.First of all, the two main actors, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, have an amazing on-screen chemistry. Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a by-the-book though guy enforcer type who you call when want to have someone taken care of. Crowe is now over 50 in real life, his age is starting to show, but he embraces that completely in this film. He is a little overweight and some of the action scenes he pulls might not look that believable, but he is absolutely perfect in this role. Ryan Gosling took a break from the more silent type roles (Drive, Place Beyond the Bines) which were becoming a bit too much for me and instead takes a comedic turn in this movie. He has some of the funniest lines, he gets in the craziest situations and yet there's also a dark side to him, having some drinking problems and at the same time trying to raise his daughter (Angouire Rice), who is wise beyond her years.The story itself is not the most original and unique, it doesn't really break new ground and you can solve the mystery on your own while watching the movie. As soon as one character was introduced, I immediately put the clues together. But that's okay, it doesn't really need to do all those things. We were not promised some original concept or never before seen plot, we were promised an action comedy that offers two great characters and a very clever script.What I truly love about this movie is how simple it actually is. It's not part of a huge franchise, it's not a CGI fest, there are no superheroes, there are no flying cars, we just follow two guys trying to solve a mystery. It really goes back to the 80-90s era, when we had some great action-comedies like the Lethal Weapon franchise or Beverly Hills Cop. It's a nice breath of fresh air with some clever dialogue, noir elements, good action and two perfect stars in the main roles. The Nice Guys is a nice surprise and it deserves a 9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Daughter Ruins It...,"This movie has a few big problems that bring it down in my opinion.My biggest problem was unnecessarily making the little girl a main character in this somewhat gritty rated r film as if this is a family Disney movie, she was just so misplaced. The time spent on her could've been used to develop the lead characters relationship more.The second biggest problem was the lazy and flat comedy, they definitely needed better writers. The comedy often didn't fit in this movie at all which gives the film an overall confusing tone. Also, Ryan Gosling doesn't do bad but this type of role is way more up Ryan Reynolds alley and casting him instead would've likely enhanced the movie.The third and final problem that stopped this movie from being what it could've been is the confusing plot. I wasn't quite sure how certain things came together or what anyone's motivation was in many parts of the movie.Overall, this movie wasn't terrible but it's nothing special at all. My guess is that Warner bros. is to blame for most of these issues.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not so nice,"But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good.

The Nice Guys: potential not reached,"The Nice Guys glimmers towards moments of excellence, especially towards the beginning, but ultimately as the credits rolled I felt disappointed.The first 25 minutes of the film, focused on introducing the 2 main characters, played by Ryan Gosling and a fairly wooden Russell Crowe, is hilarious. The characters are refreshingly satirical and interestingly presented, but as the film progresses the formula for each character becomes tiring: Ryan Gosling is unreliable, often drunk and a bit dainty, Russel Crowe is violent, sinister but has a much more soft and noble side. Every joke in the film is just based around these attributes. By the 1 hour mark I was getting sick of the same sort of material being reused and by the final act of the film I was considering just turning it off.The narrative of the film is slightly confusing and hard to follow. It's basically Crowe and Gosling trying to find a missing girl and piece together the 'so called' suicide of a famous Pornstar, but because I kind of got lost towards the beginning about who was who and what was happening I found it hard to be engaged in the story. Just for the record I understand and can follow most films I watch, I genuinely think this film was abnormally difficult to follow. I also think the flow of the movie is poor, like I mentioned the first 25 minutes is brilliantly paced, with violence and humour, and then it sort of slows and jokes become less regular and less funny and the story sort of gets a bit stagnant and then they try to pick it up at the end with a big shoot out but even that was a bit hit and miss. I almost think the writer sort of ran out of ideas after the first act of the film but thought the first part was so good he might as well finish off the story.Ryan Gosling also has questionable moments in the film: his character often overreacts in feminine ways, screaming in a high pitched voice when something surprising happens and I didn't find it funny, but he kept on doing it. It's just poor acting and really desperate writing, trying to force a laugh from a hyperbolised reaction. Another example of this is at the start of the film when Ryan Gosling's character is caught pants down in a cubicle, he slams the door which swings back round so he stands and his cigarette drops to his lap so recoils in horror and tries to close the door again but it swings back open. The first second of this was funny, but it goes on for 10 more seconds and becomes really slapstick, which just ruins the humour of the original joke. Ryan Gosling's character also has a daughter who manages to worm her way into the film and I felt like her character really wasn't needed, she sort of gets annoying and though she has a funny moment here or there, I felt like her tagging along on all the missions kind of weighs the two main characters down.Overall, watch the first 30 minutes and turn it off, you'll only be wasting an hour of your life if you carry on watching. It's not consistently funny enough to be a god comedy, or intense enough to be a good action film, it sort of floats in the limbo of titles I will forget and probably never re-watch.Rik",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun","'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers.

8/10,"Shane Black doing what he excels at the most and doing it at the very best: ""The Nice Guys"" is funny, smart, action packed, violent, irreverent, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time without ever having tonal shift problems, it molds so many elements into one cohesive package that will give you a blast at the cinema and won't alienate you even with the sudden appearance of a giant talking bug in a car.What has to be addressed immediately is the fact that if there was ever a prize for best on-screen chemistry for 2016 the race is already over, Crowe and Gosling light up the frame with an overwhelming energy, this is something we haven't seen in quite some time. Their job might be overlooked and discounted by some, but this is nothing short of genius, the way in which these two actors bring to life this story is illuminating, their timing, their banter, their personal dynamic, it is all in the brilliant script, but what the two of them do is elevate it to levels that I think not even Shane Black could have ever imagined. I mean they just had to look at each other for me to curl up laughing stupid. They don't have a false beat. And when you try to look back and think of who was better as soon as you point to one, you feel like you've made the wrong choice. Crowe's stoicism is played to perfection and when he boils up it pays off incredibly. Then there's Gosling who is recently on a roll; he was a highlight of ""The Big Short"" and showed comedic chops I didn't know he had, then comes this film and if there was ever any doubt of his comedic timing believe me is dead. The way he moves is enough to make you marvel and laugh at what he's doing, he has multiple moments of physical comedy that had me rolling on the floor, not to mention his witty, smart-ass dialogue that he nails.And we aren't even halfway done with the cast yet, everybody in this film not only is cast perfectly, but kills it. Kim Basinger's casting as a callback to ""L.A. Confidential"" is a great choice, but then getting into the more important characters: Matt Bomer is terrifying as the cold blooded killer and it is so important to be so if you want to give the audience catharsis when the final showdown happens. It is great to see Keith David again on screen in this kind of supporting character role that he always, unequivocally shines in, he is truly one of the bests in my opinion, there isn't wrong he can do. Finally Angourie Rice is a revelation, she steels the movie from Crowe and Gosling so well it feels like this movie is about the three of them together.Now, all of these actors get the chance to do such amazingly inspired work thanks to Shane Black. His screenplay presents us to a group of characters that are brilliantly well written and developed and tied into a plot that is absorbing and crazy. I don't know if this film is better written or directed because the two crafts combine seamlessly in this picture. There are so many moving elements and Black keeps up with all of them without ever leaving the audience behind or making them loose interest. moreover the way the setting is used is breathtaking and I mean that literally. He makes these characters move through Los Angeles and between a million easter eggs that I'm sure I missed half of, the locations give the film a whole other level of fascination, it has one of the best party scenes in recent memory. The greatness lies in the fact that story and setting feed each other and couldn't be taken apart, bringing to life a visual feast for the eyes that is grounded in story and character.And there's still much to talk about: soundtrack, action and fight scenes, pace, cinematography, sound, all of these elements deserve a paragraph on their own. The excellence of filmaking in display here is in my opinion really remarkable. Does it have faults? Or course: it can occasionally digress into 70s visual extravaganza just for the sake of it, the plot is thrilling and all, yet come to really think of it, unfortunately, it comes apart slightly too easily, but these are all details that have to be addressed, yet they did not take away from the overall experience which is one of the funniest and most thrilling rides of the year that I cannot wait to check out again in the theater with a bunch of friend.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

More action and drama than comedy,"Shane Black's new film THE NICE GUYS is being billed as an ""ACTION/COMEDY"" and I think this is a mistake. When I think ""ACTION/COMEDY"" I think more of things like the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg film THE OTHER GUYS or the upcoming Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart flick CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE. Basically, a comedy with action in it. THE NICE GUYS is a atmospheric period piece that blends drama, action and comedy. It is much more nuanced than the average ""action/comedy"" and, for the most part, succeeds in this nuance.Set in 1977, THE NICE GUYS pairs Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as they investigate a disappearance in Los Angeles. The more they dig into the case, the more the bodies pile up and the deeper the conspiracy goes.The key to a film like this is the chemistry between the two leads and I am happy to report that Gosling and Crowe have pretty good chemistry with each other. While I thought Gosling was trying a bit too hard in the comedy areas (he managed the balance of comedy and drama better in THE BIG SHORT), the surprise to me was how easy the comedy parts seemed to come to Crowe while the dramatic parts showed off that he still has strong acting ""chops"".Ultimately, where this film falls short for me is in the direction by Shane Black (the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and the overrated Iron Man 3). He has the ""70's vibe down, no doubt about it. Where this film falters is it's continual shift of tone. Is it a comedy? Is it a serious action film? Is it a farce? Is it a drama? All of these elements are thrown onto the screen so it takes about 2/3 of the film to settle into what type of film it is - which I would call a dramatic action film with comedic overtones. And, by the way, there are 2 comedic moments in this movie that created huge, sincere belly laughs from me - I would argue that both of those moments are worth the price of admission alone.Go for those moments, but stay for the friendship of Gosling and Crowe. You'll be entertained.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Although, I would not have bet on them being a good duo, they actually deliver really well. The whole story, full of weirdness evolves around the supposed killing of a porn actress that a young kid witnesses from the commodity of his own home. The two protagonists go from being enemies to having to help each other to solve this weirdest criminal story. Serious, often humorous, ""The Nice Guys"" make up for a good watch but might not be everyone's favorite. I don't consider this to be a movie for every palate.

Unique filmmaking compounded by strong leads,"Crowe and Gosling positively captivated me with their dynamic throughout the entire film. There never seemed to be a dull moment thanks to director Shane Black's ability to catch the audience off-guard at any second with a unique and/or bizarre bit. The villain and their motives are a bit hazy and some action scenes go a bit too long near the end, but these small negatives pale in comparison to the positives the film brings to the table. It is hard to put into words exactly why The Nice Guys is so good, but I assure you if you watch the first 15 minutes you will find out.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The lethal two,"Shane Black as a young man wrote the screenplay to the hard boiled buddy cop action film, Lethal Weapon.Black has since messed about with the formula making hard boiled mismatched buddy cop comedy action films laced with sleaze.This is a retro comedy drama set in Los Angeles of 1977. A young washed up private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to find Amelia by her aunt. Amelia has got muscle for hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop him which he does by breaking Holland's wrist.When two hoods break into Healy's place, he hires March to find what is going on. Accompanied by March's bright and ethically centred daughter, they stumble on a conspiracy that involves the Justice department, the auto industry, the death of a porn actress and reel of a porn movie that exposes a scandal.The Nice Guy's comes across as an unpretentious fun film. There are nods to Black's previous films, it can be crude in places, the story can be a bit vague but it did make me laugh a lot. Although set in 1977 it is rather anachronistic in places.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An excellent homage to 70's violent cinema that was surprisingly not directed by Quentin Tarantino.,"It's set in the 1970's, and it feels like it was made in the 70's, and at the same time satirizes the 70's. Director Shane Black really brings the action comedy and crime thriller qualities and puts them together perfectly.Two private investigators(Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling) who are both mismatched, become unlikely partners to solve the sudden death of a porn star, and to find a young woman who may be connected, but quickly discover there is more than meets the eye.It's easy to imagine that Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe where having a blast making this. The two play off each other perfectly during the 70's setting. Angourie Rice(who looks like a young Reese Witherspoon) steals the show as Goslings daughter, she really becomes the heart of the movie, I hope to see more from her in the future.

Solid Buddy action/comedy,"Shane Black, the father of Buddy cop movies, returns to write and direct this 1970's action/comedy about private eyes investigating a missing girl who is a person of interest connected to an apparent suicide of a female porn star.It has everything you would come to expect from the writer of Lethal Weapon, The last boy scout and kiss kiss bang bang: Chemistry between the two leads, dialogue of them bickering, a small case that leads to something much bigger and a insane amount of action make our heroes seem invincible (a trope that is actually acknowledged by one of the leads.)Ryan Gosling, playing against his usual suave bad-ass type, is hilarious as a bumbling, drunk goofball and Russell Crowe does what he does best, punch the crap out of bad guys.I recommend not watching the trailer as it gives away some of the film's biggest laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Gosling and Crowe shine in this energetic dark comedy,"After gifting us the original team up of Riggs and Murtaugh in 1987's Lethal Weapon (as screenwriter) and combining the services of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer in the fantastic 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (as writer and director), Iron Man 3 director Shane Black has now added the successful team up of one time pin up boy Ryan Gosling and the increasingly gruff Russell Crowe to his resume in the fun, colourful and Coen Brothers like The Nice Guys.A 70's set dark comedy with inklings of a pulp like detective tale that involves everything from pornographic actresses, blue faced goons, talking bees and Ryan Gosling on a toilet, The Nice Guys weaves a quite complicated tale of mysteries, murders and questionable investigating work into a film that at its core often fly's and sometimes fails off the back of Shane Black's witty scripting work, the fantastic use of the 70's landscape and most importantly, the winning combination of the inventive pairing of Crowe and Gosling.Clearly relishing the opportunity to play each other's foils, Gosling and Crowe are the best they've been in years here and while Gosling has shown his comedic chops in films like The Big Short and Crazy, Stupid, Love, Black un-tap's a fun side to Crowe we haven't really seen before even though some could claim ventures like The Good Year and Mystery, Alaska tried to show off a lighter side to the phone throwing adopted Australian. The Nice Guys is Crowe's best work in sometime and it's likely his future roles will try to harness his lighter persona that works so well here, even though Gosling steals most of the films best singular moments.Speaking of stealing, young Australian actress Angourie Rice who was first seen in the worth checking out These Final Hours makes a huge impact to The Nice Guys fortunes with a fantastically judged turn as the wise beyond her years daughter of Gosling's often bumbling Holland March, Holly, and considering it's no mean feat to outplay two Hollywood heavyweights, Rice could well be ""the next big thing"".A sharp, fun and engaging mixture of comedy and mystery with a healthy dosage of violence, The Nice Guys isn't ground-breaking stuff and some of the potential jokes within the film sadly fall flat but as whole this energetic and colourful vehicle driven by Black's wit, Gosling and Crowe's fine pairing and Rice's star making turn, this is easily one of the year's easiest to like cinematic diversions.3 ½ swimming Nixon's out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great sleazy atmosphere, great writing too","""The Nice Guys"" has some trouble finding its footing in the earlier scenes, but it becomes incredibly entertaining once it goes completely off the rails. When your story is about two shady characters trying to solve the murder of a porn star in the 1970s, I want everything in the movie to be ugly and slightly disturbing. Shane Black (of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame) has certainly managed that, particularly the current Russell Crowe is just perfect for a role like this. The plot is also slightly more interesting and unpredictable than in an average action movie, this movie has enough unexpected deaths to make you genuinely worry about the protagonists. Particularly for Angourie Rice, who just steals every scene she's in. The thing I loved most though is the incredibly dark comedy Black puts in throughout. It's not forced, it's not shocking for the sake of being shocking, it's just there because it's funny and it fits the rest of the movie so well. ""The Nice Guys"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, infinitely rewatchable.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"We don't get many detective stories like this. A nice, funny and well written movie.","""The Nice Guys"" is a well written movie. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe really did an amazing characterization, two detectives with two completely different approaches that match perfectly. The movie is set during the 70s and the director just nailed the mood: music, editing and color grading are just on point, not to talk about locations, clothes and cars. It is a really simple movie, nothing groundbreaking. I mean, the plot twist is nothing surprising, but its simple script just work and this production manages to entertain for two hours. There is a nice balance between research/investigation scenes, and action-packed sequences, that are very smooth, maybe sometimes a little bit exaggerated, but this was made to match the comedic vibe. In fact I laughed a lot through the film, I think that there are many hilarious and well conceived moments, comedic times are nicely done.Overall, it is a nice production.

Very NICE,"Ryan Gosling in a physical action-comedy? Whoever thought of the idea should be crowned genius of the year. With dynamite timing and uproarious gestures, Gosling mines his diverse abilities and becomes a blast in The Nice Guys, directed by Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang scribe Shane Black. Cowritten by Black and Anthony Bagarozzi, this nonstop-hilarious buddy-cop film is both a committed rekindling of the old formula Black aced throughout his career and a playful wink to the genre, bouncily walking on the fine line with occasional backflips.Not that Gosling's character, Holland March, a clumsy, drunken private eye living in 1977 Los Angeles, is exactly a cop, per se. (He's often hired by confused old ladies looking for their dead family members.) And neither is his eventual partner, the ultra-serious tough guy Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe, beefed up and effective), who rakes in hard cash by beating up his clients' enemies.Between a gorgeously grandiose finale, memorable parts for Yaya DaCosta and Kim Basinger and a juicy soundtrack that includes Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool & the Gang, The Nice Guys is the perfect, incredibly crafted yet laid-back procedural we've been starved for. Even when it sometimes seems that the endless jokes are being thrown against a wall to see what sticks, The Nice Guys, on the whole, summons that victorious, innocent feeling of seeing likable heroes win while having fun along the way. It's nice, guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Waltons, Poronography, Tricky Dicky, Hitler, Equanimity, Bumble Bees ... And Stuff!","The Nice Guys is directed by Shane Black and Black co-writes the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi. It stars Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling and Angourie Rice. Music is by John Ottman and David Buckley and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.1977 Los Angeles and a private detective and a muscle for hire enforcer wind up on the same case looking for a missing girl. Can opposites really attract? More importantly, can they survive not just the perils of a case that gets murkier the longer it goes on? But also each other?I don't care if Colonel Mustard did it in the study with a candlestick. I just wanna know who he did it with and get the pictures.How wonderful to have had Shane Black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. It was eleven years since the superb Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had reminded us that Black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. The idea for The Nice Guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.Much like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. Gosling's ex-cop Holland March is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. Crowe's muscle for hire Jackson Healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. What binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus Black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the L.A. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.As a coupling March and Healy prove to be a riot. Crowe is menacing and funny with it, Gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see Gosling's Lou Costello homage and Crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). Crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a Shane Black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. Then there is Rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as March's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.The L.A. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. Then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for Black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. As a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno Pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). And of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.Black kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the Americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. It's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to Lethal Weapon and here with The Nice Guys. But itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish Black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. Don't believe me? Then may Richard Nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stylish but scattershot,"This film boasts some impressive elements but falls short in key areas that detract from its overall effectiveness. The film's performances are undoubtedly a highlight; both Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling deliver charismatic portrayals, and their chemistry is genuinely enjoyable. They bring a comedic flair and a sense of fun that makes their dynamic engaging, providing some much-needed levity amidst the chaos.The cinematography and production design are also worth noting. The film captures the 1970s Los Angeles setting with a stylish and authentic feel. The attention to detail in the sets and costumes helps immerse me in the period, and the visual flair adds a certain charm to the movie.However, these positives are overshadowed by several notable flaws for me. The plot often feels meandering and disjointed, making it difficult to follow and engage with. There are numerous twists and turns, but they tend to be more confusing than intriguing. The film struggles with setting up conflicts in a way that feels coherent, which undermines the suspense and stakes.Additionally, the film's cynicism can be a bit off-putting. While it aims for a noir-inspired tone, the relentless focus on dark humor and satire sometimes feels heavy-handed, overshadowing the more nuanced aspects of the story. The film's attempt at being both a comedy and a thriller results in a tone that feels inconsistent, which can be jarring.On the whole, The Nice Guys is a film that shines with its performances and visual style but falters with its disjointed plot and overbearing cynicism. While the stylish execution and charismatic leads offer some entertainment value, the film's lack of coherent conflict and confusing narrative detract from its overall impact. If you appreciate a period piece with flair, it might be worth a watch, but don't expect a tightly woven story.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Did they pay you guys to give this high ratings?,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, especially for the great duo, Crowe and Gosling that have never disappointed but man....

"""The Nice Guys"" is more than just a ""nice"" way to spend a couple hours.","I'm really excited about this one! Sometimes I'm concerned that the movies I reference in my reviews may be too old or too obscure to really help the reader understand the point I'm making, but never before have I come across a group of movies that represent the movie I'm reviewing so remarkably well, or that are so surprisingly well connected to each other! Let's look back at the fall of 1997. Just three weeks apart, two great movies came out which would both go on to receive multiple Oscar nominations and were both set in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 20th century. ""Boogie Nights"" dramatized the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley from 1977 to 1984, as shown in the rise and fall (pun intended) of young porn actor Eddie Adams, a.k.a. ""Dirk Diggler"" (played by a rising star named Mark Wahlberg). This movie is notable for its excellent screenplay, terrific acting from a fantastic cast (which included Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and then relative unknowns like Luis Guzmán, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Don Cheadle) – and for the film's realistic portrayal of late 70s' and early 80s' L.A. ""L.A. Confidential"" had come out three weeks earlier and painted an equally vivid and nuanced picture of the City of Angels in 1953, complete with government corruption which involved a character played by Kim Basinger. Fast forward to 2014. The Oscar-nominated ""Inherent Vice"" tells the story of a private eye (Joaquin Phoenix) who is investigating a case involving multiple missing persons in 1970 L.A. That movie was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who had also written and directed ""Boogie Nights"". The darkly comedic 2016 film ""The Nice Guys"" (R, 1:56) has a private eye looking for multiple missing persons, while uncovering connections to the porn industry AND government corruption in 1970s Los Angeles AND a character played by Kim Basinger is an important part of the plot. Boom! So, are those some really cool connections, or is it just me? Oh. Just me. Alrighty then. I'll just review the movie The title characters in ""The Nice Guys"" are kind of nice, relatively speaking when you understand that they do some not-so-nice jobs. Jackson Healy (Oscar winner Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire. He beats people up (or worse) for money, but he's relatively polite when he does it and he feels kind of bad about it. (Well, he feels that he's cut out for more than, say, roughing up a guy whose messing around with a client's teenage daughter, and he wishes that he were doing something different.) Holland March (past Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling) is a private eye who seems to make most of his money half-heartedly investigating far-fetched missing persons claims by little old ladies. He's very polite in dealing with his clients and he's sorta smart, but he's not as tough or skilled as he acts, and he has a real problem with pain and with the sight of blood – especially his own. Regardless, Holland makes a good living and takes good care (financially, if not emotionally) of his teenage daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). Holly is smarter, tougher... and nicer than Holland, whom she reluctantly ""parents"" better than he parents her.Holland is simultaneously investigating an alleged sighting of a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) – two days after she was supposedly killed in a car accident – while also looking for an even younger woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who is a protest organizer, who may have appeared in ""an experimental film"" with Misty Mountains, and who definitely does NOT want to be found. Jackson, on the other hand, has been hired by Amelia to get this PI named Holland March off her trail. This situation leads to an inauspicious first meeting between Jackson and Holland, followed by an auspicious second meeting when they decide to join forces and use their respective talents to find out what's actually going on. You see, Holland has recently received an unwelcomed visit from a couple of thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who demand to know where Amelia is, and then people who are connected to Amelia and/or Missy start dropping dead at an unnatural rate. Our titular ""nice guys"" eventually meet a Justice Department employee (Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner for ""L.A. Confidential"") who hires the pair to find Amelia, just as they discover that a Mafioso (Matt Bomer) from New York is in L.A. looking for them – and he ain't interested in talking. With Holly forcing her way into the equation to help her dad and his new partner, it's a race against time to find Amelia and figure out who's killing her acquaintances (and why) before those really not-so-nice guys catch up with the two relatively nice guys.""The Nice Guys"" is a quirky, darkly comedic and intriguing whodunit. The script, by Shane Black (who also wrote ""Iron Man 3"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", ""The Last Boy Scout"" and the original ""Lethal Weapon"") and newcomer Anthony Bagarozzi, is intricate, but not hard to follow, and contains smart and very funny dialog and situations (including great tie-ins to TV's ""The Waltons"" and President Richard Nixon), plus a mystery that's engaging but suffers from an awkward final resolution which feels forced. Besides co-writing, Black (who also directed ""Iron Man 3"") directs this film with a good feel for pace, tension and comic timing, while his very talented cast (especially Gosling, Crowe and Rice) really brings it all together. While similar in content to those other three films mentioned earlier, this one is closest in tone and style to ""Inherent Vice"", but is more accessible and less flawed. ""The Nice Guys"" is more than just a ""nice"" way to spend a couple hours – it's a pretty damn entertaining one. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Solidly engaging and entertaining, but never as funny or thrilling as it appears to be","Somewhat of a throwback of a film, which is perhaps to be expected from Shane Black. The odd-chemistry of the mis-matched buddies are what drives this film, while the noir-esque plotting and style helps it too. The film has a reasonably engaging story-line, good casting, good laughs, some good action, and plenty of specific moments that make it enjoyable. And it was enjoyable, however this is different from saying it is a great film – because it isn't.In the moments or specific aspects, it does work, but as a whole it seems disjointed and unsure of what it is trying to be. Instead of it feeling like one common film as it flows through moments of varying tone and content, it feels like a series of moments of different tone which have been pieced together to become a whole. In some ways it is dramatic with a wry comedy, in others it is pure slapstick, and then again in others it asks us to take the plot seriously. Mostly it works in this, but it never totally convinces either.A lot of credit for it working should go to the casting and performances from Crowe and Gosling. They work very well in their characters; in particular Gosling manages to make his daughter work as a relationship (as poorly judged as she is as a character), and even makes things like a Lou Costello / Lethal Weapon-style moment work. The supporting cast features plenty of familiar faces – some work well, but some others only serve to remind of better films (Basinger and Crowe together nods to LA Confidential – which is too good a film to be put in the viewer's mind when watching this).It is all solidly entertaining stuff, but it never wholly comes together in a way that makes it stick in the mind as a great film that I'd love to see more of.",,Anonymous,Crime

Much of the movie is pretty entertaining though because I was a child of the decade in question and I know what music came out certain years especially the 1977 timeline here, it took me a little out of the picture when I heard something like Rupert Holmes' ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)""-which came out two years after that year-playing in the background. Still, The Nice Guys is worth a look for anyone interested in the era. Oh, and how cool to once again see the Saul Bass Warner Bros. logo beginning this one...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

There HAS To Be A Sequel,".and not only that, but if they're smart, they'd be filming it already. Plenty of violence, lots of laughter and excellent chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. I'll tell you, I'm not really a Russell Crowe fan, but he was perfect for this role. I heard people, as they were leaving, saying things about hoping there'd be another one with The Nice Guys before too long. Personally I think there is going to be a market for a series of them. It was that good. The daughter, Holly, played by Angourie Rice, was a tad on the precocious side but in the grand scheme of things, it worked rather well. This is reminiscent of good detective films from the past with a modern slant and these tough detectives, with their history and issues are sheer entertainment. Crowe showing a vicious side as well as a tender side is the epitome of the tough cop-type and Gosling, trying to be father, find another drink and still earn money detecting is a hoot. Bring on another one. And soon!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A very Shane Black comedy,"Ryan Gosling plays the ""world's worst detective"" Holland March, and Russell Crowe is Jackson Healey, a mercenary tough guy who's paid to punch paedophiles.This 1977-set LA story starts with a slightly misjudged visual joke portraying the death of adult movie star named Misty Mountains. When Misty's aunt claims to have seen her niece alive, March is hired to find her. Separately, Healey is hired to stop him by force. A series of convoluted events conspire to bring the mismatched duo together, and off they go on a search for a missing girl named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). There are a ton of bad guys standing in the way of their goal, who happens to be the daughter of a sinister VIP from the Department of Justice (Kim Basinger). It's fair to say that March's and Healey's chaotic quest is propelled as much by luck as skill.Being written and directed by Shane Black, comparisons to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon are inevitable. It's not quite up to the same standard as those scripts – perhaps future instalments might shed light on Healey's backstory and his neurotic need to be ""useful"", or delve more into the broken home life of March – but there is undeniable pleasure in seeing Black do his thing: banter, pathos, idiocy, lunacy, and old school shootouts. It's probably on a par with The Last Boy Scout, which will do nicely.Gosling and Crowe are cast subtly against type, playing around with (and against) their ice cool and wounded warrior personas respectively. It's especially effective with Gosling, whose tendency toward stolidity works well in the more deadpan moments. Angourie Rice, playing March's precocious daughter Holly, almost steals the show from the stars. It's a great performance and a great character: she binds these two emotionally stunted men in the way that Murtaugh's family once brought Riggs back from the brink.The trailers for The Nice Guys have been subtly misleading, presenting the film as a pure knockabout action comedy. Yet Black's skill has always been his ability to combine humour and sincerity. It's refreshing to watch an adult comedy with an intricate (if ridiculous) plot and actual scripted jokes; and one where we're not waiting for the next filmmaker-buddy cameo.The movie has more in common with the slacker detective pictures of the decade in which it's set – it is faintly reminiscent of Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye in its depiction of nihilism and questionable competence. Another touchstone would be Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, although this is the far less detached and humorous film. Similarly, the period is lovingly reincarnated, in part because it doesn't simply revel in the coolness of the time – here's a movie that's happy to eschew the disco and observe the rubbish brownness of late-70s social decline.The Nice Guys is a welcome return of one of cinema's most reliable and intelligent mainstream filmmakers. Shane Black is a master of toying with genre (he was responsible for Iron Man 3's bonkers twist); and although the buddy genre may be a familiar one, it remains the perfect vehicle for his talents.Arguably the worst impulse of the modern action movie is excess, and the curse of the modern American comedy is irony. The Nice Guys offers mercifully little of either, which makes it feel both old and new.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"More than ""Nice""","""The Nice Guys"" is a very amusing detective story set in the stylish 1970ies with a mischievous detective duo, who has more luck than brains, and a touch of porn and violence.Ryan Gosling, who played the personification of coolness in ""Drive"", now shows his humorous side by playing the over-the-hill private investigator Holland March, a single father who doesn't mind looking for people who he knows are already dead just for the sake of earning some money, a laxity that more than once has brought trouble upon him and one of those situations also makes him cross paths with Russell Crowe's character Jackson Healy, a rather moody, professional thug who likes letting his fists speak for himself and who else would be more suitable for the role than the notoriously choleric Russell Crowe?So together they form a duo as a new case forces them to cooperate and from that moment on they literally stumble upon one trace leading to another and evermore get themselves entangled in the snares of a big political conspiracy which of course surpasses their skills by far and the way in which they nevertheless manage to gain the upper hand gives cause for very comedic moments and memorable lines. The story may be confusing at first but in the end everything adds up convincingly, only the conventional finale is a letdown so to speak.What, to me, makes the movie stand out is the fact that the duo is actually a trio if you count March's daughter, the very smart, cheeky Holly, superbly played by A. Rice, she plays a very active part in the movie and often demonstrates a higher level of maturity than those two guys together.I'm very optimistic that this won't be the last case of ""The Nice Guys"" we'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nobody is too old for this s***,"The Nice Guys is genius. It's Lethal Weapon meets The Big Lebowski. In ten years time, this film will be just as quotable as those films.

The mystery really takes you for a ride. The jokes all land solidly. By far it's biggest strength is the work put into it as a period piece. It looks amazing. Not even American Hustle replicated the 70's as seamlessly as this. Every last detail and fabric is perfect.

More than nice!!!!!!,"Niiiiice job Shane Black for directing and co-scripting with inventive flair the very groovy and immensely entertaining ""The Nice Guys"". The movie is set in the 70's and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as (respectively) hit- for-hire man Jackson Healy and clumsy P.I. Holland March. Circumstances that are uproarious in happenstance lead them to team up to find a missing teen named Amelia, who just might be the key to revealing more not-too-nice foul play situations. Kim Basinger co-stars as Amelia's mother who hires The Nice Guys to find Amelia before she gets lost in the clouds (with all due apologies to the late, great Amelia Earheart for that pun). ""The Nice Guys"" will be like no other movie you will see this year; its distinctive quality and magnetic unpredictability are two major reasons this movie is a very nice gem. But of course, other nice gems come in the form of Crowe and Gosling for their super nice performances; Sure the real Crowe has had his real life moments of not being too nice, but who cares, he was very nice here as Healy. And give that Gosling fellow an Oscar nomination for his uproarious performance as March, it's the Ides of March!! Hey, wasn't he in that movie?

Bring on Sequels,"I don't know how much broad appeal a period piece that's structured around an adult film industry crime has, but you'll have a hard time not getting behind the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as the title characters. The Nice Guys is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining films from beginning to end in 2016 with a refreshing take on the buddy-cop genre.Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a tough, uncompromising, and rugged private eye of sorts who is looking for the same young woman who Gosling is as well. Gosling plays against type as Holland March who is everything Healy is not as he pretty much weeps at the sight of blood. The two play wonderfully off each other in what is hopefully just the first time we see them on screen together. It appears as if some of the gags between the two of them is improvised, but Shane Black's script and direction deserves a ton of credit.If it does well enough at the box office, I have to believe the audience would be open to sequels. Black not only establishes the bond between Healy and March, but he also sets up the characters individually just as well. The subtle hints at who they were before this movie added the needed depth for the story and motivations from both sides.With that said, the heavy inclusion of March's daughter, Holly, doesn't work as well as I think Shane Black hoped. I didn't have any problems with Angourie Rice's performance, but her presence sometimes overshadows the brilliant dynamic established with Healy and March. Seeing a 13-year-old girl parade around adult film parties filled with gunfire can be quite amusing at times, but it's more uncomfortable than anything else.It's worth mentioning that Kim Basinger re-teams with her L.A. Confidential co-star, Crowe, so that was neat. In all, I really love the world Shane Black created with The Nice Guys. There's something to be said for a period piece that poses a smart and entertaining time at the movies all while amping up my excitement for sequels.+Chemistry between Crowe and Gosling+Intricate and funny script+Sets itself up for installments in the future-Focus shifts to the daughter a few too many times9.1/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A fast-paced, intelligent and laugh-out-loud comedy thriller","Long before the term 'bromance' was coined, 80's and 90's action cinema was treating audiences to buddy movies, stories centred around a crime that would pull two opposite side of the spectrum together, causing them to disagree and bicker before finally learning that team-work is key. While desperate TV stations are attempting to re-boot various famous titles from this era with usually awful results, writer/director Shane Black is still around to remind us what made these movies so great to begin with. After all, he was behind some of the best of them - Lethal Weapon (1987) and The Last Boy Scout (1991) - and he's proving there's still plenty of life in the genre yet with The Nice Guys, one of the funniest films so far this year.Naturally, a convoluted plot brings together the two heroes of the 70s-set story. One is a grizzled fists-for-hire, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), who pays his bills by warning grown men who should know better to stay away from underage girls, traditionally with a knuckle- duster to the face. The other is Holland March (Ryan Gosling), a terrible private investigator who takes jobs from dementia-ridden old ladies who pay him to find the missing husband often resting behind them in an urn above the fireplace. His precocious daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) may also be a lot brighter than him. Despite their flaws, Healy and March are 'nice guys', and when their paths cross searching for a missing porn star, they decide to get to the bottom of a strange sequence of events because it's simply the right thing to do.There's a conspiracy-laden plot to keep things ticking along, and Black has fun trying to unravel it along with our heroes. The film begins with a young boy finding his father's porn stash and sneaking a peak at centrefold Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), before a car crashes off the road and into his backyard. Lo and behold, the driver is Misty, and the kid covers up her naked body as she dies. March is put on the case by the actress's aunt, and is soon on the tail of young runaway Amelia Kuttner (The Leftovers' Margaret Qualley), who is somehow caught up in all this mess. Only Amelia doesn't want to be found, so she pays Healy to get March off her back. Of course, the deliberately implausible story that brings our two heroes together - and what comes after - is simply an excuse for Crowe and Gosling to exercise their sparkling chemistry.I've never seen Russell Crowe appear to be having so much fun as he does here, and he shows off some impressive comedy chops as the lovable lug who will always put himself in harms way to protect the vulnerable. Even more surprising is Gosling, an actor who hasn't really capitalised on the promise of his iconic role in Drive (2011), but who embraces the goofy scumbag-ness of his inept but endearingly well-meaning single father, a man we first meet inadvertently slashing his own wrist open while trying to routinely break in through a window. Yet the biggest plaudits go to Shane Black himself who, after a blip with Iron Man 3 (2013), is back to his Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) best. He delivers a fast-paced, intelligent and laugh-out-loud comedy thriller, with one or two genuine shocks thrown in for good measure.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I didn't think Gosling and Crowe had enough chemistry to pull off a buddy-cop movie (if that's what they were going for).I found the plot to be interesting enough, but the execution was lacking. They seemed to have this ""who's a good person"" theme running through it. But they never really developed any of the characters. It was all over the place!

Starts as buddy movie then derails into a patchwork of clichés,"Crowe and Gosling play PIs with different personalities forced to work together. Not groundbreaking territory, but suitable for lighthearted entertainment. Unfortunately, what starts as a drama set in Los Angels in the late 70s, soon turns into a weird mix of Boogie Nights and Taxi Driver, minus the darkness of those two movies - but missing also their greatness.Gosling's young daughter gets mixed in the plot and proves to be way smarter than her father (not difficult) and very annoying. A sort of re-take of the Foster character in Taxi Driver, minus the prostitution. The group starts investigating the porn industry territory, but the plot meanders into other territories such as politics and pollution, without making much sense in any.Not a total disaster, but it tries too hard to be ""cool"" and it is not very funny, which is sort of the kiss of death for a comedy.

Hilarious! Lethal Weapon Meets Miami Vice Meets That's 70 Show,"I saw this trailer months ago and from the minute I first saw it I knew I was going to see this film. I knew I was going to love this film. I knew I was going to buy this film so I could watch it over and over again. I can count on one hand the number of times I felt that way just about a trailer. I'm writing this post to tell you that I was right. It was awesome!Now I did admit earlier that I see all Ryan Gosling films, but let me be clear, that is not the only reason I saw this film. I saw this film because I also enjoy Russell Crowe, love buddy cop films, thought the plot/script looked hilarious, and I mean just watch the trailer😀The Nice Guys is about muscle-man PI Jackson Healy (Crowe) who ends up working with a drunk P.I. Holland March (Gosling) to learn the truth behind the death of the famous porn star, Misty Mountains. The case is made more complicated by March's precocious daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) and the realization that the government is involved in a cover-up and it all comes down to finding a young girl, Amelia.It's Lethal Weapon meets The Man From UNCLE meets Miami VIce meets That 70's Show meets its own unique style.It is obvious that Crowe is the action and Gosling is the comedy, but that does not mean they switch roles every once in awhile. It is a screwball comedy about two guys that really don't know what they're doing, and yet, cannot seem to stop. They keep tripping over clues and colliding into bad guys until they finally figure it all out.Admittedly there are some slow parts, I was hoping it would be consistently funny (like The Man From UNCLE remake), but it lagged in places. However, in terms of the comedy and overall enjoyment of the film I'd still give it an A (just perhaps on the lower end of the scale).What makes this film so funny is that during the parts that didn't lag, it was non-stop/back-to- back/can't-catch-your-breath funny. It's all about the little things. Such as March's drunkenness falling down a hill and stumbling onto a dead body, or March chasing after a bad guy only to smack into a car door that pushes him into another car hood that makes him trip onto the bad guy. The police work is a gamble and the violence is more lucky shots.For example: March and Healy are held at gunpoint by a ""bad guy"" (I'm avoiding spoilers), so March's daughter comes in and pours the coffee pot onto the ""bad guy"". Nothing happens, because Holly thought it would be hot coffee, but it had been sitting there for a while. Next the ""bad guy"" goes to take a step toward March and Healy only to trip on the cold coffee spill around their feet and fall, knocking themselves out.Somehow everything works out in their favor. Even though it is completely ridiculous you can't help but love it, because the film makes no apologizes and gives fair warning that it is ridiculous. That's part of its charm.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
21st century film noir,"Shane black is one of the most interesting film makers working today, for good or for bad his work is always at the very least fun, I'll even admit to enjoying the predator in a mystery science theatre type of way.
Many film historians would have you believe that film noir is dead... they are lying to you. I will admit that for a genre that 70 years ago was one of the biggest they are few and far between these days. There was a small resurgence in the 90s with films like LA confidential and the big Labowski. In recent years they have been disguised at other genres e.g. sin city and dark city. But for the last ten years it has just been Shane black keeping this genre alive.
Maybe it is too early to say but I believe this to be one of my favourite films. It's funny and witty in all the right places. The action is fast paced and never disappoints. The 70s setting suits Russel Crowe down to a tie. In this he is a large brute of a man that apposes Ryan goslings scrawnier more quick thinking detective.",,Anonymous,Crime

Well, because initially I didn't have much hopes for it since it starred two actors which I am not particularly fan of.

Licensed private investigator Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) teams up with the unconventional private eye Jackson Healey (played by Russell Crowe) to solve the case of the suicide.The storyline in this movie is actually a nice surprise of a story, especially because it is a story which grows on you. The narrative of the movie is quite good and builds up gradually. And the storyline is helped nicely along by some very interesting characters with some equally interesting backgrounds.I will say that both Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe both really impressed with their performances in ""The Nice Guys"". Both of them are great individually in the movie, but together then the chemistry is just fantastic.""The Nice Guys"" is fast-paced and there isn't really a dull moment in the movie.

Surprisingly enjoyable,"This is the kind of movie I generally do not appreciate, but I was honestly surprised that I enjoyed it. Although it is a crime film, it is also tied nicely with a comedic atmosphere. The film is able to balance both the serious scenes with the funny ones, and it pays off.Gosling does a superb job with his character. While being both the smart one and the goofy one, his antics, behavior and lines are just so hilarious. Quite a few of his actions are *slap hand in face* worthy, and that's what makes it funny at times. Without a doubt, Gosling carries the film.At the beginning, I was not a big fan of Crowe's character. He play a tough guy who uses fists first, talk later. But after some time I grew to tolerate him. He does have some character development, mostly due to Holly, and I could go either way with that. We aren't given a lot into the other characters' background, but it works for this film.As mentioned, the subject matter of the film is one I do not generally enjoy. What with the swearing, prostitutes, pornography sounds, and the like. However, it is not explicit at all, save for one nude woman in the beginning (which was censored in my country), and the swearing. For a movie of this type, I would say it is one of the more tamed ones in terms of what they show.Set in the 70's, the mise-en-scene does a great job at bringing alive the era. As well, the story is engaging and fun. However, I am a little surprised that there isn't a romantic line in the film. Having said that, there is also not much of a female counterpart to the protagonists, in the sense that there is no presence of strong female characters. Amelia and Holly do portray that hardiness, and have quite a lot of screen time, however, the fact that they are young girls is a little concerning. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but if I had to say who the four main characters in the film are, it would be: March, Healy, Holly, and Amelia. Two middle-aged men, and two teenage girls. Think of that what you will.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is a terrible movie...,"As a massive Shane Black fan, this movie is crushing. And I defended ""The Last Boy Scout."" Warner Bros. seems to be getting his dreck as Marvel uses him as a gun for hire to fool Warner to believe he can direct. He can't. This movie is an absolute mess. I am certain Black can't possibly be proud of this movie. It's awful.Sure, thank you kindly for the repeat shots of porn star tits. Or, the debaucherous scumbag references of Los Angeles, but aside from all that, it just is too silly to even be interesting.The year is 1977, and we are deep into a plot about a thug-for-hire Russell Crowe and a sad-sack gumshoe (Ryan Gosling) with a daughter. There's some tragic story there about the mother's absence, but it is strangely played for laughs. As is Russell Crowe's backstory. There is none. He seems to be a good guy who wants to do good, but sees the world as awful. Presumably a recovering drunk, he hires Gosling's P.I. to track down a girl gone missing. Sound familiar? Yep, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" follows the template. Except here, it's really ugly and not very fun. The story takes odd turns, leads come up deadand the wise-cracking timing is off somehow. There are good moments, but that's all there is. There are the moments of endearment. Dad jokes type endearing, where you feel it's been told to Black by a drunken molest-y uncle or something. It's silly stuff you see in every movie he writes. Everything just seemed so misplaced. The action didn't even seem all that thrilling. And the fight sequences are clunky. Save for punch sounds, you wouldn't know if anyone even got hit. And the teen daughter in the world of porn in the 70's is really odd. Odd that it probably seemed more natural in a movie like ""Boogie Nights"" but for Gosling's kid, she was suppose to seem precocious, ended up being a lot more unnerving. The movie is also shot digitally. Film negative would've added so much more to the mood of the movie. And you can tell how much they were fighting with the modernized look of digital with the analog look of film. The setting just looked..plastic and flat. There wasn't that aged feel, even though they had ""aged"" film in the movie itself. If you're going for a plot, there is none. ¾ through the movie you're actually really confused as to what they are suppose to be doing. Never fear, someone comes into push the story forward. It happens too many times that you wonder if luck doesn't play a role in their work. They're not good detectives or muscle, they're just passive bystanders waiting for someone to tell them their next move. TERRIBLE mistake. I get that the studios probably thought ""we can't pass on the guy who wrote 'Lethal Weapon.'"" That is close to 30 years old. Wow, what a difference Black is going through. He's lost so much more when he started directing. Weird, since it seems most people figure out how to directed by writing. This movie stinks bad. Sorryit just does.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Easy to Watch,"I went into this movie with honestly no idea as to how it was going to turn out. It was nice to see Russell Crowe starring in something different and I thought his pairing with Ryan Gosling could potentially create a solid comedic combo. All in all I thought the movie delivered well enough. It is definitely funny throughout, with no shortage of jokes to Ryan Gosling's expense or humorous scenarios in the film. The movie itself does not try too hard to be a comedy, but rather toes the line being decently funny while staying true to being an action/adventure flick. The movie flows nicely and is consistently entertaining. No scenes are really painful to sit through or necessarily dry. Overall my expectations were met and I definitely feel that I got my money's worth. Russell Crowe's performance is enjoyable to watch, as he effectively delivers a character that is likable and empathetic, while maintaining himself as the muscle of the duo. If you're going to go to the theaters soon this movie won't let you down.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A Ravishing, Rambunctious & Rollicking Ride That's As Thrilling As It Is Amusing","From the writer-director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is another ravishing, rambunctious & rollicking ride that's full of laugh-out-loud moments, captures the magical vibe of the 1970s with finesse, balances the elements of comedy & thriller in a seamless fashion, and is further bolstered by charismatic performances from Russell Crowe & Ryan Gosling.Taking place in Los Angeles around 1977, The Nice Guys tells the story of a private detective who's hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star. The trail leads him to a young girl who hires an enforcer to keep him off her. But when she goes missing, the two detectives team up to find her, only to later discover that the whole plot is far more complicated than they imagined.Written & directed by Shane Black, the film brims with plenty of style, is downright witty & makes excellent use of its resources for the most part. The first half is a laughter riot and presents Black at his best but the second half fizzles out of energy after a while plus the big reveal unfortunately isn't as rewarding as expected. Nevertheless, the narrative stays funny & thoroughly entertaining.The 1970s atmosphere is brought to life with vibrancy, thanks to its outstanding production design, fitting costumes & numerous pop-culture references. Cinematography also adds more richness to the story with its energetic camera-work & exquisite use of bright colour palette. The first half is brilliantly paced but it all goes downhill in the next half. And the music further evokes the 1970s feel with its selected tracks.Coming to the acting department, The Nice Guys features a colourful cast in Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Margaret Qualley & Kim Basinger, with both Crowe & Gosling stealing the show although Rice gets to have her own moments as well and does a commendable job in her given role. Crowe & Gosling do chip in with strong inputs separately but their chemistry is even better and makes the whole experience all the more enriching.On an overall scale, The Nice Guys had all the ingredients to finish as one of the finest examples of its genre(s) but it just misses out on boarding that train, thanks to its less-refined second half that simply fails to live up to the expectations set by its previous act. It still bears all the hallmarks of a Shane Black feature, and is an incessantly fun, endlessly groovy & powerfully alluring cinema that promises an equally thrilling & amusing ride to all its viewers and delivers it in sufficient doses. Definitely worth your time & money.",,Anonymous,Crime
Niccccccccceeee!,"Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe star in the neo noir comedy The Nice Guys, which follows the investigation of two independent investigators working together to uncover a case within the 1970s Los Angles porn industry. I have never seen to actors work so well in a a buddy action like this before, and they are just so cool to watch together. Directed by Shane Black the Nice Guys provides a solid good time at the cinema for viewers with entertaining action, intriguing narrative, and enjoyable humour.So as said before, both Gosling and Crowe are absolutely great together with there different personalities that just work and you can even imagine them being a real team. Especially Crowe is really cool and bad ass which would make you honoured to know him. Gosling pulls of a great typical 70s figure with the support of great costumes although his character is an moron but he accepts that.At the heart of it is also Gosling's daughter (in the film) who provides more significance than first thought in a non annoying way, and does not try to bring a moral loving side to the narrative.Although the narrative does grab the audience, there is no real direction where you think its going, and it's not always clear what is going on the whole time.Then there is also the comedy which is entertaining and will tickle audiences but may not make you laugh out loud. I'm not really the best judge of comedy, so I can't really say how funny it is, but it is enjoyable.So in the end, The Nice Guys is very enjoyable and fun to watch, but may not be for everyone. It is more unique then other buddy action comedies like Rush Hour, 2 Guns, or The Others Guys. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just an average Joe,"Overall, I was disappointed by this film. I had such high hopes for 'The Nice Guys'. The trailers sold me, the actors and actresses had my attention. I was all-in for this but after my viewing of it; it was good and entertaining but it ultimately fell short of my expectations. Let us start with the good. Crowe and Gosling delivered. I digged their chemistry, they balanced each other out very well and the comedy hit well for me. I felt Gosling had the stronger performance and I was enjoying every scene with him in it. The 70's private investigator feel of the film was also enjoyable to me. Now for the negatives... Too drawn out. The film felt way longer than needed. To be honest, the characters of Jackson Healy and Holland March are not very developed besides being brutal yet comedic characters. The film tries to give the two characters a background story but it feels forced and forgetful. Bottom line: 'The Nice Guys' had incredible potential for me but it ended up falling short. Primarily due to the drawn out story and a lack of character development. Although still funny and pulling enough; just an average movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing Script  so original funny and great like Pulp Fiction,this movie is so original. the script by Shame Black is so good. the dialogue amazing. the chemistry is so good between Russell and Ryan. the acting is amazing. Ryan is his best performance. story is so balance. in 20 or 30 years will become a classic just like pulp fiction. you just feel pulp fiction and other amazing movies in it but is also so original at the same time. the music and the set pieces are amazing you just feel that you are in the 70s. in this last years they are not so many original films. this is feels and looks like a 80s 90s movie made by Tarantino. this is one of the best Shane Black films in it proofs after Iron man 3 that he is a great director. Russell Crowe has never been great in years. this movie creates his own style. amazing movie almost everything works sometimes you don't understand what is going on. but it is an amazing film,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
An unexpected and thoroughly entertained retro comedy!,"It all began from this year's Oscars, I saw this pair for the first time and I knew its their film promotion strategy. So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
1970's Mix,"Nice Guys resembled a Pulp Fiction type of vintage. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gossling suavely portrayed super sleuths. Angourie Rice delivered the role of female sidekick. Kim Basinger played another overly-controlling female character. Margaret Qualley acted as the rebellious one. Clever quips brought out the relationships among the cast. Costumes and dresses from a by-gone era, like Yaya DaCosta's dress in the climax, gave the scenes an authentic look. A soundtrack of hit musical throwbacks helped set the ambiance. Dramatic plot-twists kept the pace of the movie at par with murder mystery movies while the script integrated humor to lighten the premise. The result created a detective comedy for mature audiences!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Enjoyable Film But Don't Take It Too Seriously,"I watched this with no expectations, only saw the trailers and had no idea of the real plot. I was surprised by the number of times I laughed out loud and found the chemistry between Crowe and Gosling to be quite good. With that said, there were several moments where you watch and think ""That's impossible"" or ""That would never really happen"". I consider this film to be one that entertains you - doesn't make you ponder anything or make you think about it hours later - it was funny, good acting, and decent script. I would recommend it for a fun, Friday night popcorn movie. Sit back and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wickedly funny and wonderfully profane,"Shane Black's The Nice Guys is a thoroughly entertaining, retro 1970s buddy-action-crime romp that brings to mind a cross between his previous works (such as Lethal Weapon and Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang) and the blackest absurd humor of the Coen brothers (The Big Lebowski). The buddies here are an absurdly bumbling private eye, his far-more- intelligent (though also somewhat bumbling) 13-year-old daughter, and a gruff, disgruntled enforcer (who sends physical messages to people doing things they shouldn't be doing). They are grudgingly drawn together to solve a far- flung conspiracy involving mysterious deaths, porno films, Detroit automakers, the Justice Department, and The Waltons. The chemistry of the trio — played to perfection by Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, and Russell Crowe — is a delight to behold. Sincerely hope this is the start of a franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

AViolent Screwball Bromance,"This is a bromance bashed up with an action film and whipped into a kind of armed screwball comedy. It stars damned slowly because the critical parts are so far apart, but thereafter it moves along in sprightly fashion, syncopated to much gunfire (the great shootout is the most delightfully non-lethal since 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'). Ryan Gosling plays a professional, licensed private eye who, despite his ineptitude, is rather snooty toward Russel Crowe whose role is that of muscle-for-hire with occasional heart of gold. After the latter whacks the hell out of the former, clinically breaking his arm in the process, they begin to come to an understanding and find they're on, like it or not, the same side of the same absurdly complicated case. Slam-bang: lots of fisticuffs, a couple of killings, enough blood and plenty of mindless fun. Ryan Gosling is especially good.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A contrived, and flawed, yet hilarious joy ride with 2 perfect leads.","(Minor Spoilers) With Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe fantastically cast as the leads with perfect chemistry, they bring absolute genius hilarity for real fun time. This movie has great style, wit, and is overall competently made thanks to Shane Black's strong direction, but unfortunately is still heavily flawed. The entire story is extremely contrived with a nearly immortal protagonist, which is even joked about in the movie. There are far too many convenient moments like when the person they're looking for literally falls on their car, or the countless times they get away from impossible situations because of pure luck. The daughter character, while very well acted by Angourie Rice, is forced into the movie, somehow leaving the film like nothing happened after multiple traumatic events. The movie begins subverting our expectations by showing us a more realistic and messy portrayal of the violence depicted. Yet the movie still remains quite cliched and unrealistic at times, with all the tropes you'd expect from these types of films. There's big shoot outs where the characters are never hit, but there's also hilarious mess ups from the characters you'd never expect in a movie. The film does a great job of setting up these characters real quick in the beginning, and making us feel for them. Especially March, as he reacts to these absurd moments and subversions the same way we would. It's an odd combination of definite moments of unpredictability, but also remaining weirdly conventional at times as well. It just causes the movie feel messy, like it doesn't know what it's trying to be, but it's hard to fault a movie that is this funny. There's even some odd moments which seem supernatural, which are both done well and badly. A dream sequence that sets up for one of the cleverest and funniest jokes in the film, but also the moment where he falls into the pool (which is extremely convenient that not only was there a pool there, but a bad guy fell and died next to it, while he landed perfectly safe in the pool) and sees Nixon... This movie definitely has its problems, but I was consistently laughing, even out loud almost in tears (which is very rare for me), so it makes it very hard to rate this film. If the humor works for you then this will absolutely be a great time, but if it doesn't, the entire movie will collapse in on itself.(6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not so nice,"The people who created the coming attractions for this film deserve an Oscar. They made me believe it was going to be a great buddy drama, something akin to ""Bad Boys"" or ""The Last Boy Scout"" (of which this is a strange clone). Instead it is a mindless waste of talent with virtually nothing to recommend it.The acting is only slightly better than bad. And there is no chemistry at all between any of the main characters - a grave sin in a buddy film.The film takes place in 1977 but there is almost nothing to evoke the era. Neither the music, dress, locations, or slang bring us back to that era.Then there's the plot, or lack of it. I won't reveal it here, but you wouldn't believe it if I did.Don't waste your time or money.

Shane Black is back baybee!!!,"Can we just stop for a moment and thank the all-that-is-cool demigod Shane Black? Seriously, he wrote the scripts of some of the classic action movies like Last Action Hero, The Last Boy Scout, and the iconic Lethal Weapon trilogy, which encapsulates a whole generation of masculine action movies. Utilizing this experience he built throughout those movies, he went to direct his action parody debut, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a film claimed by many to be his masterpiece. Though many might be write him off as yet another cynical action director based around scummy a-holes doing scummy a-hole stuff, I believe that these films hold some deeper context; outside of delivering action comedy chops, what really makes Black stand out is the way he observes and deconstructs his main leads and the environment around him. The way Tony Stark deals with his insignificance and anxiety in the Avengers universe in Iron Man 3, Lockhart and his position as a thief in KKBB, the whole works.His endeavor this time, in his latest The Nice Guys, he examines two passé, hot-tempered detectives unable to cope with the new generation, all while delivering the most brutally hilarious and endearing buddy cop movie any buddy cop movie can ever transcend to.To what amounts to a mixture of Lethal Weapon and Inherent Vice, it centers around a single father and licensed PI Holland March (Ryan Gosling), who is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. Among this search, he comes to terms with an unlicensed and unmerciful detective Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, it all gets worse when Misty, who reveals to be an anti-pollution activist named Amelia, vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric mobsters, exotic 70s-style strippers, and a possible government conspiracy.One of the things that fascinates me about this move is that amidst all the shootings and trashy humor, there is quite a fascinating subtext about a new coming generation overlying the old. These two cops, along with most of the other characters, represents the retrograde, no-nonsense police enforcers now out of their depth with the new generation. At the heart of this subtext and what ultimately brings some unexpected heart to the film is Angourie Rice as the young daughter of March Holly. Having to deal with the hardships and goon mix-ups the same level as her father, she still endures to be tough and capable in her own right and restrain herself and others from going over their limits. Of all the themes I came to expect from this movie, the implication of a younger generation could stand more superior to the wide array of brutes, dirty strippers, trigger-happy criminals, or even police officials honestly passed my radar.But enough of that pretentious baloney! What you'll likely get from this movie is a plethora of slapstick humor, gun-toting action, and hilarious banter from the two main leads who might as well be called Abbot and Costello with a lot more balls! Crowe, as expected, is a blast to watch, portraying a husky, no-BS private eye who kicks all sorts of ass but also manages to bring some humanity near the end. But the big surprise is Ryan Gosling, bringing an unexpected Buster Keaton-type humor character. Of all of what I usually expect from a Ryan Gosling role (from romantic main lead to un ironic main leads) his turn as sort of a fun and ironic role is instantly his most memorable.However, for all that goodwill, I still struggle to call this film on par with KKBB. The reason lies strictly in design; KKBB is essentially a parody of these types of buddy cop movies that constantly breaks the fourth wall and pulls the rug from your feet with every twist out of the conventional story beats. This movie, though, sticks to be fairly predictable. It still works as is, and thankfully the movie stays far away from several clichés, but for the most part, anyone paying attention might catch up with about 40 minutes ahead at most. It is definitely not a deal breaker, but a compromise definitely from true greatness.Minor issues aside, it's pretty awesome! The jokes are funny, the dirty stuff are really dirty, the character moments are engaging, the old-fashioned and exotic 70s setting feels lived in and compelling, and Shane Black remains the best at directing intense action. Definitely a would-be classic!Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely hilarious!,"Apart from Iron Man 3, I haven't seen Shane Black's other work but after seeing this film I definitely want to explore his filmography further.The Nice Guys follows private investigator Holland March and tough guy Jackson Healy who team up to find a girl named Amelia and solve the mysterious death of famous porn star, Misty Mountains.This is a movie that people don't make nowadays and I love how Shane Black decided to revisit a genre of film that became really popular in the 80s and 90s. A buddy cop film in this generation could've easily gone wrong but Black made it work. The 70s atmosphere feels very nostalgic and memories of films like Lethal Weapon start flooding in. The script by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi is extremely witty and funny. The jokes aren't cheap and the overall amount of them keeps you engaged till the end. The plot is very absurd but it feels right for a film that doesn't take itself that seriously. Aside from Black's script and direction, there are two more reasons to see this film.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are superb onscreen together. They have a great amount of chemistry and make each scene all the more funny. I'm used to seeing Gosling do serious roles but this film shows his capability as a comedic actor. His comic timing is brilliant and without a doubt the highlight of the film. Russell Crowe's character is far more serious which plays a great contrast to Gosling. The action scenes involving him are enjoyable to watch. Another star is Angourie Rice who's really entertaining as Gosling's daughter. The only person I'm conflicted about is Margaret Qualley. I think she could have been better.The Nice Guys is a fun way to spend two hours of your life. The film's jokes and gags are absolutely hilarious and the cast make it even better. It's great to see a revival of the buddy cop genre. I hope Shane Black makes a sequel because this looks like a promising series.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Having a child actress get a role like that is really something else. Crowe and Gosling made an incredible team together. Overall, much more memorable than I initially expected and I'm surprised that it seems there isn't more hype or talk about this. I can really see it getting a lot of deserved Golden Globe nominations. I do think this is a great watch, although inevitably it will appeal to some film fans more than others and they will have to determine for themselves.",,Anonymous,Crime

Twizard Rating: 97,"So, I guess I've found my favorite movie of the year--so far, at least. The Nice Guys did so many things right and so little wrong, it's a shame its release will not garner the recognition it should.Russell Crowe plays an underground enforcer who's helping out a young girl, Amelia, trying to shake the private investigator, Ryan Gosling, who keeps following her. Crowe beats up Gosling, but soon realizes Amelia may be in danger of getting killed, and Gosling might be the man needed to assist him in protecting her. Little do they know, they're about to get involved in a large-scale conspiracy and a string of connected murders.The Nice Guys commits to its quirkiness and loves taking advantage of its irony. Gosling's character won't drive after he's been drinking, so he makes his 13-year-old daughter drive him around instead so he won't get in trouble.It's really hilarious. Not in an over-the-top Will Ferrell sense of the word, but in a very clever and cool Oceans Eleven-y type of way--with a little goofball thrown in, too. Each joke is ingeniously thought-out, but still feels very organic. While credit partially goes to director and co-writer Shane Black, we also have to praise the two leads for their brilliant delivery and conviction.Gosling is on another level and proves he deserves to be considered a comedic actor with the best of them. Crowe, who may not get to say most of the jokes, is just as important in playing Gosling's straight man--maybe the coolest and most realistic one we've seen in awhile. Their chemistry is undeniable.Amidst all the humor is a really brilliant script in its own right. We get an enthralling mystery that unfolds perfectly as the film does. There's a lot going on, but it's never confusing or overelaborate. It's old school, but new school just the same.The only thing you might say, is that there's some underutilized depth. But then again, not really. Both main characters are deep and complicated and interesting in their own ways. There's more than meets the eye and not a lot is laid out for us that easily.Black likes to make us figure things out on our own, but doesn't ever totally abandon us. Instead of flat out stating what year it is, he drops hints, forcing us to pay attention.Another marvel is the young actress, Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling's daughter. She has the talent of someone twice her age, while still maintaining a healthy amount of precocity.Based on the trailer, I knew I was going to really like this movie, save for a possible overwrought premise. But I was surprised even beyond those expectations. This is truly one of my favorite comedies in a long time. Definitely my favorite, so far, for 2016.Twizard Rating: 97",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Yes, It's Good. Actually, It's Great!","""Sometimes, you just win""Everyone ready? Cool, 'cause it's superlatives time! The Nice Guys is the best action/comedy I've seen in years. And probably also my favorite film of this year in general. *Insert Classic Footage Of An Old Hydrogen Bomb Test* But why? I'm trying to keep this flashy, so we'll stick to three elements, bearing in mind the rest goes from decent to great.What's it about? Seventies LA! Private Investigators! Doing... Quips! Action! Drinking! Quipping while drunk! Shooting whilst quipping... In an intoxicated fashion! Also porn stars, stripper mermaids, eccentric gangsters and protesting hippies.Let's start with the writing. And no, this is always my pet aspect of filmmaking, I'm not turning to it just now because Shane Black is involved. Look, say whatever you want about Iron Man 3, the man is still a rockstar. And if you disagree... Reserve judgment till you see this movie. There's not a line waisted, no tiny setup that goes without pay- off, no detail that's left unacknowledged. Does it have typical Shane Blackisms (quippy characters, subversion of action movie tropes)? Yes. Are those 'isms' appropriate? Never more so. Watching it, I could feel the release of those now so rare endorphins that tend to accompany well structured stories.Next, let's turn to the main guys and gal. I mention her because Angourie Rice really acts the hell out of the role of 'too wise and quippy for her age teen'. To channel my inner 1977 LA exec: that kid is going places. But you're here to hear about Crowe & Gosling, aren't you? Well, I personally got them served just the way I like 'm. In Crowe's case, it's noble yet down on his luck Russell (also, not throwing heavy objects at my facial area). In Gosling's case, it's fast-talking (!), occasionally dumb- witted or genius, well-written Ryan. Also, chemistry, huzzah. Crowe seems to know more about it than Bryan Cranston.*.And the final element is: laughter (note to self: great pitch for something at some point). Yes, I know, not really fair and probably a combination of the previous two. Maybe I should've said that this movie looks really great, even has some fun framing at times to improve the visual gags. But I'm going for the sappy line because it (laughter) is essential, at least in my opinion, in knowing why one should revisit this film. Yes, it's a great film all round, but I rarely rewatch films just because they're great. I need something else, and I think many others do to. Casablanca because I want to re-experience a time when movies were 'that', Goodfellas because I haven't seen a good gangster flick in a while and Mad Max because every action movie feels the same.That's why I'm sure that in a few years time, I won't have forgotten The Nice Guys, and probably, neither will you.*Get it?

Pathetic jokes that flop, and desperate attempts to shock with pointless nudity, are what this film is all about. Supposedly set in the 70's it even fails at that; the movie looks patently 2016. It tries to be sexy and comes across as pathetic. I'm sure this one scored points at frat houses throughout America. As a fan of everything 70's, this movie made me kind of sick. Definitely the worst thing Gosling has ever attached himself too, and Russell Crowe's career remains firmly in the toilet with this one. The saddest thing is the high score this thing has; has the intelligence level of the masses really declined this much? So sad..",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Rating: A+,"Shane Black wrote and directed this film and he did some great work. This is an unconventional and original comedy, with two amazing actors with great chemistry.Usually, in this type of movies, the main story is always the same: two different people, with totally different pasts and personalities, have to work together to solve some mystery and then end up being best friends. Not with this film. Both characters have a similar past (problems with alcohol) and they both have this funny personality that works perfectly when they're together. Gosling and Crowe really pull it off!Angourie Rice as Holly March is also really great, she played the ""side-kick"" to all their missions and acted as the adult in that partnership. She sold it so well, even if she was just a kid, great job!And again, Shane Black's writing is incredible. I was crying of some much laughter, there were scenes that I still remember today because they were so well filmed and funny. I can't wait to watch this movie again! The action was a nice surprise, really well shot with some old film-making techniques. Actually, the whole movie was really well filmed, it looked like I was watching an old movie, but with better effects and all.The dialogues were great, the characters were super funny and the mystery was intriguing. In a time where we're over-saturated with superhero and sci-fi movies, this is a blessing, movies like this don't exist anymore. The ending was also really cool to watch, it's really a good story.Honestly, I'm excited to watch it again. It's that great.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pleasant 70s-era crime caper: Angourie Rice steals the movie,"""The Nice Guys"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a couple of private eyes looking for a missing girl. As the movie opens (to the tune of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""), we are reminded that it is ""Los Angeles, California, 1977"". Before we know what hit us, a car comes flying around the corner, crashing into a house and killing its driver, whom we later learn is Misty Mountains, an adult film star. We the get introduced to Holland March, a private eye who is down on his luck, and separately also to Jackson Healy, the guy you call on ""to bring a message"". It's not long before Healy is hired to ""bring a message"" to March. At that point we're a good 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Shane Black, who previously brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, among many others. Here Black takes us back to the golden era of police and private eyes dramas and film noir, but with a never missing smile (or is that smirk) on his face. Second, don't worry about the insanely complicated story line, in which I got lost in no time. Instead, enjoy this movie for the many outstanding performances: Ryan Gosling (as March) brings comedy to the screen like I've never seen him do before (the 'bathroom' scene is destined to become a classic). Russell Crowe (as Healy) plays it rough and gruff, the perfect counterpart to Gosling's role (the ying and the yang), so in that respect, this is a great ""buddy"" movie. But with all due respect to Gosling and Crowe, the movie is stolen by newcomer Angourie Rice, who plays Merch's 13 yr. old daughter Holly. She seems like is was born to play in movies, that's how natural she comes across. Surely this is only the beginning of a long career for this young lady. Kudos also to the set designers, who did an outstanding job recreating what 1977 looked like (the ""Jaws 2"" poster, Tower Records, etc. ), And last but not least, there is an overabundance of outstanding music from that era featured throughout the movie, from the opening sounds of The Temptations' ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" to when Al Green's outstanding ""Love and Happiness"" plays over the movie's end credits.The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Having seen the trailer a number of times, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but nowhere close to sold out). If you are in the mood for a 70s-era crime and buddy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Nice Guys"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A comedy with brains,"Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last Action Hero) wrote (with Anthony Bagarozzi) and directed this combination thunder and hilarious spoof of a tow guy crime film and wisely chose Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling to be the pair du jour to pull of this zany and entertaining film.A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles. Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk, a sometimes-present father to his very bright daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman (Lois Smith) who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress (Murielle Telio) is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia Margaret Quailey) who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a filmmaker, was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.a complex plot to show the world a film about corruption and greed.It is always surprising when directors and costumers go to such extremes to recreate a period (the 1970s Los Angeles) and yet allow such oversights as the au courante five o'clock facial hair that would never have been around so ubiquitously during that time. Now that the porn industry is everyday news that portion holds no secrets, but in the 1970s? But those are small issues in a film that keeps us entertained from the first scene through an hilarious men's restroom scene (Ryan Gosling is extraordinarily funny) to the last expected explosion/bang-bang close. Kick back and just prepare for some belly laughs. Adult themes throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great fun!,"Ryan Gosling and his on-screen daughter Angourie Rice give great performances, while Russell Crowe delivers at least the minimum we expect from such a great star.Let me correct or rather add to what I just said: this is the first time I've seen Angourie Rice in a movie, and as you might think I had no expectations from a young person acting beside two big names, and therefore her brilliant work was all the more impressive - will definitely be looking for more movies from her.Having lived in LA in 1978 I can say that this period piece is pretty accurate.

The story is a bit weird sometimes, with quite a bit of violence and sometimes a bit of nudity. There are funny scenes enough to class it as a comedy even though it's more about action.

Plenty of adult action and fun,"Fate turns Holland March, a down-on-his-luck private eye and Jackson Healy, a hired enforcer into unlikely partners when a woman mysteriously disappears.Filmmaker Shane Black - writer of Lethal Weapon, Predator and director of Iron Man 3 offers a dark comedy with a Chinatown-like detective story. The Nice Guys is set in 1977 on an LA sleazy vibe back drop which is convincingly recreated, topped off with the music of the time.With their own reasons for getting involved the duo team up to achieve one shared goal both reliant on each other's different skills. It's a different era of wild celebrity disco parties, cigarette smoking and lenient police involvement, allowing unlikely partnership of drunkard PI Holland (Ryan Gosling) and Jackson (Russell Crowe) paid hard man to go about their business. What's interesting and surprisingly works is Holland's young teen daughter (Angourie Rice) who helps her dad and dicey new partner as they investigate the murder of a porn star, Misty Mountains and its mysterious link to environmentalist wild-child Amelia (Margaret Qualley) and politically connected mother, Judith (Kim Basinger).It feels likes it's all shot on location, the period setting is at times the star of show, injecting plenty of atmosphere and mood, the cars, the fashion etc. The supporting cast a great, notable are the excellent Matt Bomer (White Collar, American Horror Story Hotel) who plays a professional hit man and thug Keith David (The Thing, They Live) who want Amelia dead. Black offers corruption, some surprise deaths and twists but it's a comedy at heart. Gosling and Crowe are kind of 70s version of Laurel and Hardy, yelping and mumbling through scenes. Their chemistry is great, it's an interesting and brilliant casting with the leads displaying a naturally comedic zaniness along with Crowe adding a believability that he can bust heads.Thankfully Black and writer Anthony Bagarozzi create enough back- story for Holland and Jackson to ensure your buy into the characters' plights as they work through clues looking like Starsky and Hutch in Boogie Nights. Both Gosling and Crowe somehow feel they belong to the period. Rice equals Leon's Natalie Portman in terms of a young girl being in an improbable adult world. Gosling is disinclined to being a good dad, in contrast to Crowe's deadpan character wanting to be liked and you find yourself rooting for the at times unsavoury characters.With its period setting, some hard hitting action and taboo comedy there's plenty of entertainment to be had, recommended.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Unique Plot,Cliché characters & a Few Memorable Scenes","I wasn't really excited about this movie cause comedies aren't always that funny to have comedy as their genre but this movie had pretty good jokes and a few very funny moments and a nice story that is original.Well the whole story was original and since the movie takes place in the 70s it tried to put on the 70s kind of vibe in the movie.About the characters,I didn't really like it cause it was the same exact kind of characters we see in every crime-action movie,which made the movie pretty predictable,but I can't blame that cause people like that kind of thing (but I don't think anyone would mind a new set of characters for gang movies). To me the casting and the chemistry wasn't that good that I would remember the movie for it's unique cast.The movie had some short scenes with fast cuts and some scenes that seemed really pointless (not many thought) which made me think it was a first time directing for it's director (Shane Black) but when I found he's a pretty experimented directer I changed my mind,well it's an independent film but we've had better indie directors.As a whole it won't be a waste of time to watch it since it's less than 2 hours (so yaaaay!)

"Hits and misses throughout, but a fantastic lead pairing.","Set in the late 70s and based around a string of suspicious deaths within the porno industry, this Shane Black joint lovingly harks back to the good ol' days of ultra-violent buddy-cop flicks like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs. With this breed of movie almost extinct, it's gratifying to see Black breathe life back into it with his trademark dark wit, genre-subverting style and willingness to unleash a spot of sudden violence for nervous laughs. Crucially, he's aided and abetted by charming lead performances from Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the former a gravel-voiced, hard-nosed enforcer with a noir-ish edge, and the latter a likable loser with dubious parenting skills but a sympathetic past. Crowe and Gosling are the epitome of chalk and cheese, and are all the more delightful to watch because of it; some of the film's finest scenes are nothing more than them chewing the fat about life, albeit their warped life. Unfortunately it's not all rosy for Black's trip down memory lane though. The central mystery is convoluted, boring and ultimately a damp squib, whilst the numerous tangential subplots, infused with pitch-black comedy, often go nowhere, despite lengthy build-ups. On first viewing it's difficult to grasp exactly how entertaining The Nice Guys really is, such are the typical ups and downs of Black's distinctive writing/directing style. Cult classic status potentially awaits, but so does cinematic obscurity.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Shane Black is known for his involvement in the development of late 80's buddy cop film Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Iron Man 3 and this solo underrated crime comedy flick Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Black returns with a new feature film that packs not only the key elements of his works but a solid buddy cop movie that definitely feels like a new Lethal Weapon film for the new generation.The plot follows two men; tough enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) who has been down on his luck since the death of his wife but tries to raise his young per-teen daughter who paths cross when they discover Holly (Angourie Rice). At first Healy manages to get March off the case for a search of a fading adult film star in the 1970's, but it soon discovered that both men will need to work together when dead bodies surface and they are targeted by hit men. As they draw deeper into the case, a bigger conspiracy unfolds and both men are driven to solve the case.The Nice Guys plays so well; firstly the direction and the script are well presented that Black himself could write and vision, what is shown on screen is pretty much enjoyable with the production set detailed to high standards (the film is set around the 70's), it's soundtrack is catchy and nostalgic and costumes are presentable for the story's set era. The script is smart, funny and very much a noir mystery, I won't say too much on what is involved but knowing that Black's style of storytelling is a cult following, it surprises to be engaging throughout without a dull moment existing.Another strong key element that makes the movie work so well it's is great leads Crowe and Gosling, I don't think anyone would ever see these two in a film together but the chemistry they share is often smart, funny and forms the element purpose of a buddy cop film. Crowe manages to be the tough guy as we all see him, but he does give a convincing performance of a man that seems to roll with it. Gosling manages to run with the humour of his fallen character, showing his struggles of being an alcoholic and raising his daughter. Angourie Rice is an Australian actress from the deeply moving These Final Hours, here she show cases not to top over the leads or affect the plot but she serves well as both comic relief and support for the leading characters. The supporting cast handle themselves well, there is no miscast whatsoever.Overall, The Nice Guys plays out like a nod to noir crime thrillers of the 70's, old school action flicks of the era while it carries a feeling and tone of a buddy cop action/comedy that helps to keep the audience watching the plot unfold and see its leads play out in hilarious ways. Well worth a watch if you love Black's style of film or your just in the mood for a film that packs crime and comedy into the one.Nick - 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my favs,"Full of action, laughs, and thrills- The Nice Guys is one of the most fun times i've had at a movie ever. The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is truly out of this world, and it's truly dumbfounding how good they are together in these roles, especially when I heard they didn't exactly get along on set. Shane Black has not only provided an incredibly fun buddy cop-like action comedy to enjoy, but also a strangely accurate satirical view of the underbelly of society, and I loved every minute of it. Obviously Gosling and Crowe were great in their roles, but Angourie Rice deserves as much credit as she can get for her role as Holly, as she is somehow able to keep up with the two stars in a surprisingly incredible fashion. The film is entertaining, beautiful to look at, and full of catchy 70's tunes that you are bound to recognize. Its humor can be a bit dark at times, but I personally loved it, as nearly every joke made me belly laughing, if not laughing harder. In the end, The Nice Guys is an underrated little gem that I would be absolutely delighted to see a sequel for. It has so much going for it due to the great talent involved, but what makes the film so grand, is how truly fun it is, and the smile it leaves on your face all the way up to the credits.

Nice enough,"'The Nice Guys' is a comic detective/crime romp, set in the 1970s, reminiscent of Elmore Leonard. It's actually quite funny and inventively plotted, though the comedy is fairly broad-brush and it quickly transitions from low-key to wild, concluding in a lengthy fight scence which although played for laughs could have been taken from a superhero movie in terms of its violence and preposterous complexity.

Great movie! Shane Black does what he does the best!,"A buddy-cop action comedy written and directed by Shane Black. It's what he does but he does it so well. Really well The Nice Guys is a great movie. It does have many of his trademarks but still I don't think he's just rehashing himself, not at all. All filmmakers have their own thing and of course some more than others but I won't complain. All of Black's movies do have many similarities, even Iron Man 3 had elements of the buddy movie that he most often or always uses. I have had high hopes for The Nice Guys ever since I first heard of it quite some time before it was released. I'm happy to say that it delivers. Shane Black is a great writer and The Nice Guys does have a better plot than one usually expects in the action genre. It takes a number of unexpected twists and honestly after my first viewing I was not totally sure how it all hung together. But I've seen it again more than once and it pretty much makes sense now. This movie gets better on a second viewing. One seldom expects or demands that an action movie should have an award winning script and I wouldn't claim that The Nice Guys does either but still it's great to see an action movie where you aren't completely sure were the plot is heading all the time. A buddy-cop, crime mystery, thriller, action, drama comedy would be to completely describe it. It has a little of all actually. And a surprising amount of depth actually. It is a detective thriller. The character drama and plot are I feel just as important as the action, maybe even more so. The characters and acting is just great. Gosling and Crow have great chemistry and fit their characters perfectly. But the real standout like many others have stated is Angourie Rice as Goslings daughter. She turns out to be pretty much one of the main characters. At first one might get the expression that she's obnoxious and irritating but this soon changes. There is of course some comedic relief here and there in the movie, most of the jokes come from the interactions between the three main characters and some slapstick also but it's never overdone. Not every single joke lands but by far most of them. While there is humor this is actually kind of a serious story and with sad characters. The main characters are not really heroes but rather deeply flawed and struggling. Tragic comedy in a way. It feels more plausible so you can more related and care for them. The action is well made and also feels like down to earth but in a good way. It feels tense and thrilling without being this massive spectacle that goes on for too long. Not as much action as some might expect but in my opinion it's just the right amount, I feel the detective and thriller moments are just as exciting. Probably the idea is that it should feel kind of like it not just takes place forty years ago but that it's made then as well. I have no experience of 1970s USA so I can't tell if it's a totally realistic presentation but I think so, it feels so. The Nice Guys is one of the best movies of 2016. Great characters, clever plot, action, humor. See it!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Watching it I bounced between enjoyment and annoyance. Overall though, it ended up frustrating me.I assumed this was going to be a detective procedural. That's how it starts out, and the first half of the film builds up a puzzle/mystery that drew me in and, normally, should have led somewhere. Then around the half way mark it drops that idea and in favor of ... well, stuff.Maybe this one got hacked to bits in the editing suite, maybe it was just put together incompetently but the end result is a mess.

"Nice, guys","The Nice Guys is like a pilot episode to a good TV show that never happened. It's that 90's action flick that comes on TV on a random Thursday evening, which you watch only partially, because you can't decide if you want to watch this movie, the show on National Geographic or The Peacekeeper that's just starting on another channel.It is a polished buddy-cop action movie at heart, with excellent performances from most actors. The little girl who plays the daughter of one of the detectives is adorable. At the centre of the film is the dynamic between Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling, with Crowe playing a seasoned bruiser while Gosling is playing an incompetent tragic figure with a heart of gold. Their witty banter is supported by excellent physical comedic performance from Gosling.The camera work is clean, without any shaky cam, and the action is appropriately dumb, as it seems to imitate the bad action movies of the 80s and 90s, while still maintaining a polished production values of a modern production. Everything clicks together when you find out that one of the writers is Shane Black, who also cowrote Lethal Weapon.Ironically, the story is set in the 70s and not 80s or 90s, with the costumes, sets, and soundtrack all contributing to the film's retro vibe. The retro vide is very clean. The 70's never looked so clean and crispy. It's unclear why this film had to be a period piece, other than to add some flavour.This is where the good ends, as there is little else to this movie. There is no depth to any of the characters. They give the main character a tragic backstory, but it doesn't figure into the rest of the movie. There is no good villain. The back-and-forth between the main characters is nice, but the rest of the script is not that smart, and there's no big twist. The story is a just a simple murder investigation.You'll want to see more of these nice guys after watching the film, indicating that it's perhaps time for a good buddy-cop show. But as a one-off, this was unremarkable and lacked depth. Still, I hope that movies like this don't disappear. In the age of Marvel soup, The Nice Guys is a sip of clean cool water.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"It could have been better, but it was still great","The trailers leading up to this movie made it seem laugh out loud, goofy, fun and interesting, and while the movie itself is all that, I felt kind of disappointed that there wasn't enough of the humor featured in the trailers.With that said this film is still great, the performances are all outstanding, the characters are likable, the 70s vibe and cinematography look cool and the funny moments are really funny, it's just that I wish the plot/mystery was more compelling.I recommend checking Kiss kiss bang bang if you haven't, its from Shane Black as well and its pretty much the same type of film, just that better story wise IMOGood, not awesome, I'll be giving it another go-around but for now7.9 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hmmm...,"I am not sure into which category to put this movie.I am aware that they were trying hard for the film to be funny but for me it was only on several occasions. Thriller elements were kinda good but far from real action/thriller movies. As for the drama elements - it can be discussed as there is a personal drama going on with one girl in the film. So, combining all the genres into the film... you get not a bad movie but not much interesting either.I must say that Russell and Ryan were really good in the roles. But the little girl - Angourie stole the film. I think she was really awesome and believable. Kim, on the other hand, seemed absent even when she was talking.Must say also that half way through the film, I could not really get why or who or what is going on with missing girl Amelia. And the whole dead porn star M M thing was kinda ... weird. But I do confess that the whole porn industry of the late 70's thing was kinda cool.Not bad, but it was not brilliant either for me. I rate it seven.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Review of the movie,"To make this review short, i think that this movie was a fantastic buddy cop comedy. I have never been a fan of Ryan Gosling because i am not a horny teen neither a desperate 40year old cat lady, but to be honest, his performance in this movie is fantastic, as for Russell Crow i have not seen him act for quite a while but he is also great in this movie.I think a movie is underrated because in my opinion it is one of the best movies in 2016 so i think the movie deserves higher appreciation, i mean sure it is not an Oscar winning movie but for it is one of the best movies if not the best movie in this genre so i give the movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Likable buddy-cop slapstick,"Following on from directing the superhero sequel Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys provides a typical buddy-cop comedy with two mismatched misfits – the nihilistic world-weary enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and the ditzy rookie private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling). Set in the smoke-filled world of the 1970s Los Angeles porn industry, The Nice Guys provides a comic take on the sleazy world.Jackson initially targets, then teams up with Holland and the comedy is derived from the chalk-and-cheese characters working together on a case involving the suspicious death of porn star Misty Mountains and the disappearance of the daughter of a Department of Justice official. Alongside them for a lot of the film is the daughter of Holland March which provides some comic back-and-forths but mostly awkwardness in having a minor involved in adult industry setting.The Nice Guys is at its best when it takes advantage of the comic chemistry between Crowe and Gosling, a scene involving the fumbling gun while trying to keep the cubicle door open- unfortunately spoiled in the trailer- is a particular highlight. Throughout, Gosling's hitherto undiscovered talent of physical comedy is on display here.That said, the plot was incoherent and I didn't buy into the story at all, however the film was salvaged by the several belly laughs provided throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
L.A. Inconsequential,"(RATING: ☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A bubble-headed rehash of crime thrillers and buddy movies.GRADE: D+SYNOPSIS: Two inept detectives try to unravel a mystery during the groovy 70's.JIM'S REVIEW: Take the popular buddy movies of the 80's, add the retro good vibes of the 70's and quickly stir in the grisly blood and violence of the 90's and voila!...you have a half-baked movie entitled The Nice Guys, a film with no identity to call its own. To any unsuspecting moviegoer sitting through this dreadful rehash, the age-old adage, nice guys finish last, becomes all too true.The setting is L.A. during the mid 70's. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe play misfits Holland March and Jackson Healy, a couple of low-life PIs who join forces to solve a convoluted mystery involving a missing girl, a porn starlet, and how two distinguished actors can pick a real loser.This alleged comedy is directed by Shane Black, whose previous experiences with this crime genre, like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, has shown the filmmaker to have had some relative success. Here, he is more concerned with capturing the seventies era with his references to killer bees, rationed gas lines, disco music, and pong video games than delivering an entertaining and logical film.His screenplay, co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi, is a total mess. Its plot frequently detours to violent chases and shoot-outs as it tries to connect the two unsolved cases and add some far less clever one-liners between the assorted mayhem. The crime and the comedy elements rarely align unless one agree that this comedy is indeed a crime and a waste of time and talent.The casting of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, two actors known more for their heavy dramatic roles rather than their light comic style, seems off from the start. When it comes to the high art of comedy, the track record of both actors is spotty as best. (While Mr. Gosling has had some success in this area, with film projects such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Crowe's comedy film credits include only Noah, a true laugh-riot.) Together, the two leads have zero chemistry between them.Their foray as two wild and crazy guys is a dismal failure. Their so-called comedy bits are labored and bereft of humor. In fact, in one desperate scene, Mr.Gosling tries to channel the comic timing of Bud Abbott's double takes which elicited groans rather than laughs from the audience members. A paunchy Mr. Crowe is briefly united with an air-brushed Kim Basinger, his LA Confidential co-star, in a brief scene or two. Let us just say time has not been kind to either star and move on from there.In supporting roles, Matt Bomer is underused as John Boy, a paid assassin, and Beau Knapp as a blue-faced killer is more annoying than menacing.The talents of fine actors like Keith David and Lois Smith are squandered in this dud. Only Margaret Qualley as Amelia and Angourie Rice as Holland's wiser-than-her-years teenage daughter create real characters, but that is due to their screen presence rather than the dialog they are spewing. (Both actresses make a strong impression and do deserve better parts.)The film is interminably long, makes absolutely no sense, and has no laughs...none! The Nice Guys makes for miserable company.

Incredibly funny,"Los Angeles, 1978. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a private investigator, of sorts. He is the man you call when someone needs to be given a message, violently. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is more legit, and conventional, taking cases involving tracking down missing persons and the like. Their paths cross when porn star Misty Mountains dies in a car crash. Misty's aunt hires March after she believes that Misty is still alive. Their investigations lead them to a young woman named Amelia, and a massive conspiracy plot.Ostensibly a crime-drama, but far more than that. Very funny, with some very tight, clever dialogue. Some scenes and punch-lines are screamingly funny. Very edgy too - certainly doesn't pull its punches.However, as a drama, it's less good. The crime plot is okay, and was initially very intriguing. However, after a while it falls back on fairly conventional developments and contrivances.Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great in the lead roles, showing wonderful comedic delivery and timing. 15-year old Angourie Rice almost steals the show as March's daughter and delivers on the promise she showed in These Final Hours. Casting Kim Bassinger opposite Russell Crowe was a masterstroke as the plot does have an LA Confidential sort of vibe.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pleasantly Surprised,"I had NO idea Gosling was sooo funny!! I had wanted to see The Nice Guys in theaters sadly never got around to it. Which was unfortunate bc I would've been more than glad to pay for this (matinee of course lol). The only negatives I have would be the daughter; I understand she was supposed to be beyond her years but she was slightly annoying and the connection btwn Amelia & Misty still slightly confused me but I'll let it slide. Reading the ""what was the funniest part"" message boards up here, how could anyone forget the bowling ball flying thru the air or the part in the beginning with the widow searchin for missing husband (take a look on the mantle!) Hilarious!!!! I really enjoyed this film bc it was a combo of action, hilarity, and a little blood. Whenever it comes on HBO I'll definitely watch...

I didn't find it as funny as others,"Critics and audiences alike have rated this movie and some of my friends really liked it, but I was disappointed.At one level, it's a retread of action comedy buddy films like ""Lethal Weapon"" which is not surprising since director and co-writer Shane Black penned the original ""Lethal Weapon"" in 1987. But clearly, three decades later, he feels that the humour has to be more absurd (interviewing mermaids?) and the violence has to be more visceral (choking a dying man?) and this is a combination which sat uneasily with me in spite of a sharp, wise-cracking script.Of course, as the eponymous private eyes of seedy 1977 Los Angeles, burly Russell Crowe, as the violent Jackson Healy, and slimline Ryan Gosling, as the more sensitive Holland March, have great chemistry and are very watchable, but some of the female roles - especially Kim Bassinger (remember her in ""LA Confidential"" with Crowe) and young Angourie Rice (an impressive film debut) - are more surprising delights.",,Anonymous,Crime
A fun and colourful buddy cop film,"The Nice Guys is a film directed by Shane Black, director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3. The movie stars Ryan Gosling as Holland March, a private investigator, Russel Crowe as Jackson Healy, a man who punches child molesters in the face for money, and March's daughter, played by Angourie Rice. Holland and Jackson meet through the machinations of a girl on the run, but soon team up to solve a case featuring a dead porn star, some nasty thugs, and a greater conspiracy.Shane Black was already on my radar because of the fabulous Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, but we have seen little of him in recent times. The Nice Guys is a return to form. It is a dark comedy, with two disreputable characters who drink, smoke, run from danger, overcharge people, and so on. Even so, the two are lovable, and form a great duo. Gosling and Crowe have great on set chemistry, and the intelligent Holly (March's daughter) rounds the pair out with her smarts. Truly, this is a buddy cop film for the ages.Gosling and Crowe play two particularly interesting characters. One (March) is an alcoholic who breezes through life, is very sarcastic, and is a bit of a lousy detective and father. Healy (Crowe) is a stereotypical hard-boiled sleuth, who is tough talking, professional, and gritty, but also ruthless. Together, these two make a really great pair. The on set chemistry in this buddy cop action film is great. The relationship between March and his daughter (Rice) is also excellent, with really wonderful banter between the two.Black's film is full of fantastic dark comedy. The two amateur detectives make mistakes, create a mess, get lucky, screw up and muddle through, all while charging double. Black has created his second dark humour masterpiece (after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) and I look forward to more from him in the future.As you can guess, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was an excellent and comedic buddy cop adventure, full of great dialogue, excellent on set chemistry from the three leads and all the supporting cast. It was well shot, with the 1970's Los Angeles, California setting looking very colourful and fun. The action set pieces were loud and competent (although not spectacular), the humour was on point, dark and witty. The mystery felt right at home. I could go on, but suffice to say, this was a great addition to the genre, and an excellent buddy cop film. This film can be easily recommended for those who want some good black humour, or a great buddy cop movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Film for Old Guys Like Me,"Yeah. Yeah I'm giving it a ten. Just because of the age thing. I don't know if this movie was really a ""10"" but I enjoyed it immensely. So much that I used the word ""immensely"" which I don't do, much.I went to see this film on another of my ""at the mall, have to kill time"" movie afternoons and it was this or ""Angry Birds."" I mentally tossed a coin and went in, expecting to be disappointed. Well, I wasn't. But I'm a weird guy. I like Monty Python. A lot. I like a certain kind of messed-up humor--not poop jokes but jokes ABOUT poop jokes. I found the jokes in this to be laughing out loud funny, and the last ""comedy"" that I laughed out loud at was ""The Birdcage"" with Robin Williams.So your mileage may vary. I like it. I liked it a lot. It is tough (no...it's just about impossible) to make a ""real"" detective movie now, since the Cohens made ""The Big Lebowski."" But somehow, this movie pulls it off. It's really a true, hard-boiled detective story with plot and humor and everything. I'm not kidding.

"Boobs, Blood 'nd Comedy. This Thang's Got It All.","I was looking forward to The Nice Guys and boy am I glad I saw it before it stopped being shown. It's glorious.It's just great watching. Comedies are usually good fun (assuming they're quality comedies and/or don't star Melissa McCarthy), but The Nice Guys carries with it the aura of the funk, the sex, and the mystery – bringing everything to the max. It's in-your-face in its ridiculous aesthetic, or simply its whole shtick, but perhaps what it does best is use quality comedy writing and acting to carry across a lot of stupid comedy, but not always straight into your schnoz comedy — as a lot of the jokes are down to clever writing and are a little more subtle. However, the best laughs in the film explode into your face, like the blood spurting out of March's (Ryan Gosling) wrist and rotting corpses are thrown around. But although the film is full of stupid jokes, it is not totally stupid; as it revolves around a gripping plot that works wonders for the movie – keeping it going at all times. Therefore it is forgiven in the occasional moments where scenes are dragged on for slightly longer than necessary. Occasional.The soundtrack also helps The Nice Guys, as it's all funky-ass beats to fit the time period — although it's unfortunate the Chili Peppers didn't come up because it was calling for it. Of course, the boobs also help. And although Russell Crowe's American accent is a little awkward, he and Ryan Gosling are a great pair for who are two deeper than you might think characters in March and Healey. Other cast members like Angourie Rice are also impressive in the film, and she, in particular, may help Milo to get along with child actors a little more (and no, Milo is not a pervert, he just doesn't like child actors, and her performance was good so it could prove to him they're not all bad).In conclusion, from the very start I knew what I was in for with The Nice Guys. Stupid, fairly obscene, and really enjoyable watchin'. It could stand up as a classic comedy of this decade, even, and is the best new film I've seen this year so far. If you get a chance, watch this film. You probably won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Chuckle Chuckle Bang Bang,"Greetings again from the darkness. Shane Black sold his first screenplay at a very early age which led him to become something of a phenom with the success of that film, Lethal Weapon (1987). Later, he disappeared from Hollywood for about 10 years before resurfacing in 2005 by directing his own terrific script with the immensely entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (my favorite movie of that year), and then hitting big-budget time with his script for Iron Man 3. This time, Mr. Black (directing and co-writing with Anthony Bagarozzi) returns to the detective-farcical-comedy-mystery-action genre and even adds an element of being a 1970's period piece.Black's rapid-fire wise-cracks were perfect fits for Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr, and for this project he's working with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe  both fine actors, though neither known for their comedic work. What's clear from the beginning of the film is that both Gosling and Crowe are fully committed to the material and their respective characters. Gosling plays a boozy Private Detective and single dad who just can't quite get things right, while Crowe plays a hired-hand bruise type – think of his Bud White in L.A. Confidential (1997), only with an extra 50 pounds and a lot of miles. These two damaged boys play off each other very well, and with Black's dialogue and visual gags, the film provides a good number of laugh out loud moments  more silly than the sophomoric humor that's so pervasive at multiplexes these days.Of course for comedy to really click, there needs to be some type of story to follow. In the opening scene a young boy (Ty Simpkins) watches as a car slams through his house, culminating with a ""model/actress"" named Misty Mountains meeting a not-so-pleasant ending. We then learn that Gosling's Holland has been hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ms. Mountains – with two significant exceptions. Simultaneously, Amelia has hired Crowe's Jackson to convince Holland to stop searching for her. Soon enough, Holland and Jackson are working together on the ""case"" that mixes in the Auto industry (Big 3), Porn industry, Justice Department (government conspiracies), environmental protesters, Killer Bees, LA parties, LA smog, The Waltons (John Boy), The Rockford Files, Detroit, and Richard Nixon  all hot topics in this 1977 era.As much as the story is needed, it really doesn't much matter. This is a movie of moments  some of them featuring funny words, while others focus on pretty astute physical comedy. Gosling (and his stunt double) provides some pretty impressive gags as he is bounced and slammed around for most of the run time. The surprising heart of the film  and moral core  is Holland's daughter Holly played by Angourie Rice. Despite the title, she is really the only ""nice guy"" in the whole film, and her good-hearted nature keeps us rooting for Gosling and Crowe, despite their flaws.Other support work comes from Matt Bomer as a ""John Boy"" hit man, Keith David, Lois Smith, Yaya DaCosta (quick, name another Yaya), Beau Knapp (as the toothy Blueface), Jack Kilmer (Val's son as a ""projectionalist""), and Kim Basinger (re-teaming with her LA Confidential co-star, Crowe). Also playing a significant role are the mid-to-late 1970's vehicles, the period music and houses and décor that puts us right in the moment, and the clothes and hairstyles that are sure to inspire a chuckle or two.Fans of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang will surely find plenty of laughter here  despite one of the worst trailers in recent memory and even if the film is lacking the one thing it advertises – nice guys.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fun, original comedy piece","A 1970s Los Angeles crime flick featuring two P.I's and a young girl accompanied by well delivered cheesy quips and remarks. The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe along with Angourie Rice, Gosling's bold daughter all wonderfully show out in a 'crimedy' tale full of twist and turns.Firstly, the jokes in this film, while not ""Dave Chappelle"" hilarious, have a strong effect and work really well with the characters who deliver them. It stems from the fact that none of the characters are every 'trying' to be funny in the first place which makes the scenes all the more hilarious. Unfortunately for me, viewing the trailer for this film tad ruined the surprise element as it contains some of the funniest lines of the film in the trailer.In terms of originality, this film doesn't disappoint. Shane Black took a relatively cliched time period associated with hippies, rebellious adolescents, drugs and flashy parties and fashion and managed to use all those elements to the film's advantage.I definitely recommend seeing this film, even if you have seen the trailers, don't hold yourself back. Its probably one of the funniest films I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another clever neo-noir comedy from Shane Black,"In many ways, Shane Black's ""The Nice Guys"" is just his earlier film, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" playing 1970s dress up. Considering it's been more than 10 years since that hilarious crime comedy, I'll gladly take ""Nice Guys"" being any semblance of it.Like ""Kiss Kiss,"" ""Nice Guys"" takes place in Hollywood and tells the story of a tough guy and a bumbling idiot trying to solve a case involving a dead/missing women. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire who's been paid by a young woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley) to keep some guys off her back. He runs in with Holland March (Ryan Gosling), a private investigator living with his teenage daughter (Angourie Rice) who has been asked to investigate the death of porn star Misty Mountains, a job that led him to track down Amelia. When Healy realizes there are some other folks after Amelia, he and March team up to find her and figure out why there's a trail of bodies everywhere she goes.Crowe gets to play stoic tough guy again alongside Gosling, who gets a rare opportunity to do physical comedy as March, a heavy drinker, womanizer and moron whose daughter is a better detective than he is. There's always something subdued about Goslings' performances and in this case it helps balance how over the top his character is written. Again, March echoes Robert Downey Jr.'s Harry Lockhart from ""Kiss Kiss,"" another guy who is in way over his head, suffers an injury that follows him throughout the movie and makes a fool of himself in the face of danger.Black continues to own his niche as one of Hollywood's best buddy comedy architects and these neo-noir comedies are his finest work. This screenplay (co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi) is witty, of course, as always, squeezing laughs out of violence and sex in clever ways that usually involve putting his characters in uncomfortable situations.""Nice Guys"" has all the naked bodies and action that you associate with stereotypical adult male entertainment in movies, but Black is somehow always classy and purposeful about it. Hollywood in the late '70s was certainly seedy, a time when the country was rife with vice, but there's a thematic element of being a decent person in indecent circumstances. Of course, this was also a theme of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" Both films feature characters covering up exposed women in vulnerable moments.Despite being a mystery of sorts, the plot is more about the turns than the twists. Black is so good at taking the audience by surprise without needing to engage in smoke and mirrors. Very little happens in predictable fashion, even if that necessitates exaggeration or implausibility, which Black usually ensures will play to humorous effect.The strong sense of danger that makes ""Nice Guys"" highly entertaining, however, don't completely mask its emotional deficits. Considering the father-daughter relationship at play, dialogue alluding to the problems with the lack of morality of the era and some mentions of the characters' tragic pasts, it's a bit surprising that the film never operates much beyond face value. The ""conspiracy"" hiding at the end of the trail of clues also doesn't mean anything other than raising the stakes.""Nice Guys"" doesn't quite measure up to ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" but both are effortlessly entertaining films that will remain easy to watch for a long time. In fact, Black could role out another neo-noir comedy with the same footprint in 5 to 10 years and I'd watch and enjoy it all the same.~Steven CThanks for reading.

"A fresh take on the genre, with fantastic writing.","Some Spoilers Might Have Slipped Through.""The Nice Guys"" follows two private detectives who are both looking for a girl called Amelia, who has a connection to the death of a porn star.This movie was directed by Shane Black, who has also written the screenplay for the movie. He did a really good job at directing. His use of shadow is amazing. One scene in particular stood out to me. This was the one, where March falls down the cliff, and discovers the body of someone. By his use of shadow the body stays hidden, but you can feel that something is there by the camera movement. When March uses his lighter we finally see the reveal and the body is shown. That scene is handled in such a comical and scary way, with beautiful cinematography that it might be my favorite scene of the entire movie. But this is just one example of the use of shadow. He uses this a lot, but most of the time the were not used to enforce the comedic element of the scene. The lighting in the night scenes were also nicely done. He also uses very cool camera movements, especially the ones where he moves the camera from a driving car, goes up in the air, gives a shot of LA, and than goes to the place they are driving. There are a couple of them in the movie, but it never get's tiring. He also handled the action scenes very well. They were cut and shot like they were done in the 80's. He also managed to put some comedic elements in these scenes which gave a nice whole. To give one minor criticism is on the editing. This is near the end of the movie, when Gosling and Crowe are sitting at a bar. Crowe's often puts the cigar in his mouth and smokes it, but when there were different cuts, you could see his hand suddenly switching positions and the length of the cigar can also grow or shrink between cuts. This is really my only bit of criticism on the technical side of the movie.The acting also was very good. March, who I've mentioned earlier was played by Ryan Gosling. Before going into the movie, I knew that he was going to be good, that's just how Gosling acts. Now I've seen the movie, I can confirm my thoughts going into the movie. Gosling made his character feel real and gave something more to it than just the character that was written down. You could see that his character had a damaged past. Russel Crowe also was very good. He played the other private detective. He also brought a lot to the character, not in the way Gosling did, but by gaining weight. This added to how you felt about his character and pointed out his style of living. Both Gosling and Crowe had very good chemistry and they play with it, which only makes the movie better and funnier. Goslings character also has a daughter and she was very good. She played with emotion and was convincing. There were multiple antagonists in the movie, but I'll just pick one, and this one is played by Matt Bomer. I picked him, because I didn't know he was in the movie. The character he plays here is totally different than any others he has played beforeThe writing was, like I've said, written by Shane Black. But he had some help with it by Anthony Bagarozzi. The script was absolutely the best part of the whole movie. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laughed with every joke, and still thinking back of them, or reading them on the ""quote"" part on IMDb, I laugh, not out loud, but chuckles. Which is not a bad thing, because the movie was not aiming for me to laugh uncontrollably. There were some on going jokes in the movie, and every time they're still funny. The story was well thought out and complex. It was interesting to follow, due to said complexity, but also due to the great dialogue overall, not just the jokes. The characters were multi-layered and differed from each other. Like the difference between Russel Crowes character and Ryan Goslings. Both are very different, yet they seem very similar. Both are damaged people, but March is just less professional. The character I really want to mention is Holly, the daughter of March. She was useful in the movie. She was funny and smart and actually helped to get the story move. She was not just some one there to be funny or be cute or something. No she actually did something and that's really seldom looking at the movies that come out today. The bad guy, played by Matt Bomer, was good. His character was scary and hidden throughout the movie, but this only made him more threatening. The character was just not that well developed as I would've liked to see, but still a good character.In the end this was a very good movie, the best movie that came out in 2016, that I've seen, even. The directing was very good, the characters were varied and well acted. The jokes were funny and don't get boring.

"A great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of)!","'THE NICE GUYS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Action-buddy flick from filmmaker Shane Black. Black previously wrote (or co-wrote) such popular (and classic) action-buddy movies as 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'LETHAL WEAPON 2', 'THE LAST BOY SCOUT', 'LAST ACTION HERO', 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT', 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' and 'IRON MAN 3' (he also directed the latter two). The film hearkens back to the glory days, of his greatest work ('LETHAL WEAPON' and 'KISS KISS BANG BANG'). The movie was directed and co-written by Black, with first time film writer Anthony Bagarozzi (it was also produced by Joel Silver). It stars Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling; as two mismatched private investigators, trying to solve the disappearance of a missing girl (in 1970's Los Angeles). The film also costars Angourie Rice, Margaret Qualley, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Beau Knapp and Kim Basinger. I loved it!Gosling plays Holland March; a private detective, in 1970's Los Angeles, and single father. He's good at his job, but he also takes advantage of people; and he's also a bumbling alcoholic (due to the fact that his wife recently passed away). His daughter, Holly (Rice), takes care of him, more than he looks out for her. Crowe plays an enforcer named Jack Healey. Healey is also very good at his job, but he's also only motivated monetarily. March and Healey's paths cross, when they're both involved in the same missing girl case. They reluctantly team up, in order to solve it.The movie is hilarious; due to some really cleverly written dialogue, and some insanely odd comic scenarios. It's also a great action flick; with some highly entertaining, and extremely well- executed, action scenes. The characters are really well written, and acted, and there's even some really touching drama (involving them). The movie exceeds on all fronts, and there's never a dull moment. Besides all that, it's just a great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of). The film is a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pretty good movie,"Although it appears as a pilot for a TV series (since it screams for sequel(s)), this movie can remain ""as is"". It is fun to watch, most of the time something happens, some dark jokes and the ""dynamic duo"". Mr. Gosling finally shows his acting abilities (pretty good, for that matter) and Mr. Crowe' s art is not affected by aging. On the contrary. He does not have to be some Roman general to do his job with excellency. Story is a bit mumbo-jumbo, but direction is good.

Good laughs with this one,"I've noticed some criticism around this film, people judging it poor, stupid, dull, whatever. But after seeing it's good rates from users and meta critics here, I went to the movies. I guarantee it was the best comedy I saw in the last years, can't even understand how people can not find it funny. The plot is good too, no doubt. I put it in the same kind with ""The Big Lebowski"", both with a not too worried kind of humor. I think that for those ones used to big plot twists or impossible/inscrutable situations which we see a lot on nowadays comedy scripts, maybe this one'll be a bit too simple (however it has it's own amount of unbelievable action scenes). The plot goes around one very truthful and smart situation on government illegal intervention in some matters, from the point of view of a idiotic investigator, who couldn't imagine the proportions one simple case of murder would get. I'd recommend it for those who can appreciate a uncompromised comedy, as it's not focused on investigation itself, nor in maintaining the seriousness that this matter could demand. Worth seeing, that's for sure. As a comedy, I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good not great,"Like that of another film penned (but not directed) by Shane Black, LETHAL WEAPON: it's the film's unlikely duo that pushes the vehicle over the finish line. AGAIN, I get the impression that Shane put all of his effort behind fleshing out each of the disaccording partner-partner dyad, and their relationship, rather than the story they were placed in. Though, to be fair, THE NICE GUYS' tale was extensively more interesting - however, considering how lackluster LETHAL WEAPON's was, that ain't saying much; NICE GUYS' was only half-assed, whereas LETHAL's was about a 1/16 of a buttock. Still, there are no ""oooohhhh"" moments whenever a piece to the puzzle comes into place, BUT there are a few very convenient moments that force the story forward, so that's um...not so good. Pretty yawn-inducing stuff, to be honest.Beside Gosling and Crowe (and their characters) arduously keeping me engaged, there was also very consistent snappy dialogue that kept me smiling, and Black's subversion of the crime genres' norms - the usual slick and effortlessly cool are replaced with the clumsy (Gosling excels at this) and quasi- realistic - kept me on my feet and entertained. I'm aware this subversion isn't new to Black - he's done it once before (that I'm aware of) with yet another conflicting-couple crime film, KISS KISS BANG BANG. Speaking of which: I'm keeping my fingers crossed that KKBB doesn't follow the same path as the two I've seen.One last point: The soundtrack is severely lacking solid 70s jams. It's ALWAYS a joy to nod my big head up and down while mouthing/silently singing ""Ay, Ay, Ayyy! Ba de ya - say do you remember"" to September, but I need more! C'mon, Shane!

Let down by its final act.,"Like I find with a lot of Shane black films the final act is often the weakest part of the film, but what proceeds that is often cinema Gold. Nice Guys is no different!Gosling & Crow are both brilliant & their characters both bounce off of each other perfectly, but for me the standout star from this movie is Undoubtedbly Angourie Rice, every scene she steals and that's no easy job for any actor or actress when working with two of hollywoods finest, but for someone of her age is exceptional!!The film itself starts off with a blast, extremely funny from the get go, the dialogue is so typically Shane Black. However leading up to final act the film starts to lose pace, IMO becomes slightly messy, the comedy doesn't really stick & finally kind of blindly stumbles over the finishing line. That's the only reason I gave it 7 (mainly because they don't have a 7.5) had the final been stronger it would have been an easy 9.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A film filled with witty banter, adequate action, and an incredible 1970's soundtrack.","I'll be honest that the trailer for this film is the main reason I went to go see it. The few bits revealed in it definitely painted a picture of a smart and funny film. The pairing of Ryan Gosling with Russell Crowe was an interesting one, but definitely works on the ""buddy cop"" adventure level. While Gosling had almost every funny line, the action brought to the film via Crowe's slightly heavier form really helped to balance things out. The full film definitely delivered on what the trailer had to offer.With dialogue that comes fast and full of quips, I was laughing throughout most of this film. It almost has a ""self-aware"" feel to it, as each failed piece of the investigation would have normally led to the next logical step. As it is rated R, it unfortunately has an incredible amount of questionable material, including plenty of nudity (as the main plot revolves around pornography), incessant cursing, and regular violence. Much of this isn't too distracting, but the heavy-handed social message about pollution and corporate corruption is a bit obnoxious in a film that I was expecting to be fun.In the end, the Gosling/Crowe dynamic works and helps to propel the film forward between balanced segments of comedy and action. If you focus on what's being said, there's plenty to laugh about, but also a number of good examples of character development. I wouldn't mind seeing this pair of ""nice guys"" again in a sequel.A film filled with witty banter, adequate action, and an incredible 1970's soundtrack, I give The Nice Guys 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not fit for human consumption,"1 is higher than I would give it. Why two talented actors would lower themselves to be part of trash like this is beyond me.

There is so many different characters and new problems brought to the table, and the movie handles them all well and finishes them nicely in its very rewardingly satisfying end. The '70's LA vibe is great, and it was a great change to see that in a modern movie. I love the pacing and the action is enough to balance the detective work.

Great Comedy and Characters,"The Nice Guys follows two private investigators who are brought together to look into the death of a porn star and another woman's involvement in it.I didn't know this was a comedy until about 20 minutes before I decided to watch it. I thought it was going to be a serious murder mystery or something. I was wrong, and I'm pretty happy about it.The comedy is, while sparsely placed throughout the movie, great. It almost always hits, and when it does, it hits hard. The jokes are pretty hilarious and well-presented. It often takes clichés of the genre and, in a very self-aware way, turns it into an original joke. And I liked that. It was clever, but it was also very dumb. The characters are often goofy and fun, and yet no one felt out of place.The characters are great. I had a blast with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe's characters. They have great chemistry together, and I can't wait to see them together again. This is easily my favorite performance by Gosling as well. I've liked him as an actor in the past, but he's always been that guy that I mistake for Ryan Reynolds and hasn't really had any hugely memorable roles to me. And yet, here he manages to squeeze out of that place and really blow me away. He perfectly portrays this character, and I really hope to see him play characters like this in the future. Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling's daughter, does a pretty good job too.When the movie is good, it's great. However, there are a handful of points that take pretty big dips. There's one scene where a woman supposedly jumps out of a building and lands on the roof of someone's car. And she just kind of appears. It was super abrupt and didn't make much sense, and knowing which floor the character was on made it hard to believe that she jumped and landed without injuring herself or the car. Sure, there are explanations the audience could draw themselves, like she climbed down and jumped at a reasonable height, but it was just so abrupt that it seemed lazy, like the writers realized that they didn't know how to wrap a major aspect of the story up so they literally dropped it on the main characters.Also, Angourie Rice's character, Holly, wasn't my favorite. While she was an interesting enough character, and she provided some depth to the others, her role was kind of forced. She gets way more involved than she realistically should have, and does things she really shouldn't have. Sure, there's a level of comedy to her role, but the rest of the movie still manages to be realistic. When we have a little 13-year- old girl beating up grown adults with guns, it just gets to be a little too much.Despite this, the problems I had were weighed out by the good, and it didn't stop me from having a blast.Overall The Nice Guys is a great movie. The characters are fun, the performances are great, the comedy is great, but some aspects, including Holly, take the movie down just a notch. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nice movie Guys,"I absolutely loved it. And how can't you love it? Shane's Black new work brings enthusiasm. Two completely different male characters are cooperating to find a missing girl. ''The Nice Guys'', two bizarre and outlandish guys and a half of a woman (March's daughter) are searching for the gone girl and sooner or later they'll realize that a conspiracy scheme is behind everything. First of all, Shane's Black script is gorgeous, with excellent humor, zero clichés, and the proper action. The whole vintage style and scenery, plus the great characters, renders the film quite special. But I think it's all about the humor. The film is not inherently a comedy, but mostly due to these special characters the joking is astonishing and thus it's tending to a comedy. Shane Black knows how to set a maneuverable plot, thus making the film intriguing, with itself- examinations and conclusions in the end. But the film's highlight is beyond a doubt the protagonist duo. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have an amazing ''buddy'' chemistry. Especially, the second's one performance is incredible. As a big Ryan's fan, I didn't expect anything less from him, but the truth is that it's the first time he performed an entire comedy interpretation. The outcome? He is simply delightful. His role reminds me himself in real life. So what if the years go passing by, Russel Crowe is still great, despite the extra weight. The action-comedy movies is a famous genre with few successful attempts, though. The Nice Guys could be definitely considered as, a diamond of this genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I think he's probably a little like me, big movie fan, probably a fan of real good westerns. And also, Ryan Gosling. His good looks have overshadowed how good an actor, and how much range he has. So you put those two together and I bookmarked this movie about 11 months before its release. And it didn't fall short of expectations. The pace is great, the dialogue is great, and the leads have great chemistry and ""do the script its due"" Gosling as a broken alcoholic single father, juxtaposed by Crowe's hit-man with feelings is an uplifting duo. Matt Bohmer is great casting for a bad guy. The face that guy has an evilness to it.I'll just finish this with a thank you for those involved for making an true to genre original story where no one drops the ball at any part.

"Not 'nice guys,' but nice film anyway","'The Nice Guys' has always appealed to me, simply by its front cover. I know you should never judge a book (or film!) on such superficial factors, but it just looked so damn cool. And, I'm pleased to say that it is. Maybe simply setting what it – technically – your pretty standard 'who-dunnit' crime caper in the seventies it hardly that new, but it just seems to work. It's about an 'enforcer' (Russell Crowe) and a private detective (Ryan Gosling) who have to team up in order to solve a crime. So, it's effectively your average mismatched 'buddy cop' movie, even though neither of the leads are police.When you try and 'sell' a movie like this, it's hard to really make it sound as good as it actually is. As I've already mentioned, everything about the set-up is nothing new and it's only real difference is that it's set around forty years ago instead of in present day, you may wonder what makes it worth watching. Well, I guess it's the chemistry between the two leads that makes it work so well. Crowe and Gosling really do play up the 'mismatched' element of the story to perfection. However, just because they're funny, doesn't really mean that I'd call this film a 'comedy.' The humour is all very 'black' and even when you're laughing out loud, it's probably because someone has just been hurt! I won't go into the plot too much, as with most 'who-dunnits' if you give away what and why they're investigating you run the risk of spoiling what's in store. I guess 'The Nice Guys' won't be for everyone. It's not just the humour that's dark. I mentioned that people get hurt and there some fights and actions scenes that are up there with the best of serious cop dramas and action movies. It's one of those films that splits genres. It's never only a comedy, action film or drama, yet it definitely displays elements of all of them. It's also too violent and adult in nature to be watched by younger audiences, so it's strictly for adults who enjoy their murder mysteries dark when a healthy dose of black humour.It's a great piece for both Crowe and Gosling who look like they're really enjoying themselves. And it shows. As I said, 'The Nice Guys' probably isn't for everyone, but hopefully it will at least gain a cult following that it deserves.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Being more slick in execution, quick in runtime could have made it superior - but nevertheless an entertaining romp which is sure to get better with repeat watches","This is a movie you would want to like even before you watched it. Actually what's not to like - a great teaser trailer showing excellent chemistry between its likable stars, quirky comedy set in the America's favorite period - the 70s, also includes some action, adventure and crime. All they need is just an average script which doesn't completely ruin the setup they have done so far and they manage to do just that - nothing less, nothing more.Mr. Healy (Russell Crowe) has an unconventional job of being a hit-man for women in distress - no questions asked. Mr. March (Ryan Gosling) is a PI always willing to bend the rules. When they both collide literally when working on things loosely related to each other, they realize that its much bigger than anticipated and have to work together. They are effectively supported by Mr. March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) who actually cracks open the case.Even though it takes a while for the lead actors chemistry to work, it gets magical after you give it some time and patience. The movie suffers from a poor start where the first 15 minutes of its runtime, it just ponders around in a disconnected manner. Once Crowe and Gosling's characters come together and after a brief period of time, the actual plot kicks in. It definitely has an unconventional but a plot with potential, has budget to execute it to scale, able actors to convincingly portray the characters necessary. Instead of using the slick technology and movie making methods to show the action of the 70s period, the movie resorts to the movie making techniques of the actual period which is a shame. It definitely is not an issue with the potential considering Shane Black has helmed the Director's seat for Iron Man 3 and his much older Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is much more tighter (also following similar plot pattern related to homicide in Hollywood).Angourie Rice playing Holly has a meaty role and she delivers it with aplomb. The overall runtime is a tad too lengthy and easily could have edited out at least 20 minutes or so. Once the overall plot is understood, the runtime looks redundant with unnecessary chases and shootouts where we surely know nothing's gonna happen to the 'Nice Guys'.Being more slick in execution, quick in runtime could have made it superior - but nevertheless an entertaining romp which is sure to get better with repeat watches.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nice and funny!,"Director Shane Black (Lethal Weapon and LW2) proves an action genre writer, given a good script and top actors, can bring life to a story surrounding a couple of bumbling private eyes (Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling). Set in the 1970's, the costumes (Kym Barrett) and environment (Danielle Berman, Richard Brigand and David Utlfey) provide Crowe and Gosling all the leeway they need to take their crazy loose cannon characters across the LA landscape in search of Amelia (Margaret Qualley - The Leftovers), with little Holly (Angourie Rice) as the grown-up of the trio. While initially hard to believe Crowe (with a mature body) and the sexy Gosling in such nutty roles, they quickly and easily pull you into their kooky topsy-turvy world, even when the storyline goes to far or gets off track. Matt Bomer (American Horror Story) gives a fun cameo, and Kim Basinger is a glow in her many soft-lit appearances. ""The Nice Guys"" isn't brain surgery.

Kim Bassinger had a very small role, but she was a confident addition.Ryan Gosling's character blasphemed a lot, which felt awkward and created distaste.The movie had comical moments where facial expressions, mannerisms and banter made the movie feel human. The backdrop of the 70's was a nice addition as it helped the hapless characters get away with murder.The plot is not the most entertaining thing about the movie as under the bonnet it is pretty much the bog standard cops and robbers script. As decorative bells and whistles to disguise the mundaneness of the plot, they added the 70's backdrop, 2 alcoholic detectives and a little girl with too much screen time.I would recommend waiting until you can watch it for free on a streaming service as paying for this is not worth the coin.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Excellent Celebrity Pairing in a Slightly Above-Average Comedy,"A buddy cop throwback in more ways than one, The Nice Guys follows a pair of mismatched private eyes in pursuit of a grand conspiracy that connects everything from porno to the auto industry. It revels in the late-70s setting, poking fun at the fashion, décor, celebrity and personal habits of the era, but at heart it feels a touch more modern.I was struck, repeatedly, at the tonal similarities to the Lethal Weapon franchise, so it was with no great shock that I discovered Nice Guys' director, Shane Black, made his first bucks as a screenwriter for those Mel Gibson action/comedies. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are the new Gibson and Glover, an odd couple whose pursuit of the truth (and the accompanying payoff, naturally) only barely supersedes their grumbling dislike for one another. Crowe is the anchor, your typical gruff exterior with a warm, chewy center, but Gosling steals the show as his loopy, desperate, unpredictable counterpart. They both get some strong one-liners (and one spectacular silent team-up gag in an elevator), but for my money, Gosling does more with his.The plot never fully recovers from a risky swerve at the end of the second act, and it plays the pesky kid tagalong card way too often, but it's not trying to be fine art and such missteps sometimes go with the territory. It is what it sets out to be, for better or worse. I enjoyed myself.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It was pretty funny. I liked it.,"I found the plot to be a little confusing at the beginning and in certain scenes after, I still do, kind of. But overall, it was a decent enough movie. It started off with more comedy, little seriousness. Then, as the movie continued and the story progressed, it was more seriousness, less comedy. But the writers were kind enough to slip comedy into it at that point here and there. The comedy aspect was a nice touch and enjoyable, but I feel like it was unnecessary because the tone of the movie was mostly serious. Having a comedic nature even though it was slightly in this movie was unneeded.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hot Mess,"When it first started, I thought it was going to be a kind of quirky buddy movie, and even though I don't like Russell Crowe or Ryan Gosling, I decided to give it a go. A short time later, I was questioning how on earth Ryan Gosling's character got custody of his 13 year old daughter; she doesn't appear to go to school, and pretty much just runs around by herself with absolutely no supervision of any kind. Not long after that, after a porn party, which Gosling allowed his daughter to attend, again unsupervised, while he got drunk and did nothing remotely intelligent, I turned it off wondering why anyone would waste their time watching it. None of it actually made any sense whatsoever. Really pathetic.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A thrilling mix of slapstick comedy, action mayhem and '70s extravaganza, with lead characters who are completely devoid of any equanimity.","It is 1977 in Los Angeles. The music is funky, the sky is smog-ridden, corruption is rampant, and pornography is as thriving as the automotive industry. Private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star named Misty Mountains. The trail leads him looking for a missing Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), the daughter of the Chief Head Justice. Meanwhile, Amelia, who doesn't wish to be found, hires a burly enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to keep March out of her tail. As Amelia suddenly vanishes, the wild goose chase for her intensifies, and several parties of interest are thrown into the mix. Caught in the middle of a killing spree, Jackson and Holland, along with his persistent daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), are forced to team up as they uncover a shocking conspiracy linked with higher ranks of the government.Shane Black effectively hits the audience's spot by creating hilarious characters and putting them in awkward situations. The hapless nature of the duo adds to their likability. Jackson, and most definitely, Holland don't have the skillset of James Bond or Jason Bourne, making them stumble their way through each location and rely on dumb luck as coincidences turn into clues and mishaps turn into leads. The plot, however, could have used more editing, especially in the starting and closing parts where the story gets a bit shambolic. Indeed, The Nice Guys can be a confusing film that each found clue sends the plot to an entirely new direction, and events only start making sense toward the end. Black could have easily spun his film as a crime thriller, which would have served the general plot better. However, his intention here is not to make a point about government conspiracies; rather, he wants the audience to focus more on the comedic detours of the characters. For that reason, this film fares better as a comedy than a mystery.This film won't work without the fantastic chemistry and dynamic energy that we get from its leads. Jackson (Crowe) is the more rational and grounded guy, whereas Holland (Gosling) is the accident-prone, world's worst detective that holds them down. They don't strike as caricatures for there is a duality in their study; deep-down, these are damaged persons. Holland struggles in his profession and at the same time fails in responsible parenting, and Jackson is world-weary and exhausted of living an amoral life. Crowe does not play an upfront fancy character, but he deliver good comedic talents surprising for a first-timer in the comedy genre. Yes, his IMDb profile clearly states that Mr. Russell Crowe has not done comedy up until now. His stone-faced reactions to Holland's mishaps caps off the impact of each comedic scene. On the other hand, although we've recently seen Gosling's comedic chops in The Big Short, here, he sheds all his vanity and delivers an impeccable performance, from pained squeals to lost breath gags. His relationship with his thirteen year old daughter Holly is also an interesting study. Holly is well aware of her father's shortcomings but accepts him for who he is and acts as the self-appointed brains of the group. She is that rare kid who had to grow up fast but at the same time retain her pristine beliefs. Young actress Rice holds the heart of the film and deserves every right to be on the main poster with the two leads.The Nice Guys is gloriously violent yet still raucously funny. Mixing these two elements – violence and comedy – is a tricky task especially in a neo-noir setting (unless you're homeschooled by Quentin Tarantino). Black expertly directs classic action sequences (fistfights, shootouts, car chases, building drops) and stuffs them with a stream of verbal and physical gags to look adorably desperate. With a gaudy production that pays homage to the glitz and glamour of the '70s – hippie fashion, boogie music, vintage cars, and even lesbian mermaids (if that's, you know, your thing) –, this film is a lovely mess I can't wait to revisit. For once, I am not moaning over the idea of The Nicer Guys roaring down the freeway.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-nice-guys",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not your average detective movie,"1st I'm giving this movie an extra star for Russell Crowe gaining more weight than me in the last 5 years. Second, it's really good.

Love this cast,"The Nice Guys, a rollicking ride through 1970s Los Angeles, earns a groovy 7/10 in my cinematic jukebox-a salute to its uproarious humor and the dynamic duo of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. The film's strength lies in its razor-sharp wit and the impeccable chemistry between the mismatched detectives, bringing a refreshing twist to the buddy-cop genre. While the plot's complexity may verge on convoluted at times, the film's editing maintains a brisk pace that keeps the laughter flowing. The musical score, a funky blast from the past, complements the retro vibe with infectious beats. Cinematography captures the neon-soaked streets with a vibrant energy, transporting the audience to a bygone era. The Nice Guys, with its blend of slapstick humor, neo-noir aesthetics, and a dash of social commentary, emerges as a stylish and entertaining escapade that hits all the right notes.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Shane Black Remains the Master of Buddy Cop Comedies,"On a basic level The Nice Guys works like any buddy cop movie. Great action, well developed characters and a decent story to hold it altogether. But just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the real strength of The Nice Guys is how Shane Black is able to both mock the clichés in the action genre, many of which he helped to create in films like Lethal Weapon, whilst paying homage to all the action tropes that made the genre what it is today.Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer whose work mostly includes freelance work of beating up someone for whoever's willing to pay. He has considered becoming a licensed private investigator, as he wants to give real help to some clients, but he doesn't want to pay for the licence. He's a nice guy, but he's not that Nice. Then there's Ryan Gosling as Holland March, who is a licensed investigator and father to a thirteen year old girl. He spends most of his time accepting cases from old people with dementia paying him to find their recently deceased spouses, constantly screwing up and spending most of his time trying to drown himself in Bourbon. Even his daughter calls him a bad person.After one old lady with bad eyesight hires him to find her niece, who is a porn star who had recently died in a car crash. Thinking the job is easy money to just confirm the girl is dead, March takes the case. But he quickly discovers the girl could be alive. This causes him to cross paths with Healey, who is hired to burst in to March's home to threaten him and get him to drop the case. Before leaving he casually asks March a few questions about his life as a private investigator and how he's able to afford such a nice place on an investigators salary, before calmly breaking his wrist and leaving. It's a good tone setter for their relationship for the rest of the film.But Healey quickly realises the case was bigger than he thought it was and wanting to be a ""nice guy"" decides to work with March and solve the case. Very quickly they fall in to a case filled with 70's pornography and government conspiracies. It's part Boogie Nights, part Chinatown and all tied together with Shane Blacks tongue and cheek charm.Similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, one of the films greatest strengths comes from the charismatic leads of Crowe and Gosling as the mismatched duo investigating the case. Crowe delivers all his lines in a great deadpan style, whilst Gosling goes out of his usual element, giving up his usual macho man image in order to play a Buster Keaton style slapstick performance. Sometimes they seem like the smartest guys in the room, chasing obscure leads and coming up with good results. Then at other's they seem like a pair of idiots getting by on pure luck alone, such as one scene where Gosling accidentally stumbles down a hill and ends up discovering a dead body. They are both screw ups, but they screw up in such charming ways that we can't help but to continue rooting for them.The film is also able to avoid the annoying cliché used in films like War of the Worlds or Commando where the child ends up serving no role in the film other than being a victim and a plot device. Instead March's daughter is written with the same charm and depth as both March and Healey. Angourie Rice also pulls of a great performance working very well with all the other actors in the film.Shane Black both wrote and directed the film and he definitely plays to all of his greatest strengths through the films mixture of great comedic timing and sharp dialogue. He also works in all the clichés that you'd expect from his work, even managing to fit in one scene at the end randomly set at Christmas (since it just wouldn't be a Shane Black film without a little festivity). Ultimately it's a film that keeps you laughing throughout and by the end it leaves you wanting more.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
I think I am becoming impressed with mediocre movies,"I like to write reviews so I can go back and see what I thought of the movie, a little visit to past me. Lately I have noticed that I am giving high marks - a 7 for me is a decent movie maybe worth rewatching in the future.I definitely need to write down what I thought of this movie because it wasn't really worth remembering and I am sure I will forget. There was nothing really special about this buddy cop movie (or buddy detective whatever). Comparing it to ones I really like, like Lethal Weapon this one falls flat, but gets a 7 because its better than what goes for a 6 these days.It has it's entertaining moments, but found the villian was flat, the ending was meh. The only thing that really carried it was the backdrop (the 70's) and the Crowe and Gossling. That was about it.

Nice Surprise -- Go See It.,"I really enjoyed The Nice Guys. I think it's a solid hit with a miss of a title. That plus the lack of marketing kept a lot of people from seeing it -- Which is a shame, because this is one of the best of it's kind I've seen in a while. The leads were great. All the side characters had great parts. It was very funny, had plenty of action and character, clipped along at a decent pace and had an interesting plot -- although a little forced at the end. I'm considering watching it a second time because it had all kinds of small, subtle gems dropped in and I'm sure I missed some the first time.

The Funny Guys,"I was really excited about this movie. Wanted to watch this for a long time. I finally did. I was mostly dissapointed.I think that the first act of this movie is perhaps one of the funniest, funnest, most intruiging set up that a movie can get! This film had it going for it! There was a lot of anticipation to see gosling and Crowe work together. They built that up a lot. In a hilarious way. They built up the mystery a lot. It was exciting to see what happened.Unfortunately the hype didnt super live up to its name. The writing became so lazy and stupid after the first act. The story became a muddled, dragging mess. It felt so fake and overexxagerated cringe.Once again

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Lite,"The best way to describe this Shane Black film is to call it ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Lite."" It's dark and interesting in a completely quirky way but I found it to be less charming than KKBB. The dark humor is about the same and it often works quite well. Russell Crowe is exceptional and Gosling works well enough. They do have the chemistry required to pull off Shane Black material. The pleasant surprise was the daughter character. She added much needed heart and motivation for both leads to become somewhat better men.Overall enjoyable and I'm rounding my rating up based on expectations. I expected a truly great film and left the theatre somewhat unimpressed but that's my flaw so setting my sights so high and not a fault of the film itself.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Very surprised by this film, loved it","So I ended up watching this based off my brother saying it's pretty decent and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.The characters were really likeable and very well acted. The chemistry between them was very well done. I typically have issues with kids in films being annoying (war of the worlds springs to mind there), but I adored the kid ""Holly"" in this.
The small elements of humour added in I thought was a great touch and really did tickle me.
It's also a nice ending, no funny business by the director.My only negative thoughts about this film is that we didn't really get a good background on either Gosling's or Crowe's characters, kind of just jumped straight into it.
I also think the plot could have been slightly hard to follow in the first hour of the film. Due to the jumping into things approach.But overall it's a really good film and I enjoyed watching it. 8/10 from me, really worth giving it a go if you are considering watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just the right escapist fix,"""The Nice Guys"" had one of those trailers for the ages that you just know would yield a disappointing movie. No let-down here; I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a terrific mix of comedy, action, porn and Detroit gangsters. With less profanity and violence, this is something that'd work great on TV. But that'd be neutering it.It's a Shane Black movie in every respect - the end result of mixing ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and ""The Last Boy Scout"" - but that's also why it's so entertaining. It's his signature brand of dialog and brutality that make for a good time. But it's also the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both are good casting choices, but this is Gosling's show; he plays the hell out of a hapless loser, and more than a few laughs come from his spastic humor.The tone is spot-on, the plot has just the right twists, and this works beautifully as light and breezy Summer fare.And I haven't seen a soundtrack this good in a very long time.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I absolutely LOVE this movie!,"I'm gonna start off by saying 2 things:1. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because I don't wanna take the chance of spoiling such a great movie.2. I haven't laughed this hard since February of this year when I saw Deadpool.I was expecting The Nice Guys to be an action movie with some comedy mixed in, but in reality it was a comedy with some action mixed in.The movie is about 2 private eyes who end up working together to solve a case that they (unknowingly) are both working on. It takes place in the 70's in a time where private eyes can do pretty much whatever they want, and crime is running rampant. Their chemistry is great; they harass each other all the time, tell each other what they're doing wrong, and actually end up learning a thing or two from each other. (Their relationship is kinda like Murtaugh and Riggs' from Lethal Weapon)All in all, this movie is perfect in every way. It's violent, hilarious, old-school and JUST PLAIN FUN.

The Nice Guys is just not working the way they intended it to,"You begin watching ""The Nice Guys"" and even in the first few scenes, you realize that there's something very wrong with this movie. As you continue to watch, you quickly realize that the awkwardness that reeks from every scene is supposed to be humor. At some point, I was asking myself if this movie isn't some sort of social experiment. Like they purposely create a disgustingly bad comedy movie, surround it with hype through an interesting trailer and their shill army, and then carefully measure the generated income. But then I realized we are way past that point. These sort of experiments had to be proved a success long time ago because now we are getting a steady stream of low quality content that producers know is going to sell thanks to this modern way of marketing. Thus, the conclusion that must be drawn is even more disappointing. The conclusion is that the producers of this movie haven't made it as bad as it is deliberately, it's just that this is their potential.

"Neither comedy, neither drama","Well, first of all, i don't recommend this movie. The fact is: it is neither a comedy nor a drama. They picked a funny actor like Ryan to represent the comedy and a serious actor as Russel to represent the drama, and this is why neither me or any of my friends liked the movie. I think the history could become a really great drama, but they tried to make a funny movie with kids-humour, and it didn't work. We were at my place when i found this movie, a comedy with 7,4 rating, i got impressed and kind 'forced' my friends to watch it with me. At the end, everyone was staring me like 'wtf dude?'.

This one, The Nice Guys, is a good movie. What I liked most about it was watching three fine actors work.

"Miles Away From Rush Hour, But Good Enough","It was common to see The Nice Guys amongst the top of movie aficionados' lists of the best 2016 has to offer. I concur, it does nail enough good things to warrant a positive review. However, the film ultimately fails to live up to the hype.Kudos first and foremost, to Shane Black for his continuous desire to showcase buddy cop, comedy films that seemed from a bygone era. There is clear-cut entertainment value from the light hearted comedy & screwball storylines of these types & The Nice Guys is no different. Where it falls short is its chosen stars, unfortunately. Ryan Gosling for instance, was an absolute miscast. The screeching & idiotic character that often times is on the receiving end of slapstick comedy absolutely does not bode well for the actor, known for feisty roles. With Russell Crowe veering away from exerting any comedic energy (which could be a positive), certain jokes & ""funny"" sequences tend to fall absolutely flat. In comparison then, to past buddy duos like Chan & Tucker, The Nice Guys' chemistry is forgettable & lacks appeal. The film happily does make up for this flaw, with its production & costume design that brings to life the oozing energy & flavor the 70s. Fun soundtrack too!In its entirety, The Nice Guys is survived by its fresh buddy cop premise & timeline-rich set pieces that sets itself apart. If only its big named stars & Black's screenplay meshed, the film could have transcended being ""good enough"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Shane Black points his gun at the 70's and misfires,"""The Nice Guys"" is too self indulgent and arrogant to be loved. It's another example of how great screenwriters prove they are mediocre directors. Shane Black needed a Richard Donner or a Tony Scott to coral and police his scripts into something cinematic. Black appears way too in love with his own words, which is nauseating. Stylistically it looks great, but the tone flounders and fails.In regards to ""The Nice Guys"", there is a smugness that shines through from the movie's worst character, the 13-year-old daughter of Ryan Gosling. Don't recall the name, because I just don't care. There's nothing more annoying in a movie, than a child character filled with grown up characteristics. To me, that's lazy writing. Anybody can just slap some adult qualities into an underage character in hopes for a cheap laugh or for a ""look at how clever I am"" reaction. The character was unnecessary and distracted from what could've been something fun. Are we really supposed to believe that she's going to help them solve the mystery of a dead porn star? On paper, she was probably born in Shane Black's mind as ""A 'Nancy Drew' character who sits through a porn film with adults, while being the voice of reason with adults, while holding dying bad guys hands and telling them everything is going to be okay, and then thinking nothing of talking about anal sex and seeing dead bodies... and oh yeah, leaning against a wall, arms crossed with a smug smile on her face when she's got it all figured out."" She put the final nail in the coffin of this movie for me.Ryan Gosling is forced to act stupid, and every chance he tries to be funny, you feel every strain of his acting ability to sell what Shane Black has written, but it comes across as embarrassingly bad. When Gosling finds the body and he tries to scream for Russell Crowe's help... trying to be funny... it falls flat. When he wigs out and sees the talking killer bee... to seeing Nixon swimming... It all falls as flat and unfunny as the dead body they inexplicably throw over the fence. NOT FUNNY. Why did they dump the body in the first place? Why not call the cops? Oh, that's right, Black came up with the cheap gag of a dead body landing on a family outdoor dinner party, and then had to figure out a way to use that within the plot. A good trailer moment, perhaps was the intention, but it failed.Russell Crowe just looks sad in this movie. Is that really all he could bring to the table? His character looked as bored as Crowe probably was making the movie. His character had absolutely nothing memorable about him. He was no Martin Riggs or Joe Hallenbeck by a long stretch. Hell, I can't even remember a single line of dialogue he spoke, he was so forgettable.Finally and most off-putting about the entire movie, was the repeated inclusion of children and sexual situations. Some not so bad, some are cringe worthy and head shaking. Here's the list:A kid taking his father's dirty magazine. (That's fine, it happens) The kid walks up on the naked woman, which we clearly see the child actor standing over the naked adult actress. (Was that necessary?) A young 13-year-old girl buying pot and hanging around a creepy older guy, likely for sex. (At least this was handled better with Russell Crowe punching the guy in the face.) A young foulmouthed kid on a bike bragging about his ""big dick"" and offering to show it for money. (Is that necessary? It wasn't funny. It was as if Shane Black spent too much time watching ""Boogie Nights"" and tried to show an underage Dirk Diggler on a bike.) Then Gosling's daughter says ""Rim job"" which is of course the act of licking an anus. (Did we need to hear her say that? It wasn't that funny.) Now we have the girl watching a stag film around adults as if that's perfectly normal. She even mentions anal sex. REALLY???? (She would've shown more maturity if she looked away from the porn and was more like ""I don't think I should be watching this kind of thing yet, might give me the wrong idea."" That would've been not so cringe worthy.)All of this got me thinking, just what in the hell was Shane Black and his co-writer thinking when they wrote this? Did they really want to rely on children mixed with porn as a source of humor? Very strange territory, unless it's done in a more serious manner. Here, it's done as if there's nothing wrong with it and it's okay for kids to watch porn and talk about sex WITH ADULTS. In private, with their peers, that's one thing, but when you start crossing the line, things get uncomfortable and Black never rectifies this issue by the end. He was writing a 70's period piece but in the atmosphere of today's kids who are far too desensitized to sex, thanks to the internet. Had this been present day, it may have worked as an indictment of our current culture, but instead it comes across as Black using it for shocks and laughs without consequences.Shane Black spent way too much time enjoying large party set pieces and reveling in the 70's atmosphere, then creating memorable characters, and it shows. He struggled to sell the script for more than a decade and without a $1.2 billion blockbuster ""Iron Man 3"" under his belt, he never would have have sold it.

Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling's chemistry on screen made the film stand out from other buddy cop movies. Their quick wit and love hate relationship worked well on screen, creating some very funny moments.The film is at it's best when these 2 are on screen together, they keep the film flowing and the dialogue written is perfect for the character's created. The story itself turned out to be better than i expected, the trailers really didn't give away the main plot points.Although Gosling and Crowe gave brilliant performances, Angourie Rice stole the scenes she was in and for such a young actress she gave a funny and multi layered performance. She provided a lot of comic relief and, unlike most child characters, she served a valuable purpose in the film, which again is a credit to the writer.The only criticism of the film would be that the plot can sometimes get confusing and requires you to be concentrating at all times. i would defiantly say the first half of the film is better than the second, however both are very entertaining. Overall, it is a solid buddy cop movie and shows there still is life for the genera",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nice Nice, Bang Bang","Shane Black's success with Iron Man 3 resurrected this old concept from the era of Kiss Kiss and it is essentially a thematic retread of that film but far broader. It's a bit less aloof and the charismatic wrong-footedness really works here and prevents some of the cheesier sequences from being offensively heavy-handed. Gosling and Crowe make a likeable duo and it rattles along at a fine pace. Even re-watching it now I'm still reminded of the cinema I saw it back in 2016 being besides themselves at the sheer unpredictable joy of it all. It's a shame it didn't do better and we won't see more of them, but it still exists, and that's something!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
two not so nice guys in a not so nice city,"'The Nice Guys' (2016) is one of the few directorial experiences of Shane Black, best known as the screenwriter of some of the most successful films and especially action comedies of Hollywood in the last 36 years. And here he is the co-author of the script, so we can assume that we owe a lot of it to him for the quick pace, the situations and verbal comedy well combined with the story and the introducing of yet another couple of heroes of the genre that we are likely to meet in upcoming movies.Jackson Healy and Holland March are two flawed detectives in a polluted city. The city is Los Angeles, the year is 1977, and the metropolis is air-polluted (LA's smog was world-famous, with news bulletins some days recommending avoiding outdoor activities before 6 p.m.) and culturally polluted by the invasion of pornography which threatens to spread over Hollywood as well. Healy deals with protecting young women and girls by any means (meaning ANY means), and March with dubious investigations, including the search for either a husband whose funeral urn is on the shelf or a porn star whose death has been announced two days before. But if wifey or auntie pay well, why not? March is also an alcoholic and seems depressed following the death of his wife a year ago, a death for which he feels guilty. His luck is Holly, his 13-year-old teenage daughter, beautiful and intelligent enough to compensate for the father's clouded mind. The two detectives clash (including a broken bone) at first, but later they make a great pair, actually a trio if you count Holly, investigating the disappearance of a girl involved in the making of the dead star's latest film. Before long hitmen, the Department of Justice, the pornography and polluting automobile industries will be on a rampage to thwart the investigation and eliminate the detectives.The story seems quite complicated, but Shane Black knows how to write a plot well where everything that happens is improbable and still seems logical to watch. The two main characters get along wonderfully after they clear up their initial misunderstandings and have the important quality to fall on their feet from any height. The stunt people list is twice as long as the actors list, and I think that says a lot. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are two actors who each can carry a movie. Together they make a wonderful pair and the 'chemistry' between them seems perfect, a fact also proven by some dialogues that seem improvised and are among the funniest. The real star of the film, however, is Angourie Rice, another very beautiful and very talented actress coming to Hollywood from Australia. She was 15 years old when she filmed 'The Nice Guys' and played the role of a 13-year-old girl. I hope that her future career will live up to the potential shown in this film. Kim Basinger also appears in the film, in a sort of opposite role to what she has done in other LA gangster movies. The music takes us back to the atmosphere of the 70s, although some compositions are original. Shane Black turns out to be an excellent director as well, and I don't know if I prefer him to use his time in the future to write scripts or direct movies. I seldom wish for a movie to have a sequel but this is the case with 'The Nice Guys'.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best buddy movies,"Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling made me laugh a lot, even with high expectations this movie was amazing. The characters are all unforgettable, and some of the best-timed comedy bits I've seen in a while. Ryans's character is constantly falling from dangerous spots and getting out without a single scratch, Yet it makes you laugh and smile all the time. His character even says he might be invincible the way he keeps surviving. The young actresses are talented as very few can translate to adult comedy well as they have.

Fun popcorn movie,"The Nice Guys has a lot going for it: big names, decent acting, lovely sets, a reasonable script, and a semi-compelling plot. However, it's not a film to take too seriously. The story line is shallow, and it occasionally veers into the ridiculous.There's a decent amount of action and everything moves along at a healthy pace. You probably won't get bored watching it, and it has an ending that'll leave you smiling, but it's not a film I'll remember a week after watching it.Overall, it adds up to feeling a bit formulaic.

The Nice Guys,"Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a largely incompetent private detective, hired by porn actress Misty Mountains' aunt to find her, claiming to have seen her after her confirmed death. His enquiries lead him to Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), who, frightened, hires tough guy Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to scare March off. When Healy finds out that Amelia is herself in danger he teams up with March to find her, assisted and hampered by March's lively young daughter Holly (Angourie Rice).Hysterical seventies set comedy thriller with all the glorious clothes and disco music you could ask for. Mixing slapstick, black as pitch humour and razor sharp one liners, this is a joy from beginning to end. The strength of the film though is the actors and their wonderfully realised characters. Gosling (hilarious) is perfectly suited as the lovable idiot to double up with street wise and ruthless straight man Crowe and they make for a great double act. They are admirably supported by young Rice taking on a big and tricky role and new comer and now up and coming superstar Qualley, is also excellent. The film was not the success hoped for and we all missed out on a sequel which I for one would have loved to see. Immense fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

G. when it comes to the modern buddy (cop) movie: Shane Black, who made his first splash with Lethal Weapon. (If you want another overlooked gem like this film, check out Kiss Kiss Bang Bang btw with Val Kilmer and Robert Downey jr !)The films protagonists have edges and flaws.

Moves at real pace - is slick - maybe too slick for it's boots. But that's spoof 4 U,"It was good. Moved at real pace. Plenty of slick Cinematography,Edits,Jokes,Tricks and Homage. At times there is the issue of ""comedy"" ultra-violence. The jokes and prat-falls are there, so Scene X, Y or Z must be funny - surely? But sometimes it doesn't lock those concepts together so well and I am not a sensitive snowflake. This is entertainment and takes its clue from Bond, Red or even Tarantino. At times though, it really was just too smart about itself - and was a whisker away from being embarrassingly self-aware and trite. The saviour is that Gosling & Crowe are confirmed visual magnets, so it would be tough to create a mutt out of that pairing. As someone else said, the young girl as Gosling's daughter is a superb talent for such a young actor. I'd like to see Gosling and Crowe in a different, serious, pairing - but that's unlikely now.

The Comedy Duo of the Year is...Crowe and Gosling?,"In the late 1900s, there was a very particular genre of film that had a ubiquitous presence at cinemas and the box office: the good-ole fashioned action-buddy-comedy. From 48 Hours to Rush Hour, it's a mindlessly entertaining genre, known as much for its cozy saxophone scores and cheesy emotions as for its ridiculous explosions and fun patter. The Nice Guys mixes these familiar feels with the gloss of a (less-layered and more accessible) Coen Bros film, giving us a seedy and comfortably familiar noir-caper, full of big characters and bigger laughs. Through a series of chance meetings and unlikely alliances, two men barely on the right side of the law in 1970s L.A. join forces to try to locate and protect a young woman. While tonally the film is very 80s, the 70s L.A. setting perfectly shines with grimy detail. Crowe and Gosling, donned in loud suits and ill-advised facial hair, fall right into place. Both of them are super-funny and clearly enjoying themselves, eating up scenes filled with more character than you can shake a pimp's stick at, and getting to play with dialogue worth dying for. That brainy banter is a large part of director/write Black's signature style. With only 3 directing credits to his name (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3), his fearless confidence with his characters and scripts is admirable in our increasingly play-it-safe action-movie world. The Nice Guys is pure and simple fun that deserves to be supported if for no other reason than to get to see these three dudes team up for more hilarious misadventures in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overlooked!?!,"The Nice Guys is written and directed by Shane Black. It follows an unlikely pair of private eyes investigating a missing girl and the mysterious death of a porn star. This film is obviously Shane Black's love letter to 1970's Hollywood. From the cinematography, the music, and the production design, everything feels like it's accurately depicting its setting. The chemistry between the actors on screen can't go unnoticed as Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe were perfect here with their impeccable comedic timing and delivery. Angourie Rice - as the daughter of Gosling's character - is amazing. She manages to keep up with Crowe and Gosling in the film, being just as funny. On top of that, the writing is very clever and raw which is what's needed for this type of movie.

Everything you never wanted in a character piece.,"On paper this film would appear as middling and unimpressive as the CV of a middle-aged company-man reeling from redundancy. Desperate, predictable and rife with so many buzzwords that HR's spide.y-senses would tingle - eagerly anticipating an opportunity to snuff-out yet another pathetic attempt. 'I'm sorry, Mr. Doe, but unfortunately you were not considered for the position.'That presumption was wrong - in fact, it couldn't be further from the truth.Enter the middle-aged bruiser; stubble unkempt; dress - functional and straight off the rack; imposing. Short on time and patience - he doesn't get paid by the word. Surely he's inaccessible, you posturi.ze? Long uninterrupted monologues provide momentary glimpses into the 'inner- workings' of the veteran. By the end it's clear that all symptoms have dissipated, Doctor - the emotional constipation has passed. A man of action; of professionalism; he's the guy you want to be. Russell Crowe's physical attributes, his rasp and his charm sell, sell, sell on this one.The yin.g to this yang: a young, good-looking, well-put-together slick-ster; fast-talking, confident and full of good intentions. It helps to be witty when you couldn't fight your way out of a wet paper bag - he often succeeds in-spite of himself. He will always give it the old college try and somehow it works. There's being lucky and then there's being Holland March. He's lovable and totally flawed; he's the guy you can relate to. I don't have time to even mention his child prodigy - and what a performance.Both work in people - one person, in particular, puts them on a collision course of confrontation, collaboration and eventual conspir.ation. A mutual ruthless entrepreneur-ialism brings them together - money talks, after-all; a unwavering moral compass binds them. They bounce off each other so naturally and with such comedic success that it's easy to buy-in - effortless even. OK, so you get it - it's the unlikely friendship that results in a win. Not quite. The film perfectly paints a picture of transition. The team that can't seem to catch a break ends up being the only two people you'd consider capable of doing the job - in fact every main character reaches their own personal summit in the end. It's satisfying. The plot escalates onwards and upwards and without my consent - these sudden points of inflection, a literal moment of turning on one's heels, keeps the plot's focus in a constant state of flux. It scraps the 'beginning-middle-end' formula in large part by making the scenes timeline feel continuous - I sat down and BANG... Roll credits. Now that's engagement, folks.Frantic; from the outset the pace is awe-inspiring. Every single inch of screen real-estate is utilized, as is character airtime; witticisms and one- liners feel necessary; cuts and transitions have purpose; foreshadowing is constant and, ultimately, all of the above feature solely in aid of the narrative through-line that will keep you on your toes. There's no excess fat to trim. Is this how a buddy-cop tribute, set in a 70's L.A manages to feel fresh? I think so. *CLIFF HANGER* Quick cut. Cue: Curious funky bass- line. Scoring infallible. Any film set 50 years ago is at risk of hanging it's hat on prevailing modernist perspectives of the past - not in this case. Nixon, Earth Wind and Fire, porno-staches and bell-bottoms make cameos, but it happens so naturally and feels so credible that the fourth wall comes off unscathed. If you could put this film in a time-capsule and watch it 20 years from now, or even 20 years removed, I feel it would still work - this one will age very well indeed. Even the 'action' feels sincere - the 'Jason Bourne' effect is thankfully absent and yet the sense of realistic physicality rings just as true when such moments are called upon. Nothing in this film feels heavy-handed once you accept that the premise itself - and the premise alone - is a dime a dozen. Hey, Hollywood - this is what tip-top writing and execution can get you. Go figure!To summarize: this movie manages to flip the script on an old classic. The cobwebs weren't blown out, they were vanquished. Maybe I'm a mark, but when the lights came on and I looked around the theater my immediate feelings were ratified - I wasn't the only one smiling from ear to ear. I will give you my money - right now - now give me a sequel. Don't label this a 'love- letter'. I'm hip, man - consider it an exercise in purely self-indulgent hyperbole. And remember: 'For the birds'.Peace + Plants, JR.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Two Detectives, One Mystery, and a Whole Lot of Laughs","This movie is about two detectives who misunderstand each other by their cases and join hands when they realise both are interlinked. The story covers their journey to find a missing girl, Amelia, and her motive. The movie is presented in the comedic action genre.The movie is set well for a R-rated comedy movie by the satire of actions and situations in which both detectives get involved. Even though the story was cliched and predictable, the way the film was presented made it enjoyable. The subplots, like the detective Holland March seen as a loser by her daughter, and he proves himself, and Detective Healy changes to be kind rather than being a thug who thrashes anyone for the pay. The humour scenes were written well even by the performers, in investigation, stupidity, etc. It was amazing and hilarious, mostly.Acting-wise, Ryan Joshling did a great job, as I am seeing him in a fun role in movies (except Barbie). Russell Crowe was also good, as I am seeing in the comical role genre for the first time. Other actors were good too. The cinematography and composition were good as usual. The music was decent.

Hell yeah,"The Nice Guys is a torrential downpour of laughs, prat falls and lovable idiocracy, a formula which director Shane Black perfected with his super underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. This one is no doubt it's sister film, and while it has comedy in spades, top tier performances all round and luscious 1970's production design, it's just a we bit under- plotted. Having said that, that's my one and only complaint about it. It's the funniest film of the year by far, thanks to the rough and tumble pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Crowe is Jackson Healy, a mopey hired thug who will put the hurt on anyone if the dollar is right. This occupation has him cross the path of Holland March (Gosling) an ex cop PI who, according to his daughter (Angourie Rice), is the world's worst detective. He's certainly a buffoon, a trait which forms one half of their comedic shtick, the other being Healy's laid back exasperation every time March gets them into trouble, which is pretty much throughout the entire film. The two of them unwittingly stumble into a dangerous turn events involving the justice department, murder, the apparent suicide of a porn star (Margaret Qualley), a very scary assassi (Matt Bomer) and one angry goon played by an afro'd out Keith David. It's tough to make heads or tails of what's really going on, but like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang it's not about the plot or the outcome, it's more about watching the characters trip over each other in style as they get there. Crowe is terrific, a bear of a dude who's in way over both his head, IQ and pay grade, aghast at Gosling's antics at every turn. Gosling's character belongs to that special class of stupid that is so clumsy that he circumnavigates his own ineptitude and ends up falling right into clues, without a clue how he got there. After a string of recent stoic introvert roles, he's the most animated character of the film and is clearly having a ball. None of what the duo do would be possible without March's precocious 13 year old daughter, played with uncanny ability by Rice, whose star is going to be solidly on the rise, I'd wager. A reunion of sorts occurs with the arrival of Kim Basinger as the head of the justice department, joining Crowe again after their work in L.A. Confidential. Basinger isn't given much to do ultimately, but her presence is a welcome addition to the vibe. Black deserves kudos for his gorgeous recreation of L.A. in the 70's, right down to the sickening lampshades pastel suits and souped up cars it's a treat to see. The energy from Crowe and Gosling is where it's at with this one, and they both eagerly tuck in to the dialogue, making this one groovy, delirious riot of a flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Noir comedy with ups and downs.,"The first scene of the film will tell you all you need to know about the feel of it all: a kid sneaks in his parents' bedroom to get a porno mag, opens to the centerfold, sees ""Misty Mountains"" and while he smiles a car goes right through his house, killing its occupant, none other than Misty Mountains. You know it's going to be a comedy and you know it's going to be dark.The rest of the movie is carried by Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Truly, with less talented cast the film would have been a funny but failed story, and this shows most painfully towards the end of the movie, when everything goes over the top and ridiculous.That doesn't mean the film is not entertaining and, as I said, the acting was great. The script was original and some of the scenes funny as hell. It's just inconsistent, going from great ideas and scenes to ridiculous and pointless ones.You know what it reminded me of? That video camera commercial where a guy is changing the battery while a car spins out of control, hits an exploding gas station and lands in a hotel and he didn't get anything on tape.

Shane Black kicks back to his signature style with flair and reverence.,"In the era of disco and cheesy moustaches, enforcer Jackson Healy (Crowe) teams up with detective Holland March (Gosling) to track down a young woman last seen acting in a porn film. As the hilariously uncompromising duo gets closer to finding their target, they accidentally stumble upon a much larger conspiracy...If you enjoyed ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", then you should feel right at home with this mystery-comedy directed and co-written by Shane Black. The film is bolstered by a tightly-knit script as well as strong performances from most, if not all, of the cast. The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is explosive; not only is the duo's comedic timing on point, but both serve as strong foils to each other's personalities. A genuine connection can be felt in their relationship throughout the film.Another actor who deserves a special mention is 15-year-old Angourie Rice (who plays Holland's quick-witted and observant daughter). In my eyes, she is the true star of this film. Rice not only infuses her character with a rich energy that few child actors possess but also has no problems keeping up with her enormously talented co-stars. There is not a single scene where she gives a weak performance – Rice was by far the best casting choice Black and his team could have made for the role of Holly March.The production design, costume design, and cinematography also deserve a special mention. The film is so seventies in the way it is designed and lit, it actually feels like it was made in the seventies. The filmmakers also hid plenty of little nods toward the culture and political climate of that period throughout the film (which makes a second viewing all the more fun). Additionally, the film's musical selections and soundtrack will have you settled in immediately.At its core, ""The Nice Guys"" is a genuinely funny and sometimes shocking film. It features a convoluted story that's big on laughs, heartfelt redemption, and flashy action scenes. Realistically speaking, the only problem that I have with this film (and see others having) is exactly that: the film's convoluted and seemingly senseless plot. Nevertheless, for those looking to get away from this month's stale slate of sequels and adaptations, but still want to see something entertaining and well-made, this is the film for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Endlessly charming and free-flowingly hilarious,"The Nice Guys begins with the killer bass-line of ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"" and some 1970s attention grabbing neon font, and just like that I arrived in 1977 in my time machine. The film hearkens back to the heyday of bubby movies of the 80s, the celebrated world of porn stars and the crime noir of the 70s. All these is given neo-twist of a fresh lemon slice and wala... out comes a new concoction that I gleefully drank non-stop for 2 hours.The story is not really as important as the ride. It is merely about an enforcer (Russell Crowe) and the world's lousiest private investigator (Ryan Gosling) joining forces to look for a girl named Amelia. Along the way they will encounter goons, a hired killer, Pocahontas, a human fly and strippers dressed as mermaids in a world of government conspiracy. I only managed to glean the story much later on and was befuddled for the first two-thirds of the movie, but that never took away any joy, not one single bit. I found myself laughing out loud at the hilarious antics of these intensely lovable pricks. Writer-director Shane Black gets the ""anything goes"" tone and the 70s vibe just right and deftly balances the gravity of the story and the hilarity of the situations. How I know? I found myself laughing at sequences of gratuitous bloodletting as boorish people die on screen. That is not an easy feat to achieve.Even though the film is far from perfect, the snappy dialogue crackles with such vibrancy that it smooths out the uneven passages. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling makes a superb pairing for an odd couple and both of them dial down their gravitas to serve the story. They also have the help of Gosling's daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice) to neatly get them out of plenty of troublesome situations. What a threesome they make!Endlessly charming and free-flowingly hilarious, you would want to hire these not so nice guys for a missing person case and watch the ensuing havoc with a beer in your hand.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A decent laugh,"This was not a bad film, Crowe and Gosling make an unlikely and charismatic duo. The supporting cast does well, especially Gosling's daughter who holds her own against the two stars.Criticisms are the confusion around the story and murder. The plot has a few holes and doesn't flow so well. Your still piecing together what actually happened and why. When you do get some sort of picture it doesn't really make sense.This film's strong points are its comedy and delivery. It excels with its funny moments and the two male leads have great personalities that work well together. Overall not a bad flick, I'd recommend it for a laugh but don't have high expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid B+,"It's a fun 70's romp. I almost wish it would have spent a little more time showcasing the 70's (much in the way Zodiac 2007 did), because that is the film's biggest strength next to Crowe and Gosling. There's a few head scratching moments and the movie falters logically in a few places, but overall a fun film with good chemistry between most of the characters. Disappointing to have Keith David cast in a prominent role, but given almost nothing to say. Give the guy at least a few good lines to showcase his voice. Russell Crowe is distractingly overweight. I can see his character as being a bit pudgy, but there are some shots in this movie where you fear for his health. This review is a bit focused on the negative, which it shouldn't be. Good performances, overall good writing, fun movie.Spoiler: There is an interesting moment in this movie where the character delivers a monologue gradually directly into the camera basically saying that the Detroit automakers do not want you to see this movie because it exposes the truth about pollution, and there is a comical moment referencing electric cars and other hints here and there regarding oil, cars, etc.. The film seemed to want to convey a subtle message about the future (our present) regarding pollution, transportation, and fossil fuels.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty dang enjoyable,"This film was made really well with it having a interesting plot, with easy to follow and well developed characters. The scenery changes all the time, there is really funny bits, real serious bits and a mix and mash of weird moments and action scenes which makes this a very fun and easy to watch film. Ryan gosling did great with his role being a super funny clumsy usual character that is sweet at heart. His partner played by russel crowe I honestly didn't like at all. Russells character is a ass to begin with and the directors try to make him redeemable but at the end he is still a murderer, he lies and is a arrogant piece of work. Didn't like him throughout the whole movie which is the only bummer. Overall a pretty decent film that has a bit of everything to keep your interest. 7.5/10 for me, I'd highly reccomend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Nice GuysIf it weren't for bad fathers there wouldn't be any porn stars in the world today.Thankfully, there are no shortages of either in this buddy-comedy.When an adult film actress (Margaret Qualley) disappears, a gruff enforcer (Russell Crowe) is forced to work with a PI (Ryan Gosling) and his daughter (Angourie Rice) in order to find her - and to dissuade a dangerous third-party.But when her latest project turns out to be an X-rated expose on the car industry's exhaust inhibitor cover-up, the motley detectives find themselves searching for her misplaced stag film at the 1977 L.A. Auto Show.With all of the sleaze of 1970s pulp cinema and the witty banter and odd couple camaraderie of classic comedic duos, Gosling and Crowe forge a unique bromance through a sharp script and apt directing.Furthermore, porn shoots make the best crime scenes on account they're covered in DNA evidence.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's Shane Black back alright.,"Shane Black has been a name in Hollywood I have always taking great pleasure of seeing in the credits. Creating characters such as Riggs and Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. This man invented the buddy cop movie and unlikely friendships with The Nice Guys being yet, another fine example.If there's one thing Shane Black is great at creating, it's those interesting alliances that are formed from equally interesting and awkwardly different characters each presenting counter ideals or attitudes. It's watching an almost mutual hatred for one other slowly turning into trust and tolerance.Gosling's P.I. Holland March seems to be very much influenced by Jimmy Rockford from the Rockford Files by taking cold cases, avoiding conflicts and charges the same fee of $200 per day. Not shy to drinking and seems to marauder around with a careless yet cowardly way of life.Now Crowe's Jackson Healy is of the heavy handed, brass-knuckle kinda guy, who's not afraid of conflict and isn't shy of hurting people. However, he bares a moral code and there's something quite honourable about the guy. Wanting to do the good thing but capable of doing the other, he has a sense of heroism.Basically the two of them are the good bad guys, or the bad good guys depending on which way you look at it. It's creates a great relationship for comical situations where the duo somehow compliment each other. It's not a case brains and brawn, but more so stupid blind luck and haphazard accidents with some clever scripting.Who does accompanying the cast and inappropriately so is Angourie Rice's character Holly March. Holland's inquisitive and and actual helpful daughter. She pretty much saves the day.Set in the seventies it has a neon disco haze everywhere it goes and the cleverly shot in a yesterday's L.A. Which is still very much recognisable. There's a good soundtrack but a lack of it and it's fairly unnoticeable score is really quiet compared to his score for X-Men: Apocalypse.It's shocking and borderline controversial with some great comedy. It's unpredictable but wouldn't say it's original. Different maybe but there's a strong fragrance of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in the air which isn't a bad thing as that film was brilliant and this film is a stand alone great.It's funny and entertaining, doesn't lose pace and the chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is superb. However, as much as I did enjoy it, it wasn't as funny as some parts should have been and there isn't anything majorly outstanding about it but having said that, I would welcome seeing the two investigate some more but maybe speed it up to be set in the eighties?Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 5 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 5 points for Gosling and 5 for Crowe, just can't seem to award one without the other.82% 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The ""Not So"" Nice Guys","A mismatched pair of private eyes investigates the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.The Nice Guys reunites director and co-writer Shane Black and producer Joel Silver, who have previously given us the Lethal Weapon movies, The Last Boy Scout, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - among others. Where Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans or Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer have gone before, now we have the sublime pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.Before our emotionally liberate 21st-century world invented the idea of the ""bromance"", we had the buddy comedy and the first reference that come to my mind is Roger Moore and Tony Curtis in The Persuaders on television. This film is an arch return to this tradition. Not unlike Deadpool, this is a rare American Studio movie willing to acknowledge the stupidity of mindless action with cathartic elements. The complex plotting bears a close resemblance to Inherent Vice in its dirty arrangement of events in which the main characters generally seem lost in the fog of their own pursuits.Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are funnier than ever in this buddy movie about crime investigation. Though at the end of the third act, it sometimes shifts into more straightforward procedural details that lack the same spark as its stars. Still there's no doubting the appeal of these two bumbling entities. The Nice Guys delivers brilliant physical comedy, null the actor's ability to turn their screen presence into a punchline. In this movie, everyone is trolling everyone else. Ryan Gosling, among his many talents, has blossomed into an inspired physical comedian. While what's fun about watching Russel Crowe is that he treats the savagery of his job as casually as if he were filling out a tax form. Indeed, they are a brilliant pairing and fit like a glove. So well in fact that you will wonder why it didn't happen sooner. It's a Hollywood buddy pairing that leaves you wanting more - a sequel, if it happens, would be justified and welcome.This movie is likely to score big with audiences, and for the same reason that it's proved to be a perfect fit. It's a treat to see popcorn movies this decadent made by people who know exactly what they're doing. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography gives L.A. a night bloom glow but not so much of a period authenticity, unfortunately. Finally, the hotel elevator scene, when the heroes duck back into the elevator with a ""we don't need this"" shrug. The timing of the gag is exquisite because it's Black's way of expressing what it feels like when whenever you're expecting is almost certain to turn out worse.Overall, The Nice Guys is a cynical movie but yet more or less sympathetic. An innocent pleasure that you can just let slide.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Worst Movie I've seen in years and I LOVE these guys!,"The trailer alone sold me; Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling playing goofball 1970's detectives? I'm in! I should have stayed out. This is only the second movie in like 20 years that I've wanted to walk out on but we had friends present and I didn't want to make a scene (turns out they would have left with me). Ten minutes into this movie will tell you that this in not screwball comedy, it isn't a detective thriller and it isn't a throwback look at the crazy 70's. It could have been any of the three and been successful but the writer(s) couldn't make up their minds which way to go and you're left in a painful limbo where (1) the movie isn't funny (2) there's no suspenseful plot like a real detective movie and (3) you suddenly remember you taped several far more interesting things at home. The writing shows signs of being done by several different people who weren't talking to each other and wrote at different times. Such a shame.....the acting was actually pretty good.

Simply Outstanding,"One of the best films I've seen in years; the plot and script are highly original and consistently hilarious. Shane Black knocks this out of the park, and while it is definitely an homage to movies of the 80's, it feels so refreshing in the modern day. The film has incredible acting all around. Gosling and Crowe, as unexpected a pairing as Gibson and Glover at the time, have incredible chemistry and sell the movie and their relationship to a tee. Bomer is great as well, but possibly better than all of them is Holly, Gosling's daughter in the film, who for my money is a star. The dialogue is perfect, great cinematography, beautiful sets...

"Sexy, violent and funny","I seem to have spent a large part of the last few years devouring late 60s and 70s cult, exploitation and giallo and finding the cinema of today less and less appealing. Generally speaking it is the current trend towards aiming movie product at young teens that seems to have created the giant gap. To compound the problem, for me, so called 'adult' films seem to have to be 'serious' films and dealing with certain 'important issues'. All well and good but I can't be alone in wanting a little action without apology and humour without worrying if someone might get upset. So, much the same way as I have enjoyed box sets of TV shows like Life On Mars and Ashes To Ashes, I very much enjoyed this. The magic devise adopted by the TV production company was to set the series in the past and thereby get round the whole politically correct business and this film set in 1977 Los Angeles does the same. Russell Crowe is fine as the ruthless, almost humourless hard man and Ryan Gosling particularly effective as his 'partner'. Amazingly for a US film the kids are great and Angourie Rice a revelation. She didn't put a fourteen year old foot wrong and helped enormously in making this retro comic neo noir work so well. Sexy, violent and funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Kiss Bang Again,"It makes complete sense that the man who created LETHAL WEAPON, in further doing his Quentin Tarantino spin on the ""two polar opposites teaming up"" that worked in his KISS KISS BANG BANG, would fall into the hands of the action-packed finale liken more to his own (old) thing than Tarantino's. And by the time these NICE GUYS try to groove, they're already nearing the end...One that can be seen a mile away. The formidable bad guy is named in the previous scene and, all along, there's a little pre-teen girl who you just know will wind up in danger.And she's more than a tagalong: The kid belongs to Ryan Gosling's Holland March, who, as a Private Investigator, could give Wile E. Coyote a run, or rather, fall for his money while a brooding, menacing Russell Crowe, as a guy hired to beat people to a bloody vengeful PULP named Jackson Healy, tries to keep the vehicle on an even-keel...Unfortunately, after a pretty funny and breezy first act, getting to know the quirks and smirks of both Alpha and Beta Males before and right-when they team up, there's only an investigation that, in a neo-lit Film Noir Gumshoe Fashion, leads to plenty of name-dropping handoffs while trying to find one important name in particular: a missing young lady mixed up in the porn business (which actually sounds more like THE BIG LEBOWSKI than anything by Tarantino, which fits since Quentin was originally inspired by The Coens).There's a moment when Gosling says he's too tired to drive. Summing things up because nothing much is happening, and there should be. Yet the story petered out miles back, and the characters kind of gave up...Especially Crowe who, either resembling an overweight version of himself or a thinner John Goodman, really had potential to make everything work since Gosling, while a capable actor, just doesn't have comedic timing to pull of the necessary ""relief"" throughout all the serious bloodshed....And it's not that these GUYS don't share a few excellent moments, and the movie does bring you back into the 1970's without trying too hard, or unveiling too much pop culture trivia. But Shane Black caters to the mainstream action template instead of keeping things tight and unpredictable all the way through. But if more LETHAL than FICTION is how you prefer your buddy crime flicks - guess this'll do.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ryan Gosling was at the top of his game as a cowardly dead beat yet clever PI, and Crowe shines as a charming thug. The backdrop of the 70s porn scene works so well with the movie since it gives us something even more sleazy than the main characters themselves.

THE NICE GUYS Deserves a Lot More Love,"The most overlooked, underrated movie from 2016 was, without a doubt, THE NICE GUYS. I saw it in theaters on the weekend after it opened in a small theater with no more than a dozen people total. The box office numbers for THE NICE GUYS were depressingly low, being siphoned away to the swarm of big budget blockbusters that, let's face it, weren't all that impressive that summer. I treated myself to a double feature that afternoon, starting with the latest X-MEN and closing out with THE NICE GUYS. Needless to say, Shane Black's retro detective buddy comedy was the far superior film and I just wish more people had given it the attention it deserved. We've got superhero movies hitting us from every direction; we've rebooting reboots; we're regurgitating old properties and turning toy brands into franchises. So when an amazing, original movie like THE NICE GUYS comes along we need to pay attention and give it the love it deserves. Why are we wasting theater space on yet another tired TRANSFORMERS installment but my chances of getting another round with March and Healy are low-to-none? I think the only, and I mean only, mistake this movie made was being released in May at the start of the summer movie season. If the studios have played it smart and released it in the winter when audiences aren't bombarded with two and a half hour CG explosions, this movie might've gotten the love it deserved. Because this movie is awesome.It's set in the '70s Los Angeles in the midst of the national gas crisis. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a sleazy private detective who finds himself teaming with the more honorable hired muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) in getting to the bottom of a mystery revolving around a missing girl and a dead porn actress. THE NICE GUYS is equal parts action and comedy, with Gosling and Crowe giving what are probably my favorite performances from two actors I don't generally associate with comedy. March is an alcoholic who's still reeling from the death of his wife. He's raising his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) alone and makes a living pursuing the sort of cases that might involve ripping off old ladies for on-going payments. Healy is a loner, living above a club with only his aquarium for company, who'll put the hurting on troublemakers for the right amount of cash. The two cross paths when Healy is hired to ""send a message"" to March to stop trailing a frightened young girl named Amelia (she's a person of interest in March's case). Soon Amelia goes missing and a couple of thugs (including Keith David because, as I mentioned, this movie is awesome) come terrorizing Healy in search of her; Healy recognizes there's someone with more sinister intentions pursing this girl and he turns to March for help in locating her. March reluctantly agrees and we're off on one of the best buddy action/comedies in decades from the writer of LETHAL WEAPON.The writing is sharp. The laughs are consistent. The action is brutal. THE NICE GUYS succeeds on every level. I would've never pegged Gosling or Crowe for these sort of semi-comedic roles but they nail it. I want to see a sequel with March and Healy on their first official case as a professional investigation duo, with Holly tagging along despite the mens' warnings in sort of a ""Penny in Inspector Gadget"" role. Holly is precocious for her age and acts as March's unofficial partner, meaning she's the sober one and keeps him on track. Angourie Rice keeps pace with the heavier hitters of the film and never falls into the pitfall of being ""the annoying child actor"" who ruins an otherwise fantastic movie. She's just as vital a team member. The conspiracy uncovered by the trio is complex without being convoluted and it makes for an interesting story built around the legitimate gas crisis the United States encountered in the era. It's a fun period piece from a fun period. We don't get enough period pieces from the '60s or '70s anymore so I love it when one comes along and, even better, when it's done well. THE NICE GUYS has everything you could want and I don't want to spoil much of anything so I'm trying to be sparse with the details, but I really encourage you to check this movie out if you haven't. By the end, I imagine you'll be aching for another go with the Nice Guys P.I.s as much as I am.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very disappointing,"The trailer was so much better than the film. Incoherent plot, mumbling dialogue from Ryan Gosling and barely there acting from Russell Crowe.

Stay away from this junk and look for a movie with some acting, a plot, and actors who care about the movie they are in. The actress who plays Ryan Goslings daughter ( Angourie Rice) stole the whole show. Watch out for her in future, she is going to be a star. I guess I am getting old and jaded, but movies lately seem to have gone off an artistic cliff. Special FX, car chases, CGI and shock tactics seem to have replaced story lines and acting.

Their lives cross when Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl they've both been tracking goes missing. The two join forces to try and find her, as they cross bad-guys and uncover a larger conspiracy, all while forming a friendship that their otherwise clashing personalities wouldn't allow.The story of the film is it's weakest point, but only because it seems overly complicated. There's a dead porn-star, a missing girl tied to that scene, government conspiracies, shady gangsters and so on. It's not hard to follow, however a more basic story would have served the film better, as there are some plot points in the film that leave you with questions that need not have been asked. There are also some very coincidental plot points added to serve the purpose of the story, which were quite obvious and took you out of the film a bit.Story aside, it's the characters and the performances that really shine. Crowe and Gosling form a mismatched pair, on paper and on screen. However the dynamic between the two appears very natural, bringing out the best performances out of each actor. Not only that, they're very funny, when alone and together on the screen. The supporting cast of colorful characters are all great as well, with Angourie Rice, who plays March's daughter Holly stealing the show.Shane Black deserves all the credit in the world for writing and directing such a fun film, the like of which has universal appeal, with lots of action, humour, twists and turns. It's a throwback to buddy-cop movies like Lethal Weapon, which is no surprise considering Shane Black wrote that film as well. He's also nailed the look, tone and pacing of the film, with its 70's era setting and neo-noir feel.While The Nice Guys won't ever achieve the classic status of a film like Lethal Weapon (which set the bar back in 1987), it will take you back there, providing you with all the same elements that made that film and others like it great. Where the film faults in its story, it makes up for in its excellent characters, performances, action and humour, offering you a highly entertaining and funny viewing experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent buddies movie,"The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is an excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes — absurd in a comic way. It is a ton of fun. Watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy.Set in 1977 Los Angeles, bumbling private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and muscle-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) become unlikely partners when they find themselves both looking for a missing woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). The two men then find out that Amelia was working with Misty Mountains and an amateur filmmaker named Dean. Dean, however, mysteriously died in a fire that burned the film. The two end up at a party to search for the film's financier, Sid Shuttuck, a notorious pornography producer. The two detectives come to party for searching Amelia. However, they met Blue Face and Older Guy whom are two assassins hiring by Amelia's mother, try to kill Amelia because Amelia have evident which reveal her mother's bad stuffs such as drug dealer, porn movie, sell illegal weapon. Jackson Healy fights with Older Guy, while Blue Face tries to kill Amelia from inside his car, only to be stopped by Holly (Holland March's daughter), who warns Amelia and then escapes with her. While chasing them down, Blue Face is seriously injured in a hit-and-run. Later, Blue Face was strangled by Jackson Healy and dead. After a brief investigation, the two are greeted by Amelia's mother, Judith Kutner (Kim Basinger), a high-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice, who claims her daughter is delusional and paranoid and she hire two detective to protect her daughter. Jackson Healy reveals the note paper with Holland March 's address given to him by Amelia is identical to a paper he found at the party, which gives leads to an airport hotel where Amelia was going to distribute the film. Two detectives found Amelia land on their car from the building where she is accidentally knocked out. They take her back to March's house and two detective was told by Amelia about her mother bad stuffs in government and bad Detroit group. Amelia created How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? To reveal those bad stuffs in government. Amelia mother has her assistant, Tally (Yaya DaCosta), arrange for Holland and Healy to deliver a case that supposedly contains one hundred thousand dollars. However, a half-asleep March accidentally crashes their car and the case is opened to reveal shredded magazines, causing them to realize that they have been double-crossed. At home, Holly is confronted and attacked by John Boy, who had been sent by Tally under the guise of being a family doctor. Holland March and Jackson Healy arrive back at the house and engage in a shootout with John Boy. John Boy escapes, while an impatient Amelia leaves, only to run into and be killed by John Boy. March and Healy try to bring the matter to court, but are rejected, as they have no evidence, leading them again to search for the film. They found out that the projectionist, Chet (Jack Kilmer), another protester they had questioned about Dean, is the projectionist for the film and had worked with Amelia to make How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? Public by splicing it into the presentation film for the Los Angeles Auto Show, which is being held at a hotel. At the auto show, the two find that John Boy and Older Guy also was in this hotel to searching the film. Two detectives fight with two bad guys. At the end, two detectives have the film and two bad guys (John Boy and Older Guy) was dead. The detectives take How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? To the police and though Judith is arrested, the Detroit car companies are immune to any charges, due to insufficient evidence. When she talks with March and Healy before her trial, Judith claims she did not want her daughter killed and justifies her involvement by insisting that ""what is good for Detroit is good for America."" Afterward Healy and March decide to continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency ""The Nice Guys.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nice Guys is no Kiss Kiss, but still goes Bang Bang!","No spoilers ahead- Writer/Director Shane Black has returned from the highly underrated Marvel film, Iron Man 3, with The Nice Guys. The film is extremely entertaining and had me laughing throughout the entire 110min run time. I did myself a favor and only watched the first trailer for The Nice Guys. This allowed most of the comic skits to play out unseen by myself and hit hard for me! I feel the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe was on point, with much of their adventure together being more entertaining on screen then when they were not on screen together. Don't get me wrong, both Gosling and Crowe are master performers, but together they really shine! I feel the plot of the film was a little hard to keep up with all the pieces, but overall the film closed all those loose ends up. The Nice Guys definitely deserves a second watch while in theaters to grab onto anything I may have missed during my first screening. One of the best parts was the ending. Because today's films are always looked at as possible film franchises, The Nice Guys does not shy from this, but is wrapped up and president as a stand alone film. However, the ending does leave us with an out to bring in sequels, with brand new stories staring these two private investigators. The 70s setting is a great time period to place a film franchise, and even in this first film the writes remind us it's not so easy to phone someone when you don't have cell phones in the 70s. I really love how the writers used the time placement to play on the story. Definitely check this film out, if you haven't already. Overall, I highly recommend this film! Spoiler alert, this film is not a child friendly film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pure comedy,"The best two-hander in years! Beyond just being funny though, this gem goes right into a certain pile of movies (The Big Lebowski, Inherent Vice, The Long Goodbye, etc) which utilize both a specific period, as well as the comedic trappings of burnouts, to explore emptiness, loss, and the strangling grip of capitalism. The tightest, snappiest, most deceptively beautiful movie in years.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good buddy movie,"This movie doesn't make anything new, doesn't make you thinking about the meaning of life but it's a great fun. The story isn't a big thing but the main characters save the whole show. They are cools and there is a bunch of hilarious conversation them. I don't really remember saw Ryan Gosling in this kind of movie but he do it great. One more good point to this movie that it doesn't stop for too long time. It always go on maximum round and you have no time to bored. The only reason why i don't give 10 point because it does not have anything surprise and does not do anything advanced and unremarkable.

Simply the Best Movie of 2016,"The beauty of this cinematic masterpiece lies within two frank elements. Shane Blacks incredible script and direction. The second element is the cast - equally as superb. Equally as enigmatic!This buddy, noir, almost comic book representation encapsulates the perfect science of making a movie well. Shane Black has an incredible edge when it comes to producing a script that has you screaming for more. The wit is second to none, the shocks are timed well and the dialogue is simply sublime.Mix this with a master class in direction and you have a movie that will etch its way into the ""favourite"" category within that film library in your mind.I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this film. It was fresh and a change from the normal daliances with overweight ties to super hero flicks that seem to dominate the screen at the moment. Sometimes, simple, catchy, energetic dialogue and good, well rounded acting is all you need to make a film special.Gosling and Crowe are splendid. Crowe stands out as the ""chequered past"" investigative partner of Gosling. He is rough and ready, humorous and big on screen. His portrayal of Jackson Healy is one of the best I have seen of Crowe of late. Black seemed to bring the life back to Crowe as he slung his whiskey soured voice around the movie without breaking a sweat. He is endearing and captures the performance with an ease of timing and purpose that makes you hungry.Equally, Gosling is frenetic and brilliant. His character portrayal is beautifully and mercilessly flawed. This gives an added extra as Gosling seems to perfect his portrayal of Holland March with a methodical flow. You become sympathetic and angry at the character. A testament to the brialliance of Gosling.The combination works and it works well. At first I was uneasy about Crowe and Gosling being able to pull off this buddy team. However, your mind is at ease as soon as they hit the screen together.There is another who makes this films cast stand out. Screen starlet Angourie Rice (who plays Goslings daughter Holly March) - tempers the relationship between Crowe and Gosling. This is not her only attribute as she stands firm in her own shameless portrayal. She is quite the actress. Her humour and movement give her, easily the break away performance of this movie.There is quite a support cast (look it up).This movie is a gem. I don't need or want to say too much because I genuinely want people to watch it.My faith in good, old fashioned, simple, well put together screen plays have been restored. This movie shows that there is not always a need to spend 12.3 billion dollars on an ensemble cast with heavy special effects. It is simple and beautiful. It is irreverent and conclusive. The only bitter pill to swallow was that it ended....",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
L.A. Confidential if Done by Blake Edwards,"The titular ""Nice Guys"" are two formerly functioning members of the boys in blue who now scrounge up a living working on the fringes of the law. Holland March (Gosling) is a private dick who largely keeps his clients on a leash just long enough to get paid extra for little work. Jackson Healy (Crowe) on the other-hand barely scrapes by as an enforcer of sorts; beating people up on behalf of anyone with the right money. The two cross paths when the secretive and frightened Amelia (Qualley) hires Healy to keep March off her back, but after an escalating set of circumstances, the two boys team up to find out who Amelia really is and why she's on the run.On the face of it, The Nice Guys has all the outward themes and calling cards that make director Shane Black's oeuvre so appealing. The story twists and turns with the erudition of a Peter Cheyney pulp novel only played up for belly laughs. There's the obligatory precocious child who's often too clever for his/her own good, this time played by Angourie Rice. Then there's the crackling dialogue whose machine-gun wit and irascible one-liners impresses even in his lesser efforts. Here, the script is a perfect blend of Lethal Weapon (1987) pacing and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) sardonic witticism, with a touch of seventies style to add ironic snark.If one were to find fault in the film's finely tuned, well-oiled machine it'd be the obviousness of the villain. With tons of effort made to establish the film's tone and groove into the plot twists and reveals, you'd think they wouldn't tip their hand so much. No matter; less time thinking about the intricacies of the plot leaves more time to revel in Gosling and Crowe's deft, pitch-perfect acting, the gleeful, uproarious laughter and the gaudy seventies swag.The Nice Guys is L.A. Confidential (1997) as done by Blake Edwards. It's smart, funny, effortlessly assembled and easily accessible. The story is tight and clever which more than makes up for any far- fetched tomfoolery and the themes are similar to those of Shane Black's other efforts though it never feels like he's resting on his laurels. Give The Nice Guys their due in theaters lest you wind up on the wrong end of a loaded cookie jar.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tedious until it was just plain bad,"I was looking forward to this movie, but it was terrible. Most of it was tedious, until the grand finally, which was just plain bad. None of the characters were likable. The plot was convoluted. It couldn't decide on a tone, neither action nor comedy nor drama.Set in the late 70's in Los Angeles, it is kind of a cross between Shaft and Miami Vice. The one bright spot was the 13 yo daughter Holly, played by Angourie Rice. They should've made the movie about her.This was supposed to be a big comeback for Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, but this is not. As of its opening weekend, this movie is very highly rated by critics and fans alike, but I disagree, I did not like it at all.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crowe and Gosling are brilliant together in another winner from Shane Black,"Yes, oh yes, The Nice Guys is every bit the hilarious and entertaining movie I was hoping for. Part action, part buddy comedy, The Nice Guys is the latest movie from Shane Black and believe me when I tell you, there is so much fun to be had at the cinema with this one.Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a hardened private eye who chooses violence as his method of business. On the other hand, Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a bit of a bumbling private eye, not akin to the violent methods of Healy's choosing.When the mismatched duo are paired together to investigate the death of fading porn star, Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), they begin to unravel a web of corruption and lies, pointing toward murder over suicide. They are hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl who holds the key to the whole conspiracy, before others with cruel intentions do.First things first, The Nice Guys is really driven by the great on-screen partnership of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, who share such an unbelievably good chemistry as the two private eyes who couldn't be more different.This is the best Crowe has been since State of Play in 2009 and he has no trouble at all selling the tough guy persona of Healy. The comedy was something I thought Crowe could struggle with however, having seen him do a few interviews recently and after his performance in The Nice Guys, I had no need to worry.Crowe is funny in this but Gosling is absolutely hilarious. He proved he could do comedy in Crazy, Stupid, Love but there is so much more to the comedy he performs in The Nice Guys. A lot of it is verbal but there are some moments of physical comedy that Gosling nails, particularly one sequence in the movie's finale that was rather quite brilliant.The two are aided by a brilliant script, full of enough wit and quips, written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi. Black is no stranger to writing both movies and characters of similar ilk, having written the first two Lethal Weapon movies and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which he also directed. It's not only Crowe and Gosling who benefit from the script either with Matt Bomer shining as the sinister John Boy and Angourie Rice almost stealing the show as Holly March, Holland's rather persistent daughter.I understand that The Nice Guys hasn't performed well so far at the box-office which is a real shame. I urge anyone who likes to be entertained to go and spend two hours watching this at the cinema. Trust me, those two hours will fly by and we could do with having more movies like this being made.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

You get thrown into a situation, people form bonds instantly, minors are suddenly super detectives and undercover agents ... this movie gives you so many set variables that you feel like you don't need to see anything evolve.

A Shane Black comedy n'stuff,"What do you get when you cross Cutris Hanson's LA Confidential with Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang? The answer is this entertaining crime comedy centred around a porn film in 1977. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe make an unlikely pairing as together they investigate a missing persons case which escalates quickly into insanity and hilarity.Russell Crowe portrays Jakson Heely, a character who shares similarities with his LA Confidental character Bud White. Crowe plays the brute with a softer side fairly well, making a mini comeback after some less than stellar performances in films such as Les Miserables. As good as Crowe is, he isn't the stand out star of this show, the would go to Ryan Goslings brilliant performance as the alcoholic buffoon Holland March. Gosling embodies the clown role of the film, perfectly executing the many, many gags he's faced with delivering. Goslings performance plays a big part in my enjoyment of this film and finally shows that the actor isn't just a pretty face.The film is a funny film, thanks to Crowe and Gostling for their delivery is definitely in order for the films humour working, but their delivery would have been for nothing if the script wasn't funny to start with. Also the direction and editing are also great in pulling off some of the physical comedy of the film. Long story short the team behind this film work brilliantly together to compliment one another and create a genuinely amusing movie.The only issue I had with this film was the crime story itself. As the film progresses it seems to shift from a mysteriously cursed porn film to yet another government conspiracy to which I am still confused as to how that was resolved. The films climax centres around our protagonists retrieving a porn film to which the story is evidence against the department of justice for illegal activity... But everyone involved in the films making is dead and its a PORN film, so I'm struggling to see how this singular piece of pornographic evidence is enough to take down someone high up in the ranks of the police force. Sure Chet is alive to testify but that is never specified and is that really enough?Overall The Nice Guys is a really nice film. Although the overall story gets a bit sh*t the characters and the humour will compensate for this to the end. Ryan Gosling gives the performance of his career so far and deserves a special mention for his work on this film. This is a cool movie filled with porn, murder n'stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Shane Black's nostalgic and great writing make The Nice Guys of the best of 2016,"The Nice Guys takes place ten years before I was born. Though I was technically alive in the 1980's, I've always seen myself as something of a nineties child. I think it's because of the media I was watching. I was heavily into the Nickelodeon channel and the 1990's fast evolution into the computer age. The reason I bring this up is that one's preference of culture can definitely define the era they were raised in. My older brother may have been born in 1985, but he has a love affair of the 1970's. He likes a lot of the television shows from that time like Dukes of Hazzard and Starsky & Hutch.While I'm not that much of a nostalgic individual, I can see some of the appeal of the seventies. There is something of a bright but gritty combination that's unique. A lot of that had to do with the darker content that was coming out now that the previous restrictions that were present from old studio system were lifted. The Nice Guys returns to this era, giving us a buddy-buddy mystery that's in vein of something that's closer to the seventies cop shows like The Rockford Filesonly with an emphasis on comedy.In the late seventies, adult film star Misty Mountains is killed in a car crash. The aunt of this star hires private investigator Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) to find a missing girl named Amelia Kuther (played by Margaret Qualley). Amelia, however, does not want to be found and hires an enforcer Jackson Healy (played by Russell Crowe) to try and intimidate Holland to stop trying to find her. Jackson is something of a wannabe detective who may be better at it then Holland, who is an alcoholic klutz. When Jackson encounters and escapes two thugs looking for Amelia, he decides to team up with Holland to find Amelia before the bad guys can.The two end up being assisted by Holland's teenage daughter Holly (played by Angourie Rice) who seems to be the only one to truly read things between the lines. Holland and Jackson end up going from a porn producer's party in Bel Air to an air pollution protest. It's there they discover that Amelia was making an experimental movie to work with the air pollution protesters, leading into suspicions into the adult film industry, Detroit auto industry, and the Los Angeles city government.While it sounds like a lot to take in, The Nice Guys not only has an interesting mystery, it is also a great buddy-buddy comedy. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a surprising good team, given how well they establish Crowe as the rough guy and Gosling as the idiot (a role I never expected him to play). Now if you want to know who had the best performance, that honor goes to young Angourie who played Holly. She may have been smart and curious about the mystery that her father was a part of, but she still acted like a child. Why is it that few movies that involve kids really let them act like kids?Shane Black wrote and directed this very enjoyable film. You can see a lot of Lethal Weapon's same buddy cop mentality, though I'd argue there's something of a ""meaner"" feeling. A lot of that might have to do with the fact that our heroes are not cops, but private investigators. It also has to do with it's 1970's setting which is so rich in it's own world, that I'd be surprised if the film isn't awarded for it's production design.I'll give this nine cookie jars out of ten. The Nice Guys is already guaranteed a spot as one of my favorites of the year. Shane Black is clearly one of the best writer's in Hollywood and I'm glad to see studio's like Warner Brothers taking a chance on him to let him make whatever he wants. I can't summarize enough with how much fun this original story is. Please see The Nice Guys to support more new content from Hollywood!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

She actually did a pretty good job.Bottom line: This movie was made for adolescents. Yet it's R-rated for good reason --- the subject matter is for adults only.

Watch it with an open mind and smiles are guaranteed,"I've seen reviews of this that say ""poor depiction of the 70's"", ""the daughter ruined the whole thing"", ""the characters are poorly shaped"" - all valid if you're eager to see this movie as a failure even before you've watched the first five minutes.What I saw was one of the funniest cop/detective comedies since The Other Guys, starring a duo with just as much potential as Chan and Tucker in Rush Hour.After recent memory was soiled with all sorts of awful Kevin Hart/The Rock combos, The Nice Guys was a breath of fresh air. Crowe and Gosling were solid and clearly enjoyed the whole thing, and while the script may have been found lacking at times, it was the humor (and arguably Gosling's overacting) that saved the day every single time.Those of you watching this in the States, I beg you: if you've lived through the 70's, watch this without judging the setting too much. It wasn't meant as an accurate biopic, and looking for flaws will just ruin your experience.Look out for some old school references and be prepared for a whole lot of random humor. As stated above, I would see this morphing into a trilogy, similar to Rush Hour.

Fun and thrilling,"I meant to go see The Nice Guys when it first came to the theatres, but I don't remember why I didn't go. I finally rented it. Most of what I had seen before seemed great. A mutual from tumblr seems to like this movie and constantly reblogs GIF-sets and screencaps from this movie. All that dialogue seemed wild and fun, so I thought it'd be right up my alley.An almost constant thought that followed me through the movie was ""this reminds me of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". No wonder, since it's directed by the same guy. Shane Black really handles neo-noir films very well. Few especially great details were the internal monologues at the beginning of the movie. They were like straight from old time-y film noirs, but way more fun.The plot was way more intriguing than anticipated. From the screenshots and GIF-sets The Nice Guys seemed more like a comedy than actually thrilling crime mystery. The plot is complex, and it's actually very satisfying and entertaining to see how the story goes, what was going on, all that.One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the 70's aesthetic and music. I've always had a soft spot for 70's fashion, so movies from the past few years set in the 70's are great at least aesthetically speaking.The Nice Guys is definitely a fun, thrilling movie, tho I am sceptical if it would be as good the second time.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The movie follows an enforcer for hire and a private investigator as they try to find a missing girl.After watching this movie, I cannot imagine someone other than Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe to play the characters that they did. Any scene they both are in, was guaranteed to bring a laugh. The dynamic between the two was brilliant. The movie was also unconventional as it didn't follow most of the buddy cop routines such as a falling out of the two before the climax.The only qualm I have about this movie is that it has no sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome film for a Friday,"This film contains everything an action-comedy needs. Some good jokes and with some I mean a lot; sometimes I really couldn't stop laughing. It also contains a lot of great action scenes with, of course, good slap stick. The plot is amazing and for me it was unpredictable. The combination of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling is as expected great. Adding the fact that none of the two actors is taking all the credit, though I liked Ryan Gosling's acting and role more. And of course it has something every action-comedy has and needs to have a happy end. I would also like to complement Angourie Rice (Holly) for her great acting work, if she doesn't become the typical child actor, she will have a beautiful and bright future. As conclusion I would say that this film is one of greatest action-comedies I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot) and that if you haven't seen this movie yet that you should definitely check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Painfully Bad and Boring,"I finally rented this film because of the good reviews that it had gotten. Lots of praise for the chemistry between the leads and it being a throwback to the good ol' buddy cop/PI movies of past. Wow! What a disappointment. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Painfully unfunny, the film's plot is barely discernible and the story is just plain boring. Russell Crowe is still an actor I love (extra pounds and all) and he's the best thing about this movie because he basically plays the straight man and isn't trying to be a clown like Gossling is. I didn't care about anybody in this film. And, I'm tired of Hollywood glamorizing sexually precocious youngsters. Here, the 13 year-old daughter or Gossling's character is made out to be more mature than her idiot father. He's anti-porn and wonders what's happening with young people but the daughter is cool and has frank discussions about sex with porn actresses. Awful movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worth the watch,"This buddy adventure movie has a 70s vibe, a sense of humour, and a story that is compelling enough to keep you watching and a little more. While the plot is no work of genius, this movie is enjoyable, entertaining, and funny. Ryan Gosling does a great job of playing his alcoholic schemer of a private investigator who gets multiple solid jokes in. Russell Crowe comes through with a solid performance that one would not initially expect, and is very believable in his gruff tough guy role. The villains are a little ridiculous, but the main characters hold things together. Even the child actor is surprisingly good. This is no masterpiece, but it's a feel good comedy adventure that doesn't treat the audience like they're idiots and is well worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Viewers do not mind a film using elements or paying homage to genre defining films as long as the characters and the story make sense without distractions.

The Nice Guys is awesome and the credit entirely goes to the unexpectedly hilarious performances of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.Loved u both,"The Nice Guys (2016):Its been a long time since I laughed like hell after watching a movie.All the comedies are left out just as a failed attempts of ridiculousness and some times sex.When I found that The Nice Guys is an Investigative crime comedy starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling,I was like ""How the heck could it even possible?""But than I got known that this hell of a comedy is from Shane Black who brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which also as same kind of unimaginable cast for a comedy.(Robert Downey Jr.)Plot:Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk. He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a film maker was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.???Plus Points:1)Casting: The Nice Guys would not be the same without Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.These two Superstars of Hollywood teamed up in a most unusual way for this crime comedy and surprisingly they are freaking awesome.There is a scene in this movie where both Russell and Ryan goes in an elevator and when they reach the floor they find a guy with his throat cut and some firing going on.They immediately goes back into the lift for escaping from it.Their expressions in that scene are enough to prove that both of them are not only stars of emotional or kick ass movies.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are nothing short of perfect. A subtle goofball/straight-man line is drawn between them within their individual approaches to the case, and the back and forth between them is magical, often managing to be blissfully goofy while always remaining grounded and real. Angourie Rice as Holly March,daughter of Gosling is very good and her acting is on par with the legends.2)Screenplay and Direction: Shane Black did not write any out of the box script or anything.Its just a simple detective buddies investigating a mysterious girl related to the death of a famous porn star. But the way he wrote the funny dialogues and situations are excellent.There are lot of hilarious situations in this film.As a director, Black also demonstrates a fantastic eye for visual comedy, be it Holland struggling to handle a gun, a magazine, and a lit cigarette simultaneously while in a bathroom stall, or Holland and Jackson stepping out of an elevator to an incredibly violent scene. From the movie's opening shot, taking the audience up and over the dilapidated Hollywood sign, Black ensconces you in The Nice Guys' noir world, and you really don't want to let it go by the time the credits roll.3)Music: There is this funky music playing in the background helped the movie a lot.So,The Nice Guys is awesome and the credit entirely goes to the unexpectedly hilarious performances of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.Loved u bothMy rating 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
You can never be too NICE;),"'The Nice Guys' is the latest return to form from writer/director Shane Black. Coming off the unexplained mess of 'Iron Man 3', Black delivers a fun and edgy dark-comedy in the vein of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'.1. Never have I been a fan of Ryan Gosling (March), because his acting has always been on a sub-par/mediocre level to me. Yet somehow, Gosling fits perfectly here and blends well into his character. On the other hand, Russell Crowe (Healy) has always been in my top 10 'favorite actors' list, (not that I'm complaining) but he seems to be playing himself in this role. Crowe is most notably known for being an aggressive tough-guy in real life, and he mirrors his character to a fault in this film. Hence the reason I said he's playing himself lol.2. The plot of this movie is fairly simple and nothing all that special, but the real entertainment comes from great dialogue and interplay between characters. Kim Basinger (Kuttner) has an important role in this, yet her acting is utterly poor whenever she's on screen. The surprising talent comes from young actress Angourie Rice, who plays Ryan Gosling's feisty and responsible daughter Holly. The darker tone of this film comes in the form of Matt Bomer, who plays the villainous hit-man John Boy. Bomer is quite scary and menacing even though he doesn't have much screen- time.3. Shane Black took a great direction in making this a murder/mystery which keeps the audience compelled. Also the fact that it's based around the death of an incredible hot porn-star (Murielle Telio) and gorgeous women as suspects, there's no reason guys wouldn't like this film;) There is never a boring moment as things move at a good pace, in which I have to give a lot of credit to the editor. Crowe & Gosling are an exceptional pair, just like Gibson & Glover or Downey & Kilmer, but that's what Black does best, writing strong buddy-characters with great chemistry.This film deserves a lot more praise and recognition because I know movies like this don't draw large crowds. 'The Nice Guys' is pure entertainment, with a perfect balance of crime, action, drama and of course....comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Genuinely Repulsive,"I'll say that unlike other movies, this one hasn't a single redeeming feature. Ok, I need to make a disclaimer. It may have something decent in it after I abandoned it on the principle that my life is finite so I won't waste it. That was the 50% or so mark.There is nothing funny or even non-offensive in the entire show aside from the opening scene where a sex starved 12 year old boy gets to see a soon to be dead naked girl. The issue here and throughout is that people do not act as they do in this movie. A 13 year old girl, after being attacked by a grown man who is then defeated, does not immediately grow concerned with his welfare.I suspect that the editing harmed what little there may have been of the movie. The 'buddy hookup' as well as the goal made no sense. The supposed comedy is Crowe, ballooned to 250 lbs. Lumbering about hitting people. Both he and Gosling look like they spent the previous night sleeping in a sewer.Given the production values and stars, I'm blown away at how bad this was.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Light crime comedy from Gosling and Crowe,"Wonderful light crime comedy. I have heard a lot of mixed reviews about this movie. Therefore, the advice right away is to look yourself.The story is typical, but very good and has its charm. The wonderful atmosphere of the USA of that period was conveyed. It is worth noting jokes - real jokes, not a second-class slag, which can be seen in modern blockbusters. There are several blues and patterns, but they don't spoil the overall impression.The characters are bright and easy to remember. The cast is very good. And it applies to everyone from John the killer to the daughter of Healy.A few words about the main characters. Gosling and Crowe played very cool. Ryan perfectly portrayed his image as an alcoholic detective who, after the drama in his life, does not believe in himself.Very glad to see Russell in the movie. Recently, he rarely appears in movies, but still remains a great actor. This role is proof. And the tandem of the two actors is very cool.

A recipe that shouldn't work but is an unexpected delight!,"A buddy comedy about morally dubious private detectives. Both thoroughly uncool losers. With slapstick physically comedy and an outlandish plot that stretches credulity. Set in the 70s. Revolving around porn and automobile corruption. Starring Ryan Gosling. And Russell Crowe. It was a brave studio exec that green-lit this project. But one who spied a touch of genius. There's nothing in this recipe that should work, yet somehow Shane Black has blended up a black comedy that feels simultaneously from a bygone movie era and completely refreshing.

Under situations where no heavy humor mars or burdening the film is very particular how shifted to play two players that makes it quite a hit ... Far from the frozen composition ""Drive"" here it is just the opposite Ryan Gosling in man returns rather left, deceitful, or not too clever at the edges but releasing a charm and bonhomie that echoes his muscled sidekick, equally amazing and explosive under Russell Crowe traits ! What looks, which phrases associated with unique and unexpected reactions. Crazy as can be, all that will trigger both nickel feet detectives will bring us some very funny moments when the secondary roles give all their importance and have nothing to envy the two heroes, like the little Holly, egghead element weighted and benevolent as thoughtful girl of Holland ...

The Nice Guys,"Shane Black has been known for his creative writing, clever use of violence and a knack for great humour, we've seen this in Lethal Weapon. This paired with superb characterization and great acting from both Russell Crowe (Jackson Healy) and Ryan Gosling (Holland March) provide the back bone for a fantastic movie.While the cliché of the serious, hard hitting macho man paired with the witty, surprisingly smart side kick has been used and abused in many detective / cop comedies. The Nice Guys get away with it. The various interactions between March and Healy along with March's daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) are fresh and entertaining. Healy's seriousness is offset by a down in the dumps, depressed, drunken March whose inebriated antics and don't give a **** attitude will have you weak at the knees.The over the top nature continues to remind the viewer its a movie, the characters never really focused on the immanent and direct danger. This steals most of the serious tones and allows the viewer to take the film with a grain of salt. It plays off completely unnatural reactions to vastly unrealistic movie situations (as many action comedies do) yet at the same time throws in touches of realism that pulls things back into perspective without losing its comedic effect (e.g. the exceptional scene of March punching the glass and slitting his wrist).I know the previous paragraph is a cliché for modern crime / action comedies (e.g. The Others Guys, Deadpool for example) however, The Nice Guys plays into a genuinely interesting and compelling plot that isn't afraid to push boundaries, woven in with a 70's theme that adds a brilliant extra dimension.Superb acting and hilarious characters keep it from being another ""passable movie."" So while the movie is a little bit clichéd, it's refreshing, original, comedic take on a already strong movie formula will no doubt have you laughing. This paired with a great, original plot, keeps you entertained and captivated for the full 2 hours. Highly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Film Noir for the Disco Era,"An unlikely duo must team up to find a missing girl before a secret cabal has her murdered in The Nice Guys (2016), a comedic crime drama written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi and directed by Shane Black. Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys is a film noir for the disco era, but wasn't originally written as a period piece. Thankfully, the writers decided to rework the concept and what resulted was one of the best films of 2016.Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a muscle-for-hire who Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley) pays to dissuade private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) from looking for her. March, an alcoholic who lives with his preteen daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), believes Amelia is somehow connected to the death of porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio). Misty's aunt, Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith), hired March to investigate Misty's death because she believed Misty might still be alive.When two anonymous men (Beau Knapp and Keith David) show up at Jackson Healy's apartment to press him for details on Amelia's whereabouts, he decides to pay March to help him locate Amelia before they do. Together, they discover Amelia and Misty were connected to an underground adult film allegedly exposing a conspiracy on the part of auto manufacturers to suppress the catalytic converter. Several people involved in the movie turned up dead.Things get really complicated when Amelia's mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice, pays March and Healy to find her daughter. When Amelia literally falls into their laps, she accuses her mother of being part of the conspiracy. March and Healy slowly put the pieces together, but will they rescue her and the last remaining film reel in time to expose the truth?Nice Guys was loosely inspired by true events, although it wasn't advertised as such. Because of its particular geography, Los Angeles has long suffered from lingering smog, which was a pervasive problem in the mid-twentieth century. The film pokes fun at activists protesting ""bird killing"" pollution, but people really did wear gas masks to protest LA smog and it did have negative and long-term consequences for public health.Auto emissions were a contributing factor to airborne toxins until 1975 when the Environmental Protection Agency mandated all new cars come equipped with a catalytic converter. GM, Ford, and Chrysler (the ""Big Three"") agreed to research pollution-reducing technologies in 1953 but dragged their heels. The Justice Department filed an anti-trust case against the Big Three in 1968, alleging a conspiracy to suppress pollution-reducing technologies. So the events that formed a backdrop for the film occurred years before the film takes place.Nice Guys is more concerned with evoking the Zeitgeist of the decade rather than a strict adherence to facts. It was a brief time in American history when adult films were socially relevant. The 1970s are sometimes referred to as the ""Golden Age of Porn,"" when porn achieved some mainstream success with films like Deep Throat (1972) and The Devil in Miss Jones (1973). There were also widespread but unsubstantiated fears of Mafia influence in the adult film industry, which Judith uses as a red herring in this film.Nice Guys features several strong performances. Ryan Gosling is a Canadian actor with a long career in film and television, most notably in The Notebook (2004) and The Place Beyond the Pines (2012). In 2016, he also starred in La La Land, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Holland March is a less serious role, demonstrating Gosling's versatility as an actor. Audiences and critics loved it. For this performance, he was nominated for ""Favorite Comedic Movie Actor"" at the People's Choice Awards and was awarded ""Best Comedic Performance"" by the San Diego Film Critics Society.Angourie Rice, a young Australian actress, had her breakout role in The Nice Guys. Since then, she's appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), which was praised by audiences and critics, and The Beguiled (2017), which was not. Her character in The Nice Guys, Holly, is an adorably precocious child, insisting she can help her father solve the case (since her father is an incompetent drunk, who can blame her?). Like Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994), Angourie is perfect for the role, and hopefully will have a bright future in film.Nice Guys is funny, clever, and expertly manages a purposely convoluted and over-the-top plot ala The Big Lebowski (1998) and Fargo (1996). Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling perfectly play off each other's strengths, and bring a sense of ironic humor and style to an otherwise bleak and cynical world.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie for Comedy Month,"In this age where every modern movie is a sequel or based on something else, it's great that we have a look at something brand new. This is one of the best comedies in recent years and everyone seems to agree with me. I'm reminded of what made films like ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" so funny was because the main characters play the goofy series straight. That's exactly what Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling do here. We get our first great joke of the movie when a car crashes through a house. What's great is that there's so much going on in this movie.You just have no idea what will show up next. The one moment that really made me jump in my seat was when a giant bee appeared in the backseat! It's a dream, by the way. There's all sorts of jokes used here, although slapstick comes off as the most prominent. The weird thing is that I saw the first half of this movie on an airplane. I was watching this weird edited version for some reason.Why would a movie shown on an airplane screen be edited? You're the only one who hears it! The few moments where the characters yell are especially funny because they're usually so calm.

It might just be the funniest film of this entire decade. ****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""The Nice Guys"", An Inmediate Classic Comedy","Irrefutably, ""The Nice Guys"" reigns compared to R-rated comedy films of this year (with the exception of ""Deadpool""); with the personal obsessions of its director/scriptwriter, narrative intelligence and heart of those buddy comedies of the 80s, Black resumes the power in a suspense/action comedy movie rich in good performances and argumentative ability, in addition to a fascinating travel across time. Despite not having a vast repertoire of works, Shane Black established the odd couples of rough guys in the films, those which possessed a terrible relationship in daily life, but that in the violent and full of action sequences show their good hearts. After his latest project in 2005, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", Black writes - together with Anthony Bagarozzi - and directs what could become in the best of his career.The film would survive of independent way, without the need to its extreme action and violent scenes thanks to the incredible chemical of its leads, certainly, they are erected as an of the funniest duos in the film world. Black and Bagarozzi transport us back to the glorious 1980s, epoch where lechery, endless party and the psychedelic pornography were booming. Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a dishonest and unprofessional private eye who immerses himself into an alcoholic whirlwind to forget the death of his wife while trying to educate and raise in a peculiar way his teenage daughter. On the other hand, Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healy, an unorthodox hired enforcer , he does not matter to work for the most indelible person in the world, provided that you collect a acceptable amount of money, he will work for you, complacently. Angourie Rice gets the same prominence than the main duo, she is Holly March, daughter of March and assistant of the couple of private detectives, unconsciously, a girl as charismatic as intelligent, who gains one place almost immediately in the frantic and demanding Hollywood by herself. The funny and hilarious trio will be challenged to solve four cases that ravage the City of Los Angeles: the death of a porn star, the disappearance of a young woman, a criminal conspiracy of high standards and the disappearance of a man from his funeral.The plot is a genuine and vile MacGuffin, a trick designed by the selfsame Alfred Hitchcock, who permeated each suspense work of his authorship with this clever strategy. The film borrows several references to the ""The Big Lebowski"" classic, considering that it employs each alleged main plot to take us to the true final storyline, some indecorous and dangerous car manufacturers utilize of camouflage the disappearance of a young girl and the death of the porn star to give one message of singular form; nonetheless, Gosling and Crowe involves us in the complex scheme as themselves.""The Nice Guys"" is a perfect coordinate mechanism, it not is based only in the sequences of shootings, explosions and fights (which have recreated of lucid and entertaining way, perhaps, Marvel instilled in Black this ability after the success in ""Iron Man 3""), the movie combines with dialogs full of jokes, powerful dialogs, clap-worthy dialogs, besides certain nostalgia by the films of the 80s. Although the film did not expect such reception at the box office, was not created for this objective, it is a movie with fundaments and totally faithful to the old buddy movies, is not a commercial product, although it seems like, it is a project that deserves the name of ""film"", in capital letters.Shane Black earns good marks in a genre that is quickly becoming in monotonous and without surprises. An intricate plot, an extravagant atmosphere, a explosive soundtrack and an ingenious chemical of its leading actors are complemented by a absorbent pace and a nostalgic tone eighties. If you like to enjoy of one action movie, watch ""The Nice Guys"", if you like to enjoy of one comedy movie, watch ""The Nice Guys"", if you like to rekindle the 80s, watch ""The Nice Guys"", if you want to experience the best film of comedy of the year, watch ""The Nice Guys"".",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

This movie brings back the action police-mafia-chase that we all missed.

The plot is the main point, and it follows the characters who are dealing with it. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crow have amazing chemistry and it's refreshing to watch them.

Jackson Healy: People got hurt.
Holland March: I'm saying, I think they died quickly. So I don't think they got hurt.OrJackson Healy: So, you know the old lady, right? Did you believe her?
Holland March: What about?
Jackson Healy: When she said she saw Misty alive that night, did you believe her?
Holland March: God, no. She's blind as a bat.
Jackson Healy: Uh-huh.
Holland March: She has actual coke bottles for glasses. You paint a mustache on a Volkswagen, she says, ""Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast.""OrJackson Healy: The place reeks of marijuana. They're smoking it.
Holland March: I can't smell.
Jackson Healy: What?
Holland March: I got hit in the head a while back. I lost my sense of smell.
Jackson Healy: You can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: You're a detective, and you can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: Aw, this just keeps getting better and better.
Holland March: Wow, that's really insensitive.Gosling and Crowe have a great chemistry that cries out for a sequel to happen so audiences can enjoy their future adventures in this sleazy 1970s coke filled version of Los Angels (although the film was sadly a box office disappointment). The other standout performer is Angourie Rice, playing Gosling's quick witted and smart-mouthed daughter Holly (reminiscent of Danielle Harris' character in Black's ""The Last Boy Scout"" as Bruce Willis' smart-mouthed daughter), who has some great banter herself with Crowe's Jackson when she finds out what he does for a living:Holly March: You beat people up and charge money?
Jackson Healy: Yeah.
Holland March: Sad, isn't it?
Holly March: How much would you charge to beat up my friend Janet?
Holland March: What?
Jackson Healy: How much you got?
Holly March: Thirty bucks.
Holland March: That's good, this conversation is over.Holly also has some hilarious father/daughter interaction as well, such as when she hides out in the trunk of the car to follow Gosling and Crowe to coke filled party populated with adult film stars and observes:Holly March: Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.
Holland March: Sweetheart, how many times have I told you? Don't say ""and stuff"". Just say ""Dad, there are whores here"".
Holly March: Well, there's like a ton.That last interaction leads to a great callback later in the film when Holly is talking to a young adult film actress that's too inappropriate to repeat here, but it's probably the biggest laugh of the film. Overall, ""The Nice Guys"" is charmingly retro, from it's use of the 1970s Warners Bros. logo at the film's opening to the fabulous cars and costumes to a fun soundtrack, it all gives the the feel of a politically incorrect R-rated version of The Rockford Files. Keith David, Lois Smith, Gil Gerard, and Kim Basinger also appear in the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Atypic Hollywood Originality; A Clever, new take on the buddy/P.I. film","To begin, it's one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated films of the last several years (even decades in the genre). Period. And by that, I mean not a great success at the box office, even though it was very* well-reviewed by critics and audiences, alike. If you haven't seen it because you are weary of the beleaguered and hackneyed buddy-cop/P.I. films (ever since Lethal Weapon started the endless cloning process), you must* see this.It's got loads more to offer,from its kitschy 70's pop culture setting (Including some memorably awful hair, clothes, and Nixon.), a 'groovy'soundtrack filled with 70s Pop & R&B music..but much more. Gosling, charming as always, is the n'er-do-well, boozy, bungling P.I., adored by his oft-disappointed and precocious daughter. He stumbles on a case (deemed initially, at least, as unsolvable but an easy paycheck) offered first by the worried Grandma of an assumed- deceased porn star, and then another case offered by a tough-guy- for-hire/washed-up but capable P.I., (played appealingly by Russell Crowe in one of his best comedy roles, ever) -who is looking for another missing girl.Eventually (of course! - and we are grateful) they join forces, stumbling into a wider plot that links the two missing women. Along the way, yes, as the genre insists: mishaps and humor. But refreshing, more sarcastic, less broad humor. And more finesse means better laughs- as Hitchcock found that less gore brings greater terror. This duo is 'fab' chemistry. It's enjoyable, more believable, and such** a relief from the formulaic action films endlessly put forth on CGI-laden cookie-cutter releases that gross 10x more, sadly.Word is the Director, Gosling and Crowe are on board for a sequel; but the studios are dragging their greedy little feet, because the modestly successful box office of Nice Guys takes a back seat to 45 more Pixar/CGI/ or the ubiquitous 'Boys or Girls' Night Out-with hilarious result'..films.

Stylish and Overlooked,"The Nice Guys is described as a older style neo-noir type drama based upon during the 1970's. This film was released during the summer of 2016 and appeared to have been overshadowed and overlooked due to higher profile films, which is a shame since this film delivers in what people are looking for in these type of stylish crime mystery dramas. Compared to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (by the same director- Shane Black) and there are some similarities but with the Nice Guys, it shows growth from that film.What makes this film work is that the storyline is continuously energetic and entertaining, mainly due to the lead actors of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowed- their chemistry is what makes this film top notch. The clever and witty dialogue is there as well as the comedy and action. Nothing feels forced and the film does not drag on. Although, it was somewhat odd and different how the daughter was in as many scenes and had a big role as she did (arguably the third most screen time after Gosling and Crowe). Some complained that she ruined the film but one would get used to it. Overall the Nice Guys is one of the better crime dramas of last year, and we have a suspicious this film may develop a type of cult following.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just when I was about to give up on Hollywood...,"...I stumbled across this little gem, which has to be the most entertaining and darkly hilarious movie that I've seen in the past three years. Although the film is a buddy crime comedy at its core, to describe it as such doesn't really do it justice. I occasionally felt reminded of classics like Fargo and The Big Lebowski. To say anything more would potentially spoil the movie, which I think is best seen with little to no plot-related expectations.I do have to add one final note concerning the low IMDb rating though. I found the amount of one-star reviews rather puzzling, so I read about two dozen of them. With the exception of one lady who downrated this gem because Russell Crowe has gained a little weight (and they say men are shallow!), the only bone of contention appears to be the graphic language, especially that of a precocious teenager. I already knew that Americans can be a surprisingly puritan audience, but this is a little ridiculous imho. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that if you happen to be an overly language-sensitive person, or someone who harbors the delusion that the '70s were a more innocent time, maybe this film isn't for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Nice Guys: A guide about our way of living,"The Nice Guys is a complete guide showing us ""how not to take our lives so seriously"".Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe brightly countering together turns the whole story (that was made to be sarcastic, but serious) into a class about ourselves.

Why do popular people always seem to do what is trendy instead of what is correct. Young audiences that view these type of films like to emulate the characters to be popular. Actors, writers, producers,etc, can bury their heads in the sand and pretend that their products have no bearing on the morals of society for the sake of profits, but they need to look intelligently at what they are producing.

Super Solid,"""The Nice Guys"" is written and directed by Shane Black and stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe and is about a mismatched pair of private eyes teaming up to investigate the suicide of a pornstar in 1974 Los Angeles. So originally I was quite looking forward to ""The Nice Guys"" as from the trailer the film seem to convey a sense of style and pervado that I found quite intriguing, so my anticipation for this film was quite high, and well ""The Nice Guys"" does live up to my expectations it does not pass them by any means. First off this film is excellently written, with a great mystery that keeps the audience hooked throughout and many comedic scenes that had me splitting with laughter. Gosling and Crowe's chemistry was unexpectedly and uniquely perfect in this film, I'd totally love to see them in another movie again or possibly a Nice Guys 2. Now there is a young girl in this film who I found to falter a bit, there were times she would be really good and to others where it felt like she was reading off a script. I have no problems with this movie whatsoever, the action was great, comedy was funny and all around it was great flick.

"Darkly comic homage to Bud Spencer, Terence Hill, and the 70s!","Shane Black has built a reputation for wayward humor and he certainly lives up to that label in THE NICE GUYS. He is greatly aided by spectacular photography, awesome stunts and a roller coaster of a script often on the far side of believability and forever exploiting the dark humor of any situation.Best of all, the acting: the leads and Angourie Rice are longer on screen than others but I remember short support roles by Keth David (his death scene is memorable), Matt Bomer as the cold-blooded assassin who brilliantly dispatches Amelia, Yaya da Costa as another budding murderess... but it is Rice as the pure soul in the midst of so much depravity, pornography, murder, and all manner of crime, that stands out.Crowe is brilliant in an understated role as a killing machine brought under control by Rice, who threatens not to talk to him again if he kills a murderer. And the bumbling worst detective ever, Gosling, who keeps falling and, as he does so, he keeps hitting upon solutions.The sequence where Crowe and Gosling go up in a lift and see several people killed, close the lift's door and just leave is in the best tradition of dark comedy. The one where Gosling thinks he sees Nixon in the pool is also fantastic. The fight between Crowe and David had me laugh throughout. The porno movie intro at a car demo show is memorable, as is the shootout that follows.Crowe is Bud Spencer to Terence Hill's Gosling, but both are far darker and more selfish characters than that very funny duo of the 1970s - especially the Trinity spaghetti Westerns.No moral values in this film - except the little girl who embodies hope for the future because she cares so much for doing the right thing. She is the highest spire in this unholy trinity.Self-deprecating, great fun flick. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
a drag,"I imagine this was liked because the stars are so wonderful in other movies they've done and we're supposed to feel an allegiance to them even though the writing is poor, the plot is ludicrous and , for me , there's no laugh and the thing drags along with a forceful attempt to make it interesting which it is not. There are so many actors who could have made this funny , perhaps. Crowe almost pulls it off. I find it hard to write enough words for this review because the show is so lame i'm speechless and can't lay enough words out there. I'm mystified why so many like it including all the sites where critics are grading it. Someone in these reviews said maybe there should be a rating added including age groups and that is interesting but i don't know if the younger group or older group would like this. I think the younger group would like this more than the older group. Maybe the younger group is 'catching' something the older group isn't getting or the generations have a vast different sense of humor. But, i think there are universal appeals. Grand Budapest Hotel, Royal Tenebaums, The Big Lebowski, 'Knocked Up' and a zillion other films have around the same ranking at 'The Nice Guys'. This is simply crazy to me. As i watching this i kept thinking maybe there's something i'm not getting, something wrong with me, maybe i'm in a bad mood and i tried to make myself like it. Just this kind of behavior in myself , now , let's me know this show plane isn't good. I come back, again, to that folks just want to have an allegiance to the actors. Most other shows these guys do are great but i think they should stay away from comedy or get better writing and directing.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is definitely a comedy but it's also got a good enough mystery/conspiracy at the heart of things that it moves briskly and it never comes across as a mere spoof or parody.

"A recommended watch, despite its flaws","This movie is great fun, and it's easy to narrow down why: The performances from Gosling and Crow, and the characters they portray. Not only are there several instances of hilarious dialogue and banter between the two, but even some first class physical comedy, way ahead of most other action/comedy movies made these days. Especially Gosling has some hilarious moments.It's hard not to compare this movie with Shane Black's previous film ""Kiss kiss bang bang"", which also includes a hilarious duo that stumble through a mystery that's way bigger than the both of them. There are some differences, though. In KKBB, the balance of competence is very uneven, where Kilmer's character is the competent one, and Downey plays the moral compass. In the movie, they are more even, with Gosling and Crow both playing deeply flawed characters, with each their strengths. The balance works, and much like KKBB, they are hilarious together. In KKBB the female sidekick is also a love interest, while in this movie it is the daughter of Gosling's character. The setting is a bit different, but it is still set in the entertainment industry, and with some similar locations.The movie suffers a bit from too much build up, with too little pay of. There are several elements introduced that seem like they are supposed to pay of in a funny/interesting way later on, but that end up only being used in one or two gags. This movie would have lent itself perfect for running gags, and there's one that has great potential, but is dropped quite quickly (a character that accidentally kills the wrong person a couple of times).There seems to always be some sense of self-awareness in Shane Black's movies, where clichés are either broken, or commented upon. Ryan Gosling's character has a moment in the movie here that very much keeps up with this, where he acknowledges the streak of luck he seems to have. I love how Black plays around the tropes and clichés of the genre, but wish that the story/plot would be as solid like KKBB.So, while this does not hold up to KKBB in many regards, it's still way better than most others out there, and I highly recommend watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An almost perfect film,"POSITIVES:1) The relationship and interactions between Crowe, Gosling and Gosling's daughter are great
2) The film perfectly blends action, comedy, drama and mystery genres together
3) The performances are all very good, with one exception that I'll mention later
4) Pulls off the feel, groove and aesthetic of the 1970s very slicklyNEGATIVES:1) That exception I was talking about? It's Kim Basinger. Why cast someone so well known in a role that has less than 5 minutes of screen time. Her performance was completely flat and dull in a film where everyone is giving the complete opposite kind of performance. She was probably only on set for a day and probably hadn't even seen the script before shooting

A Great Buddy/Detective Movie With Perfect Casting And Great Characters,"The Nice Guys was a pleasant surprise for me. When it was originally released it flew under my radar and I didn't see it until it was available for home viewing. It has all the ingredients for an enjoyable flick: a great cast of actors, interesting characters for them to play, and a well written script (though folks may find some of the plot elements seedy, but that's why ratings exist) with great banter and dialogue. I've always enjoyed buddy-cop movies, though our two heroes aren't actually cops, but an ex-cop turned private investigator, and a tough guy you can hire to teach someone a lesson/deterrence by having him beat the hell out of the offending person. These two protagonists become unlikely partners to solve a great '70s era whodunnit.Both Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling bring terrific humor, drama, and warmth to the pairing of these totally different characters. Their interactions, along with scene-stealing Angourie Rice (the current Betty Brant in the Marvel/Sony Spider-Man movies, and Siobhan Sheehan in HBO's excellent Mare of Easttown), who plays Gosling's spitfire tween daughter, were for me some of the best moments in this film. Gosling especially shows how funny he can be with a lot of great idiosyncratic dialogue mixed in with all the physical pratfalls, accidents, and beatings he takes.I won't spoil the fun, so enjoy this movie.

"The Good, the Bad, the Ugly: The Nice Guys","Shane Black does it again with The Nice Guys. This guy needs to make more movies. Enough said about that, let's get to the review.Synopsis: Set against the backdrop of 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys opens when single father and licensed PI Holland March (Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. As the trail leads him to track down a girl named Amelia (Qualley), he encounters less licensed and less hands-off private eye Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, the situation takes a turn for the worse when Amelia vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric goons, strippers dressed as mermaids and even a possible government conspiracy. Starring: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling Director: Shane BlackThe Ugly: Okay, in this movie Gosling is supposed to be an alcoholic. You have to look really close to see it. Why they kept it hidden in the movie is beyond me. It could have given the movie so much more.The Bad: Much like the alcoholism, early in the movie you have to look to see what the main story going forward is all about. It does come to light, but it takes about thirty to forty minutes to find out what is going on. You don't even see the main villain in Matt Bomer until the last thirty minutes of the movie. But that's okay because of the ""good.""The Good: As I said above, Shane Black did it again. He made a great movie based off one of his scripts. Yes, he wanted this to be a TV series, but Fox wanted Lethal Weapon. So he made this into a movie. That's okay, I don't think it could have been done without the two main actors. They played so well off each other. Ryan and Russell were comedy gold in this movie. Russell as the enforcer is always a golden ticket. And the ""buddy cop"" aspect in Los Angeles is a staple for Black. Why mess with almost perfection?Final Thoughts: Everyone needs to watch this movie. Everyone. For you youngsters under seventeen, you best be asking your parent's permission, as there is quite a bit of language and nudity.

Terrible movie,"The film is so un-funny, I had to stop watching. It can not decide what style to follow.

The plot is a total mess. Characters are undeveloped.
I do not understand why this movie needed to be set in 70's. It was a very shallow depiction of 70's. No one would be playing Pong at home on a screen. The sharp young black executive female aide in a killer suit did not exist in 70's. I think maybe the 70's were used as an excuse to weave low, cheap humor of graphic sex in there involving minors.

We need Ryan Gosling in more comedies!!,"The Nice Guys benefits from functioning both as a genuinely engaging mystery thriller, and also as a genuinely funny buddy comedy. From the get go I was intrigued and straight away I was vibing with the style of the film.I wasn't always on board with Russell Crowe, and his character took a little warming to, but this was more than made up for with Ryan Gosling's performance which was stellar. He is such a great comedy actor and was by far and away the best thing about The Nice Guys. We need this man doing more out and out comedies. The dynamic between the two actors was always fantastic and so watchable. There wasn't too much of a supporting cast but these two acting heavyweights were more than enough to carry the film.The plot was also pretty good. It had some great twists and turns (albeit a little telegraphed at times) and nailed the pacing. Sometimes these mystery films can get a bit bogged down and become convoluted but The Nice Guys played it perfectly.As mentioned already, the style and tone of the film was spot on. The costumes, sets, soundtrack etc all contributed to this great imagine and tone which I loved.

A lot of fun,"The Nice Guys is a perfect movie if you want a film that is not too long, that is able to entertain, make you laugh and with a good amount of action. For me it was a blast because my mood was exactly that one and it totally satisfied my expectations. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have a great chemistry and the contrast between their characters is the origin of some jokes. A mention aslo to Angourie Rice that gives a very strong performance as well. The Nice Guys is as simple as that because it doesn't try to give moral lessons, provide messages or other profound things. Its only goal is to entertain and it surely does. A very good buddy movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Makes Fun of itself and Succeeds,"One thing I love about this movie is that it takes all of the standard action film moments and turns them on their head (often making those moments more realistic by poking fun at them). For example, when Ryan Gosling's character falls from the stairs onto a table during a big chase scene, he hits the table and rolls to the ground very hard and very awkwardly. This film starring Gosling and Russell Crowe is smart, silly, and meta.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Crude and hilarious,"Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe have great chemistry together as a pair of ethically challenged investigators trying to find a young girl. Everyone associated with the missing girl keeps turning up dead, which deepens the mystery.The writing here is excellent, with Gosling showing off his comedic chops against Crowe's straight man. The production values are also excellent, as this movie is set in 1977 Los Angeles, in the seedy world of drugs and porn movies. One flaw came in the background music, with Rupert Holmes's ""Escape"" is heard. This song came out in 1979, and for all of the things this movie got right about the era, this was rather sloppy.But don't let this deter you from enjoying a funny movie, with the crudeness of something the Coen brothers would make.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Low Key, but All Cylinders","""You made a porno where the point was the plot?""
The deadpan delivery of this critical line was a screamer, as were every other bit of spot-on repartee.Gosling and Crowe eschew the usual Hollywood spectacle for this more intimate and nuanced film about two reluctant and shady heroes, mismatched detective/fixers, out on a case.Supporting characters click, as does the story itself (no wasted scenes on either side)

Funny and screwed up! With a sharp acid humor.,"I'm not a fan of comedy films, I admit that there are few that I see. In fact, the reason it took me so long to see this movie was precisely because it was a comedy kkjkk, but I got carried away and ended up watching it. Best decision I made, the movie is hilarious! With acid humor, physical and idiotic comedy, but also with timing comedy, with funny texts and lines. A real hit!Ryan and Russell are the ""nice guys"" duo, I'm a fan of both! But here Ryan takes all the attention, the guy is just unbelievable! Every scene of his I was cracking up, especially with his expressive, corporal comedy, with hilarious little screams and a touch of slapstick. In addition to them, we have Angourie, as the daughter of Ryan's character, who also stands out, and the other supporting characters, very well placed.The script and direction are signed by the same author, Shane Black, who already has experience with films in this mix of slapstick, drama, comedy and action. So, due to this, the film is excellent in each of these points, it may be that in the dramatic issue it is not so much, but it is fulfilling its role. Also, the script is the best thing we see in the film, being one of those that we can't miss a thing, because any scene will be mentioned, used or explained later.Concluding the review, it's an excellent movie to take away that stress, to see something different from what you already see regularly. Funny, naughty, malicious, slapstick, sharp and acid, this is the kind of movie you can't miss, it will lighten your day, it will be a fun time.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Nice Guys,"A little like Shane Black's earlier cult film noir comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, I must have let this one, a seventies tale of a couple of seedy private eyes trying to find a missing girl and solve the murder of a porn star, slip past me when it first came out. Giving it a second look now, I find it's a really well put together and fun movie that lands somewhere between Boogie Nights, Get Shorty and The Big Lebowski, with enough of a personality of its own to like it for itself.Russell Crowe is in fat-and-coasting mode, and doesn't stretch himself too much, but Ryan Gosling is having a whale of a time not being a romantic lead for once, and hams up the comedy all he can. What most stands out about it looking back today is the complete lack of politics, the confident development of the plot, which tours all the familiar film noir landmarks but via its own idiosyncratic route, the hilarious and often shocking twists that still feel believable and add to the story, and the characters, who are all distinctive, memorable and likeable. Even six years on, the basic skill and competence displayed here in these matters is largely gone and forgotten in the TV and movies of today.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't expect anything nearly as funny as the ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" movies. Or the kind of teamwork chemistry in ""Lethal Weapon"". The script is weak and I actually was going to stop watching in the beginning. I didn't get my first laugh until the middle, and there were only a couple after that.

Quality buddy chemistry flick,"My quick rating - 7,8/10. Crowe and Gosling team up in an unlikely crime/mystery film that just works. The characters are acted out just the way they should be which is often rare in buddy flicks. Crowe plays the heavy while Gosling plays the heavy drinker. They get paired up when Gosling is a Private detective working a case that Crowe inadvertently gets roped into. The two of course have no interest in working together which adds to the comedy. This movie is filled with underlying dark humor that sometimes does miss the mark, but overall is entertaining. Also incorporating some little shout outs to spotting the time frame (Tim Allens name on the marquee at the Comedy Store for an example) points out the writers/directors attention to detail. Little things such as this pop up to make you appreciate the care that was put into the film. The story itself moves along very well as the mystery of Amelia (Margaret Qualley) plays out in the porn industry. Explaining what I mean would be in spoiler territory, so watch it to see. I will say that after the majority of the film being so good, the ending just seemed to run out of gas. It didn't let the audience down, it just didn't live up to the excellent work that was already presented. But overall, a very well made movie and I could be open to a sequel if they so chose.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unfortunately, this kind of film needs a somewhat large budget to re-create that era and since it's not a teen sex comedy or one with the current trend of comedy actors doing their shtick, it doesn't draw in the big crowds Hollywood brass hunger for to declare it a ""hit"". Like Black's previous similar buddy-buddy comedy, KISS KISS BANG BANG, this kind of film picks up speed audience wise in the secondary market like Netflix, etc. and becomes a ""cult"" classic.

The cinematography is great, I like the amount of closeups there are in this movie, because it shows the audience how great the actors are. The editing is really amazing, because I never felt bored and the movie never felt rushed. That was also probably because of the terrific acting performances from everyone involved.

Save your money!,"This film is absolute trash. I don't know where to begin in explaining how awful this movie is. Maybe with the opening scene with a child viewing pornography, while his father was passed out drunk. This seems to be a theme in the film, with Ryan Gosling's character too busy drinking himself into oblivion to realize his own daughter is at a party watching more porn herself. I'm not sure why the film makers insisted on this theme of minors and porn but it is frankly disturbing. There is no comedic value and a disgrace. I wasn't surprised when people, including myself walked out of the film. Don't waste your money on this, you will regret it.Aside from this content, the film lacks in comedy with all of the laughable scenes already in the trailer. Everything else is just filler. Gosling plays a complete idiot, who we're supposed to feel sorry for. Maybe the audience could give a damn about him as a single dad raising his daughter alone if he wasn't too busy day drinking and putting her in harms way every other scene. Crowe is supposed to be the lovable tough guy but instead comes across as a bland character who adds very little to the story.

The Nice Guys - A Hilarious and Stylish Neo-Noir Buddy Comedy,"Shane Black's The Nice Guys is a wildly entertaining mix of neo-noir mystery, action, and comedy that delivers witty dialogue, great chemistry, and a nostalgic '70s aesthetic. With Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe leading the charge, this film is a refreshing throwback to classic buddy-cop movies, filled with dark humor and unexpected twists.Positives✔ Fantastic Chemistry Between Leads: Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are a perfect duo, with Gosling's goofy, unlucky private investigator balancing Crowe's gruff, no-nonsense enforcer. Their comedic timing is flawless, making every scene enjoyable.✔ Sharp, Witty Dialogue: Shane Black's signature fast-paced, clever writing shines throughout the film. The humor is dark, sarcastic, and perfectly timed.✔ Engaging Mystery with a Fun '70s Vibe: The film's conspiracy-driven plot involving a missing girl, the porn industry, and political corruption is intriguing without taking itself too seriously. The 1970s Los Angeles setting is beautifully recreated with great costumes, music, and cinematography.✔ Great Mix of Comedy and Action: The film balances laugh-out-loud moments with intense action sequences, keeping the energy high from start to finish.✔ Angourie Rice as Holly March: Gosling's on-screen daughter, played by Angourie Rice, is a standout. She adds heart to the story and often outsmarts the adults around her.NegativesOccasionally Messy Plot: While fun, the mystery can feel convoluted at times, with a few too many moving parts that don't always tie together seamlessly.Not for Everyone's Humor: The dark, irreverent humor and violent slapstick might not appeal to all viewers. If you're not a fan of Shane Black's style (Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), some jokes might not land for you.Pacing Dips in the Middle: The film starts strong and ends well, but the middle section slows down slightly before picking back up.ConclusionThe Nice Guys is a stylish, sharp, and wildly entertaining ride that deserves more recognition. Gosling and Crowe's chemistry, combined with Shane Black's witty script and the film's retro charm, make it one of the best buddy comedies of the decade. If you love detective stories, dark humor, and a good dose of action, this is a must-watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Utterly hilarious Neo noir,"The Nice Guys looks every bit the noir film, with its Los Angeles setting, and the period look and feel of the film. The Los Angeles of The Nice Guys feels like the same Los Angeles of The Big asleep and of Chinatown. It also has convoluted, twisting plot characteristic of many noir films. But The Nice Guys distinguishes itself for being a side splitting comedy up front and only a noir film secondarily, which makes for an exciting combination I am not sure have been done before. The script for this film borders on perfection, and is sharp, witty, and absolutely hilarious. It knowingly and cleverly utilises callbacks and features funny, clever banter between our two leads. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe are also a perfect match with each other, sharing impeccable chemistry. Gosling plays the detective who is lazy, lax, but is intelligent, while Crowe is hilarious as a more serious, though kind hearted tough guy. They are also both masters at comedy, exhibiting great deadpan humour and excellent comedic timing. Newcomer Angourie Rice is also excellent as Holly March, a rare protagonists' daughter who actually gets to help her father and not get kidnapped requiring saving, and unfortunate trope of lesser movies. The film is also notable for being an action film, and there is a fair bit of action in this film. The action is always well done and entertaining. All in all, while the film does slow in some parts, this is usually done for audiences to take a break from the incessant action rather than being a slowdown in pace. As a result the film is tightly plotted and runs with good pace, meaning there is no pressure to stare at a clock or watch. Until I watched The Nice Guys, I didn't know a noir film could be so funny. The Nice Guys would come as a surprise to audiences because it is something, I think, truly unique- an atmospheric crime film which is glitzy, glamorous, suave, and funny.

it was better than i was expecting. is a car movie with jokes,"At first i didnt watched because it was r-rated and for some reason, i dont feel ready to watch r-rated...now i have watched alot , so is time.this is a action comedy in the way that is r-rated because many jokes and the whole plot about two detectives that already look tired and arent perfect, still solve the case.is a car movie about ecology and cars, tied with alot of jokes and alot of nice 60's cars, like the mercedes 280 se convertible that is driven in many scenes.theres alooot of jokes, many, i cant count them all. All i would say, i like when rusell crowe plays guys like this, and ryan gosling is really funny. We need a sequel¡¡¡ this is the kind of movie where i like to see ryan gosling and rusell crowe, because is fun, and is a detective movie¡¡¡",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Hilarious Duo, Fun Mystery","An excellent film. It had a decent blend of comedy/mystery/action, you name it. Gosling killed this role with a perfect blend of comedic relief throughout the movie. He had fantastic synergy with Crowe through the entire film and I really hope they star in a movie together again. There were moments in the movie when I needed to pause just because some jokes really caught me off guard. The story kept me guessing and I appreciated the mystery/crime aspect of it as well. Angourie Rice was great too and I'm glad she received more roles later on. Also being set in the 70's and giving a specific vibe was such a nice touch and they did a fantastic job shooting the film and capturing the environment. 4/5 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Raucous, rousing entertainment. And stuff.","Academy Award winner Russell Crowe and Academy Award nominee Ryan Gosling play the title characters, a.k.a. Jackson Healy and Holland March. Healy is a down-on-his-luck enforcer who'll now beat up anybody for a payday. March is an inept private detective. They're united on a case to find a wayward porno actress named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who's actually got an agenda that goes way beyond just making a sex film.Co-writer / director Shane Black continues to put interesting spins on the ""buddy movie"" formula that he helped to perfect with the original ""Lethal Weapon"". In 2007 he gave us ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". Here, he has two disparate guys who butt heads constantly, when not firing quips at each other. Hell, their first meeting basically consists of Healy beating the stuffing out of March! And this time around, Black also injects the presence of a teen girl, Holly (Angourie Rice), who is Marchs' daughter. She insists on tagging along, even with Healy & March go to places like a decadent party for adult entertainers!Some of the lines & situations here really had me laughing loud & hard. Some of it is also of the WTF, ""did I really just see that"" variety. Black serves up a twisty story that is actually not too hard to follow (although you'll know the villain as soon as they make their first appearance in the tale), and delivers lots of violent, sometimes hilarious action. The cast also includes Yaya DaCosta, Lois Smith, Keith David, Kim Basinger, and Gil Gerard, among others, but it is the natural chemistry between Crowe & Gosling that really makes this work as well as it does.The climax is particularly amusing stuff, with Gosling coming off like some sort of superhero with as many lives as nine cats. It's all over the top and quite a hoot.Set in the Los Angeles of the 1970s, this does a nice job of creating the look & feel of that era - complete with a vintage Warner Bros. Logo from the period.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
