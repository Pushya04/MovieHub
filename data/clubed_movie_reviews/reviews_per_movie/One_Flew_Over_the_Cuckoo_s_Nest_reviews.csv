"Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once","I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism,"Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of ""Chief"" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""What an excellent movie"" is all that  went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece","What a movie, what an excellent movie!!! That is what first went through my mind after seeing this masterpiece. I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...When the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A great order vs. chaos tale that everyone can relate to,"Based on the amazing novel by Ken Kesey, Randall Patrick McMurphy is an antisocial and dangerous man no different than a petty criminal, placed in a mental ward to have his behavior studied. He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.The movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorly-constructed society's approach to the ""mentally unstable"" is, but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphy-like figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing, especially as far as the use of audio goes: some parts just made me go ""...wow.""My only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points, but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point; anyone who has ever hated their job, been accused of something, had some person so self-righteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way, or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Poetic - Powerful - Simple: The Greatness of Cuckoo's Nest.,"The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   ""Randle McMurphy"" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as ""McMurphy"", is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later.  It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds.  Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax.  Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me.  You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward.  The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture.  One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  ""McMurphy"" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the ""normal routine"".  He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a ""date"".Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as ""Nurse Mildred Ratched"".  She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited ""McMurphy"" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the ""Chief"" is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning.NOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece,"The seventies produced some of the most interesting and worthy Hollywood movies. Before the era of blockbusters, and ever increasing dumbing down of the cinema art by the Hollywood power-brokers and greedy moneymakers, there was this short but truly amazing window of time that produced many of the timeless gems. A great portrayal of oppression, this gem should not be overlooked by anyone. Truly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Jack Nicholson at his finest,"It's tough to really judge this movie. Is it Milos Forman's greatest directorial masterpiece or Jack Nicholson's best performance. Tough to say, but the marriage between both director and actor are quite phenomenal. From the first time we see Jack Nicholson to the sad, yet uplifting ending, one cannot escape the sheer power of the film. When a film is parodied as many times as this one has been, typically, greatness can be associated. Well, greatness was achieved, and let's hope this one never falls through the cracks.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Best film of its era,"Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a landmark (one of the few I might add) in cinema. Pretty much everything in this film is at or close to perfection. And rightfully so, it became only the 2nd (1 in 3 films in history along with It Happened One Night and Silence of the Lambs) film to win the top five Oscars- Best Picture, Actor (Jack Nicholson), Actress (Louise Fletcher), Director (Forman), and Screenplay (Bo Goldman).The story (based on Ken Kessey's astounding, though not too similar, novel) focuses on a rowdy misfit named Randle Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson) who is put in a mental hospital with other people (some voluntarily in) who are not all there. Some of these guys include Danny DeVito (in his first role), Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif (in his Oscar nominated role) and the never forgettable Will Sampson who played the Chief. The film, It's actors and scenes will always be terrific achievements in cinema and is one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest of all time.,"R. P. McMurphy, A Korean war veteran pleads insanity and lands up in an institution for the Mentally unwell. In charge of his ward is Nurse Ratched, who has a right control on proceedings, McMurphy challenges the order of things.Let's be honest, this film is phenomenal, and should be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.I read the description here, and I'm not a hundred percent sure I fully agree with it, for me it's more of a power struggle between Murphy and Nurse Ratched. Murphy challengers Ratched for sure, but it feels as though her battle is to get him to conform, he fights against it, and wants to give some life back to the patients.For such a serious and bleak setting, there's actually a lot of humour, it drops to some real lows, but the laughs and lighter moments are so uplifting.Jack Nicholson, what can you say, is this one of the greatest performances of all time? I'd say you could make a strong case for it. The supporting cast are awesome, nobody puts a single foot wrong, acting perfection, Louise Fletcher, Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito etc, sublime.The direction is phenomenal, this is a startling looking movie, and one thing this film has is originality, sheer originality, there is nothing quite like it.At least I now understand the Netflix Ratched series, and the link that has to this movie.You could watch this film 1000 times, and it would still be as good.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A perfect mixture of entertainment and drama.,"Czech director Milos Forman seems to be obsessed with rebellious characters that don't like to go with the flow. Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.Really one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Underwhelming...,"'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman, centers around R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a prisoner serving time for the statutory rape of a 15 year old, among other things. In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).OK, first of all, it has to be said, I had quite high expectations for this movie. It came highly recommend by both my parents, is number 8 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and won the grand slam at the 1975 Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). However, I was left extremely disappointed with this film.While the first 20 minutes seem promising, showcasing Nicholsons immense talent, the film drags for the next hour, trying to convince you to love McMurphy and loathe Nurse Ratchet, unsuccessfully, I will add. Which brings me to my first and largest problem with this film. On the back of my DVD case it states that ""Nurse Ratchet is among the coldly monstrous villains in film history"". Based upon that assessment, I expected numerous unnecessary, unethical punishments, and a complete lack of care for her patients. Well I did not receive that, no instead we got a firm, cold, woman that takes charge of her ward, filled with mentally unstable and perhaps dangerous people, with an iron fist, being nothing but a true reflection of the mental health system at the time. That being said, I am not in anyway completely condoning her behavior. She is far too cold to be an effective nurse and her use of manipulation would not be accepted in today's society. However to asses her as being the one of most wicked, evil, heartless is completely and utter over exaggeration and unfortunately paints the film in a 'State vs Rebel' way.Which leads also to my other major problem with this film. McMurphy, is not likable. At least not to me. He is an arrogant, self-centered 'rebel', who has made the rather laughable decision to get himself committed to this mental hospital as he is tired of the prison work yard. But no, we are supposed to cheer him on in his attempts to rid the ward of rules and boundaries, in other words, 'fight the system'. Perhaps it was 'in' to rebel against the state in the 70's? To me this film reeked of this ideology, spoiling much of it.There are certainly positives to 'One Flew Over' and I can understand on one level why is rated so highly by many critics and audiences. It is well directed, the acting by the two leads, regardless of my objection of the use of their characters, is extremely well done but I do not believe it to be Nicholsons best work, as many praise it to be. There are genuine funny moments to be had and a certain scene revolving around cigarettes is the perfect example of acting at its best. The last 20 minutes is also very well executed and left me somewhat vindicated.Overall however, the particular framing of the 2 leads left me simply annoyed with this film and as such, I was left underwhelmed.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""You're not a goddamn loony now!""","The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for ""hidden"" meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see – Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife – are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that ""something"" is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the ""chronics"" in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene – for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent – a fact that should not be overlooked – but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

Jack Nicholson's best yet!,"I cannot overrate this movie. I watched it last night so I'm writing this review with it still fresh in mind. I had high expectations knowing all the rewards that rained down on it, but the film and Jack Nicholson's performance in particular still managed to surprise me.R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation after given a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape charges. He tries to make the most of his suspected short stay in the hospital and challenges the head nurse (Louise Fletcher) at every chance he gets.Anthony Hopkins has done a great intelligent psychopath, but no one does crazy better than Nicholson. I loved his performance in ""The Shining"" and am ashamed to say I have yet to see ""As Good as it Gets"" (one of three movies he won best actor Oscars for). He delivered an average performance in ""The Departed"" and isn't getting any younger, but I do hope he gives us at least one more role that comes close to the show he put on in Cuckoo's Nest. Watching his interaction with the other patients made me believe on some occasions I was seeing a comedy, but the movie quickly reminds us it can be just as depressing as it is funny.It's hard to find fault with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Louise Fletcher did a great job as the leading actress and strong performances by all the supporting characters made the movie brilliant. Good screenplay, good directing and the music by Jack Nitzsche played nicely with the film.I've seen some hate about the ending, but in my opinion it couldn't have been better. McMurthy could have jump out of the window when he had the chance and I think most of us were rooting for him to do so, but what he does next shows the strong bond formed with his odd friends inside the hospital.The movie left me emotionally blank for a while and then I just felt sad. I'm not going to drop any major spoilers on this site as I know some of you still haven't seen it, but it's one of the few movies that have truly left me staring at the end credits in awe.Conclusion:It ranks as one of the best in my book alongside ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".

One Flew Over One of the Best Movies Ever Made!!! (And that person was me),"First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay.

Extraordinary,This movie will always be one of my all time favorites and therefor I have to give it a maximum rating. It's one of those movies that will always stand the test of time. The whole cast are excellent actors. The constant mental battle between McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) is a delight to watch. You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality. The daily routines in the mental institute would even drive a normal person completely bonkers. I saw this movie so many times without getting bored once. This is truly one of the best movies in that genre.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Greatest Ever Made,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)**** (out of 4)What can one say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Winner of five Academy Awards, director Milos Foreman's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is without question one of the greatest movies ever made and I think it also contains some of the greatest assembled acting that you're ever going to witness.Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is put into a hospital where he's going to be evaluated and right from the start this rebel butts heads with the main nurse (Louise Fletcher). That's pretty much all you need to know about the story because the great characters and the remarkable story just captures you and doesn't let you go until the end credits.There's a lot of credit that deserves to be shared in why this film is so special but you really have to start with Nicholson. If you look at his filmography during this period, it's really remarkable to see the type of roles he was doing. It's also easy to see how these type of films certainly wouldn't be made in today's age and time. Today rebels are shown to be tough guys with no weak spots but films like FIVE EASY PIECES, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE and this one show that the tough rebel can also be highly flawed and not always win.Nicholson's performance here is simply flawless and there's not one false move throughout. It doesn't matter if he's just laughing at what's going on around him or connecting with one of the other characters. It's really hard to think of anyone in the history of cinema doing more with the role than what Nicholson did. Fletcher is also extremely good but for other reasons. It's not so much her ""performance"" but the simple ways she looks at the other characters. She expresses so much with her eyes that you can see why she's able to get the Nicholson character to bring out so much anger and rage. The supporting cast members are all flawless in their own right and really make this one of the most memorable assemble pieces ever put together. Brad Dourif certainly deserves special attention as the troubled Billy.Everything from the music score to the editing to the way the story is build is done with such perfection that I really have no problem in calling this one of the greatest films ever made. The film is full of emotional highs and lo's but this is yet another reason it's so memorable.",,Anonymous,Drama
The Ultimate Backfire,"It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Get Mad If You  Want To! This Is Very Realistic!,"This is undeniably one of the best films ever made in the history of movie making.. In 1975, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" swept all four major academy awards... Best Actor (Jack Nicholson) Best Actress (Louise Fletcher) Best Direstor (Milos Foreman) and, of course, Best Picture!! Only on very rare occasion does this occur... Only a handful of films may lay claim to such an honor!! ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is a stunning portrayal of mental illness, and how even the most affluent nation on earth (The U.S.A.) is totally unequipped to deal with it properly!! Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is one of the greatest performances ever by an actor... The array of all the psychologically debilitating diseases was itemized to a flawless state of depressing realism.. The emotional explanations for the dysfunctional dispositions with everyone in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were so astutely broken down that it evoked a concise indication that not just any producers, directors, actors or actresses could partake in this film!! Such a depiction upholds the proverbial contention that if you are not mentally disturbed when you go into the ""Booby Hatch"" you will be when you get out of it!! In the case of Jack Nicholson's character, he seemed relatively non-culpable for any intense psychiatric affliction, it was a matter of slight discrepancies!! It is as if he was severely punished for not finishing his cereal at breakfast time!! The talent in this movie is incredible.. I liked the television show ""Taxi"" and it stands to reason why... So many of the actors who starred in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" were in the T.V. Show ""Taxi"" too!! The gripping conversation which dealt with a man who was impotent was perhaps the single most poignant part of this film!! The line I remember in particular was ""Do me a favor and don't be on my side, okay""... In the ""normal"" world, the average person is burdened in his ability to communicate with someone else due to a conflict of interests!! In the case of a poorly funded mental health facility, this apocalyptic predicament manifests itself horrendously, and thus has an intolerable proliferation!! Authorities in the mental hospital are restricted by a serious lack of funding, so they are quick to generalize!! The overall situation which garners societal sympathy at a mental health facility is categorized as ""sad"" and platitudes such as ""we will do all we can"" are everybody's precarious form of consolation!!! Mental illness gets a generic label, and, from there, becomes something which is basically swept under the rug!! Here is where the film ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" expounds on their abysmal dissertation concerning mental illness!!""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was based on a true story!! Mr McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was a lone rebel from start to finish with this film!! Whatever the orderlies or the nurses would say, he would disagree with!! It was always an issue that could not be looked at rationally by one patient or the other that compounded the dilemma of mental anguish... Such a plight became the culprit to a lack of thorough communication, and thus invoked an overreaction from the administration of the hospital!! You are branded mentally ill and that is all anyone has to know!! The total lack of egalitarian commiseration with administration was why McMurphy was so belligerent!! The status quo was to subject patients to grave consequences for their actions... Are the nurses and administrators wrong for doing this? Usually not!! It was the gray matter in this film that made it so intellectually riveting!! Mental health patients are often times aware of the fact that they are vilified in the same manner you would a bunch of seven year old kids for not doing their school work!! Their self respect gets relegated to a bureaucratic mandate, and all of this is subconsciously and consciously demoralizing!! If someone were to have a conversation with Charles Manson, they would realize so many depraved patterns of illogical behavior to him, however, if Charles Manson were to say that two plus two equals four, the correct answer does not get changed to five!! What is the point of this example? Mental health patients are not inaccurate in every assessment that they make, just because they are labeled mentally challenged!! What was Mr McMurphy's contention with so many issues is that he would assume a premise of mutual self respect when engaging in an argument with an orderly... This is not a case of defiance, rather an instance of a one on one debate... How quickly the administration would then resort to the cop out of ""Well!!"" ""What do you expect!!"" ""This guy is mentally ill""I have never seen a film like this one!! ""Woman Under The Influence"" which was made around the same time was incredibly spellbinding as well... ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" however, is something which should be put in a category all by itself!! Director, Milos Foreman articulates cerebral despondence to a state of dissonant plausibility with this film!! This becomes an avenue for political debate... Foreman's movie breaks ground on mental illness being one big cacophony of our nation's failure to communicate!! Louise Fletcher is tremendous as Nurse Ratched, her dedication to the tenets of disciplinary policy became vicariously ruthless, her devotion to this standard was extremely deep rooted!! Nurse Ratched's insolence was an aspect of infuriation that was in of itself amazingly thought provoking!! As I have previously mentioned, Jack Nicholson was excellent as McMurphy, the mental health patient who reoriented the ideology of what it means to deal with mental illness... Tremendous film, maybe the best American film ever made... Do you think that sounds strong? Watch the movie first and then tell me I am exaggerating!! REMARKABLE!! UTTERLY REMARKABLE!!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Jack Nicholson may be the greatest actor of all time and this the greatest film,"One of the things that makes this a contender for best film ever is that you couldn't possibly make it any better than Milos Forman did in 1975. Modern filming, editing, sound recording and set design techniques couldn't improve what is, essentially, a perfect film.Jack Nicholson's performance is often cited as one of the greatest by any actor, but everyone in this film executes their roles perfectly. Sydney Lassick is outstanding as Cheswick, character-actor Brad Dourif gives a career best, Lousie Fletcher was rightfully honoured with an oscar; even the minor actors like Christopher Lloyd and William Redfield and hit the mark perfectly.The script is sharp and incisvie. The music is used reservedly to poignant effect. There's laughter; there's tears; there are complex character and hidden depth to everyone except 'the chronics'. The patients are a perfectly assembled spectrum of mental illness; every one hiding some degree of emotional damage or abuse. The way they react to McMurphy's introduction is amusing at times and heart-wrenching at others.Just watch Jack Nicholson's reactions during the first group-therapy session as he realises the passive-aggressive perfection of Nurse Ratched's control over those men. Never has there been a more unlikely build-up of protagonist to villain. McMurphy waltzes onto the ward looking for an easy escape and ends up becoming the unlikeliest of heroes to some chronically neglected people. It's almost like a Western: the antihero arrives in town looking for his own personal gain and ends up taking on the cruel sherrif who runs the place. Except, in this western, the sherrif has a clipboard and a haircut that may or may not have been deliberately sculpted into horns.The ending is perfect too, albeit devastating.If you've never seen this film, this is one classic you won't regret seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Heavy Handed,"I found this film to be quite heavy-handed. Even Jack Nicholson's edgy free spirit routine didn't convince me much.The portrayal of Nurse Ratched in particular is extremely disappointing; giving the character some depth, any glimmering of conscience or conflicted motive, might have redeemed the film. As it is she's little better than an extremely well-performed Disney villain, malevolent and rigid to the end. I can check out The Little Mermaid if I want that.If you want to feel oppressed by inherently corrupt authority figures, here's your movie. If you expected something that presents you with a moral dilemma, you'll come away disappointed. In particular, anyone who's read the book will have the sensation that it's been stomped flat in the process of being adapted for the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
the single-most shamelessy over rated movie of the 70s,"I just wanted to add what may be the lone dissenting voice on this board concerning this movie. Is there anyone else out there who agrees, at least in part, with the heading?  Firstly, movie is very hypocritical in its treatment of the patients by wanting us to feel compassion (fair enough) while making fun of their afflictions. There is the lead actor. Nicholson's performance is fine, if he's playing Jack Nicholson but what's all this anti-hero talk. McMurphy comes across as a completely selfish and self-eserving figure, without much humanity or compassion for others. Louis Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched in a somnambulistic state, dreary monotone and is about as threatening as Audrey Hepburn. Milos Forman's direction is uneven and reflects the hypocrisy of the entire project. This man must surely be one of the most over-rated directors of the era as well.'Cuckoo's Nest' (the title alone proves the hypocrisy point)is'nt one-tenth the movie Nashville is and mainly won all its awards strictly because audiences of the time (and still apparently now)seem to fall for its phony pandering, false emotions and blatent audience manipulation. If these comments help bring the picture down a bit from its lofty position on the top 250 list, then I have done my duty.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
Still a masterpiece after all these years,"Just rewatched this movie on Netflix after last seeing it for the first time some 35 years ago. Still a masterpiece. The strength of this movie is in acting by the whole cast. Not just main characters. To the effect that I would have given Oscar for the best support actor to that hydrocephal dude who never had even a line in the movie.At the core of the movie is the theme of individual freedom vs conformal adjustment to the rules of the society, brainwashing and questioning of how the so called democracy really works. The asylum is a microcosm of the society outside at large. It is opressing but at the same time a safe and predictable environment for some of the misfits (who could leave anytime they wanted, but they never do). An illustration to ""If you give up freedom in the name of security you end up with neither"". Well, may be with ""maximum security""....
So the movie is just brilliant. Everybody shines, even the younger nurse, her wide boggly eyes. It is her who utters the famous ""It is medicine. It is good for you.""One thing that set the movie apart is that hero/villain combo breaks the usual stereotype of good/evil. McMurphy, who is our hero here, is nothing but. He is a cunning criminal thug who is truly dangerous. And Nurse Ratched? She is just doing her job. And from the looks of it, she has been doing it well according to existing standards. That is before McMurphy showed up. Here arrives a cantankerous, uhinged but charismatic fella who starts questioning the rules that she so carefully designed and implemented. She takes it as a challenge. Which was a mistake, because this is how she set her carefully built system on the path of unravelling. She should have sent him back to jail, instead she took it personally and decided to ""break the bastard"". I could almost sympathize with her.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Now I know why they closed?,"This film is a brutal commentary and observation about mental health services in the United States. Many of these facilities have since closed. Many of these patients would be homeless on the streets. I only saw bits and pieces of the film in the past. Finally to see it altogether, Jack Nicholson is perfect as McMurphy. Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward. I guess we see her coldness and true nature at the end when she discovers Bill's indiscretion. She uses it against him cruelly which leads him to tragedy. But I still don't think Nurse Ratched is this monster.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Looking At This Famous Film Then, And Now","Like most people, when this film came out in the mid '70s, I thought it was great. Being still young and Liberal, I, too, looked at the rebel as the good guy and the authority figure as the bad guy....just as Hollywood has wanted us to do for a half century. Over the years, I watched a couple of more times and then stopped maybe 20 years ago.A funny thing happened when I looked at it again a few years ago as someone in their mid 50s: I looked at the two main characters in a totally different light.For the first time, now that my Left Wing rebel days are over, I didn't see Nurse Mildred Rachet (Louise Fletcher) as an evil person. On the contrary, the woman was just doing her job. I also appreciated Fletcher's performance more in here. She is outstanding, especially with her facial expressions. The only negative I could find on her was late in the film when she threatened to tell on ""Billy.""Jack Nicholson's character, ""Randle Patrick McMurphy,"" was generally an obnoxious ass. He must have set the Hollywood record at that time for most usages of the Lord's name in vain. I lost count on all the GDs. But Nicholson's performance was still outstanding: that hasn't changed in my eyes. He was also the perfect actor for that role.Who could argue with either of those actors getting Academy Awards for their performances?Yes, the story was good but it was the acting in general which made this such a memorable film. Without Nicholson, Fletcher, Will Samson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito (I didn't recognize him!) and Christopher Lloyd, this film wouldn't have reached the heights it did.This is an unpleasant film in parts. Mental illness is not pretty, but it sure was a memorable film, I'll give it that. Unlike most reviewers, I don't love this film, but I respect it. It hasn't lost its power, either, nor is it dated.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing and Unforgettable,"Would you go to a mental hospital to avoid a prison sentence? One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a story of patients in a mental hospital and how their life was changed by R.P. McMurphy. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, arrived in the ward to avoid going to prison or working on a work farm and he made an impact. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a memorable story that goes down in history as one of the best. Let's start with the characters. Nicholson plays R.P. McMurphy, a criminal who has history of violence and aggression. He was sent to the asylum after acting erratic on the work farms. He isn't really mentally insane, but he fakes it to avoid going to prison. He thinks he can serve his sentence in the asylum and life will be easy. In the asylum we have Billy Bibbit, a nervous stuttering man with depression and anxiety. Cheswick is a nervous man who also struggles with anxiety. The actor who portrays him did a great job in playing the part. Danny Devito, yes little Danny Devito before he really went nuts, plays Martini, a lovable character. Then there's the Chief. Chief is a 6'5"" mute who everyone thinks is dumb as a rock. He turns out to be one of the most important and influential characters. McMurphy originally goes into the ward to avoid prison but he eventually helps the patients in there. He thinks some of them could survive in the real world and he ends up giving the other patients confidence and a type of therapy. Billy eventually stops stuttering for a little bit. Harding has more self control and Cheswick learns to stick up for what he believes in. An example of McMurphy's ""therapy"" is the fishing trip. McMurphy climbs over the fence and steals a bus with the patients from his ward. He takes them to a fishing boat and takes them fishing. McMurphy had his own agenda but he also helps the patients. He gives them an experience a normal man would have and they have fun. One of the best aspects of this movie is the accuracy to the time period. Men with mental illnesses were put in asylums like the one we see in the film. They experienced the different types of therapy. They took drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti- depressants. Any means to help them relax and make them acceptable for society. They experienced group therapy, which we see often throughout, and something I've never seen before in hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, during this time period there were a lot of problems. If people were overly aggressive or considered dangerous they would undergo electroshock therapy. Basically, doctors tie you down and put conducting gel on your temples and a rubber mouth guard in your mouth so you don't bite your tongue. Then they literally send a shock through your temples into your brain. The idea was to reset the brain and make you more relaxed and in control. The audience witness's electroshock therapy in the film and it is a little disturbing to watch. You can see the suffering on their faces. Finally there is the lobotomy, where doctors drill into the skull or go through the nose to scrape out a piece of your brain. This turns a man into a vegetable who can barely survive on their own. It is illegal today but back then it was common. Character relationships are important for a successful movie and not many compare to the relationship McMurphy had with the vile Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched was the head nurse in the ward. She controlled the groups and she was in charge. Her character is difficult because I couldn't ever really tell what her intentions were. Sometimes she tried hard to help the patients and other times she acted like she wanted to make them worse. A prime example is the one therapy group when Cheswick wants his cigarettes and Nurse Ratched just ignores him. Cheswick grows a backbone and stands up for himself and Ratched tries to put him back in his place and treat him like a dog. That scene really changes the movie and the major events of the movie unfold from there. McMurphy and Ratched would clash all the time. McMurphy would get under her skin and she under his. It made the movie really entertaining and a little comedic at times. Now no movie is perfect and I did have a few problems with it. Mainly it was the ending. It was a fine ending but I feel like it was a little too drastic. I don't want to give it away but it was one of those moments where you smack your forehead and go, ""you idiot."" When you see the movie you will know what I mean. Also what happens to one of the patients is completely unnecessary. I understand he was upset but he didn't have to do what he did. It was a little ridiculous and I can't see it really happening. Overall, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a great movie with excellent characters, a well written script, an interesting, and entertaining storyline. It deserves all the credit it got and will go down as a career making movie for Jack Nicholson. He did a fantastic job and deserved the Oscar he won. This is not what I would call a ""background movie."" Meaning, it is not something you can watch casually. You need to sit down and watch it and pay full attention. That's my advice and without a shadow of a doubt, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and is something I can watch again and again and enjoy every time.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"I'm not stuck in here with you, you're stuck in here with me!","Have you ever found a piece of old schoolwork and realized how dumb you were? That now, with all of your more developed skills, you could've done that same assignment to a higher degree of quality or ease? That's how I felt watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time. 2 years ago I enjoyed the plot, characters, and ending, but now, 2 years and over 150 films later, I can appreciate One Flew Over for what it is: a masterpiece of fiction, and a deceptively challenging piece of art.I'll jump past the plot synopsis and get to the heart of the film: R.P. MacMurphy. The slacker, rebel, that kid in class who just wouldn't listen. How can you deal with a character like MacMurphy? Is something wrong with him? This is a major thematic point in Cuckoo's Nest, and the answers aren't simple. What gives someone the right to make choices for another? What is the point that someone can't think for themselves? Is there a point? Questions beget questions, especially around the idea of ""authority"".That authority is personified by Nurse Ratched. She looks like an authority figure: icy glare, skull- like face. Instantly you dislike the nurse. You're pointed in that direction by the patients. But personally, when looking at her character objectively, I didn't find her bad for most of the film. Let me elaborate: a few weekends ago I met an children's organ transplant doctor. It is the most noble of work, but visually I could tell it took a toll on him. He wasn't rude, or volatile, or detached, but what he described himself as ""serious"". Working in healthcare, seeing things go wrong, that wears you down. I believe Ratched, working (for a long time), hearing mental patients yell about trivial things such as cigarettes, day after day, takes its toll. You wouldn't be a cheerful soul after years of that. Of course at the end she does flex her cruelty and we really grow to resent her, but for most of the film I thought she was just doing her job.This is a great film to analyze because it's so opinionated. Two similar people can see it, and based off of their own experiences will draw very different conclusions about the message and characters. Many others hate Nurse Ratched. I'm sure there are those out there who don't like MacMurphy. Some will say control is necessary, others that freedom is the most important thing out there. Cuckoo doesn't really force you into believing one certain way.The hospital itself if juxtaposing: the setting is a plain, boring hospital with drab white everything, but the characters are quirky and colourful. I loved them all, and didn't find anyone really annoying: Chezwick's extremity, Tobar's big reactions, the Chief, General, Billy, and a near- silent Stanley Kubrick-alike. This band of misfits are a joy to watch, and have some laugh-out-loud moments like Martini eating the dice and the basketball game.Despite the hospital setting, Cuckoo is a generally smile-inducing film with a fantastic script that develops its characters well for the conclusion. And oh, the end. It is really a twist, but the second you realize what's happened, how the chips have fallen, you give an audible gasp. This is one of the great film endings, bitter and sweet, but very satisfying. It may even bring a tear to your eye. 9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A good movie, but a little flawed","This movie is directed by one of my favorite directors, Milos Forman. When I saw it, I expected it to be a great film.  Indeed, throughout most of the film, there was a strong theme being presented, and the film was well-made. At the end however, I expected there to be a great conclusion or a big pay-off.  But really, it kind of turned out to be an ""Of Mice and Men"" kind of story where two guys dream of going far away and living good lives. This did not really fit in with the movie.  However, another part of the conclusion was good where the main idea of the movie was strongly portrayed. I won't say what it is because I don't want to give any thing away, but it involves someone other than the main character dying.  So, I would say that the movie is good, but not great.  It does not measure up to Milos Forman's other films like Amadeus, Man on the Moon, and Hair.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
pretty standard stuff,"A few interesting ideas as a starting point, and from there on predictability all the way. I believe the technical term for this sort of movie is 'crowd pleaser', and it's easy to see why it won so many Oscars. There's redemption, there's hardships to overcome, there's comradery. The predictability and dumbing down is rising to levels that makes the food inside me almost rise too.Case in point: the Chief. Will Sampson played deaf and dumb convincingly, until Murphy found out that he wasn't deaf and dumb at all. From that point on the Chief had metamorphosed into somebody who could hear, and the movie viewers were implicitly invited to pretend like the nursing staff hadn't noticed. Every time something was said, you could see the Chief react. But only for the viewers' sakes, of course. Wouldn't want them to not understand what had happened. Bad case of disbelief kicking in.Still, and entertaining movie, just not a very good one.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent Film-making; Excellent Casting,"Take a book like Ken Kesey's which did startle some and had a good following. I read it in a graduate English class. I remember setting it down and saying, ""That's a pretty good book."" It is well written with insights into the characters, but I didn't get the life I did in the movie. Throw a good director and some great character actors into a film like this; add Jack Nicholson, one of the most complex actors on the face of the earth; throw in Louise Fletcher with her soft spoken acts of terror; and you have a real film. Even though there are a few differences between the book and the movie, I actually enjoyed the book more the second time because the movie extended, for me, the depth of the characters. I don't know if Kesey would like to hear that, but sometimes it becomes a win win situation. The mental patients (some people choose to call them psychos which isn't fair) are wonderfully alive and full of their own being. Nicholson's character comes along and pulls out the humanity from them. I met some of the most wonderful people when I worked at a state mental hospital for a time (I now teach Junior High kids, which is a whole other issue). How would you like to be treated, given their setting? Medicated and controlled? There was a lot of that where I worked and I always thought, you may as well sentence them to death as treat them as you are. I think things are a bit more enlightened now. I think that maybe the movie helped a bit. This one has always been a top ten film in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A Powerful Protest, and a Tragedy of the Failed System","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.Many films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.The most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.The movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.In conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great gem that never gets old,"This is one of the few movies that hasn't and will never age with time. An all time classic. Jack Nicholson is stellar as always but in this role in particular, he just knocks it out of the park.You can recognize some early faces of major celebrities such as Christopher Lloyd and Danny Devito. I've heard that the movie differs from the book but knowing the changes I think it still works. I don't really care about the Oscars but thank god this one got recognized back then, it would have been a crime to not prize this movie. Another thing I can say about this movie is it's subtlety. The main character isn't exactly an hero and the ""antagonist"" can't quite be categorized as a villain. It's up to your interpretation. I thought that was a nice to this masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Err...,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a movie that bitterly dissapointed me. I suppose it was alright, but with all the praise it has received (including being so high on IMDB's list), I expected more than I got.The main problem I had with the movie was that I didn't care for the characters at all. Sure, there were some scenes that were interesting and provided a nice glimpse into one character or the other, but, for the most part, I couldn't find a way to sympathize with any of them. Jack Nicholson did alright in this film, but, at times, I actually disliked his character and what he was doing. As for the other people in the ward, they did a good job, but, again, I just didn't sympathize with them. Louise Fletcher, however, did a superb job as Nurse Ratchet; her icy demeanor was perfect. Again, though, I just didn't, well... dislike her.I didn't find the plot, flow, or atmosphere to be strong enough to make up for the apathy I felt towards the characters (and one would guess that, in a movie such as this, it's critical to one's enjoyment that they care about the characters). While there were some great scenes in the movie, those scenes just weren't enough for me to really like the movie. I thought the movie was overall, bland and uninteresting, and certainly not deserving of all the praise it received.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

hope...despair...hope?,"Cuckoo's Nest fills you with all the awe human hope can give, then it slams its dead remains right in your face, just as you despair it then offers to revive it one more time.A roller-coaster of emotions, one might say.I haven't seen Chinatown yet but I've seen a lot of Jack Nicholson and this is my favourite role of his. He plays a believable Jack-the-Lad, the kind you knew at some point in your life: annoying to some, endearing to others. However you viewed the Jack in your life, he always had time for you, perhaps even changed you in some way.But this isn't just his story, that's the beauty of his character: he has time for everyone and thus you feel the stories of the other characters in that Nest, you might relate with some too, or at least recognise someone.And Nurse Ratched?

An Impeccably Made Film about Repression by Authorities,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 drama film by Milos Forman about the inmates in a mental institution and their struggles against the nurse in charge.The film portrays the impact of the arrival of a new patient at the ward of a mental institution run with an iron fist by authoritarian Nurse Ratchet. Ratchet maintains control over all aspects of the patient's lives by whatever means necessary, intimidation, humiliation, and rigged competitions being common techniques. A rebel attempting to escape the labour of a short prison sentence, RP McMurphy finds the patients being oppressed by the authorities in the institution. Being an anti-establishment type, he continuously butts heads with Nurse Ratchet, and the struggle for the autonomy of the patients escalates.The film is shot in a clear, straightforward, and compelling manner, eschewing complicated cinematography for clarity and simplicity. This manner of filming allows the characters to be the focus of the scenes, and the actors take full advantage of this. Nicholson and Fletcher are perfect in their roles, and their scenes together make for some of the best drama in film.An excellent story whose style accentuates the strengths of the film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not Kesey, But Still Well-Crafted","Milos Forman's film may not be entirely true to Ken Kesey's novel, but it is still, in its own right, an inspiring, well-crafted, emotional and intelligent telling of the choice to conform or rebel.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest stars Jack Nicholson as Randal McMurphy, a prisoner who decides he'd have a better time serving out his sentence in a mental ward, but ultimately ends up enlivening the patients there and showing them the beauty of life.Jack Nicholson's performance as McMurphy is deservedly Oscar-winning, inspiring, and is surely one of the best of his career.  As the naive Billy Bibbit, Brad Douriff is impressive and touching in his film debut.  Louise Fletcher does well as Nurse Ratched, even though she doesn't really compare to the tough-as-nails Big Nurse as written of by Kesey.  She is more than up to the performance, however, and is effective as the ice-cold Ratched.A truly inspiration film with fantastic performances, terrific scenes, and a double-edged, satisfying ending.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An eye opening film.,"Milos Forman's 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is an extraordinary film as for what it can make off of mostly one setting, finished off with a sad but great and meaningful ending. This film is about people, whether they're mentally ill or not.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is about a convict who fakes being mentally ill in order to get himself out of prison labour. He tries to make the best out of his time in a mental health hospital/asylum as he deals with an obnoxious nurse.This movie is about individuality, making the best out of what you have, escapism, explores the mind and it's way of working and thinking, the movie explores numerous themes as for it's mental exploration throughout characters and actions.Milos Forman did a brilliant job on this film, his camerawork to create diversity between each character, his presentation of characters struggles, tragedies, etc. It is all very delicately but messily done. Keep in mind, when I say messily, I mean it as a good thing, no perfect film is actually perfect as the perfect film has flaws which it uses to only make it more unique, diverse, and better. Forman's directing is really special in this film, the way he can work with such a diverse bunch of characters/casting is so incredible and needs to be seen to be believed. The way Forman reveals or presents parts of the script is great too.The screenplay is only incredible, it's way of characters and adaptation from the book is some amazing craftsmanship. To create the character development through each character from its experiences and more. It's reveals, it's tragedies, it's actions, all are so very unique, the entire situation from the start has its own share of spectacularity to it.It's so easy to say such things about any aspects of any film, calling it spectacular, unique, and whatnot. Film reviews such as this one will only work if we're able to call out or name what makes these films what they are. I call Formans work on this film great, but what about it is great? The camerawork, for example? Sure, so what is it about the camerawork that makes it such a great factor to be listed in the review. This is where most reviewers stop, now sure you can say you don't want to spoil it but I think that's a terrible excuse. To further expand, Forman's camerawork on the film is great but it tells the mental state of each character, whether they're scared, sad, mentally ill, or sane. In most of the therapy session scenes, these methods are used for close ups or medium close ups for each character which I noticed and thought was very well done. To continue my rant, I will begin actually analyzing parts of these films that I review for my own good, if I do this, maybe I'll pick up on these methods or whatever you want to call them and use them when making a film or script myself.The cinematography of the film is nothing out of this world, as someone who enjoys cinematography as an aspect of any film, when I don't see something outstanding or super meaningful in a films cinematography, I don't really see it as much which is my problem. OFOTCN cinematography might be outstanding but I wouldn't know as for my lack of knowledge on the subject. Maybe a further focus on the lighting of a film or whatever will do me better as for the analyzation of its cinematography.Those this film is about people, characters, finding themselves in a way, it helps you find yourself, it has helped me find a new direction in these reviews or film overall.OFOTCN definitely, one million percent, deserves a watch, and I'll be rewatching again someday too, and again. Because for what I know, this film helps me as much as McMurphy helped his 'inmates' find a part of themselves once again.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
So much good about this movie...,"What an amazing movie! I cannot begin to describe how good One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is, the whole film has the word classic written all over it. The production values are of top notch quality, and Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent. The film also has a brilliant script, superb direction from Milos Forman(who also directed one of my other favourite movies Amadeus) and a compelling story. The pace is spot on, and there are many memorable scenes especially the very poignant yet harrowing ending. The characters all add a lot to the film, especially Nurse Ratched who is oppressive and terrifying. The cast are all terrific, Jack Nicholson is superb in one of his best roles and Louise Fletcher is just unforgettable as Nurse Ratched. Among the supporting cast are Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Douif, all great. So overall, I cannot fault One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it is considered not only one of the best of the 70s but one of the best ever, and it deserves that reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A cinematic masterpiece,"This movie is easily one of the greatest films ever created. The acting, cinematography, the score, it just comes together so well. This movie greatly captures the human spirit and accurately shows the inner workings of something I think all of us feel in our lives. Nicholson portrays the rebellious patient so perfectly and gives us something we can relate to in one way or another, especially in the way he deals with the corrupt nurses and the hospital. He refuses to give in to their mold and continues to do what he believes in and does not conform in any way. This movie makes you feel a wide range of emotions when the credits roll, making you reflect on your life and the way you deal with others and your own life decisions. A truly special movie that is perfect in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The One film I knew the end, but almost cried","When I was recommended this movie, I only knew Jack Nicholson was involved, nothing more, then I read some reviews, and, unfortunately, realized how the ending would be (No Spoilers).This did't mean I would't watch the movie. I was talked awesomely about this film, and I wanted to see how good it really was.When I started, I could't move away from my TV's screen, 'cause what I was watching, was a real ""Good Film"". Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Randy McMurphy was fantastical, also Louis Fletcher and Brad Dourif, who surprised me very much.Until the end, I was enjoying this ""must-see masterpiece"" without caring about the fact I knew how it would conclude, so, when the time came, I started to feel like talking to McMurphy, literally, to make him aware of what would happen to him. I was caring about Jack Nicholson's character, something Milos Forman nailed.I won't say what happens, because that's something you need to find out, but what I can say, is that I almost cried. The soundtrack, the acting, the cinematography, everything just before the credits is perfect.I really recommend this film, if you haven't watched it yet.Thank you Milos Forman, for one of the best films I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
You would have to be crazy not to watch this movie.,"The more I see older Jack Nicholson films, the more I understand why people think he is such a great actor. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is definitely one of those movies that would not be made the same if made today, and as far as I can tell, it is actually pretty accurate for the way mental hospitals worked at the time. The story of a sane man playing crazy and then trying to make the other patients sane while making the nurses crazy, it just has to be seen to be believed. The story is interesting and kinda heartbreaking in the end, (note to self, never fall asleep during an escape attempt, bad things will happen) and it has a great young cast that has gone on to do some great things with Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif all turning in terrific performances. And yeah, Nurse Ratched is just plain evil.

Insanely perfect,"This will probably be regarded as a very blunt and unpopular statement, but I think that almost one third of the films listed in this website's top 250 do not belong there. Particularly among the first 50-100, there are far too many movies that are either vastly overrated and/or only listed so high because they have large and obsessive fanbases that vote continuously to keep them up there. The opinion naturally doesn't count for a handful of films that are - and forever will remain - undisputable masterpieces. ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is such an undisputable masterpiece, and it actually hurts to see that a landmark like this is getting pushed back in the ranking. I remember, a couple of years ago, this was #5 and all of a sudden, it's only at #18 now.Anyway, I certainly do not always concur with the choices of the Academy Awards committee, but it was the right decision that ""One Flew..."" triumphed in the five main categories, and this in spite of the tough competition that year (""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Jaws"", ""Barry Lyndon"", ...). When your film is considered the best in those five areas, including best script and best film altogether, you can safely conclude it's pretty close to perfection. The story is definitely one of the most absorbing ones ever told, with courageous themes and utmost fascinating characters, and strengthened by the flawless performances of the ensemble cast. The authenticity of the asylum setting, Jack Nitzsche's music, the cinematography and about half a dozen other things all contribute to its pure genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Read the BOOK!!!,"I must admit, I seriously loved the movie and especially Jack Nicholson's unbelievable performance. However, after reading the book, my opinion has definitely diminished a bit. The screenplay seems to consist simply of events of action only. The best parts of the book were the emotional rollercoasters the patients go through. Most of the best parts of the book were completely left out erasing much of the battle between Ratchet and McMurphy. I also missed the use of p.o.v through Chief Bromden's eyes.

so multi-faceted, that no actor could ever portray him the way Kesey did. Nice try by Nicholson, but he just wasn't the right...something (physical build? Attitude?I don't know). Only two novels have, imho,

"One of The Best Movies Ever Made, Simply Flawless","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. Not a great actor, an spectacular actor. This is one of the great films of his career as well as for the rookies, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments ... who could forget the icy glare of the demonic Louise Fletcher, The dialogs of Jack Nicholson and Will Sampson, his impressive performance often without saying a word.The film shows the terrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions at the time, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to leave, to change things for himself and the others. I grabbed the movie, from the first second. I never took my eyes off the screen, and surely i will reflect on the film for a while, I thought it was great the way the movie shows the hospital portrayed as something more like a prison than a hospital.Milos Forman did a great job of making this very powerful contrast to the viewer. The movie is very exciting and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Each actor gives a great performance, each character is perfectly connected with the movie, every line, every frame is absolutely perfect. I would not change a thing in this movie.

When a director adapts a book to the big screen, a better film is made when they're not working within the boundaries of someone elses perception, after all, whats the point of having a carbon copy of the book on screen?

Deserves all its accolades in full,"The first thing to say about this movie, perhaps, is ""beware of the other reviews!"" (lol) Actually, as is common with reviews on this website, many of the otherwise well-written reviews of this movie found here contain factual errors that are not necessarily insignificant to understanding both the plot and theme. (In that regard, this comment pertains only to the movie, not the book.)That said, this is yet another film like COOL HAND Luke or MISTER ROBERTS that deals with the theme of a small group of men under the thumb of a petty but truly malevolent tyrant, in this case the now-notorious Nurse Ratched. Jack Nicholson is the agent provocateur classic to this genre who challenges not only the authority but the actual control the tyrant has been able to exercise up to the point of his entry into the setting, and of course that cannot be tolerated. Given that in this vehicle this kind of action is taking place in a mental hospital rather than a prison or naval vessel, it also raises the question as to what ought to be considered sanity for confinement purposes, at least in a very abstract or philosophical sense. For this is one of those movies that is not at all realistic, really, but a morality play. Thus, in spite of the look of the thing and the inclusion of electroshock ""therapy"" and the lobotomy, real mental illness is not realistically depicted, nor is there any reason to. That's really not the point.Probably the best reason to see this, then, is to see Jack Nicholson as one of the ultimate movie wise-guy personas of all time. One can't help but wonder what what James Cagney or even Humphrey Bogart would have had to say about this performance; I don't feel that either of those greats (or so many more, even including Paul Newman or Sean Connery) ever did anything so compelling. As the anti-authoritarian foil to the villain's oppression, he is about beyond compare. Add to that Louise Fletcher's cold-blooded, pathologically manipulative control freak (the one who really needs to be institutionalized to stop her from hurting people) and a top-notch supporting cast who later became quite famous in other vehicles including Danny DeVito (with HAIR!), Christopher Lloyd, and Scatman Crothers and this picture walks off with the Triple Crown of the Academy Awards.

brilliant and difficult,"an iconoclastic book crafted into a brilliant but difficult movie; obvious cudos to nicholson (back when he was acting), screenplay, direction; shooting is average; oddly, was recently shown (nov '12) on tcm as part of their series on handicapped, disability in film; the strange take being that films showing demented people (or crippled people, or otherwise disabled people) are somehow off, not true, not up to par; the PC culture reigns supreme- even, according to tcm, for movies set in the 17th century, like bedlam; as though best years of our lives should not have shown homer with no hands- even though the book it's from showed him with a horrible series of much more disturbing problems; so if you approach the movie with that PC view in mind it's so flawed; on the other hand it's a tight look at the individual versus the system, the loner versus the crowd, what you think you should do even when everyone says you should not; the late 60's-early 70's message, unfortunately, is that you lose- as though it presages the coming of the nanny state, the transposing of jfk's what you can do for your country to obama's what can your country do for you;though there are many movies about asylums and dementia, this one stays almost till the end on the edge of sane or not; that's what makes it interesting",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An all-time classic about the subversion of authority,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most beloved classics of all-time and features Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, a man who's been ordered by a court to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a mental hospital. McMurphy doesn't show signs of mental illness, but he does have a strong anti-authoritarian impulse, and he establishes himself as a leader among the inmates shortly after his arrival. He's an obvious wild card in an otherwise stable population of patients who are tightly controlled by Nurse Ratched, played to chilling perfection by Louise Fletcher. Ratched employs a host of manipulative suppression techniques to keep the patients under her thumb, and McMurphy becomes her nemesis, attempting to subvert her authority wherever possible. The film, which swept the Academy Awards, on a surface level is about the personal struggle between the ideologies of the two major characters, but it can also be viewed as a metaphor for the culture wars of the 60s and 70s. The film also powerfully illuminates the oppression of the mentally ill under a system incapable of treating them with dignity, as they are stripped of their humanity and kept out of sight from society.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the Last Anti-Establishment Films of the 1970s,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is about the triumph of the human spirit, but it's depressing as hell.Jack Nicholson gave the last of his great performances before he started playing parodies of himself, and Louise Fletcher plays one of the screen's greatest villains, the only role this forgotten actress was really ever known for. Their battle of wills in a mental institution symbolizes the battle of humanity against oppressive authoritarianism, and if Nicholson's character happens to lose this particular battle, the movie implies, humanity is determined to win the war.Looked at now in historical context, this film was one of the last gasps of anti-establishment film making. Vietnam was ending, American political corruption was starting to fade into memory, and the boom years of the 1980s were not far away.

Many times the movie brings you to think, ""what if it was me""? I watch very few movies twice. This is a picture that you can do that !

Just doing her job.,"Having heard all the pop culture references regarding Nurse Ratched over my life I expected her to be an evil abusive psychopath. It turns out she was just doing her job. Jail/prison guards today make Nurse Ratched look like a sweet little pussycat. The things they say and do to people are truly inhumane. Ratched was a woman in charge of a mental ward full of men, she had to stay in control or the whole place would turn into a mess. You never see her haul a patient into a corner with no security cameras and beat the crap out of them do you?She did shame a patient pretty badly but considering the mess she walked into that morning her response was pretty mild, it's not like she killed him or even touched him. Plus, she told the orderly to stay with him and the orderly disobeyed. The real screwups were the orderlies, who spent more time shooting hoops than watching the patients, and the night watchman who wanted to get drunk and laid. I couldn't help but laugh while he was crying ""This is my job!"", like he somehow expected a different outcome to his actions. Come on... You know everyone but the nurses got fired after all that.Overall, it's a good movie. At no point in the 2 hour runtime did I feel bored or the need to play with my phone. I don't hold it to the mythical standing that others seem to but I was pleasantly entertained. I totally didn't recognize Danny DeVito until seeing his name listed on IMDb. His looks changed drastically between this movie and 3 years later when Taxi started. It was also funny to see how many of the actors would later appear in multiple Star Trek series and movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A story of disciplinarians, technically-apt professionals and social custodians vs. the carefree and unfortunate ones in society","When One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came out in 1975, it undoubtedly left an impression on moviegoers that still lasts to these days. It clearly was a direct and frontal indictment on the mental health care system of the day, when antiquated and primitive methods of treating patients with mental illness were still being used. The movie indeed had a lasting effect on the study and treatment of mental illness afterward.The movie presents a difficult subject for many to comprehend and appreciate given the natural perception of many towards mental illness. The movie was a complete success thanks in great part to a well assembled cast of actors, who played complex and vulnerable individuals trapped in circumstances not of their own making. The movie portraits very well the conflict between stern disciplinarians, technically-apt (impractical and unwise) professionals and social custodians vs. the carefree and unfortunate individuals in society, that still is relevant today.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
You Get Out of It What You Bring To It,"I watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest about a decade or ago for the first time and found it quite entertaining. It was also interesting to see how many before-they-were-famous actors were in this movie. It was almost like an audition for their future careers to come! The last 30 minutes were, and still is, a roller coaster ride.
Watching the movie recently, with an older perspective on life and social issues, I'm finding the movie isn't so perfect.
I guess you could look at a movie as a metaphor for society and that Jack represents being an individualist and bucking the system. If you're into that approach to living, then you'll totally relate to his character. On the other hand, if you prefer social order and routine, his behavior will be seen as disruptive and anarchistic.
My view on Nurse Ratched has slightly changed over the years. When I first watched the movie, I saw her as the huge villain. But on repeated viewing, I still see has somewhat manipulative, but not a huge villain. I mean, she does punish people based on them doing something wrong, as opposed to, just doing it randomly. I think the whole TV situation definitely put her on the wrong side of things. But it ultimately was a bit of a power struggle between Nicholson's Mac and Ratched. The thing is, the inmates were not feeling like they were missing much. In fact, as Ratched put it, they were in there on their own voluntary choice. Naturally it makes sense, considering these were not violent mental patients.
Now, the one thing I think everyone disagrees upon is the electroshock therapy and lobotomy approach to treating these individuals. There's no disputing that. But I think in some way, this movie did a disservice by putting people who can't take care of themselves in society, in a wrong light. Like they were imprisoned rather than being looked after. Sadly, today, something like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest doesn't exist because so many people with mental health issues, who should be institutionalized, have been given a bottle of pills and told to look after themselves, on their own.
I know I digress, but I guess the overall message could be, do people who cannot care for themselves, need to be emancipated? Or should it be accepted that they do better when they are in an environment that looks after their needs 24/7?
Unfortunately the last 30 minutes of the movie kind of throw all the messages out the window, with violence. Or is that what it's all about as well? As much as you try to control through passive aggressive measures, the violence is always bubbling just below the surface.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Don't watch this movie if you cry too damn easily.,"Wow, and I mean wow. This movie really got me deeply. It's one of those movies where you feel like the characters are ones you just want to love. Jack Nicholson was far beyond the boundaries of amazing with his performance. Randle Mcmurphy is one of the best characters of all time, and Jack Nicholson was perfect for the part.Okay, so the movie takes place in a mental institute because Mcmurphy pretends to be crazy so he can go to a mental institute instead of going to jail. He doesn't realize that the institute is in fact worse than prison itself. However, he does make friends with patients of the institute. He soon makes friends with The Chief (Not that other guy from Halo), the only Indian throughout the whole movie. I don't want to spoil anything about the character but he is just as amazing as Mcmurphy in terms of character and likability.I'll stop there in terms of the plot. Watch the movie to truly understand how gorgeous this movie really is. This movie could possibly make you cry, so get tissues just in case. Maybe this movie could help promote mental institutes being horrible Nazi-like places.P.S. If you thought PIXAR movies could really get to you big time in terms of emotion, WATCH OUT, 'cause this nearly breaks the emotional barrier of PIXAR movies. It breaks your heart.Gorgeous movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good character development and grade A+++ script and A+++ tear-jerking.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Just a Cinema Classic,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a Drama film that is just a classic of cinema and contains performances that are near unmatched. With clashes between characters and the stories delve into the mind of mental patients, the film succeeds in bringing a sweet story with also a dramatic one, even a little humour seasoned in as well. Overall I did have a hard time giving this it's score but in the end I felt this was solidly a sublime film, and here below is why I felt that way.The story is pretty neat, kind of different I felt from many other Oscar winners in the sense that the characters are not dark people and the movie is never scared of being funny quite a bit. It is fascinating to watch too, just to see such a rich storyline play out in front of you, you realise why this film makes many of the best films of all time lists. One other thing I loved about it was that it is also so smartly done, it's lead character brings the story smart lines and also brings the best out in the other characters, just sensational stuff.Jack Nicholson is superb in this, completely crazy yet funny, dark yet excitable, he just brings a wealth of expertise to the movie and his character is one I shall remember for a long time to come in cinema history. Louise Fletcher is great too, she is very calm, and I mean VERY calm yet the way she portrays it just makes it so great to see and her chemistry with Nicholson is movie gold. Look out for Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others, truly bringing even more quality to the already high quality film.Milos Forman directs well in truth, I did feel that altogether Nicholson among others steal the show and you kind of forget about the directing involved, but looking back it is done to a good standard. I enjoyed the script as well, as said before it contains humour, and that means the film is never too serious or something that is always dark, it has a few sweet spots in it. Even the score for the film is haunting, yet it is also very dreamy and really works well to say it is in a mental hospital with patients constantly taking drugs to help them, score goes with it excellently.So hard to find much wrong with it, but the reason I don't think this is a perfect film is mostly down to the last maybe quarter of the movie, it just slows down a lot and although not bad stuff, the quality we are used to at the beginning affects it's slightly less good end(the actual end of the film is fantastic though). I could say that not all the actors are great but well we can't expect everything, to be fair to them Nicholson and Fletcher get most scenes and dialogue so it isn't there fault.If you like a classic piece of cinema, go watch it, this epitomises legendary plot lines and characters and serves as a real way to do movies. If your looking for Oscar films, again this is probably for you, this has to be one of the best Oscar winning films around and trust me, some people may find this their favourite film of all time. For Nicholson fans, well where else to start or end than with possibly his best performance, he rules this film and stays with you way past the 2 hours this film lasts, just great really.Overall it is Solidly a Sublime film as said, I will add I nearly gave the a Perfect mark showing just how amazing this movie really is. This film is always worth a watch if your compiling the best movies of all times, truly is one the best and the performances are also some of the best. Another good thing this movie does is not to make mental disease seem just stupid and silly, they actually have hearts the characters and can be very nice at times, very great to see such things happening.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

There is no exaggeration that One flew over cuckoo nest is one of the best movie Hollywood ever produced. As Kirk Douglas read the story and wasted no time in buying it He was so exhilarated from the story that he produced a play of One flew over cuckoo nest, but it didn't get that appreciation but it was his young son who fulfilled his dream of turning this story into movie after 9years .The stage was set and the project was given to not so famous Czech native director Milos Forman. The role of semi psychotic outspoken agitating Randle P Mcmurphy was given to Jack Nicholson. Personally I think no one could perform that role so perfectly than Jack had done. He was marvelous and outstanding and very much convincing .All the cast consisted of reputed actors as Danny Devito, Brad Dourif and Christopher Lloyds (debutant) as Jack's psychotic mates Nurse Ratched is considered most coldly monstrous villains in film history. Louise Fletcher intelligently acted as a soft spoken villainous nurse Ratched .No doubt that the movie kept you stimulating throughout and it's hard to forget the impression that it makes on your minds for a long time. One of its kind and must see movie. Won five major category Oscars including best picture, best actor, best actress, best director and best adopted screenplay.

Wow... what a film,"One flew Over the Coo- Koo's Nest is the powerful story of one man, who gets thrown into a mental hospital and makes a difference n the patients lives. This person is Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson. Randle, who is an ex-convict being put in a mental hospital, tries to just be himself in the place and tries to break out. He has some smart remarks made to the nurse of the place, Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who is a cold nurse. A nurse who is not tempted into doing anything and I mean anything, unless it's ""her way."" The nurse's character is still considered one of the coldest characters in movie history.The movie has a lot of action and always keeps you entertained. It has a lot of interaction between the characters, which is good, because you get to know them well. You see the change undergoing between the patients there after they meet Randle, and start rebelling against Nurse Mildred Ratched. It shows how they like to disagree with Nurse Mildred. One of the biggest characters to change was the character Chief. He went form doing almost nothing to moving around and even speaking but only speaking to Jack Nicholson's character Randle McMurphy.The director of the movie, Milos Forman, had different actors in mind for certain parts of the film, made the right decision in the actors that he chose. The cast is very well casted, and most of them went on to so other movies, Including Danny Devito, who got his start in this film. Devito would later star in the hit TV series Taxi. Christopher Lloyd, who also appears in the movie, also starred in this series with Devito.Though based on the book, the movie almost butchers it, according to the books author, Ken Kesey. He was saying that he would never watch the movie in its entirety. This is surprising due to the fact that the movie launched may careers and won 5 Oscars and was the seco9nd movie to win all of the main categories. The film in addition won 6 golden globes, in many of the categories it won Oscars for. The films success makes it one of the greatest films made, even by today's standards. It even ranks #12 on IMDb.com's top 250 films. The movie is very, very powerful.The ending has big twist and you probably wont believe it to be true, but its really the ending that makes the movie what it is today. Without the way it ends, The movie would be next to nothing as a movie, and probably a waste of time for you to see. But that is why Milos foreman is a good director, and Jack Nicolson a good actor.One flew Over the CooKoo's Nest is one of those rare movie that you watch and instantly fall in love with this one. It is a powerful and moving film that will forever capture you heart and really change you. It makes you see what's on the inside. This movie introduces a lot of talent, like Jack Nicholson, Danny Devito, and Christopher Lloyd. It's surprising how a movie like this isn't #1, but it good for where it's at. I personally would give this movie a 10 out of 10 and it deserves all of it",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Epic and Beautiful,"There is nothing that I can say or add that will testify to the greatness of this cinematic masterpiece. Many of the viewers here, considerably older and more familiar with writing critical reviews have already decked this work of art with all the glistening lace of high-brow comments it deserves. Still my concise and modestly candid opinion can nudge itself comfortably in the microcosm of viewer appreciation. I can start by saying that I saw this film two years ago and although I haven't seen it since, the theme and acting is so livid and memorable that it's as if I saw it yesterday. Ken Kessey's novel provides the essence of the story which is beautifully woven and crafted into first person through the perspective of Chief Bromden. Fans of the novel are not only delighted by the crisp, descriptive rendering of Chief's character but also of the characters of the patients of the ward of whom protagonist Randall Patrick McMurphy consists. He at once rejects the policies of the ward which are distinctly aimed at subjecting the patients to a systematic, vegetative mode of life from which there is no escaping. There were scenes in the film when tears welled from my eyes mainly when the other patients acknowledged that they were free to leave the ward at any time, but were afraid. The famous 'you should be bird-doggin' chicks and bangin' beaver' quote from McMurphy after he is stunned by patients' divulgence made me smile at its humor but sympathetic towards his situation.The ward staff are also beautifully rendered and at once realistically strict and unflinching in their tempers. The chief of staff, Nurse Ratched is the most implacable of the ward employees as she does her best to suppress the freedoms of the patients to as great an extent as possible. McMurphy rivals her, or as the book indicates, is at war in a battle field over her strictures and insinuations. The climax of their dispute seems to end when McMurphy is strangling the life out of her with his hands like vice grips delving her throat until the blood flows to her face and cheeks. At this juncture, there seemed a remote chance that McMurphy had won the battle, but here, Ken Kessey shows Nurse Ratched's despotic wield of authority. Although it seems destined, the death of McMurphy's mind through lobotomy and then his physical death at the hands of the chief conclude the film on an idyllically sad note.Randall Patrick McMurphy's fictitious existence is just a small example of the mavericks in society who have risen up against powers which threatened to be far greater than their own. They have stood at the doorstep of impossibility and shattered it through courage and forbearance.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Nothing really happens, there are flaws in the story, and are you supposed to think that head nurse is evil? I never thought so, she was just doing her job or what? Darth Vader, there's your baddie, or Emperor Palpatine these guys are mean.I gotta admit I laughed a few times, and this is not a bad movie. But masterpiece?

One of my all-time faves; Flawless Jack- classic American film,"ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975) **** Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, WIlliam Redfield, Will Sampson, Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Scatman Crothers.  One of my all time favorite films: Winner of five Oscars in all major categories (the first film since ""It Happened One Night"" in 1939 and only recently succeeded in 1991's ""The Silence of The Lambs""): Best Actor (Nicholson in his best performance of his career); Best Actress (Fletcher); Best Picture; Best Director (Milos Forman) and Best Screenplay Adapted From Another Medium (Lawrence Hauber and Bo Goldman, based on the novel by Ken Kesey).  Boisterous tale of feckless restless spirit Randle Patrick McMurphy who is committed to a mental institution after several unsuccessful rehabilitation in the cooler where he faces impossible frustrating and comic odds with some vivid characters and compelling dramatic storytelling.  Fletcher's calculatingly cool as a cucumber, castrating Nurse Ratched is the main obstacle in many encounters that test the human condition.

Cozy,"One of my favorite movies. A script that curbs preconceptions with people with a psychological, social or mental health problem. They show that they are sick people, as well as people who break and need treatment to treat a broken arm, or even those who need resaccioliation.

"Most of the times, a film that's rebellious has brought joy to me, and this was a great rebellion movie.","Most of the times, a film that's rebellious has brought joy to me, and this was a great rebellion movie.R.P. McMurphy (Fondly regarded as Mac or Randall) has to fight a nurse in a mental institution and before he fails he brought one man, freedom. The Chief got free and indeed freed Mac too. Death can be such a relief in a painful world It's better to die than to go through monstrous pain that shall make us fall one day so much painfully Jack Nicholson as R P McMurphy gave us one the best anti authoritarian, anti establishment, recidivist, performances that we have rarely seen. Look at home, giving the commentary of baseball match, explaining in great detail each intricacy of the game, or the way he brings the patients on one platform by playing a basketball game. He does so many things from fishing to partying, to make those poor sick people happy but succumbs to the torture and is let free by The Chief (Will Sampson).Miss Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is the authoritarian nurse who feels that she is doing a world of good, by listening to the patients giving them medication and controlling them by her henchmen, she is not all evil but most of her certainly is evil. We don't like dictators for one reason, because we want to dictate our own terms, we want to free ourselves from the bondage set by anyone else and bind ourselves by our own will to something. Ratched was hated because she set the terms, irrespective of the amount of pain she was going to transpire within those poor souls.And thus, R P McMurphy, who was till then a sane man, got wild, weird and mad.Watch the movie for performances more than anything. The writing was good but I can't say great as it is mostly confined within the premises of the mental institution where patients stammer, mutter, scream, yell and even be silent. So how they act is more engrossing than what was written. The Chief's stoned emotions Cheswick's fight for cigarettes, Billy's plea not to tell his mother. All are acted out extremely well. For extracting such great acting from the cast, I give Milos Forman, the director complete credit and he has done an outstanding job indeed. He stood out as the watchman, the captain, watched each emotion and molded them wonderfully to make us see what this film stands today.The lighting, sound and cinematography are good. The music was great, it was not that creepy, or sad music, it was just as required for a scene. I'd rate this a great movie, as it brings alive the spirit of rebellion and I love to control my own life, even if I have to rebel for it.This is a 5/5 movie and one of the finest pictures known for acting, it's a triumph even in tragedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Deserves all the praise it gets,"It has been almost 40 years since One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest first entered cinemas but its impact has not diminished. Cuckoo's Nest is one of only three films to win the 'Big 5' at the Oscars (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay and Film) and it is easy to see why. Jack Nicholson excels in the lead role as Randle P. McMurphy, a streetwise conman faking mental illness so he can spend his time in a hospital rather than a jail cell.Nicholson draws on all his talents as he does battle with the despicable Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, who seems to revel in the torment she inflicts on her patients. The conflict between these two characters is the driving force in the film, as Ratched strives to maintain order in the face of Nicholson's gleeful anarchy.Perhaps the most surprising thing about Cuckoo's Nest is how funny it is. There is always a danger, when making a film about mental illness, that the subject matter becomes too dark and depressing. Cuckoo's Nest is able to avoid this by populating the hospital with a number of memorable, and funny, characters. Rather than laughing at the patients and their illnesses, the movie explores their idiosyncrasies and, with stellar support from the likes of Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, never threatens to mock the characters.Director Milos Forman handles the pacing perfectly, with the movie flitting between comedy and drama with ease and never once feeling like it is overstaying its welcome. For a film almost exclusively set in one location, it moves along at a rollicking pace, with McMurphy pushing Ratched closer and closer to her limit, until we reach the absolute gut punch of an ending.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is an absolute classic – one of those instances where everything just seems to work together to create something truly special. It contains, arguably, Jack Nicholson's greatest performance, a cracking script handled perfectly by a talented director and one of the most iconic endings in Hollywood history.

Jack Nicholson displays a top-notch performance as Randall P. McMurphy.  McMurphy is an ex-con who's doing time in a mental hospital in order to avoid doing hard labor.  The hospital staff see this and want to send him back.  McMurphy wins the admiration of his fellow patients, and becomes the leader of the group.  However, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher, Best Actress Oscar) has different plans.  As a means to show her dominance over McMurphy, she tests his character by punishing him, and the other patients, with certain rules and mental/physical torture.  The movie is not totally humorous either, but even frightening too.  There is one nightmarish scene in the movie when McMurphy undergoes ECT.  Many other different events ensue, which pit McMurphy against the control of Ratched.  The ending is both a tragedy and a triumph of the human spirit.  Excellent acting and screenplay.

Classic movie,"ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, an exploration of life inside a mental institute in America in the 1970s, is THE definitive exploration of mental illness put on film. It's a classic for a good reason, a movie that has it all: laughs and heartache, drama and pathos, feel-good moments and scenes of pure tragedy. The film is an adaptation of a novel but it's the screenplay which proves so successful, making perfection out of the story elements.Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast in the edgy lead role, playing the new guy who comes into the ward to shake things up a bit. Nicholson always has that wild side to him and he plays it perfectly here. As the antagonist, Louise Fletcher has a much more rounded character than you might expect; although she's cast as the villain, she's more complex than that, truly convicted that her ways are the best.The film is also notable for the prevalence of familiar faces in the supporting cast, many of whom went on to better things. Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson are the stand-out players, many of them so young as to be virtually unrecognisable, but all revealing the greatness to come.The intensity of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST builds as the story progresses and the stakes are raised, with the narrative in the end proving to be a life and death battle between humanity and the establishment. It doesn't get much more powerful than that, huh? And the ending, although bittersweet, is sheer perfection realised on film. I can't wait to watch this one again.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece,"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is my all-time favorite film.  This movie excels on so many levels:  acting, cinematography, storyline, directing, music, and intelligence.  Added together, this is one of the most amazing movies to ever hit the big screen.Jack Nicholson is amazing as McMurphy, who's ""crazy to be in a loony bin like this.""  That loony bin is where the story is told; it is one of isolation, of human fears, of human mind, and of human triumph.  Nicholson has had many great performances, such as Chinatown and The Shining, but this is the movie that made his mark.  He is very convincing as a maybe-crazy, maybe-sane man.Then there is Louise Fletcher as the calm and very consistent Nurse Ratched. Her performance was simply brilliant.  Supporting performances from Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Douriff are also terrific.The storyline is one of thought provocation.  After watching this film, one should (and hopefully will) wonder who was crazy and who was not.  Many of the people were simply scared of society, others couldn't handle their fears, some were legitimately ""out there,"" but who exactly knows?  That is the beauty of this film.  It asks many questions:  What makes one ""crazy""? How has society defined it?  How do we react to it?  What can we do about it?One Flew also contains the best climax to ever be shown on screen.  It is probably the most powerful moment to ever be viewed.  The ending is also tremendous and tremendously performed.Cinematography was excellent and added to the feeling of isolation.  The music was terrific; I recommend owning the soundtrack.  Milos Forman did a tremendous job in bringing everything together to make this film a simple masterpiece.Many people wonder what class this film belongs to:  comedy, drama, or comedy-drama.  This is a question mark because there are elements of both comedy and drama, but it can be viewed, I think, in all three ways/styles. I can definitely say, though, that this film is a classic.Rating:  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant film but...,"For me, this film is very tough to rate because the book is one of my all-time favourites. So let's be fair, Nicholson gives an excellent performance as McMurphy, his chemistry with the other actors is great and really gets you, the viewer, on his side with his likable persona. The supporting cast also gives a strong performance, providing the perfect pitch of crazy that is required and Nurse Ratched providing an instantly unlikable presence. So, if i had seen this film without reading the book i would probably be able to give it a higher mark but...well now the problem begins because, you see, the novel is perfect and the film is not wholly true to the novel. The major thing that really bothered me right from the beginning was Nicholson. Nicholson could never be McMurphy truly because he just does not have the physical presence that is required for a rugged street fighter type, it was a battle he could never win. The other problem for me was that the darker side of McMurphy wasn't shown as well as it could have been, meaning that the character could (and should) have had more depth. Chief Brompton was cast perfectly though (his character could have been given more attention though). So in summary, great film, see it...but read the book first, even if it blights the film, its worth it!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Sad True,"First I'd like to say how unbelievable it is finding out the concept of mental facilities. No matter this movie was filmed over 40 years ago, I still think it's mostly applicable to methods that are being used in modern age as well. I suggest it's much easier to give a patient ""a happy pill"" to do all the work. I find it very disturbing, especially a part where they put electricity through your brain. Like that can do any good for a patient. In my opinion, those people weren't patients at all when they first arrived. I think it's applicable to present situation when people are sent to these madhouses. They arrive mostly like Mac did. I definitely wouldn't call him crazy. Those people just need someone to talk with, someone who can understand their feelings and help them solve any sorts of problems in a healthy way. But it's much easier to make a plant out of a human and announce he is insane, isn't it? I felt throughout the whole movie like they didn't even want their patients to recover from their, so called, madness. You convince yourself in that kind of environment that you actually are crazy, especially when you follow their rules and schedules. The littlest confrontations and changes of rules shock the whole system. That's exactly what Mac has done. Anyway, I didn't even feel like I was watching a 40-year-old movie because of its timeless thematic. Well, I only realized it because Jack Nicholson is not so young anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Good Movie,"Set in the early 60s, the story involves R. P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of ""Chief"" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

** 1/2 (Out of four),"Foreign directors tend to create films with disturbing subject matter. Czech auteur Milos Forman is no exception.  His films have taken on issues of freedom underneath even the vilest of expressions, whether they be pornography or mental wards.  ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is set in the latter, and its tale of a recently-indoctrinated inmate who inspires the other ""lunatics"" is noble.  Yet great art is not always determined by courageous ambitions.  Ironically Forman, unlike most of his foreign colleagues, has a Hollywood touch which proves condescending to his material yet rewards him when the Oscars come calling.  ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a prime example of Oscar-bait, assuming a certain knowledge on the human condition yet remaining hollow in the center.Jack Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, mental inmate extraordinaire, able to get withdrawn Indians speaking and stuttering momma's-boys laid.  As the movie begins, McMurphy enters the domain of Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher), a blue-eyed orderly with a heart of stone.  Soon enough, he's able to bond with his fellow inmates (including promising up-and-comers Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd and Forman regular Vincent Schiavelli) through evening poker runs, basketball games, fishing trips and drunken defiances of authority.  Indeed, the man's so inspiring that it's a wonder Robin Williams didn't snag this movie for his own.And therein lies the problem.  McMurphy, it is clear from the outset, is not even a character.  He's a symbol, enacting Bugs Bunny-esque guard smooching and still possessing his abilities to score women despite his current mental condition. This is no accident, because Forman and his screenwriters make an effort to set McMurphy apart from the ragtag group of nutjobs by contrasting their white uniforms with his snow cap and blue jacket.  This plunges the heart out of Ken Kesey's original novel, which illustrated the bond between McMurphy and the other characters.  Jack Nicholson, however, plays him as if he were a religious artifact, smirking all the while like he knows he's a pedestal above each and everyone else in the sanity department. The subtlety of character emotions exerted in real-life is altogether lacking in many scenes, such as McMurphy's over-the-top rendition of watching the World Series. Indeed Nicholson seems here to be pleading for the Academy Award from his acting peers (which he ultimately, and predictably, won) which was only understandable after years of Roger Corman trash-pics and four Oscar nominations with absolutely nothing to show for it.  His performance here was the first of many where he decreasingly lost touch with the subtleties of his profession and decided to go for comedic, crowd-pleasing broke simply by playing off his own stereotype.If there is one performance to note here, it belongs to Louise Fletcher. Cold, calculating, but always protruding her frigid qualities with nothing more than a stare, Fletcher's portrayal of Nurse Ratchet earns its spot on the cinematic hall of fame.Yet in the end it's not enough.  Not even Haskell Wexler's tight, expert cinematography and intriguingly funny bits of dialogue (as the movie went on I kept wondering why males don't use the euphemism ""beaver"" anymore) can save Forman's film. Of course one can easily deduce a pattern from the Czech helmer's career.  From ""Hair"" to ""Amadeus"" (still his best film) to ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", Forman has had no trouble plunging into the depths of certain issues which repress humanity.  Unfortunately, however, one can never reach the full effect of triumph of the will when one's story is supported by a cartoon.",,Anonymous,Drama

Recommended movie,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman earns a 8 out of 10 star rating by me, one reason being how closely the movie relates to the novel. If were to not have read the novel before watching the movie, I would have gave this movie a 10 out of 10 star rating. I feel that the movie left out important scenes that were made very important in the novel. Another reason why I would give this movie a 8 out of 10 star rating is how the characters compare in the novel and the movie. Each character seemed to be different in the movie than they were in the novel. Although I am giving thi movie a 8 out of 10 star rating, I would recommend watching this movie, preferably without reading the novel prior to the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A perfectly crafted commentary on the treatment of the mentally ill.,"Milos Forman brings his directional skills to the max with a film that perfectly captures feelings of claustrophobia and conflict thats only elevated by quite possibly the greatest cast in any film ever. The main attraction is of course Jack Nicholson as McMurphy, but every single member of the cast has at least one iconic moment. And the ending is such an emotionally captavating and beautiful example of film technique that it would be criminal for me to say anything about it.

except for the endings this movie was almost perfect,"A tragedy drama that makes you look forward to what Jack is going to do next.I remember the feeling I had the first time I watched this movie over 10 years ago, the feeling was mutual watching it again in 2012.The movie is based on the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey and it was shot at Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon, which was also the setting of the novel.The director Milo Forman made sure that you get to feel a sort of attachment with the characters so you share their feelings of joy, sadness, remorse and loss at various times in the movie.The movie is blessed with some nice classic actors like Jack Nicholson, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito just to mention a few.The movie focuses on the free spirited Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent for evaluation at a mental hospital.Upon getting there Randle had an idea that he was to do time, not knowing that he was there till the doctors say he is free to go.He made friends with some of the patients in the institution like mama's boy Billy (Brad Dourif) and silent Native American Bromden (Will Sampson) who all thought was deaf and dumb and whom he called Chief.The psyche ward is handled by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who is seen more like the antagonist in this flick.McMurphy was an instigator of unruly behaviour from breaking him and his fellow patients out from the hospital to go on a boat trip and to a night party at the hospital which led to a tragedy.The movie did have a message, live free, be happy don't allow yourself to be tied down by anyone or anything or let either stand in the way of your happiness.Two of Milo Forman films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), both gained him an Academy Award for Best Director.The movie was the second to win all five major Academy Awards which were Best Picture, Best Actor in Lead Role, Best Actress in Lead Role, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.The thing about the movie that gets to me most has always been the ending, tragedy never sits well with me sometimes especially in the case of this movie.Well if you haven't had a dose of this movie, then you need to.www.lagsreviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"""Crazy"" Good","I heard nothing but good things about this movie and I finally understand why. Absolutely PERFECT!! Jack is flawless as per usual and I enjoyed the supporting roles of A-list actors such as Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. The film flows in such a way that it seems to submerse you in the mental institution portrayed in the film and at certain points makes you feel a little ""nuts"" yourself. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the film has very little or perhaps no musical score at all from what I was able to tell. I especially like movies with no score because it makes you pay attention and listen to the dialog even more in my opinion. Overall, I recommend this movie to absolutely anyone.

Movie versus Book,"This was a genuinely good movie, but if you read the book by Ken Kesey the movie was a rather large let down. Nothing can sum this story better than the book. Personally I would recommend reading the book. It tells a much more in-depth and touching tale. But the movie is a good substitute if you can not read the book. The movie tells the tale of old McMurphy only, while the book looks at the perspective of the old Chief Bromden. The movie does not do the Chief justice. It does not fully portray his character like the book does. The movie did have good acting though by Jack Nickolson which helped give a sense of reality to the story. The horrors that occurred in the mental institution are not exaggerated. The horrors of Lobotomy and Shock Treatment really did occur in some mental institutions. Overall I would just like to say this was a good movie, but one should consider reading the book.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A justified exposure of the very limited, often potentially detrimental, tools available to treat mental illness, even in the early '60s","Firstly, I invite you to read the review entitled 'the spirit of freedom vs. The spirit of legal-ism': currently, the second review under the category of 'featured' reviews, to get a good idea of the overall message of the film. No use my repeating that here.I will largely confine my review to several specific topics covered by the film.Firstly,: Smoking. Of course, in recent times, smoking has been banned in psychiatric wards. But, this film takes place in 1963(released in 1975), when the Yankees are battling the Dodgers in the World Series, when smoking, wasn't banned. It is well known that mentally ill people, in general, and schizophrenics, especially, tend to be smokers, and we see evidence of that in the film. At one point, Nurse Ratched severely rations cigarettes, as punishment for Jack Nicholson's character winning everyone's cigarettes in card games. As a result, one patient pleads that he has to have some cigarettes. Nurse Ratchet denies his request. He goes berserk, creating quite a scene. It should have been obvious to Ratched that he was suffering from nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but she wasn't sympathetic. Finally, Jack's character breaks the glass in front of the cigarette cartons, and gives a whole carton to his friend. Today, there are a variety of methods for intaking nicotine without smoking or chewing tobacco, that weren't available then, as well as several drugs that reduce symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.Second: The abominal practice of lobotomy: removing part of the brain. 50,000 instances of this barbaric procedure in the US, alone, are recorded. Occasionally, it improved the patient's behavior, but more often it rendered then severely retarded or even dead. This was mainly practiced from about 1940 to early 60s, before more effective and safer drugs became available. In the film, this is not shown, but the scar on the forehead, as well as their much diminished behavior, implies its use on one patient. Actually, in this case, it was more a punishment for trying to strangle nurse Rachid.Thirdly, the still commonly used technique of electroconvulsive therapy, is dramatized, as then practiced. Like lobotomy, this was subject to possible important detrimental effects, as well as, possible benefits for the patient. This technique has since been modified, using a smaller electric current, and done under general anesthesia, to create a temporary small brain seizure, which somehow may improve symptoms, with much less danger of significant detrimental effects. In fact, I was subjected to 21 such treatments: an extraordinary number, and very costly to Medicare because of the anesthesia. I got the impression that this was partly punishment for maintaining that my anxiety was originally due to a bout of lead poisoning from lead paint scraping. The doctors chose to discount this possibility, as there was nothing they could do about that. Instead, they judged this to be a psychotic delusion, ignoring several symptoms and a blood test done elsewhere. So, what was the result of these 21 expensive treatments? Nothing either the doctors or I could notice!. I still stubbornly maintained that, among other things, I was suffering from lead poisoning, which I am still certain of, still suffering the same symptoms years later, and being forced to retire from my job, which caused great financial stress. No treatment could diminish the importance of that in my mind. Rather, it has taken time, and several financial 'miracles' to reduce my anxiety about my future well being.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

McMurphy quickly gains fame and thus the support of the retarded people. Together they repeatedly break the rules and regulations of the asylum and are punished. Believing he doesn't belong there McMurphy decides to run away until things take a very tragic turn.The idea of the director to break away from normal day routine and enjoying life is conveyed strongly by the ending which tells us that even though McMurphy himself is not there but his idea of 'life' is.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Of course I was probably not even 10 years old, but even then I remember it being an interesting movie that wasn't as good as Star Wars or Jaws, but certainly painted a horrible picture of mental health facilities. Although I was young, I remembered enough of the movie to not want to re-watch it, at least until recently.Well it came on a commercial-free cable channel, and I decided to DVR it. And wow, I was blown away when I watched it. The acting is amazing. I mean, TRULY amazing. The story immediately pulled me in, and each scene is sharp and riveting.

Not without flaws,"This is a very fine movie in many ways, most of which were rightly recognised on its release. It is marred, though, by a script (possibly accurately reproducing the tone of the source novel, which I've not read) which has an overly simplistic approach to its characters, in particular to its protagonist McMurphy and his nemesis Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is our typical anti-hero, held up for our approval in spite of being an unrepentant apologist for grim offences; whilst Nurse Ratched is shown no mercy (and therefore given no depth) by the authors. This could have made for a two-dimensional movie. Fortunately the actors reached way beyond the binary world they were presented with and infused their characters with, in Nicholson's case, roguish charm and, in Louise Fletcher's case, inner complexity. They are both magnificent and richly deserved every award they won for their performances.They are superbly supported by a remarkable crew of scene-stealers - Danny Devito, Sydney Lassick, Scatman Carruthers, Christopher Lloyd, William Redfield, Will Sampson - and by a quietly effective, apparently one-off performance by Lan Fendors as Ratched's assistant nurse.The polarities of the film - conformism/individualism, control/freedom - are eternally important themes in our lives. In Milos Forman the film had a director who completely understood the significance of the material, crafting a film of real power with his DOP Haskell Wexler. But to me its message is weakened by the way its women - with the exception of Ms Fendors' taciturn nurse - are polarised as either dragons or whores. I've read that before Ms Fletcher was offered the role of Nurse Ratched, a number of actresses had turned it down because of the script was so misogynistic. This demonstrates why Ms Fletcher's achievement is so great: she carefully sidestepped the dragon the script offered up, instead creating someone altogether more difficult to write off in such simple terms. It is an outstanding performance, and remains the best reason to revisit this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

She makes what she thinks is best for the patients.. And they know they can get out.. when she is in control, everything is calm.. no joy, but not a mess as when McMurphy steps in.. that is the other extreme.. Actually my favorite character was Billy..

I will say that some of the content could be disturbing to those who have not read the book or are not familiar with mental illness. I feel that the movie can be enjoyed by everyone.

A good film but lacks the paranoid dimension of the novel,"Ken Kesey's novel is narrated by Chief Bromden, who reminisces lyrically about the Columbia River country where he grew up.  He also has insights into what is going on in the hospital, such as microphones in the broom handles, and machinery within the walls. But, then, he is a patient in a mental hospital. So that's our narrator, a paranoid schizophrenic. One of the features of film is that the camera is objective.  A few directors have tried to create a subjective camera, most obviously by giving it the point of view of the main character or even the narrator.  I seem to remember an Alan Ladd vehicle, The Lady in the Lake I think it was.  But audiences generally trust the camera's objectivity. So instead of getting this story from a paranoid schizophrenic mental patient, the film gives it to us as objective truth. That the central message of freedom comes across is a tribute to Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher in particular. But there is a dimension missing, and to my mind it is Kesey's implication that America is a madhouse, and the only sane people might be those considered by the society to be mad.  Maybe others see that implication but, having read the book before the film was released, I find the certainty of the narration undermines that dimension.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Order vs. Chaos,"I've been meaning to watch this movie forever as Im a big Jack Nicholson fan over the years but either kept forgetting or never made proper time to sit down and watch from start to finish. Today was finally that day and what a magnificent piece of art work this movie is. An all time classicThe social commentary this movie provides is a very authoritarian and oppressive regime in the form of a mental hosptial with it's patients lead by control freak and sadistic Nurse Ratched. Ratched likes everything done her way and her way only. She's not so much of a physical threat or does any physical harm to her patients, it's the psychological mind games she sometimes inflicts.Then along comes Randal McMurphy, a criminal who fakes insanity in order to get out of serving time in prison and overall a true free spirit. McMurphy is 100% authentic beating his own drum who not only befriends some of the paitents most notably Danny Devito, Brad Dourif, Will Sampson and Christopher Lloyd's characters becoming not just a friend but a leader and a symbol of hopeIt is through his rebellious but also kind and compassionate personality he challenges Ratched's authority several times throughout the movie, giving his friends new life and the ability to be themselves without the fear of oppression. The most touching part throughout all this is McMurphy's friendship with Chief Bromden, a native american who a mentally broken individual who pretends he is dumb and can't speak when really he can and he's also a war veteran who has seen and been through too much who through his time with McMurphy begins to find new found confidence in himself again and the ability to live againAlthough sometimes you can't always beat the system not just in a mental hospital or whether it's at work or through our Governments and what society perceives of those that are different to anyone else, you can sure as hell break the system and not live in fear.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThis film is a classic that should be seen by everyone. The story is funny, disturbing, and the characters are so unique and genuine. The story shows us what can happen is authoritative figures become consumed in their own power.The acting is amazing. Jack Nicholson is perfect. He plays a wisecracking man who defies all authority. Louise Fletcher plays the infamous Nurse Ratched. She is absolutely perfect. All of the actors in this film perform very well.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is short for the source material.Milos Forman has made films, that on paper seem mundane and boring, that capture the mind and soul. He is a master of storytelling.Pros: Funny yet disturbing story, a great character study, unique characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and how Milos Forman can create such intriguing and capturing filmsCons: The film is rather old but it holds up in most parts. The acting can seem outdated and the cameras used for the film make the film seem grainyOverall Rating: 9.4",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
As touching as movies can get,"What is there really left to say about ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" that other reviewers haven't already said, and in a more eloquent way to boot? By this time it has been well-established that this is a truly great film, with an excellent multi-layered script and an absolutely brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. However, I think the true strength of this movie is partially in the supporting roles. The supporting cast never turns into lame caricatures of mental patients, all of them give very realistic performances. Their characters are mentally unstable, but they're still real people you can side with. They're likable guys, and they need to be because otherwise the contrast with nurse Ratched wouldn't work out. Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, in my opinion these guys add just as much to the movie as Nicholson does. Furthermore, this film has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. It's so fitting, it's so touching, and despite the nature of it it still leaves you strangely satisfied. One of the best movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Difficult, fascinating drama runs on pure emotion, not logic...","Multiple Oscar winner is an astounding, gripping piece, although occasionally the material allows too much showing off for its star and the four-letter dialogue coupled with the bleak material can be exhausting. A softened (albeit no less hard-hitting) film-adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about sex-deviate Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) sent to a mental institution instead of prison, quickly butting heads with the stony head-nurse on his ward (a hissable Louise Fletcher playing Nurse Wretched--uh, Ratched). Ostensibly a downer, the film does get a rousing kick from Nicholson, going full bore with an actor's relish and infusing the movie with unpredictable, kinetic energy. Director Milos Forman helps us get to know the patients at this hospital, easing us through the preliminaries and yet sparing us none of the ugliness. Still, this plot is a bit thin on the screen; Forman does his best to ""open up"" the material, which was first produced on the stage, but the sequence on the boat is more an emotion-based relief for the audience's benefit than a logical turn of the story. Tough-going, compelling film is occasionally brilliant, with Nicholson and Fletcher both winning Oscars, as did Forman and producer Michael Douglas. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
An exiting story about madness that comes from where we least expect it.,"The story Goes about the Main character McMurphy accepting his new life in the hospital, and nurse Ratched plays the antagonist, despite her role being the good guy and McMurphy being the bad guy. This isn't a story about Anti hero, but Rather about how far do people push each other until something serious happens. Both McMurphy and Nurse Ratched push each other like a competitive game, and it the end it hurt them and innocent victims who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The acting was great, and the stakes they held were reasonable, they had a realistic view on the environment that they were in. I read the book too, but despite the book having much better detail, the movie did great, it told the story well.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Awesome,I had the chance to watch this when it first hit the big screens with my father who was a fan of jack Nicolson! true to the title this movie takes you to the depths and heights as it is a true master piece that you can watch over and over and still see something you had not seen or hear a line that you didn't hear the first time. An all time favorite of mine if you like a good deep movie watch this timeless Movie! In a word the Director did a fantastic job and Jack puts a most interesting and believable performance as the bad guy/just trying to stay out of the system as much as he figures a different way to get into more troubles then he bargained for. If ever there was a way to sum up the fact that you aren't going nowhere and getting there fast this is it.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The movie is different enough in point of view and events to make it stand on its own.Nicholson is, as almost always, incredible in the McMurphy character. It's amazing that you can laugh at something in one scene (""Little dab'll do ya, huh?"") and then see the results of this same character in the final scenes.

Jack Nicholson.....wow.,"Possibly the best drama, if not the best movie, of all time.  AFI has it rated as #20 two above 2001, which is silly seeing as how 2001 is in my opinion only liked because Kubrick made it, in reality its slow, long, and boring.  But back to One Flew, it is an amazing piece of film with some of the best acting I have ever seen, Jack Nicholson's character is the typical antihero everyone loves, just when you think he has learned his lesson....well I won't ruin it. DeVito, Christopher Llyod, Cheif, and the others in the hospital brought the movie together. This isnt the most exciting movie, but it is amazing nonetheless.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I was unfortunate enough to have watched the movie after reading the book. Unfortunate in that because of this the movie was disappointing for me. The book is so complex and emotionally moving, as well as mentally stimulating, that although the movie was good, it didn't even come close to being as memorable. If anyone asked me which was more worthwhile I would unflinchingly answer 'the book'. And if they did decide to do a remake of the film, I reckon Tom Waits would be way better casting for McMurphy than Nicholson.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

I suppose having previous exposure to Kesey's work before seeing the movie spoiled me. I was expecting to see a great book made into a great movie. The movie Murphy was a totally different person than the book Murphy. The book Murphy instilled in the other patient a new found sense of self. In the movie, Murphy replaces the staff as the authority figure. The patients did what Murphy said, much the same as they did with the hospital staff.

No One Else Could've Been the Lead Except Nicholson,"*SPOILERS* ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" One did indeed. Starring in a role as though he was born for it, this prison film chronicles Randle McMurphy (Nicholson), an always-smiling maniac who helps his fellow inmates discover how life can really be lived within penitentiary walls. However, he also shows them life outside of it. He has the time of his life before meeting his fatal demise.Randle is sent to the prison on multiple charges but soon lives life against the rules and getting others to do so with him. He both breaks out of the prison and creates a riot in it. He is extremely crazy but Nicholson plays the role seemingly without acting at all. He performs the part with such ease that it is believable to think that he is McMurphy.In my opinion, these are some of the standout scenes that make this film truly great. Randle and the Chief sitting on the bench chewing Juicy Fruit is priceless. The scene in which Randle finds out that all of his fellow inmates are at the prison due to their own will is mesmerizing. The near-end scene in which Chief smothers the lobotomized Randle is purely sad. And finally, the scene in which Chief escapes by throwing that sink through the window gives even the viewer a sense of freedom.The film is enticing from beginning to end. It is an emotional joyride that will truly make you feel for its characters. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" would not be complete without Nicholson and its supporting cast, and is one of the greatest prison movies of all time.",,Anonymous,Drama
Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy as if he were born to it in this hilarious and heartbreaking classic.,"McMurphy is an Irish-American brawler found culpable of battery and gambling. He is a Korean War veteran who was also held as a prisoner of war. He is sentenced to a fairly short prison term, and decides to have himself declared insane in order to be shifted to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his time in comfort and luxury.Randle Patrick McMurphy appears on the well-organized and claustrophobic scene of the psychiatric ward like a bolt from the blue in the movie, ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest."" He is a sharp-witted, elegant, aggressive, and an energetic person who always challenges the status quo from day one. He introduces himself to all and sundry in the ward, shakes hands and fills the silence with loud laughter. He is perhaps not mentally ill; he has chosen to be sent to the psychiatric hospital because he did not like to work on the prison farm, where he had six months to go before his discharge. The desirability of the psychiatric hospital for him was the idea of enjoying better food and a trouble-free lifestyle. This is not exactly what he actually gets.McMurphy has brought a touch of normalcy in the general atmosphere of the ward with his sense of humor and rebellious voice. He instantly engages in a long, hopeless, and endless battle with a ""Big Nurse"". What Nurse Ratched wants is a group of passive and silent men who do not offend or query how she has ordered things. It is their incarceration, voluntary or otherwise, upon which her job and role in life depends. Hence, McMurphy is the ultimate threat—a nonconformist who encourages the residents into a desire for action. He provokes them up out of the lifelessness and dullness in which they have been dwelling. In fact, he provides them with the creation of a treatment to their problems. The more victorious McMurphy is at disturbing the status quo, the more severe the battle becomes between him and Nurse Ratched.McMurphy is a very funny character but the humor ends when he discovers that Big Nurse has complete control over his fate—over what treatment he receives and when he is discharged. What starts as a boisterous mutiny against authority becomes a calamity. McMurphy is repetitively subjected to electric shock therapy. He manages to joke about it and to gather the strength to arrange a fishing expedition for some of the men. Finally, he makes a plan to escape one night but before that he invites everyone to a night of drinking and partying in the ward. The drunken orgy, complete with prostitutes, turns into a debacle and becomes the cause of his demise. Big Nurse comes to know about the party and sends him for electro-shock treatment. He returns lobotomized, as a human vegetable, after the therapy. All the lights in his bright mind and brave personality have been extinguished due to continual electro-shock therapy. Afterwards, his trusted friend ""Chief"" asphyxiates him with a pillow and saves half-living McMurphy from sinking into a vegetative existence. In spite of his final degradation to a vegetative state, he wins the fight for freedom that he has fought so courageously.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The true meaning of the cuckoo' s nest!,"Excellent film in all aspects. as a viewer, i felt that i was a patient myself. it was interesting to see how the patients became all self conscious about who they were.jack being able to persuade them to change their routine schedule was proof that not all patients need the sort of therapy mental institutes provide.If not in some cases mental institutes help patients worsen their condition due to over medication and irrelevant conversations initiated by the nurses. it was interesting to see for every opportunity the patients had to escape, something always retained them to stay. for most of them, the institute was their home. they would not be able to function in society and may face rejection by others due to their stigmas. their fear of rejection is what kept them isolated in the hospital, not the barbed fence and secured windows. their only family was the ones inside the institute. Jack brought awareness to each individual in the hospital and made them realize they had a voice. when he died, a part of them died with him!the native Chief represents an important factor in this film. natives are the most discriminated people of our history.we see that he to is afraid to escape into the real world because of the racism. when he observes what is done to Jack in the end of the film, he knows he is better off out in the real world. He takes the risk so he can go to Canada where most of the reserves for natives are held. there he will be accepted. Billy killing himself expresses how the doctors and nurses had power to fear and control the patients using their weaknesses in character and personality. it is a sort of brainwash and manipulation tactic hospitals use to overpower their patients. taking away their freedom of speech, will to live is was really makes the patients ill. taking away their self- consciousness and alienating them of their existence. one normal man awakens the ones who are asleep and shows them they have freedom of speech and a chance for change. when his actions begin to work, the doctors fear him, so they shock him until he is a vegetable.this is a great metaphor on how the government has control over the citizens using tactics to manipulate us. making us believe everything we see even if it is not the truth. we as humans live in high secure society, but don't realize it.more and more are political systems are taking control of our freedom to live in order to have complete control our way of thinking and living. this resembles the metaphor behind this film. a good example is president Jfk who was assassinated because he wanted change and good for the society. Same with jack, he is assassinated from his essence as a great human being,to be left with no more identity and self awareness of himself.it easier for the government to stuff patients with pills so they don't interfere with the ideal society they are trying to construct with perfect flawless people.this film expresses how sometimes for some people, illness is socially constructed and not biological related. pressures from the ideal society is what makes them sick. two thumbs up for the written script and performances in this epic film!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is brimming with memorable characters.,"Films today just don't have that sense of story and character, it's more visual narrative and overacting. There's no overacting here, every performance is understated in their own unique way. Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, is cool, calm and collected and yet her mannerisms exude terror. Her authoritative figure and soft spoken voice just adds to this, so much so that the patients in the state mental hospital are petrified of her. Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is just a common criminal who to start with plays along with the other patients. However, upon the realisation that he may not ever get out...he starts to find ways in order to escape. I found his performance captivating and clearly he is great and portraying crazy people, just look at The Shining. He is able to control the smaller scenes with his charisma and own the bigger crazier scenes with his excitable energy. His raucous behaviour puts the other patients at risk of certain procedures such as the controversial electro therapy. What really compelled me was the similarities between the mental patients and the outside world, to which McMurphy says that there is no difference. The screenplay for that scene, well every scene actually, brings life to each character. From the first 30 minutes, every character's personality and state of mind is indicated to us. There are no boring characters, each of them have unique qualities and that is something you don't see in every film. Loved the fishing boat scene, adored Chief's and McMurphy's friendship and appreciated the time and effort spent on character interactions. The way they talk to each other in the therapy sessions just felt natural, and to balance the screen time between them all was just genius. You just don't get films like these anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"An excellent movie, but it could have followed the book better.","The movie, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" directed by Milos Forman in 1975, was definitely seven out of ten stars. The movie, based upon the book, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, is an original novel coming to life. Words from a page are turned into a pleasing visual film that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. As a classic novel, the book does not follow the original written novel as closely, the main character changes from the book to the novel, and the emotions held within the novel are less-existing in the movie. The movie does not follow the book closely, leaving out key-events such as; the black boys seeming excited to take patients temperatures, or the event in which Mr. Harding's wife visits. Both of those events are not present in the film. The main character changes in the film, in the film, the main character is McMurphy, a wild man who is avoiding jail, while in the book, Chief Bromden is the main character; Chief Bromden tells the story through his eyes in the book, and this is not present in the film at all, instead Chief Bromden is rarely present within the film. Lastly, the emotions within the book are less-existing in the movie. In the book, mostly the emotions held are less pleasant and humorous, while in the film, the director tends to lean towards humor in the film. All of these reasons given further explain my reasoning for the rating I have given this movie. The movie does not follow the book, and after reading the book, this is disappointing, while the characters and their point-of-view changes as well, also the emotions shifts from the novel to the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Undeniably Uplifting, Potent and Beautifully Lyrical A Genuine All-American Masterpiece","No group of Hollywood filmmakers and actors could come across such a dark satirical portrait on mental illness, rebellion and organizational authority and make it a revolutionary landmark film like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. Based on the 1962 bestseller by Ken Kessey, Milos Forman breaks new grounds in the art of film-making. He flawlessly blends astute cinematography, an outstanding adapted screenplay, rhythmical pacing and remarkably first-rate performances by two stellar leads and an authentic ensemble cast.When anarchistic petty crook Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is taken to a mental institution to be evaluated, he instantly develops silent yet tenacious animosity toward deceitful, stubborn Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher). As a sign of the rebellious, flamboyant, defiant individual he always has been, he acquaints his fellow mental patients with actual life outside their wards.Jack Nicholson's tour de force is here in his Oscar-winning role as R. P. McMurphy, the audacious rebel who liberates the group of impressionable mental patients from living in solitude. Among this group of inmates includes ""deaf and dumb"" noble Native American Chief (Will Sampson) who becomes McMurphy's loyal accomplice. McMurphy understands what the patients lust for and he encourages them in the best way he knows how: baseball, fishing and a night of debauchery. He wreaks even more disorder to a carefully laid system for his and the patients' benefit much to the dismay and chagrin of Miss Ratched.Louise Fletcher also receives a well-deserved Academy award as the very manipulative Nurse Ratched. Many argue that her performance was bland but she blew me away conveying one of the most despicable women in the history of film. Her neurotic feelings of repressed sexuality are cleverly masked by cool, authoritative facade and icy stares. She is entirely apathetic and insusceptible to the needs of others and her biggest concern is making herself the psychosomatic leader of the ward. Her reluctance for McMurphy to outdo her escalates to a heart-stopping climax.Each member of the supporting cast gives incredibly genuine interpretations to their character. It is amazing how every one of those chaotic (proven by their regular hectic group therapy sessions) patients have their own story to tell behind their convalescence. The patients are motivated by McMurphy, even if they aren't completely aware of their actions by the exposition of propaganda Randall takes. In a way, they become cured through Randall's behavior.With a phenomenal unofficial screenplay by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman and poetic momentum and character development, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST still upholds its title as one of the most potent pieces of the big screen of the 20th century.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Is that crazy enough for you, do you want me to take a s**t on the floor","One of the best films ever made, as I can just watch it again and again and never get board of watching it. It goes to show how good the film was, that almost every main actor in this film made a success in acting after taking role in this movie. Jack Nicholson was truly made for the part as RP McMurphy, as nobody else could have played the part more convincing and dramatic as he did. To perform a film set in a mental Institution takes an incredible amount of patience from both the directors/actors to learn how to act mental, as Danny Devito(Martini) and Christopher Lloyd(Taber) were especially remarkable at this, as they knew how to put on such convincing mental facial reactions (ie.when C.Lloyd was screaming/laughing when Will Sampson(The Chief) escaped from the mental Institution and when D.Devito(Martini) was playing Monopoly with Harding as he put his hotel piece on the board.This film in all aspects was funny, witty, heartfelt, dramatic and quite realistic, as all the way through the film you are either angry, laughing, crying, at something or other, that is going on in the film, whether its being angry with Nurse Ratchett(Louise Fletcher)over her legalism, or crying when Billy(Brad Dourif) harms himself at the end of the film or even laughing at the way RP McMurphy was acting, when he was listening/ observing Mr.Hardings and Mr.Tabers argument during Nurse Ratchetts therapy group. There is not a moment in this film, for which ones emotions aren't triggered, as this film is 'all go' and never drags-on. If you haven't seen this film and would like to, please watch it, for I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed.

But that much-too-typical kind of aberration, who couldn't answer Randle Patrick McMurphy's question about the dirty laundry, may be still another issue entirely! . . . He's about the same kind of being who called me the Devil, and tossed me out callously on my ear, from a fundamentalist denomination, one barren night, six years ago, when I'd felt desperate enough to turn even to the ""likes"" of their kind, again; and all that, simply because he couldn't handle the truththat I Corinthians 9 does speak, among other related things, aboutmoney! . . . Good Lord, it's ""almost"" enough to drive even me back to the Mother of my Roots, despite an ""allergy"" about as ""violent"" as Damien's! And I suppose that, given how completely so many things have been symbolically, ever-mystifyingly, and just as cleverly turned back over, entirely on their heads, including the world itself (Acts 17:6), you by now have all the ""real evidence"" you need, right there alone, against me! . . . But, then, just check it out yourselves, if you don't know it alreadyfor at least the one is openly calling the other ""The Devil,"" too; which would alone serve to ""embarrassingly"" necessitate, and, thus, all-the-more-solidly reinforce the most basically mutual feelings here!Which is all-the-more warranted, even by the likes of these two, against one-another, ""merely"" quite symbolically due to how ""highly doubtful,"" to say the very least, it is that either of these two ""Judas Goats"" (and they both ought to know!) shall soon be burying Billy on Holy Ground, while the Chief is being hunted down like a dog, by the dogs, with shoot-on-sight-to-kill orders, no questions asked! . . . On the other hand, though, Tony Curtis did one of the cleverest Public Service Announcements I've ever been told about, many years ago, at least for as long as it had been permitted to remain on the air. He simply said, with that little pause, in the middle, and an accompanying ""twinkle"" in his eye, ""I don't smokecigarettesthat is!"" It's a real wonder they haven't gone witch-hunting, by now, after cigars and pipes, too!Or, have they, after-all?For, again, after-all, at least which one, if not both, could possibly have been meant? . . . By the way, I don't require any behavior modification; that is, unless, of course, your real intent is, after-all, to turn me into what Malcolm McDowell had originally been, and finally become, once again!About as radically as such a procedure would have to be accomplished at all in my case! And I'm only beginning to ""touch up"" this particular painting, along with the last one, and so many others!--Unless somebody is at least nice enough to even--let melet-alone tell meperhaps even the way they did Barry Champlain--once he'd so eloquently and unbearably unmasked all of them completely--to flake off! . . .

Unfortunate Insanity,"I found this movie difficult to watch, not because of the subject matter, but because it initially seemed as unsure of its destination as I was. It is entirely understandable that a movie about a mental institution would provide an insight into the daily routine of the inhabitants which is most likely quite dull and, well, routine. It is also necessary to provide for character development, but too much monotony and introduction is just difficult to watch. This is not to say that any of the actors were negligent in their craft. Everyone was very believable in their respective roles, so much so that it took me a while to recognize Danny DeVito. Jack Nicholson was his usually boisterous and slightly insane self and Louise Fletcher was a superb Nurse Ratched. The technical aspects of the movie were sufficient and fluid, but did not draw attention to themselves with any particularly notable exhibition of flair.The second half did pick up a bit and the ending misses making the movie more than just worth watching by only a tiny fraction. I suppose I just can't help but feel a bit unsure about whether or not anyone actually escaped and whether or not that is the movie's intent on how I should feel.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Isn't Nicholson's Character a Villain Too?,"A convicted prisoner fakes mental illness to get into a mental institution, and sort of befriends the other patients while trying to 'break' the cold authoritarian nurse.I don't mind the film for the most part, and Jack Nickelson's character grew on me over time. I agree that Nurse Ratched is the main villain and antognkst of the film, I really don't think Nicholson's character is much better. The film seems to forget that it sets him has a villain when we are first introduced to him. He's not a good guy.

Among the best ever on that scheme,"In the movie history, you can find several films about mental, psychiatric institutions: ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, SHOCK CORRIDOR, SHOCK TREATMENT, THE SNAKE PIT, and at a lower scale MR PATMAN, but we can consider this one as one of the best, the most famous, and also the most outstanding performance from Jack Nicholson, a role which made him so famous besides CHINATOWN. It is a beautiful, painful, disturbing drama, not destined to all audiences, but a film that was nominated at the Academy Awards and won for at least the best picture. It is widely deserved. And the supporting character Will Sampson is also here as his very best. Worldwide audiences will remember him for this character.

"""Which one of nuts has got any guts?""","A touching story carried by wonderful acting from all cast members. A rollercoaster of emotions packed into 2hrs 13 mins & worthy of the 5 Oscars it received.
In the opening scene, the patients seem extremely docile - obeying Nurse Ratched's cult like rigour (one patient even takes his medication like communion), though upon McMurphy's arrival, life on the ward perks up. With his rolled up sleeve encasing a pack of cigarettes, the dishevelled hair, the mischievous look in his eyes, McMurphy establishes himself as a rebel without a cause from the get go. He brings joy & laughter back into the lives of the patients, and inspires the men to gain autonomy for themselves and indeed hope for a life outside of the institution.
The group therapy scenes were excellent and really allowed time for you to 'get to know' each individual patient. Though Nicholson's character (McMurphy) is flawless, credit has to be given to the men behind Billy Bibbit, Chief & Martini. Their performances felt so believable - not once did I think oh, these are actors.
One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a touching, and culturally significant drama which stands the test of time - offering an interesting insight into the relationship between authority and freedom.

One Of The Greatest!,"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest is probably, along with Cool Hand Luke, one of the greatest films of all time. Jack was at his very best which, amazingly, is all the time. I think that Nurse Ratchett is the most hated character that I can recall. She was evil in a way that was familiar to many of us. I believe that, of movies that were made from books, Cuckoos Nest is the most faithfully reproduced. I've seen this movie many times and I always enjoy all the wonderful performances. Also notable are the careers that were launched with Cuckoos Nest. The almost unrecognizable Danny DeVito as Martini. The frenetic Chris Lloyd fitting so neatly into the band of lunatics. Will Sampson was inspiring as Chief Bromden. Cuckoos Nest, overall, coaxes such a wide range of emotions, from out and out hilarity to tear-jerking sadness, that it is nearly impossible to classify. Suffice it to say that One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest is one of the greats!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Probably the best film ever,"Close related to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and Francois Truffaut's Les quatre cents coups(The 400 Blows), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best films ever made. Well, for Milos Forman, is not the best movie. That's because he still has another ""best film"" in his filmography, which is Amadeus. But for Louise Fletcher, Scatman Crothers, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Brad Dourif and, last but specially not least, Jack Nicholson, is their best film ever. Their acting is more than natural, it is real life. Great photography by Haskell Wexler(he is the one who filmed, together with Bill Butler, another masterpiece called The Conversation, with Gene Hackman, directed by Francis Ford Coppola). Great music by Jack Nitzsche(he provided music also for Cruising, An Officer and a Gentleman, Starman, The Jewel of the Nile, 9½ Weeks, Revenge, among many others).

Sometimes a movie just works,"I've always had slight problems with this film. I've seen it every now and then throughout my years. I've heard how good it is. And I can see that for myself. It is a good film. But why?Well... it did win the Big Five of Oscars. Best Film, Director, Screenplay and both Main Actors. Only the second film to have ever done that. And yeah, I guess there's something there. Everything in this film simply works. And it works very well together. Jack Nicholson as the chaotic McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as nurse Ratched, who controls the mental ward with an iron fist, are both phenomenal in their roles. Nicholson is of course Jack Nicholson, but Fletcher's role, especially right next to Nicholson's, also must be praised. You're constantly being kept wondering whether her efforts to force the patients into an iron tight, rigid order are because that's what she believes will help them or is it just because she truly doesn't care and simply wants everything to go exactly like she prefers.It's also a really professional-looking film. Cinemacraft at its finest. Although, I have to admit that 60s mental hospital is not exactly the most exciting of locations, but then it's a character movie anyway. The score is also atmospheric and moody in just the right way. The opening shot alone instantly sets the pace.I guess sometimes you just have to admit that you don't know something.

"Amazing, humorous and shocking.","I watched this movie for the very first time yesterday and I have to say, it blew me away and is definitely one of my all-time favorites. This tells the story of Mcmurphy (Played by the incredible Jack Nicholson) who gets put into mental institution after a number of incidents. From there on in, you are captivated by the witty cast of the institution (Including Christopher Lloyd) who produce some hilarious and entertaining scenes in the ward. But the plot thickens and you begin to realize the shocking tales that occur and the story twists and turns. You are literally holding your breath from start to finish and it is also one of the most thought-provoking ends to a movie.The nurse Ratched, played by an excellent Louise Fletcher, is ice cold in her attitude and you really grow to hate her. In fact, every character in the movie is absorbed into your mind and you really get to know them. You feel for the characters like you would feel for people that aren't acting, and provokes the question, why are those that inhabit a mental institution so ignored and turned away from society?In a nutshell, this is an amazing, humorous and shocking piece of movie-making that everyone should watch, you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One flew over the cuckoos nest,"This is what a great film looks like.Astonishing acting by all, engaging plot and touches your soul.

This movie truly makes you smile or frown whilst you watch it, this is rather rare in movies nowadays but this one really is the definition of simple but beautiful. The ending really does make the movie, it almost feels as if you have lost a close friend, you remember the memories the beginnings and now the end. You want to continue their legacy, their dreams and goals to honour them and keep their memory alive. Seeing how somebody loses their souls, personality, love, passion and emotion is a unique but unfortunate experience, from happy charming to soulless and empty, the contrast almost made me tear up. This movie is a marvel, highly recommended for all.This movie also shows how administration can corrupt, is unethical, and sometimes unfair.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A beautiful film about life,"Jack N. has also been known for playing loud roles, and this is his biggest one. He plays Mac, a man who's thrown into a Mental institution and he seems to be the only person with common sense. Louise F. plays the Warden and she adds an extremely powerful performance as the embodiement of evil yet at the same time not going too cliche. Both cast members received Oscars for their performances and they were definitely well- deserved. Jack adds in such a variety of emotions, it's hard not to feel his pain. Milos Forman and his always focused direction really bring everything together. His sharp attention to details also help build in the ending of the film. He also brings all the cast members together to do their job. The script is excellent too, emersing itself in the harsh realities of life and how things don't always go the happy way. One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest won five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted screenplay. Each of them was sufficently earned, but Barry Lyndon should've won one or two of those Oscars. Even though most of the film is excellent, there are still some flaws. The pace here and there gets a bit too slow and things end up just dragging on. Also, eventually the character of the Warden gets old and tired after a while, and the viewer wants to experience something new. Everthing else adds up right, and it's a fine film, and should be #11 of the IMDb top 250 films. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout all of the movie, which eventually leads to a what I believe is a triumphant ending.Jack Nicholson is of course awesome in his role.It was just Jack being Jacking:improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie like he was actually admitted.

"An intelligent perspective of chaos, order, institutionalisation ,and freedom...","There's a good reason why this film ranks so high on IMDb's top 250 (as I am writing this, it is comfortably in the top 10): this movie appeals to a wide range of audiences without seeming pretentious or over-the-top (save perhaps for one scene which I will not discuss here for the sake of the potential viewer).Deservedly, one of the few films to sweep the 'Big 5' awards at the Oscars, namely Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress, and Best Screenplay (Adapted). The film itself is worthy of all the accolades won; it sends the viewer on an immensely gripping psychological ride, with one of the best and most widely discussed endings you are likely to see in a Motion Picture. This was in fact, the very film that catapulted the legendary Milos Forman to stardom (he would later follow this up with the highly successful AMADEUS). The direction is simply superb as is the writing, and it is evident that Forman knew exactly what he wanted from the offset.Jack Nicholson wins his first Oscar in one of the best roles ever portrayed on film. The viewer will constantly question his state of mind relative to the other patients, and to the persons who society deem as 'mentally fit'. It is worth noting that Nicholson was only Forman's third choice for the lead role, after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando. Maybe the Fates conspired that Nicholson would eventually get the nod, as it is now difficult to imagine either of the aforementioned topping Nicholson's performance.Louise Fletcher is equally brilliant, and the interaction and conflict between these two key personalities is one of the main selling points of this feature. The viewer will question intensely the ultimate motives of Fletcher's character, and this has made for one of the more interesting character studies of all time. Not to be forgotten is Brad Dourif who, in his debut performance, deservedly garnered an Oscar nomination. Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd also have small roles which they perform admirably well, but all this was before they really became famous. In fact, all the actors portraying patients do convincingly well in their portrayals of a wide variety of common mental illnesses, and the casting in this film was simply genius.For the entire running time of ~125 minutes the viewer is captivated, leading up to, during, and well beyond the ending, which is not quite cathartic but will no doubt impinge upon cerebral impulses rather than visceral. Personally, just considering the first 100 minutes or so, I would have simply stated that the film was quite GOOD; it is the ultimate conclusion that propels this film from good to GREAT; perhaps one of the best of all time. This film,like many great ones, stays with the viewer long after the end credits begin to roll.Arguably, the movie may not have aged well since many of the practices in the medical discipline of mental health have improved drastically since the late 70s. However, I find this does very little to upset or throw off the open-minded viewer.I am not surprised by this film's inclusion in the Top 10 since, as stated earlier, it has a very wide appeal, not unlike THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Honestly, this film should not be missed, even if you have to watch it on one of the classic networks with commercials and censorship (Heaven forbid!).This film warrants 4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Highly recommended. Should just about enter my top 100 at 99 or so.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
I'm glad this one flew onto my TV screen,"Every Jack Nicholson film that i have seen everyone that i have known has been making comparisons to his acting abilities with THIS film.  People saying that he was great in 'As good as it gets' and 'Batman' but nothing could ever push the part he played in 'One flew over the cuckoos nest'. This is when i decided to watch it!!!Straight from the off we could see that there was so much talent and energy in the role that Nicholson potrays as mental patient MacMurphy who finds himself being monitored by the institution that he has been sent to in order to find out if he really is mental???At the academy awards of 1975 this swept the board including Nicholson taking Best Actor and Louise Fletcher taking a well deserved Best Actress. But i thought that the incredibly talented Brad Douriff who made his debut with this film as Billy, was very unlucky to pick up best supporting actor in which he was nominated for.  Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Will Sampson were all brilliant as the inmates of the hospital and showed that its all about the overall cast and not just one actor.The film itself is incredible, nothing like i've ever seen before and puts very stupid versions like 28 days way out of context!  You could cut the tension with a knife in every encounter between Macmurphy and nurse Ratched, it literally was end of your seat stuff.Why i havn't watched this film sooner is beyond me, so please anyone out there reading these comments that hasn't seen this film, pick it up from your local video store A.S.A.P...........10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Admiration without affection,"Milos Forman's second American feature is a loose adaptation of the novel by Ken Kesey that made so many changes that Kesey refused to ever watch it. Having never read the book, I can't comment on changes, but I can say that this is one of those Best Picture winners and well-loved films that I never quite get. I think it's a good film, well-made, acted, and lensed, but I don't get into the emotional groove its offering, feeling more distant from the action than it seems like most audiences do. It's a film I respect more for its craft than I actually enjoy watching.I think I never quite love this film because I never quite hate Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). It really feels like the love of the film comes from hating her character, but I see her as a flawed human being with good intentions counterbalanced by a real mean streak that she's not afraid of using (what she does to Billy (Brad Dourif) at the end is outright evil). She's a bad person, but not a devil, so I can never quite get around to hating her and feeling some great joy at watching her attacked. It's helped by the fact that I see Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as less purely good and more dangerous than I think other people see him as. Again, he's not a bad person, but he can't control himself and puts himself in a spot where he's willing to harm sick people around him to win a fight with Ratched.So, McMurphy was in jail for a series of assaults and convinced the state prison psychiatrists that he needed to be sent to the funny farm, the mental hospital. He shows up, and he finds seventeen patients, all largely placid in their own ways and under the heel of Nurse Ratched. What follows is a power struggle between McMurphy and Ratched. They have dueling philosophies on life, and those manifest in different little struggles, all with both of them using the other patients as tools.If you see the film as McMurphy just trying to get people to discover their true selves and Ratched trying to oppress them, it becomes a very easy to root for one over the other. The problem is that I see them both as using these people in their fight with each other. McMurphy forces Bancini (Josip Elic) to put him on his shoulders without his consent to run around and try to show Chief (Will Sampson) how to play basketball. Was that kind? It seems at least kind of mean to me. It may not be Ratched arranging electric shock therapy, but it's also not McMurphy trying to help Bancini at all, instead using him to try and find a way to have fun.McMurphy's open defiance of Ratched makes him something of a figure of awe among the patients, especially Billy, and he even gets the grudging respect of others like Harding (William Redfield) and Max (Christopher Lloyd). His desire to break loose and have fun is a great feeling for these people on tightly run schedules (so tightly run that Ratched refuses to change anything to let them watch the World Series) who love the sense of freedom, but they are also really sick people and taking them out of the hospital to steal a boat to fish on was not exactly great. That they all end up reacting well feels somewhat artificial to me. At least one of these people should have had some kind of breakdown, otherwise it's intentionally stacking the deck in McMurphy's favor. He takes them out of the hospital, some of whom are there by force of the state, and they're all fine. Either this is saying that these people shouldn't be locked up at all (which, considering Billy's fate later, seems to be a poor assumption) or that they just need to get out a bit. I think that the best way to read this is that the psychological approaches of the time were backwards and destructive, but that implies that these people needed it as well.You see, my issue is that ultimately I feel like there's an intentional subtext here about society and competing views between control (Ratched) and freedom (McMurphy), but the application to the setting of the mental asylum is imprecise to the point of distraction.I find it hard to separate that subtext from the narrative surface, but the surface is where things work better. The characters are all very well drawn, starting with McMurphy, this guy trapped in a place that he didn't realize the implications of when he schemed to get in. As played by Nicholson, he's cocky and confident until he realizes the trap he's set for himself, using everything he has to jump around, domineer the patients, and try to have a good time. The patients all around him are convincing, especially with those early turns from Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Lloyd. Dourif ends up the tragic figure in the end, harshly manipulated by Ratched with one single line of dialogue when it becomes obvious that he won't listen to her anymore. Fletcher has a restrained performance, and she loves her control in small ways, never lording it over people except in her cool, calm voice. Her lashing out is in what she says, never in how she says it.I feel for Billy and where he goes. He was a mentally ill young man manipulated by both people over him, one far more maliciously than the other. What happens to McMurphy is the result of an uncaring system and a powermad woman, but he's less the hero than I think the film thinks he is. I see it as an imperfect application of Forman's experiences under communist rule during his upbringing in Czechoslovakia to the American experience. I appreciate Forman's craft in molding performances from his actors, clean filming, careful use of closeups, and general production quality, and I feel some sympathy for a side character, but I think it doesn't quite hit as well as it should. It's good, not great.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Giving the Oscar to Louise Fletcher for her performance has to be the all-time joke of the movie business. That much more able actresses had turned the role down speaks for itself. With the current lack of financial wisdom in the US in 2008, however, the film obviously had some serious irony up its sleeve to be kept for 33 years down the track.

But it never panders or moralizes, it just stands as a warning against the Nurse Ratcheds of the world and as an example of how wonderful good writing well-acted can be to behold.It is a Tragi-comedy/Psychological Drama. And Milos Foreman does a great job too. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One made the best film of 1970s.,"Conclusive in it's existence, magnificent in it's metaphore, `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' tastes like wine  the older it gets, the better it is. It's a comedy because of the ironic unpredictabilities that occur during the story, and it's a tragedy because despite of everything that happens, nothing will ever be changed and nothing is set to. The only thing you can do is `rip that ******* thing' from the bathroom and run away from that kind of closed life circle.Not one performance is overdone, not one line overwritten, not one moment unimportant, not one second of the movie flawed. It's a coherent brilliance of craftsmanship and a quite greatness of humility and dignity. The movie's anti-establishement intonation is already a thing of epochal diameter and it will stay that way for ever. The strenght of its unidealistic undercurrent is what makes all of us alive, even though no one is allowed to admit it. What is fascinating in this movie is that the people who made it know it.Thinking back to the film  I'm often thinking: `What if every human being in the world would allow himself to `rip that ******* thing' just one single time in his life?' Now, that was a scary thought.10/10. Best motion picture of 1970s.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A classic of the seventies,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the signature films of the 1970s. Based on the 1962 novel by counter-cultural icon Ken Kesey, the movie focuses on the rebellious R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he becomes immersed in life within a mental institution. Over the course of the movie he bonds with his fellow patients and steadfastly opposes Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and her dictatorial ways.One of the things that ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is known for is for winning Oscars in all of the so-called 'big five' categories. These include Best Actor & Best Actress, with awards going to Nicholson & Fletcher, respectively. Both contributed excellent performances but they also benefited from some fine support by the supporting cast of mostly unknowns. Early appearances by Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd & Vincent Schiavelli are augmented by notable work from William Redfield & Scatman Crothers. And who can forget Will Sampson as the taciturn Chief?Czech director Milos Forman was also honoured by the Academy and so were screenwriters Lawrence Hauben & Bo Goldman. Between them, they found a way to approach the material that was simultaneously authentic, humorous and emotionally resonant. Among those who lost Oscar bids, particular recognition should go to cinematographer Haskell Wexler and composer Jack Nitzsche.In the final analysis, I feel that the story takes a little while to hit its stride but once it does it ably sustains the viewer's interest right up to the memorable finale. It was up against some stiff competition for Best Picture so the fact that it took home the Oscar is a testament to its overall quality. That being said, I feel that it may be just a tad overrated, though it is undoubtedly essential viewing for any movie lover.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Many characters were either cut or sidelined in an effort to make Taber relevant, even though it served absolutely no purpose to have him in the movie. Without giving any information, there seemed to be many important events and lines from the book that didn't make it into the movie, probably to make it a little more acceptable to viewers.

Real Classic,"Few films stand the test of time as well as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Even decades after its release, the film remains a masterpiece of storytelling, acting, and thematic depth. Directed by Milos Forman and based on Ken Kesey's 1962 novel, the movie is an exploration of individuality, institutional oppression, and the fragile balance between sanity and control. Its relevance endures, making it as powerful today as it was upon release.From the very first frame, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest immerses viewers into the sterile, suffocating environment of a mental institution, where rules, order, and routine dictate every aspect of life. The arrival of Randle P. McMurphy, played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson, injects energy and chaos into this rigid world. McMurphy, a free-spirited and rebellious figure, challenges the institution's authority, symbolized by the cold and manipulative Nurse Ratched, portrayed by the outstanding Louise Fletcher.One of the reasons this film has aged so well is its ability to explore timeless themes. The conflict between individuality and oppressive systems is something that resonates across generations. McMurphy, despite his flaws, represents the irrepressible human spirit, refusing to be broken by the institutionalized control imposed by Nurse Ratched. Her character is a chilling representation of authority wielded as a means of subjugation rather than care, and her passive-aggressive cruelty remains one of the most haunting performances in cinematic history.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Everyone comes to this world with great message, with task. And of course sometimes it looks like someone is at the wrong time and place, and that freedom for everyone will be the same. However it is not so, for example, my freedom is to do that what I like, others freedom will be being in hospital and be in frames which offers hospital, because the whole world may be chaotic and for someone the worst place ever.Though this movie is great, and it makes you think about some kind of political movements right now, about inequality in public and 100 other questions, I suppose that book is little bit better.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
is and always will be one of the best films ever,"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975)Truly one of the greatest films ever made.Jack Nicholson is put into a mental institute when he pretends to be insane to get out of going to prison. While there he uses the patients to help him pass the time. he plays cards and basketball and kind of tries helps them more than the nursing staff does. While hes there we wonder ""is he really crazy?"" or would we all act like that in his situation?Nicholson seemingly wants to be a hero to these people, he wants them to like him so that he can change things, however making ""crazy"" people change their routine isn't easy. Really I don't feel like he really ever was a hero to anyone he just got desperate and more and more depressing. The more he tried to help his fellow patients the more he was driven mad.One issue I have with the film, well not really with the film but the way people have received it is how Nurse Ratched is played off as the bad guy. In my opinion she did her job and in no way was overly strict or mean or anything like that at all. She seemed to do her best to keep order and did it the way it should be done. Really Nicholson's character is the bad guy in my opinion. He tried to throw everything off and in a way made the patients worse, by throwing off their routineJack Nicholson's performance is, in my opinion, his best ever. It was a role I don't think anyone else could do as good and a role I can't see him ever being able to top. As the say, he was born to play it. Danny Devito also did a great job, though a very small role I think he did fantastic, as well did most of the patients, and Louise Fletcher in the role of the Nurse RatchedThis film really did deserve the 5 Oscars it got that year. Personally I also would have given it cinematography over Barry Lyndon.Forman got seemingly everything out of all the actors and had everything go right. It was some of the best directing in film history.The film is at times funny, at times sad, at times tense, it has everything that makes up a good drama.

Review of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was truly an incredible film. Everything on the screen seemed real, and makes you feel as if you're there in the mental institution. There is a real truth to the story, that makes the whole film believable, and since most of society doesn't know what it's like to be in that kind of setting, our attention is gained by experiencing something new. Jack Nicholson does a phenomenal job, expressing his anger towards Nurse Ratchet, as well as his passion for the other patients; helping them to improve themselves. The film brings out emotions in the viewer, sometimes you want to cry out of sympathy for the patients, other times you feel the anger McMurhphy has, you feel the frustration of the patients, and some fear towards the more ""crazy"" patients. The film also has an important social message. It proves that not everyone is society is viewed for their true potential. It is hard not to judge someone by what we see, before we know them. Overall, a great film, but also heartbreaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Botched Medium,"I am kicking myself for being so unobservant.  Films, books, and plays are three different art forms and 'Cuckoo's Nest' has the (mis)fortune of existing in all three stages.  None are good examples of their respective forms.Books are plot-driven, requiring the right mix of story with dialog. Actually, dialog isn't necessary to make a popular book as Tom Clancy and John Grisham have demonstrated.Films are visually-driven.  When a film relies too much on the mechanics of books, they fail.  Why have the Clancy and Grisham adaptations faded so quickly?  Because the directors start with a story and then try to visualize it as best as they can while cutting out the guts of the book (the plot)...probably why the #1 comment is ""the book was better"".  Thus a good film, in the visual sense, needs little dialog and even bad dialog can work. Ang Lee, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick proved that.  These three start with visuals then use plot as an excuse for the vision, that's how they get away with clichés.Plays are entirely dialog-driven, requiring mastery of language to create and perform.  What works in books and films can fail because we take out the scene imagination of the audience in exchange for verbal imagination.  The two don't mix.Well, 'Cuckoo's Nest' (book, play, and film) is nothing unique.  Remember that Kesey wrote his book after Heller's 'Catch-22' and the film adaptation likewise followed Nichols' better attempt.  We can see that if Heller hadn't succeeded this would never have been made.  No one would have been interested in another examination of insanity, but this doesn't even have the clever manipulation of either the narrator or language.In this particular case, the failure falls on Forman.  Dialog and acting are pointless in this medium, especially Nicholson since his ""method acting"" here is no different than the Joker.  Another problem is the emotionless images.  This isn't the calculated coldness of Kubrick, just sloppy filmmaking.  Perhaps this should not have been attempted at all...My advice, compare this to that year's 'Barry Lyndon' to understand when adaptations take advantage of the different mediums.  The problem with America is that we make everyone verbally literate and then expect them to go to movies with the same mentality.  If we raise future generations to be visually literate then this movie would disappear.  That's our dilemma: Hollywood vs. Education.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""What do you think you are, crazy? Well, you're not!""","Whether intentional or not, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" was a sign ofthe times when it came out in 1975. It reflected the anti-authoritarian sensibility of Americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Director Milos Forman'staste for subversion is said to come from his war-torn childhood, his parentless upbringing, and finally, the rise of Communism in his native Czechoslovakia.The film's imitators, many and poor, have tried to duplicate its formula,practically inventing a new genre--the mental hospital drama--probably because of the opportunities for over-acting. An actor's favorite role to play is a mentally disadvantaged person. But Jack Nicholson's character, McMurphy, everyoneagrees, is not sick at all. Some of ""Cuckoo""'s imitators didn't understand that the film isn't about crazy people, but about rules, suppression of the soul, and the desire for power.As McMurphy emerges as a leader among the patients, a battle of wills formsbetween he and Nurse Ratched. At first McMurphy is just having fun. Heoperates on the belief that few of these men are actually crazy. Of course, it works for a time. Eventually it has tragic consequences.Forman would re-visit the anti-authoritarian themes of ""Cuckoo's Nest"" in""People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Ragtime.""

Even with an abrupt conclusion that nearly derails the emotional development that Milos Forman identifies early on, there's an addictive energy that only increases from start to finish.

Meet the Gang,"One of the more difficult things to get right in a movie is full and rich character development. Unlike books, movies are shorter, the plot comes faster and the elements are more immediate. A film maker has only a short time to get the characters right before the audience wants to get the plot going--about twenty minutes, certainly no more than thirty. Many films get by with only two or three fully fleshed out character and the others done in broad strokes, using the shorthand of either stock or, in some cases, downright cliché players.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the great exceptions. One of the standout brilliant scenes, in this film of many, takes place in the first few minutes when McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is forced to sit in a group session with all the other residents of the ward. This is where the cast of characters are introduced to the audience. With Nurse Rached (Louise Fletcher) as mediator, the personalities and quirks of all ""the crazies,"" as McMurphy refers to them, come to the surface in efficient, yet subtle, fashion. Not only are the characters fully drawn, but the relationships between them are apparent.Part of this is due to Forman's ingenious camera work. By, for the most part, avoiding long shots, which tend to lend a ""third person"" quality to the narrative, and placing the camera inside the circle of chairs, the audience is drawn into the action and placed in a ""second person"" position and, at one point or another, occupying the place of every one of the characters.In this way, the ""second person"" viewer not only sees and experiences the interrelationships of the ward, but is also called upon to form his own relationship with each character--like them or not.

Jack Nicholson destroyed this movie,"In the book, McMurphy was a lovable rogue, Falstaffian in character. Jack Nicholson turned McMurphy into a stupid jerk a**hole, not the least bit likable. Besides which, McMurphy was a big hulk of a guy and Jack Nicholson is a tiny little wimp guy not the least bit like McMurphy. In the book McMurphy fought Nurse Ratchet because he had the best interests of the inmates at heart and she was a sadistic monster and deserved a comeuppance. In the movie he fought her just because he was a jerk. She came across much more like a decent nurse looking out for the inmates, undeserving of McMurphy's torments. Nicholson's McMurphy could never have torn up the sink and thrown it out the window, he's just too small for that. The book's McMurphy was big enough to make such an act believable. I was so disappointed by this movie I quit seeing Jack Nicholson movies for several years. As I thought about all the Jack Nicholson movies I'd seen over the years, starting with Easy Rider, I realized that in every movie his character was an a**hole. That made me think maybe Jack Nicholson is really an a**hole. Then he shined like a star in About Schmidt. I loved that one. So I will now go see Jack Nicholson movies again. I guess age has improved him. Separate from Nicholson's McMurphy ruinations, I really missed the part where the chief's hand grew gigantic in anticipation of using it as a monster weapon as he contemplated some taunts. The book made that a great scene. The movie just ignored it. Too bad, it would have been good.

Brilliant critique of compelling social forces,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" may be read as a scathing satire, reminiscent of Orwell's ""1984"", as both depict a society that controls its members through enforcing and internalizing conformity. The alienating consequences for individuals in such a society are rendered brilliantly by the director, as Jack Nicholson's character fights to keep his individuality.This film also reminds me of Gary Walkow's 1995 picture ""Notes from Underground"" (starring Henry Czerny and Sheryl Lee). Walkow's protagonist, like that of ""Cuckoo's Nest"" finds himself to be the only sane human being as far as the eye can see--his awareness of his condition renders him bitter and terrified.

Jack Nicholson flies over the cuckoo's nest,"It is difficult to say which cinematic role defined the meaning of Jack Nicholson's career, whether it's his portrayal as the sadistic psychopath in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', the iconic DC villain 'Batman', or his role here as a criminally insane convict with the thirst for rebellion. Regardless, Nicholson has made a man of honest talent, and his talent still lights up to this day. This five Oscar-winning (including Best Picture) adaption to Ken Kessey's acclaimed novel shows this fine actor in what is arguably one of his most roles of his career. Directed by Milos Forman, Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy, a long-time criminal who is caught for criminal activity and sentenced to prison by the court once more. Upon the start of his prison sentence, McMurphy pleads mentally insane in hopes of escaping prison labor and is sent off to an institution for the mentally unstable. Upon arrival, McMurphy witnesses the dispiriting treatment of him and his fellow inmates by the hands of Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). Disgusted by her superiority and mental abuse, McCurthy takes matters into his own hands and rallies up the inmates to an effort to start a rebellion against the nurse.Unlike the critically acclaimed dramas such as 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Green Mile', this movie supplements a more light-hearted and less somber take on the prison genre. Milos Forman grants a fair charm and ingenuity into what almost feels like a Stanley Kubrick-style picture. This director plants an engaging narrative material and a decent sense of dark humor from the ever charismatic Jack Nicholson. His character is the pinnacle of charm and entertainment as he builds solid chemistry with the supporting characters and a heated rivalry with the antagonistic Nurse Ratched who is blessed by a sinister portrayal by Louise Fletcher without giving an over- the-top or downright evil vibe, but of someone who simply doesn't understand the harm she causes. This actor delivers a darkly comical performance to portray the stark and colorful protagonist. Aside from his performance is a large roster of actors including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Douriff and many others who turn in some fine performances but perhaps less memorable. There are moments of laughter, moments of dread, and a few scenes of shock, particularly the ending.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a triumphant achievement by Milos Forman that demonstrates a fantastic performance by Jack Nicholson and a solid script. This movie is a must watch for film buffs everywhere as it serves as a good exploration into the early years of Jack Nicholson's career.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is one cuckoo's nest you're going to want to take the time to visit.,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not just a good film for fun and entertainment; for people watching it for its funny script and great Nicholson performance, but it's also a great film as it contains numerous clever conventions and tricks that really help you zone in on the situation and ultimately, put you there in the film with everyone else.Although set in a mental institution, I never really got the feeling the bulk of these people were, indeed, 'crazy'. The group that we are presented with seemed fine, just a little socially inept perhaps apart from the character of Martini (De Vito) whom was a little odd. I first had this suspicion when I saw them all playing cards with one another to reasonable success although McMurphy's (Nicholson) expertise in card playing later on only emphasises the incorrectness from earlier on. Martini's so pleased to be finally playing cards correctly that he just keeps exclaiming: hit me, hit me, hit me. This idea of having a comic and often dramatic film set inside one of these places makes for pure gold.This brings me onto the character of McMurphy. Obviously the audience watching this film aren't as crazy and (hopefully) aren't as socially inept as the characters we focus on in this film so that means we're going to relate to him the most as he's the most like us although some may swerve more to Billy (Dourif). Although brilliantly acted by Nicholson, he is further emphasised through the fact he's not wearing plain white like the rest of the inmates, meaning he stands out. McMurphy's reactions to what was going on, especially during the group therapy sessions, also stood out as they were pretty much my reactions also! I was smirking and looking confused at what was happening; McMurphy even gets restless with these people, something we all would feel after a while in that situation.Also, watching McMurphy's relationship and friendship build up with the character of the Chief (Sampson) is just as fun as it is fascinating. There's this huge, native American who's supposedly dumb and deaf yet McMurphy gives him all the time in the world to try and develop him. The basketball game scene is particularly memorable in its hilarity and the way in which it shows Chief engaging and succeeding in what it is he's been told to do. Remember: we think he's dumb and deaf.Another piece of clever film-making is the Chief himself. In a way, I think the Chief is perhaps supposed to represent the audience in the sense that if the audience was a character, they'd be the Chief. He doesn't talk or do much (similar to what an audience does when they watch a film), he helps McMurphy out when he gets involved in a fight with a guard (Whilst I was watching, was praying someone intervened and it just happened to be Chief) and we even see things from his point of view (the only time it happens in the film) as McMurphy winks at him to show he's OK. So this is very much putting the audience in the film as one of the characters; of course this is played with later on when certain things are revealed and regarding whether or not people escape: I find it very symbolic who does and who doesn't.In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is just one of those films that is funny, engaging, entertaining and is actually a very smart film considering what I think it does regarding all the characters and everything. This twinned with the character of Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) who I stress isn't so much as evil as she is doing her job, still looms every now and again threatening privileges. I am not surprised this film won so many Oscar's as it would still do today  a great and very memorable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Book adapted film even better then novel itself,"I first came across the excellent novel One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest when doing a report for an English class in High School. After I read the book in order to establish a better comparison between novel and film I found the movie more to my liking. Everything in the film I had been able to really visualize when reading the book. I could also completely see Nicholson in the role of R.P. McMurphy and in all honesty his lunatic performance in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was much better (and of course funnier) then playing Jack Torrance in Kubrick's butchered version of Stephen King's The Shining. Milos Foreman did an extrodinary job directing this film adapted from the book even better then he did with Man On The Moon starring Jim Carrey as the late Andy Kaufman.For those who have not seen or read One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest the plot of the story follows a man by the name of R.P. (Randle Patrick) McMurphy (Nicholson) who is sent to prision for the statuatory rape of a 15 year old girl. Not wanting to do any kind of labor whatsoever he convinces people that he is an insane person (and ironically enough he actually could be insane by the way he acts in the institution) and thus sent to a mental institution where he meets Nurse Mildred Ratched the head of the insanity ward. From the moment he arrives there he turns the world of the patients, orderly's and nurses upside down with his demands for changes in the schedule. However, in the end McMurphy's antics do more harm then good and the resulted consequences turn out horrifying.I give this movie A++++",,Anonymous,Drama

A Masterpiece of American Cinema,"From the vague but beautiful opening shot with the eerie bowed-saw to the symbolic and tragic ending, it is difficult to not become fully immersed.Every role, even the non-speaking ones are played marvelously. Every actor, especially Nicholson and Fletcher, totally embody their characters.The fluctuation between high intensity to absolute hilarity to shocking twists and the breaking of the human spirit despite man's innate desire to revolt against such things, is captured here perfectly. It's the perfect borderline uncomfortable mix that sticks with you, one you won't find anywhere else because whether you like it or not, it's there and it's real.This is Jack Nicholson at his finest, possibly even at his peak. While it is quite different from the novel, the strength of the acting, directing and the desire for a grounded film shedding light on a subject that still has a stigma attached to it.Through the film, the funny scenes as well as the heart-wrenching ones, are all undercut with a realistic looming sense of dread. The acting, directing and quality of a screenplay adapted very differently from the novel were carried out and executed perfectly.This film is tragic, but enchanting.

Jack Nicholson gives what I consider his best performance ever as Randle Patrick McMurphy, the most rebellious, independent thinking patient ever seen. All of the characters were excellent and unforgettable, and wonderfully played. Not a single actor can be called out for any flaws. The whole movie you root for McMurphy to defeat Nurse Ratched, and in many parts he succeeds and further annoys her. Danny DeVito gives the high point of his career here also, before falling down the acting chain into lame comedies and dramas and whatnot. Brad Dourif gives his least evil performance I have ever seen as the young Billy Bibbit.

"It's a great, maddening drama.","This is a great drama about felon R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who gets himself transferred to a mental institution to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, McMurphy gathers a group of the mental patients to rebel against the oppressive and authoritative Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).For a drama, the plot is incredibly well-paced from start to finish, which keeps you captivated at the story, from McMurphy's heated exchanges with Nurse Ratched to him breaking the patients out to enjoy a day of fishing. The characters are well-developed as the plot delves into the individual backgrounds of each of the main patients, including Taber (Christopher Lloyd), Harding (William Redfield), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), Martini (Danny DeVito), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), and Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif). The therapy group sessions between them and Nurse Ratched are what I think the highlights of the film as it generates the film's mood, plays on the minds of the patients and instigates the ensuing drama and tension.Great acting by the actors - my particular favorite is that of Louise Fletcher. She portrayed the nurse as just a person doing her job, almost oblivious to her authoritative, cold stance and power-hungry grip. The characters generate both sympathy and indifference - especially that of Nicholson's character.Great drama throughout and it all leads to an incredible ending.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher head up a stellar ensemble cast including among others, Danny DeVito, Will Sampson, Christopher Llyod, Vincent Schiavelli and Scatman Crothers. I'm sure I've seen this at least 10 times since that day of the sneak preview including a couple of more times in theaters. It's a classic.

"Both uplifting and disheartening, sometimes both at once","I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as ""one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles"" and ""one of the classics of the 70's"". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a ""crazy house"" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant Acting Makes For A Very Good Movie,"Although the story is not that great,what makes this picture unforgettable is the brilliant acting by the actors,especially Jack Nicholson.His performance is one of the best I've ever seen,his expression is not to be matched.He fakes braindead after having had terror-treatment and lets the other patients very much paralized.Yet Nurse Ratched knows he's faking it.Also great acting is the scene when Jack waits for his girlfriend when she's having sex with one of the inmates,the sad Billy Bibbit.The expression and silence of that moment is very impressive. The other actors are also on their top level,like Louise Fletcher as the legendary ""evil"" Nurse Ratched.She plays it with great determination and it looks not as evil as it should be,that's because she makes it look like she thinks that she's doing the right job.

"Nicholson shines in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""","While watching Milos Foreman's ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", it occurred to me that I've been on a real psych movie kick lately. Shutter Island, Good Will Hunting, Cuckoo's Nest...I even caught myself looking at YouTube videos of Titicut Follies the other day. Psychiatry is often portrayed in a negative light in the media-- as a field of medicine where pedophiles and monsters pump their patients full of pills and electroshock while caging them like animals. While the field has come a long way in the last hundred years, the early 20th century was marred with highly dangerous and pseudo scientific procedures and patterns of inhumane treatment toward patients. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is, among other things, a commentary on the barbarism of mid-century psychiatry.An adaptation of the classic anti-establishment novel by Ken Kesey, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" follows the free-spirited criminal Randall McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) as he is being admitted to an Oregan mental hospital. Randall aims to be declared insane so that he may ride out his short prison term in what he feels will be a comparatively comfortable setting. McMurphy is put in a ward with quite an eclectic cast of characters including the 6'5"" Native American ""Chief"" Bromden (Will Sampson), stuttering suicidal Billy Bibbit (Brad Douriff, who would later go on to play Wormtongue in the Lord of the Rings movies), the diminutive Mr. Martini (Danny DeVito, a connection I didn't notice until well over halfway through the movie!) and the spastic ""Taber"" (Christopher Lloyd). Shortly after his admission to the hospital, McMurphy begins to notice that many of the patients are being abused and degraded, kept in submission by the tyrannical and calculating Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). McMurphy bands together with the other patients in his ward to mount a rebellion against the oppressive Ratched, causing more than a few riotous moments.This film is intellectual gold. Aside from being immensely culturally relevant (a strong theme of individuality v. authority/establishment is felt throughout) the film is a scathing commentary on the state of mental health treatment in the 1960's (Ken Kesey based the story on his experience working in a VA Hospital in Palo Alto, California). The means and methods of treatment were inelegant and at times did more harm than good, while patients were stripped of their individuality and reduced to helpless subhuman husks of men in hospital Johnny coats. The dialog is smart, the direction is spot on (a number of the extras were actual mental patients, and the actors supposedly stayed in character between takes).

They believe he's not crazy at all, that he's just doing all this to get out of working a job. But only watching the movie can tell you what happens. All I can say is that it was crazy. As far as technical work goes, the movie had very omniscient and interesting photography. The movie also had a few good subjective shots. But what really made this movie was how round Jack Nicholson's character was. This movie was a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie combined. The story progression on top of Nicholson's character just made a crazy dramatic thriller. Also every nurse in the movie was so cold and eerie, especially nurse Ratchet, she was so cold and had such an eerie personality, it just helped build the overall uneasiness of the movie.

He pretends to be crazy to get out of working, and ends up in an institute where things just get more crazy. His ability to capture the attention of the audience is very prevalent. He brings a certain charisma to the screen, one that makes you truly identify with his character. The cinematography in the film is also great, a lot of the shots are actually taken in an old broken down mental institution, which give the film more verisimilitude. Certain camera angles that play off Nicholsons character are also very good, they give you a solid perspective of what he is actually seeing while being in a looney bin. The ending I think carries a certain message along with it, it leaves the viewer very uneasy as the credits role.

During his initial evaluation he describes despicable and irreprehensible acts he's committed that prompt the doctor to commit him for further evaluation. Once inside it is McMurphy who starts observing. He observes the patients, some commited and some there voluntarily. More importantly he observes head Nurse Ratched. He views her treatment of patients as inhumane through abuse, cruelty, medications and electroconvulsive therapy. That battle of wills begins here. McMurphy decides to practice his own therapy on patients by treating them as human beings as opposed to being castaways from society. Ratched is relentless in her treatment methods. This battle ultimately ends in one of the most disturbing and poetic endings in film history. The plot is flawless, clever, funny, dark, disturbing, violent, unique and cathartic. This remains one of the most memorable and sublime films of all time. This film is a virtuous work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece of rebellion and humanity,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975), directed by Milos Forman, is a cinematic masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on film history. Based on the eponymous novel by Ken Kesey, the film stands out for its ability to explore complex themes such as freedom, rebellion, and human dignity, set in the claustrophobic context of a psychiatric hospital.The story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy, played by an exceptional Jack Nicholson, a convict transferred to a psychiatric institution in an attempt to avoid hard labor. His turbulent presence and rebellious spirit soon become the focal point around which the ward's dynamics revolve. McMurphy clashes with the inflexible Nurse Ratched, a character embodying the oppressive and dehumanizing power of the system, masterfully portrayed by Louise Fletcher. The contrast between the two main characters is rendered with palpable emotional tension, keeping the viewer glued to the screen.Forman directs with a skilled hand, balancing moments of intense drama with subtle irony. The screenplay, enriched by the extraordinary performances of the cast, makes each character memorable and deeply human. Among the patients, the performances of Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif stand out, each bringing their own nuance of vulnerability and hope to the film.Haskell Wexler's cinematography captures the oppressive atmosphere of the psychiatric hospital with raw realism, while Jack Nitzsche's soundtrack underscores the narrative's key moments. The film is a complete sensory experience that not only tells a story but immerses the viewer in the reality experienced by the characters.One of the most powerful aspects of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is its ability to raise moral and ethical questions without providing easy answers. McMurphy's struggle for personal autonomy and dignity constantly clashes with a system that seeks to suppress individuality and freedom of thought. This central conflict resonates strongly, inviting the audience to reflect on the nature of power and the resilience of the human spirit.The film received numerous accolades, including five Academy Awards, such as Best Picture, Best Director for Forman, Best Actor for Nicholson, and Best Actress for Fletcher. These awards not only testify to the artistic excellence of the film but also its lasting impact on cinematic culture.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a masterpiece that continues to influence and inspire. It is a film that, through its powerful narrative and unforgettable performances, explores the human condition in all its facets, inviting the viewer to a profound reflection on freedom and dignity. Forman's direction, combined with an impeccable screenplay and masterful performances, makes this film an unmissable cinematic experience, capable of touching the deepest chords of the human soul.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Tour de force, Nicholson's best","Chief Bromden's narrative is matched for excellence is this film, with Jack Nicholson perfectly cast as McMurphy, who although not more rambunctious than the novel version of Ken Kesey's feisty character, has the edge in sarcasm.  Nurse Ratched is also portrayed very well, by Louise Fletcher, and the acting overall is stellar.  The portrayal of Billy Bibbit and his situation superb, as is the 1963 World Series scene.  (Interesting:  in real life, Tresh and Mantle did homer against Koufax, two-run and solo, respectively, but in different games, and that represented all of the Yanks' damage against him;  Koufax pitched in games 1 and 4, Downing in game 2.) However, my favorite moment is McMurphy's lifting effort.  We return again to the chief at the end, as the final scenes, like the rest of the movie, do not let us down.

Simply a Masterpiece,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is an outstanding film. Not only is the directing of Milos Forman among the best achievements in film history, nearly all of the actors are at their best and helped in making this movie an excellent display of dedication to the role. I must admit that I didn't recognize Danny DeVito because he played so differently than in most of his later films which were mainly comedies, and although I wouldn't say those later films were not good either, his best role in my opinion was the one of Martini in this film. About the talent and dedication of Jack Nicholson a lot of people have said enough and I can only repeat what has been said before. But again, in this movie he kind of outperformed himself compared to most of his other films. Louise Fletcher has played another brilliant part, making an excellent opponent for the tragic hero played by Nicholson. And finally, Will Sampson, who died much too early, has given this film an important twist, without which it simply couldn't have been complete. But every supporting actor played absolutely perfect either, there is no weak acting or other flaw in this movie. I have not given many movies a ten, but this one deserves it - among few.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
one of best Jack Nicholson film,"This movie remains possibly THE finest psychological drama I have ever seen, mixed with both outrage and subtle comedy. You can look at Jack Nicholson's face and know exactly what he is thinking. He has zero unconscious bias against anyone and just wants everyone to find a way to enjoy life. Not to mention how amazing that it debuted supporting actors such as Christopher Lloyd and Danny deVito. This movie also made Nurse Ratched (sounds vaguely like wretched, or more like ratchet, a tool that clamps down but doesn't let go!) an icon for cruel treatment. Interesting that this movie was released just five years after Reagan signed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act to end long term involuntary incarceration of mental patients.They just don't make movies like this anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" - 10/10","It is widely believed by a number of critics that Milos Forman's 1975 Best Picture-Winner, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (only the second film in history to win all five major Academy Awards), is an anti-establishment, anti-conformist, anti-anything.  I think it's all of those things, plus the most crucial element that some seem to be overlooking: You can't defeat the human spirit.  This film is remarkable in its portrayal of people who are uniquely human, and director Milos Forman knows this, especially during the opening scenes at the hospital when he shows us the patients going about a daily routine of standing in line awaiting medication.  Jack Nicholson is brilliant in a winning performance as R.P. McMurphy.  As McMurphy, Nicholson is a rebellious con artist who faked insanity to avoid time in jail, and is sent to a mental hospital where he encounters the dispirited patients and runs afoul of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  McMurphy begins to enlighten many of the patients, including Billy (Brad Dourif) and Chief (Will Sampson), a mute and deaf man who everybody thinks is retarded.A truly unique film that isn't to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

When People Talk About Memorable Movies...,"When people mention movies that stay with you, they're talking about ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. This deserving Oscar winner stars Jack Nicholson as Randle P. McMurphy, a sane (or is he?) troublemaker sent to a mental institution. Sympathetic to his new roommates, he promptly involves them in cards, basketball, fishing and just plain old fun. However disturbing his presence is to the staff, including strict Nurse Ratched, the newest cuckoo fits right in while breathing new life into the orderly surroundings.Everything clicks in this one. The characters are remarkable and distinct without being exaggerated or unbelievable. The performers are a treasure, arguably constituting one of the most incredible ensemble casts ever seen. Nicholson again proves he's the master at playing characters we think we know while at the same time knowing we may not know. Is McMurphy merely a petty shyster looking for an easy way out or is he certifiably sick? Louise Fletcher is just as good as Nurse Ratched. Although she is often cited as one of filmdom's great villains, she doesn't come across nearly as evil as her reputation suggests. In fact, viewers may find themselves wondering who to trust -- the rambunctious jailbird McMurphy or the professional, buttoned-down Ratched. Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif and big Will Sampson as the silent Native American are outstanding in supporting roles.Given the subject matter involved, not everybody could have turned ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST into such a respectful, dignified picture. Give director Milos Forman full marks for finding just the right ingredients to make this a recipe for success.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
About the Average,"I like Jack Nicholson and I like most of his movies .. and I truly feel that this movie is way overrated .. not that I didn't like it but it is just about the average with two good performance by Louise Fletcher & Nicholson.

I kinda find it quit boring most of the time, and I can't help it if the movie sucks on many ways .. I don't care that the movie based on a famous novel that I didn't read .. because I'm watching a movie and my eyes only believe what they see and I'm afraid I didn't see that much to amaze me besides, I've read some reviews and it sounds the movie wasn't faithful to the novel and was a very bad adaptation ..

One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest review,"This movie was amazing. I was very into this flick. Jack Nicholson is phenomenal and the supporting cast is top notch! The story is very very dark, but the movie has its funny parts. Some scenes actually had me laughing pretty hard. I don't think mental illness is a laughing matter what so ever but there were a few pretty funny scenes. This movie won best actor, best actress, best director, and best picture. I have not seen many movies from 1975, but i can definitely see why this movie walked away from the academy awards that year like a champ. Everything about the film just wowed me. Especially the acting. The patients were great supporting actors and they were so good at making me believe they were mentally ill. it has both Christopher Lloyd and a much younger looking Danny Devito. I didn't even recognize Devito at first. Lloyd was hilarious. To me i found this movie kind of scary. To me, movies like this are more scary to me than a modern horror movie. Let me just say that this is a perfect example why i do not like hospitals. It does not take place in a hospital, it takes place in a looney bin but i see hospitals as the same way when I'm staying in them, this institution in the movie though is so messed up it makes me cringe in certain scenes. Those scenes terrify me. The movie was great and I highly recommend it to everyone. I do not see how someone could not like this movie. I was obsessed with the whole movie after i saw it for the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
No words to say,"(r#90)One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was the first ""favourite film"" I ever had. While it is a pretty low-key film and definitely not what you'd call a blockbuster, it was so loved in Sweden that it stayed in cinemas for over 10 years! So why was this film considered so great? Well, for starters, this is Jack Nicholson at his very best, and that says a lot. Throughout his long and successful career, this might still be Jack's best performance (although I'd argue that his scorching scenery-chewing in ""The Shining"" is even more entertaining). The movie is worth seeing for Mr. Nicholson alone. His high energy, quietly sardonic delivery and trademark leer is pure comic gold and McMurphy is a movie legend.The supporting cast is excellent, as well: the petrifying Louise Fletcher, whose demanding screen presence almost steals the scene from Nicholson himself; Brad Dourif in the role of a life-time as the troubled teen Billy Bibbit; Danny DeVito and Scatman Crothers as one of the inmates and the warden, respectively; and even Christopher Lloyd in his smashing debut role. One-hit-wonder Will Sampson makes a great Chief Bromden, and Sydney Lassick, one of my favourite ""no-name"" actors, is hilarious as poor Cheswick who just wants his cigarettes.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is such a massive success because it balances between emotions so perfectly. To keep it simple: the movie is hilarious, sweet, touching and ultimately shattering. The climax is fantastic and will stick in your memory for a long time. Since the movie's basic plot is very simple (wrongfully institutionalized man teaches suppressed inmates at a mental hospital how to have fun) director Milos Forman can effectively play on our emotions without either manipulating or condescending us. There are no musical or visual cues that tell us what to feel, there are no wailing violins when something bad happens. Instead, the performances and story are more than enough to affect us.Milos Forman, who also cranked out several other of my favourite movies (including ""Amadeus"", ""Hair"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") is probably the one to thank for making this movie as impressionable as it is. There are no unnecessary scenes, no pointless fluff, no cringe-worthy moments in the film. Every scene is needed to move the plot along, to make us laugh, to make us cry. No scene feels like it could have been left on the editing room floor because every part of the film is just so damn good. Forman is one of today's most under-appreciated directors in my opinion. The guy's a genius, and this is by far his best movie.Having read the book which the film was based on, I understand why fans were disappointed by some of the changes Forman made. The novel is a brilliant masterpiece and one of the most affecting books I have ever read. Still, I don't think the differences between the book and the movie somehow make the latter worse. The most obvious change in the film version is, of course, the fact that we no longer see the story from Chief Bromden's perspective, as we do in the novel. I don't think this change was unnecessary at all and it works very well. It even adds a slight plot twist to the story for someone who hasn't read the book, but let's not say too much about that. I know how much it sucks when someone ruins the plot twist for you. *cough*The Sixth Sense*cough* :(Anyway, where was I? Despite some changes in the story, any film fan will see that this is an excellent piece of work, a perfect film to just sit back and enjoy. The script is brilliantly written and the delivery from the cast could not have been better. Overall, a great film if you want to laugh, cry, gasp in horror and just become ensnared in a simple and extremely powerful story.Is Jack's character crazy or not? In my opinion, definitely not. Well, no crazier than ""the average a**hole walking around on the street"". He just got sent to the mental hospital, as he put it himself, because he ""fights and f**ks too much"". Still it's interesting to see how far a man like McMurphy will go to get away from work, and how the other inmates - the true ""psychos"" - react to his extrovert and completely over-the-top persona. The inmates' transformation from quietly respectful and pathetically obedient patients to real people is brilliant. Louise Fletcher remains the same vile, quietly life-destroying nurse throughout, and in the end we cheer for McMurphy when he finally takes the law into his own hands. Fletcher is frighteningly great in her role and handing her the Best Leading Actress Oscar was one of the few smart things that the Academy ever did. A total class act and one of cinema's most memorable character studies. It's a shame her career didn't go the same way as Nicholson's - perhaps she was so overshadowed by the latter's manic performance, no one truly saw how amazing her work here really was.Simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Very few movies can touch this one. -10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 American drama film directed by Milo Forman, based on the 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey","In 1963 Oregon, Randle Patrick ""Mac"" McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment.McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients. McMurphy finds that they are more fearful of Ratched than they are focused on becoming functional in the outside world. McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), who is epileptic; and ""Chief"" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American of imposing stature who is believed to be deaf and mute.McMurphy's and Ratched's battle of wills escalates rapidly. When McMurphy's card games win away everyone's cigarettes, Ratched confiscates the cigarettes and rations them out. McMurphy calls for votes on ward policy changes, to watch the World Series, to challenge her. He makes a show of betting the other patients he can escape by lifting an old hydrotherapy console, a massive marble plumbing fixture, off the floor and sending it through the window; but fails to do so.McMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat. He tells them: ""You're not nuts; you're fishermen!"" and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination.Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely. Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone. During one of her group therapy sessions, Cheswick's agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind up brawling with the orderlies.While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs ""Thank you...Ah, Juicy Fruit."" McMurphy is delighted to find that Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and that he stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning brain damage, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the Etc only charged him up all the more.As the struggle with Ratched takes its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night. They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers). McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a Christmas party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and celebrates. At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls. McMurphy says goodbye to everyone, and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital—though he would like to date Candy in the future. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there. Billy and Candy agree and they retire to a private room. The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.Ratched arrives the following morning and discovers the scene: the ward completely upended and patients passed out all over the floor. She orders the attendants to lock the window, clean up, and conduct a head count. When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and, buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter. Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy's mother what he has done. Billy panics, his stutter returns, he starts punching himself and then locks himself in the doctor's office. Locked inside, Billy kills himself. McMurphy, enraged at Ratched, chokes her nearly to death until orderly Washington knocks him out.Some time later, the patients in the ward play cards and gamble for cigarettes as before, only now with Harding dealing and delivering a pale imitation of McMurphy's patter. Ratched, still recovering from the neck injury sustained during McMurphy's attack, wears a neck brace and speaks in a thin, reedy voice. The patients pass a whispered rumor that McMurphy dramatically escaped the hospital rather than being taken ""upstairs"".Late that night, Bromden sees McMurphy being escorted back to his bed, and initially believes that he has returned so they can escape together, which he is now ready to do since McMurphy has made him feel ""as big as a mountain"". However, when he looks closely at McMurphy's unresponsive face, he is horrified to see lobotomy scars on his forehead. Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state, the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow. He then carries out McMurphy's escape plan by lifting the hydrotherapy console off the floor and hurling the massive fixture through a grated window. Chief climbs through the window and runs off into the distance, with Taber waking up just in time to see him escape and cheering as the others awake.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Powerful, poetic and plausible!  ""Wow"" at the performances and ""Whoah"" at the message","Finally watched this movie 36 years after its theatrical release. Definitely a special combo of brilliant acting, anti-establishment vigor and messages of living life and standing up to oppression.I don't see this as a movie about mental health so much as the human spirit. Nurse Ratched is the epitome of freakish control, obeying rules no matter how inappropriate and showing an inability to see things from other people's perspectives. She truly is a scary villain... which makes McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) such a great hero.Yes, McMurphy has problems and a criminal past, but we cheer for his spirit to break free from the frightening halls of Nurse Ratched's mental ward. That's why we forgive his breaking rules, and boisterous persona... because it's hard to sit back and watch the human spirit trampled so thoroughly as it is inside that mental hospital.I really liked the movie, but it seems ranked a little too highly overall. Ranked #9 of all times at IMDb at the time of this writing... it just seems a tad over promoted. Perhaps nostalgia helps, of which I have none built up yet. It may also be that repeat viewings improve upon the feelings explored. But no doubt it's place on the MUST WATCH list is well warranted.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A fine film that ends on a perhaps too difficult note,"This here is quite a classic film. Nicholson does a great job as the nutty but ultimately sane protagonist, while every other actor/actress plays his specifically written role very well. Notably, Louise Fletcher as the lead nurse. The film does a very good job globally at not dwelling on its main concept and introducing a variety of derivative subplots that all help build the momentum up til the ending. The characters are all well developed, the scenes express their point vividly, there are surprises as it goes and not one dull moment despite the very focused plot at work.I don't do this often in my reviews, but I will give a more personalized opinion: the ending, although necessary to deliver the film's strong conclusion, is perhaps a bit too harsh, like they didn't have to go quite that way and could've found something else.

The Patients' Fight for Freedom,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful and moving film that explores themes of freedom, individuality, and the nature of mental illness. Nicholson gives an unforgettable performance as McMurphy, a charismatic and rebellious figure who refuses to be cowed by authority. Fletcher is also superb as Ratched, a cold and calculating woman who represents the forces of conformity and oppression.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic film that is still relevant and powerful today. It is a must-see for fans of drama, social commentary, and great acting.If you haven't seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great film but...,"Last night I watched ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" for the first time ever in preparation for Ryan Murphy's ""Nurse Ratched""; and I really wish I had seen it when I was younger.
By today's standards it was M I L D. Based on the torturous history of institutions and Ratched's pop-culture reputation, I was expecting Annie Wilkes and not just a nurse with a stern look trying her best to do her job with bad hair.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A comment on the comments,"This movie is a fantastic film based on a very realistic book.I just want to comment on some of the other messages on this board to say that this movie DOES NOT REPRESENT the Nixon era and the Vietnam war.  The book was written in 1962 which was when Kennedy was President.  The movie was made in 1975, only due to problems with copyright approval.The film is a fascinating character study and a definite MUST see. Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson deliver Oscar winning performances.  And the movie also won best picture.  Fletcher's Nurse Rachet is one of the most hated villains in movie history.  In fact, her Academy Award winning speech began with the words, ""Thank you for hating me So much.""  And as the director Milos Foreman once said, ""Jack Nicholson was sent from heaven.  He doesn't just play R.P. MacMurphy.  He Is R.P. MacMurphy."" The DVD version is fantastic and has great info on the cast and movie development.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"6.0/10 - Not Bad, But Far From Being Gripping Enough to Deserve the Praise","Milos Forman is a very famous and well-respected director. He has made several films that are regarded as classics, and some of his movies are amongst the films that have taken the highest number of academy awards ever. I've only watched two of his movies before this one, and quite ironically, it's hard to imagine two films (from those that I've reviewed), by the same director, with such an immense gap of quality between them. I'm talking about Amadeus, which is one of my favorite films ever (layered, well-paced, beautiful and full of interesting motifs) and Hair, which is...not. Hair is a movie that's pretty full of itself, thinking that it has a lot of charm while it actually has very little of it, and just generally has little to no substance besides the fun soundtrack. Too over-the-top and flat.So yeah, I didn't really know what to expect here, despite knowing how this movie is one of the only three to ever win all the big 5 academy awards. I think I was cautiously excited to watch, but unfortunately, again, I was disappointed.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a 1975 film, which was adapted from a critically-acclaimed book by the same name. The plot follows R. P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a guy who's just arrived to a state mental hospital. McMurhphy, always chaotic and absolutely hates being told what to do, tries to get the ward to rebel against the strict Nurse Ratched, who's in charge there. This is the conflict in the heart of the film - authority and order versus freedom and, maybe, chaos.Let's start off with some of the things that I like about this movie: the cast is very, very solid. I feel like a wide arrange of actors are used here in a simple, yet effective, way (and this is maybe a compliment to the plot of the film as well): there is a wide cast of characters in the ward, each with its own mental issues, and all of them are portrayed really well by the actors. Taber (Christopher Lloyd) is violent, cynical and loves to pick a fight, Cheswick (Sydneny Lassick) is childish, clingy and very emotional, Martini (Danny DeVito) is almost floating on a cloud somewhere, always playing games in the wrongest way possible, smiling to himself. I could go on - they're all simple characters, but each has its own bits and gags, and I find it enjoyable. Entertaining, one might say. I like the bonds that are made between them and McMurphy, and I also enjoy the interactions they have with one another.I also generally like the cinematography. There are few shots that are really memorable to me but they're there, and things are generally well-shot and well-composed, and even though I can't say it has tons of uniqueness/ personality visually it's still pretty good.That being said, I think that it's time to address the biggest issue I'm having with this movie, funny as it may sound: it's just not that interesting. I mean, I wasn't bored for most of the runtime, but I also know that throughout most of this movie I could just stop watching and I probably wouldn't have had a desire to know what happens next. I didn't suffer while watching, but it wasn't gripping, wasn't moving. I can point out some scenes that I think are pretty good, like the party aftermath scene or the ""they just worked on him"" scene. But again, the actually GOOD material here is scarce, and I just don't feel the impact that people say this movie has on them. It's not really thought-provoking for me, nor does it make me view psychiatric wards in any new way.One other thing that really bothered me was how stupidly machoistic is this film's perception of freedom, how it focuses on sex and football and fishing like this is what freedom is. I mean, sure, Nurse Ratched could be seen as a villain - her little sadistic expressions, the shadow of a smile on her face when she does something that hurts others, the way she worships order, but still - the ideological clash that should be in the center of this movie feels quite hollow, considering the way in which it portrays this so-called ""freedom"". I get that the 1960's were a time of sexual awakening and they wanted to bring sex to the mainstream and stuff, making it less taboo, but it just feels sort of cringe and too over-the-top here, the way that it's being portrayed. It actually reminds me of Hair - the main character thinks that freedom means doing whatever you want, which makes him kind of a douchebag, which makes it harder to like him and his story resonating with me.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, despite being well-directed, having a really solid cast and containing a decent amount of entertaining, fun gags and bits, is just not interesting enough for me to want to keep watching, throughout most of its runtime at least. I'm not having a bad time watching, and I do enjoy it overall, but it's too thin to really stick with me. Feeling a 6.0/10 on this one. Insanely overrated.P. S
I'm on a streak of disappointing movies, I really hope that my next review will be a really positive one.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not only one of the best films of the 1970s - winning the top five Oscars (Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay) back in the day when those little golden bookends meant something - it is one of the most socially significant movies yet made about the late-20th century counterculture movement.Based on the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, Milos Forman's 1975 film stars Jack Nicholson as R. P. McMurphy, an erratic and violent, but fully functioning, sociopath who is transferred from a prison work detail to the Oregon State Mental Hospital for evaluation of his behavioral health. In the ward, McMurphy's confidence and charisma immediately enchant his timid and unstable fellow patients, but his careless nonconformism also butts him up against the iron will of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who rigidly controls the happenings in her wing and doesn't take to challenges of her authority.While McMurphy is often romanticized as a hero of the free spirit, neither Kesey's story nor Forman's film shy away from the character's darker edges, painting a complete picture of the complex paradoxes tearing at the 1960s youth movements. While the cruel severity of Ratched's stern villainy often obscures McMurphy's serious character flaws, making him seem, by contrast, like a liberating angel, he is really a selfish, reckless and dangerous criminal rogue, incapable of operating within a society without causing damage and chaos at every turn.Nevertheless, within Ratched's totalitarian system, McMurphy's rule-breaking is a tonic for the other inmates. It's important, however, that many them are self-imprisoned, voluntarily in the hospital, hiding from the outer world because they lack the very bold qualities that, unrestrained, have resulted in McMurphy's incarceration. Ratched's dominating approach is not aimed at healing her patients, but rather at controlling them through routine, and the central power struggle between her and McMurphy has little to do with their welfare and takes a heartbreaking toll on the most fragile caught between the two irreconcilable extremes.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Poor adaptation -- read the book,"I can only think of one movie adaptation of a great novel that was worse than this film, and that is ""The Color Purple"". They both suffer from similar problems. Both novels focus on the internal experiences and perceptions of the main characters, and rather than doing something creative, the film-makers simply tell the story and leave out the point of view. In the novel the entire story is told from the point of view of one of the patients. Sometimes he is drugged, sometimes he is in a fog and sometimes he's thinking clearly. To the reader it is as if you are experiencing being incarcerated in the asylum. All of this is lost in the movie. I really recommend reading the book and forgetting about the movie.

A Must See,"i this movie years ago for a psychology class and recently watched it again. wow what a movie! This is probably one of the best performances of Jack Nicholson's career. Its amazing how dynamic of characters he can play. I think he carried the movie entirely, with out him it just would of been a weird mess. Whats so impressive about this movie is that its got its comedic elements(that I think only Nichlson could of pulled off) but its very very very intense dramatic moments as well. It just felt so real, the props, the acting. It makes the thought of mental institutions scary, it was even hard for me to watch at times. There was a large portion of time where i was glued to the screen though, which i think made it very hard to notice impressive cinematography, but the plot and the actors were so good i guess it doesn't matter. overall i would give it a 9 out of 10, at some point everyone should see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Questionable as if he has any mental problems, antagonist nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, spends her time attempting to discover the truth behind McMurphys mental state.

shining,"To say that the film is a masterpiece means almost nothing, especially in today's deteriorated understanding of what masterpiece is. The film is a pinnacle of the world cinematography. It has everything that the real masterpiece has to have: superb direction and screenplay, casting, music, plot, and a theme that deals with timeless concept. What brings the film to the highest points is its power, by which the supreme humanistic ideals as freedom and democracy are, together with everyday-life-related human foibles, are kindly presented for our consideration.The film makes us focus on valuable humanistic categories, without which a man is not a man, meanwhile admitting that no one's perfect, that less-important shortcomings of a man may be acceptable in our not idealized life.The film has advantages compared with the original story, which is brilliant itself. Eliminating the Chief's narrative style, the film becomes more objective and realistic for perception: you get in a first-line contact with McMurphy and others. Nurse Ratched is nice-looking rather than almost a monster, as described so in the book. Moreover so, the film shows that Nurse Ratched honestly and altruistically serves the patients' life and health, although, as in the story, forgetting about freedom. Therefore, by widening the scope of Ratched's character and making it more common, the McMurphy-Ratched conflict becomes more powerful and substantiated.There are a few scenes in the film, especially the final one, which I think are among the best scenes in a movie history.It is a real art: elevated, transparent, at the same time loaded with ideas, and triggering thoughts, an ability of which is as important for the mankind as the principles of democracy and freedom.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest films of all time!,"In this heartfelt adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel, felon R.P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is sent to a mental institution rather than jail. Once there, he's so uproarious that he makes the head nurse cringe. This is Jack Nicholson's best performance yet, hands down.

A very disturbing yet incredible movie going experience,"One Flew Over the Cukoos Nest had a deep impact on me, especially the ending which of course I will not reveal.Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) pretends to be crazy in order to get out of prison and work. He is sent to a mental institution instead, and this is where we meet the other patients in the ward. This movie had a lot of actors that would go onto long careers in film. Danny Devito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif were all a part of this phenomenal movie, and they all gave incredible performances.McMurphy soon becomes a hero of sorts for the patients and helps them to improve their psychological well being. Of course soft spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) doesn't like this as it starts to affect her domineering control over the patients. She is truly one of the most evil villains of all time and deserved her Oscar just as much as Nicholson deserved his.This movie was well directed and well acted. I don't think any other movie actors could've made it even half as good. The movie's pacing was excellent, and it also contained some funny moments, but the one thing I didn't like about the movie was that it was one sided towards the patients. With the exception of Scatman Crothers as the night orderly, all the workers, doctors, and nurses seemed inhuman and hateful in this film. We never got any other sort of view of them. Maybe that was the point of the movie, but it still left me a little uncomfortable. After seeing this movie, I don't think I would ever want to be committed to a mental institution ever. So I'll give it a solid 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Jack Nicholson's Best Performance,"Jack Nicholson is at his best in this classic Oscar award winner from 1975. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one of only three movies in the history of the Academy awards to win the ""big five"" in it's year: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress. For the uninitiated who might not recognize the scope of such an achievement, just know that's incredibly rare and very impressive. The film is based on the novel of the same name, written by Ken Kesey (whose renowned in other circles for his band of Merry Pranksters and his electric Kool-Aid acid test in the sixties). The novel was originally based on Kesey's own experiences working as an overnight orderly in a sanitarium, the movie is said to very slightly (the book was written from the first-person perspective of the Chief, a supporting character in the movie) but otherwise remains accurate. Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is transferred from a work farm penitentiary to a psych ward when his penchant for fighting arouses questions of his sanity. McMurphy sees his new home in the ward as a chance to cruise an easy life until he is released but fails to realize when it entails. The ward is overseen by the strict Nurse Ratched, a cold-hearted woman who takes her position unwaveringly seriously and shows little interest in seeing her patients as human beings. In his time at the ward, McMurphy makes it his goal to inject a little life into his new ""feeble-minded"" friends and light a fire under Nurse Ratched's miserable rule.Nicholson rightfully won the Academy award for his role here as McMurphy. It's probably my favorite role he's done; one of his best, right up there with his insane performance in THE SHINING. He's an over-confident, free-spirited goofball and you immediately rally with him on his crusade against Ratched. He struts into the ward one day and immediately rattles the establishment. His explosive approach to life begins to work more effectively on the patients that anything Nurse Ratched has attempted. For the first time, the patients on the ward are speaking their minds and it isn't sitting well with the staff. Louise Fletcher is the iconic Nurse Ratched, a performance that has been paid homage to hundreds of times over the years. Ratched is considered one of the top cinematic ""villains"" of all time, but I have a hard time buying into that. Ratched is a horrible person, no doubt about that (and played to cold perfection by Fletcher). But she doesn't come across to me as someone who's inherently evil. She's just doing her job and happens to totally lack in compassion. Her perpetual restrained anger and steadfast desire to follow procedure, regardless of how miserable it leaves the residents of the ward, makes for a fun conflict between her and McMurphy. Still, as great as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the real scene-stealers in this film are the exceptional supporting cast.Let's name some of the highlights: Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd (in his first major film role), character actor Vincent Schiavelli, and the debut of Brad Dourif. The patients on the ward are a great collection of eccentric performances and great personalities. DeVito is hilarious as Martini, a feeble-minded man who appears to find infantile joy in just about everything, and Lloyd is downright psychotic as Taber. He plays the character with just a hint of rage inside (you can see if in the end as he's staring on during the final McMurphy/Ratched confrontation), but enough that you kind of wonder how he's allowed with the general populace. As for Dourif, I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the movie. He does an amazing job for his first major film and I'm a bit surprised he went on to more eccentric genre performances than valuable dramatic roles. And these are just the recognizable faces in the crew; everyone in the ward does an astounding job of earning the audiences affections, especially Sydney Lassick as Cheswick. It's impossible not to feel sorry for the poor guy as he begins to cling to McMurphy, practically idolizing him. The cast in this movie is superb and the best part of the experience. The movie itself is engaging and contains some of the most iconic moments in recent cinema history (the Chief's escape has been parodied just about everywhere). It can move a littler slower at times and it sort of gets off track for a moment when the patients take a field trip, courtesy of McMurphy. Otherwise, it's a totally engaging film and a memorable experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Which of These Characters Truly Belong in an Asylum?,"Sentenced to a term of hard labor, charismatic inmate Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) thinks he's found a way to beat the system. Though he may not have fooled the staff of a nearby asylum, protocol insists they humor his pleas of insanity and he's given a bed in their ward; out of the sun and away from the back-breaking work camp. But while he may not be busting his hump in a physical sense, Randle soon discovers that this institution has its own ways of crushing unruly subjects. Particularly those who threaten to undermine their authority.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's most visceral story elements revolve around the fundamental discord between Nicholson's anti-establishment loudmouth and the dominating, manipulative Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). This antithetical duo was destined to cross swords from the first frame, and their mutual disdain soon spins far out of control. Both have empathy for the other patients - McMurphy makes friends and encourages them to think for themselves, while Ratched seeks peace and conformity to better address their ailments - but really, they're both just looking out for themselves. Where Randle intends to use the chaos as a means to escape, Fletcher's nurse is clearly out to stroke her own ego. They orbit, collide, recoil and stiffen like a pair of wily old boxers, feinting and jabbing their way through a series of unfair mental games that go right over the heads of their poor, exploited co-conspirators. Two rich, complex characters, expertly realized by a pair of top-tier actors. Both took home well-deserved Oscars for these roles.This powerful, multi-faceted character study touches all corners, not just those occupied by the most visible leading characters. Its subplots and side narratives are equally loaded, with a superb supporting cast that includes the film debuts of both Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd. Both, as one might expect, shine despite the limited exposure. The younger Lloyd is darn near unrecognizable behind his crew cut and dark, unflinching gaze.

There are some wonderfully funny scenes and some really sad ones. The whole is a roller-coaster of emotions but with the one umbrella like feeling pervading the film which is one of no hope.

Flower Power's Last Hurrah,"""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" feels like a movie lost in time because it is, a 1970s release set in the early 1960s, influenced by the late 1960s and, if the IMDb is an accurate measure (and I think it is) as popular today in a culture drastically different from those eras mentioned above.Why is it ranked below only 11 other movies all-time as of this writing? I have no idea. It's an incredibly well-acted film, by a cast of no-names who would go on to popular careers (and two who didn't, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher, give the best performances). It masterfully builds tension, unfocused at first, to a point where it is barely endurable. There's nice bits of comedy to leaven the proceedings.Jack Nicholson, whose lead performance as inmate R.P. McMurphy is also something of a title role, tells the director of the mental institution where he is being admitted that he got into trouble because he liked ""fighting and f---ing"" too much.Normally a Nicholson film would leave it there, letting you soak in his rude, rough nature. Here the official gives the expected embarrassed nod, then raises his eyebrows. ""In prison?"" he asks, and it's McMurphy's turn to blush.Ken Kesey's novel ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" came out just as the Camelot period of the 1960s was ending, and signaled the start of the ""do-your-own-thing"" ethos that permeated the rest of the decade and which Kesey himself preached. All that was just about over by the time the movie came out, and the message of doing your own thing had found widespread acceptance only in its mutated, discofied, coke-addled form.The film is so committed to its gritty, realistic aesthetic that it never makes clear who to root for. McMurphy, more in the movie than the book, is out for himself, his interest in shaking up the inmates having less to do with any humanistic urges than a desire to have more interesting people around him to steal cigarettes from. Fletcher's Nurse Ratched is widely accepted as one of filmdom's great villainesses, except Fletcher's nuanced performance suggests someone more blinkered than bad, sincere in her concern for her charges, even McMurphy. When she does commit a rather harsh act late in the film, it's so out of character it feels like a cheat.Maybe I'd like this film more if I was a bigger Nicholson fan, like everyone else. Especially in the 1970s, he always seemed to play variations on the R.P. McMurphy character. I'd be more impressed with Nicholson's career if he played Nurse Ratched. But it's a good film, very tough in the way director Milos Forman plays off the texture of the famous documentary ""Titicut Follies."" The acting is so naturalistic it's like the actors never knew when the cameras were rolling and just improvised.It reminds me in that way of another film made in 1975, ""Nashville."" Me, I would have given ""Nashville"" the best picture Oscar over this. And I would have given ""Jaws"" the nod over both of them. But according to the voters of IMDb, the ""Cuckoo's Nest"" Oscar was one of the most deserved in history. Agree to disagree; it's a good film, whatever era it's supposed to be about.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Nicholson's Best and a Masterpiece of American Cinema,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most famous novels in American literature, it also happens to be one of the most successful adaptations in American cinema. Sweeping the major awards at the Oscars (at the time it was one of only 2 to do so) the film propelled itself into a cult classic status and has transpired through generations onto top films lists from people of all ages. Nicholson turns in what I would consider his best work in a long list of incredible performances. His supporting cast isn't too shabby either. Louise Fletcher, Will Sampson, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, William Redfield and Sydney Lassick turn in brilliant performances to help craft Milos Forman's beautiful vision for this classic tale of Man vs. The System.The film is incredibly funny and at the same time stunningly compelling, heartwarming and sad. It combines these aspects so well that you're able to sympathize with characters throughout the film, hate Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and laugh along with the patients on the ward all while rooting for our hero McMurphy (Jack Nicholson).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Don't let the bastards get you down!,"This is an excellent movie. Nicholason is awesome and the acting is generally very good. The only problem I would have with it is the unrealistic way the mental patients are described. This is hardly the way it is to be insane. The movie is also a bit sentimental like for example scenes where we see severely sick people partying at Christmas. What joy could they possible get out of that? However, all this is excused because the plot is so good. The role of the big Indian really makes sense, and this is, of course, really the story of America. ""They killed him."" ""I'm not saying they killed him. They were working on him like they are working on you."" This is the conversation between Nicholson and the Indian. It is very true. This is what ""society"" does to you as a person. There's always going to be some people who are ""working on you"" to get you down.

A comedy of Karisma,"This movie gets a 9 for me because at the time of the movie, it is so cleverly written and directed so beautifully that its simply a joy to watch. It captures the magic of a movie fantastically. By that i mean there are moments that make you smile and their are many moments that make you laugh! absolutely worth a watch! The relationship between certain characters really warms your heart. Jack Nicolson takes us on a journey that allows us to develop empathy towards the other characters but his love for life and quirky sense of humour makes us learn to listen to him and also makes us question his emotional state. This film holds emotional value for me because it was introduced to me from my father who loved it! The movie isn't too long, it leaves you feeling a restored faith in humanity.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lighthearted and free-spirited yet surprisingly dark and ultimately poignant.,"This eclectic tale of a sane man pretending to be 'insane' in order to gain a lighter sentence manages to make a few poignant commentaries on society, freedom and acceptance while also maintaining a dark core story that isn't afraid to be bleak but also isn't afraid to be fun. 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' keeps a lighthearted and free-spirited tonality that allows for the more pessimistic points to have extra punch whilst never spoiling its overall 'live free' message. The fact that it is so free-flowing can sometimes lead to a lax pacing, however, and the increasingly tiresome escapades of the protagonist can become a little, well, tiresome after a while. The film ends up as an affecting and memorable experience, though, one that highlights the 'odd' in 'oddball' but makes it work wholesale with an amazing central performance from Nicholson alongside some surprisingly super supporting performances - including a few familiar faces, too. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""She Likes a Rigged Game, Doc""","There aren't many films that can hold their pop after the passing years go to work on them. This film does. Its just as powerful and fresh as when it was released. In terms of achievement, the movies of the 70s were kind of a garbage dump compared to other decades, so this one really sticks out. As for the performances, its become hard to separate Nicholson from this role, almost as if the character played him. Just like Rhett Butler and Stanley Kowalksi did for Gable and Brando. Magically happens sometimes. Kesey's story too is one of the few great novels of the last century. Director Forman gives a clinic on how to successfully make the transition, what to change and what to include. Material changes are made in execution. For example, the book is told completely through the eyes of the Chief, and the movie does an excellent job of going about it differently, but effectively. The irony of the book is of course, that the narrator (Chief) is the one bona fide lunatic in the ward. This is isnt so apparent in the film, but its not important. The performances by Lloyd, DeVito, Billy Bibbitt are just incredible. One odd bit is giving the Best Actress Oscar to Nurse Wratched. She doesn't do much, just stares straight ahead like a blind person most of the time, so she must have just rode the crest of the film's success. In fact, if you see any of her subsequent work, I think you will agree with me. This film deserves a place in everyone's top 10 list.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"It's a Comedy in the Truest Sense: It's a Tragedy, Too.","Whether it's better or not, the persistent battle in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and whom it's between serves as a secluded epitome of the culture hostilities of the 1970s more creatively, engagingly and powerfully than Joe, Midnight Cowboy or Five Easy Pieces before it, matched perhaps only in that regard by They Shoot Horses, Don't They? The big difference is that Cuckoo's Nest is hilarious, and a comedy in the truest sense: It's also a tragedy. There's a quietly unmitigated close-up of Nicholson a little more than halfway through. We become aware of it because it hangs on warily. It shows R.P. McMurphy pensive. It comes at the match point flanked by the mirth and mischief of the previous portion of the film, and the closing deterioration into misfortune. What is he feeling? Is he plotting more insubordination? Grasp that all is hopeless? The vagueness of what McMurphy is thinking is the film's driving ambiguity. It all leads up to a late scene where he's found asleep on the floor next to an open window. Has his soul finally expired? Subdued for the post-classical '70s into a fable about society's imposition of conformism, it almost knowingly disregards the truths of mental illness so as to turn the patients into a set of snuggly characters ready for McMurphy's egging on. We learn that one is not actually mute, one doesn't have to stammer, and others need not be debilitated by introversion or dread. They'll be healed not by Nurse Ratched's medication, Muzak and counseling sessions, but by McMurphy invigorating them to be guys, to watch the World Series, go fishing, play basketball, get smashed, get laid. The memo for these miserable patients is: Be like him.The movie's naive attitude toward psychosis is not actually a weakness of the movie, as it has no concern with being about that. It's about a freethinker in a lockstep system. Nurse Ratched, who is so uncompromising, so insipidly certain she's right, characterizes the American ""cult of motherhood"" at its militant maximum, and McMurphy is the local color who wants to escape from her form of society. The movie is among other things deeply afraid of women. The only two depicted optimistically are McMurphy's hooker acquaintances Candy and Rose. I mean this as an comment, not a censure.McMurphy's backstory is inferred early on. He was sentenced to a prison farm for doing the deed with an underage girl, and has been sent to the mental institution for ""evaluation."" He's observably a rabble-rouser, and yet acutely egalitarian: He takes the patients head-on, treats their disorders as choices that can be reordered, and attempts by pure power of determination to break them free into a nibble of independence. The movie views them that way, too. The cinematography and editing provide reaction shots that nearly always have the same implication: A given patient's rigid expression is misconstrued thanks to the new perspective given by McMurphy. For instance, McMurphy has stolen the boat and has the group aboard. When he's interrogated, he introduces them all as doctors, and there are quick cuts to close-ups of each one looking vaguely formal like clockwork. This has nothing to do with mental illness but everything to do with slapstick.Nicholson's performance is one of the acmes in a lengthy career of enviable anarchists. Jack is a much-loved American presence. And if his performance is rightly praised, Louise Fletcher's, notwithstanding the Oscar, is not valued enough. This may be since her Nurse Ratched is so meticulously loathsome, and since she exemplifies so utterly the traits we all have been trained to fear in a particular variety of female authority, a woman who has fused sexuality and sympathy into responsibility and rectitude. Dressed in her distantly militaristic nurse's uniform, she is at once bondage mistress and dungeon master, followed everywhere by the petite, non-speaking nurse who is her altar assistant.Since we react so ardently to her we barely see Fletcher's performance. Her uncanny composure, her pokerfaced ""fairness,"" her obstinate observance of policy, as in the scene where she orders McMurphy to get a majority vote in order to watch the World Series on TV, regardless that a majority of the patients don't comprehend what they're voting on. Later, when McMurphy's ultimate fortune is settled on, note how the male overseer hesitantly proposes he be returned to the prison farm, though Ratched resolutely gainsays him.This great human comedy stays everlastingly well-liked as a subversive fable, but realizes its triumph by thoughtfully electing to utilize the mental patients as droll exaggerations. This initiates the fishing excursion, which is simultaneously the most enjoyed, and the most deceptive, scene in the movie. It's McMurphy's noble-cheerful flip of the bird at Ratched and her breed, but the oomph of the sequence can't camouflage the anxiety and bewilderment of men who, in several instances, don't know where they are, or why. Bear in mind by contrast the understated, late-night monologue by the Chief, who talks about his father. This is a window into a genuine character with genuine and fascinating issues, and leads up to the bittersweet release of the very final scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A novel and film of importance for their time,"Treatment in a mental hospital. It's based on a 1962 novel of the same title by Ken Kesey (1935-2001). Kesey wrote the story after working a couple of years in such an institution in the San Francisco Bay Area. Keysey was born in Colorado but lived most of his adult in Oregon. While attending Stanford University on a graduate fellowship in creative writing, he took part in government studies of hallucinogenic drugs. He had other successful novels after this, but Cuckoo's Nest remains his signature work.All of the performances in this film are very good. And the film clearly deserved its top five Oscars in the Academy Awards, as well as the top five Golden Globes and four of the top five BAFTA Awards. Very few films in history have come close to sweeping the top five in the three major worldwide English-speaking film organizations. Louise Fletcher was superb as Nurse Rached, and Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy was outstanding. Nicholson was 38 years old and nearly 20 years into his career in 1975. He had reached stardom by 1970. Although he would receive two more Oscars after this, and five more nominations, nothing Nicholson has done since 1975 can come close to his performance in this film.Most everyone knows about the plot of this film, so further discussion of that isn't necessary here. I would just add that there was and continues to be some controversy over the film and what it depicts. Indeed, some actresses who were offered the role of Nurse Rached, turned it down because they saw a heavy misogynistic tone in the screenplay.My wife and I saw this film when we lived in Virginia. She was a trained RN with considerable hospital experience. Although by 1975 she was a full-time homemaker raising our children. I mention this because I've often found it most interesting to discuss a movie afterwards with someone who has a background, training or experience in a subject covered in a movie. Neither one of us had read the novel. Of course, one doesn't know how much of the novel itself may be fiction, including some possible details that may have been fabricated. Then, how much of the movie may have been fiction or revision from the novel? Just judging on her studies, continuing education of the past 10 years and reading, my wife said she wasn't surprised at what the movie showed.This was about the time that treatment and practices in mental hospitals in the U. S. had come under considerable scrutiny. Many had been changing or were about to make changes. No doubt, this movie spurred them and others into action for major changes. The biggest cultural change coming out of this period was the shift is much more treatment of mental illnesses outside of the institutions. Many more patients could remain living at home with family members, or with family and friends in their homes, or in group care homes that had more openness and freedom.In the early 1990s, when I resided in Oregon, I met Ken Kesey. He spoke at a special Holiday performance of the Portland Pops in Portland's Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. He had made his home for many years in Pleasant Hill, not far from Springfield and Eugene, in west-central Oregon. And, although his book was based on experiences when he lived in northern California, he had adopted Oregon as his home. Since the Beaver State had become a favorite place for location shooting of movies by Hollywood studios, Oregon became the place for setting the 1975 movie. The fishing scene is the only one not shot in Oregon - it was at Fort Bragg in northern California. But the boat boarding scene took place in Depoe Bay, Oregon. Filming was also done at the Oregon state Mental Hospital in Salem, and around Salem and other locations. Except for the hospital, I've been to all the Oregon places used for filming several times and know them quite well.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

If you notice the nurse sees the positive response to Nicholson by the the other patients that she is very jealous! Ratchett insists everytime to keep Nicholson in the asylum longer when the rest of the Board is completely convinced he is normal. Even Nicholson proves most of the patients in the asylum aren't even close to being insane. It's just the sedating drugs and shock treatments that mess them up. And nurse Ratchett gets off on all of it. I swear if you watch this movie and don't want to beat the nurse in the head there's something wrong with you! She played that part awesome!

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"With a strong class view, this film satirizes the negative phenomena in the real society through allegorical and cautionary symbols. This film is the representative of American social and political films in the 1970s. Director milos forman excelled not only in his portrayal of the romance of the original, but also in his delivery of a rebellious theme in classic Hollywood language.

A Superb Look at Non-Conformity,"When rebellious convict Randall McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is sent to a mental institution to avoid hard labour, he quickly clashes with the cold Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and her methods, which begins a battle of wills between her and the inmates, in Milos Forman's psychological comedy-drama co-starring Will Sampson, William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Sydney Lassik and Christopher Lloyd.In a way, it's lucky that attempts to get the film made in the mid 60s didn't pan out, as it probably wouldn't have been a mainstream hit a decade before. A decade later, however, and an America just emerging from the hangover of Vietnam and Watergate embraced its defiant spirit with open arms, recognising the conflict at the hospital as something much more universal than it might have been seen before.McMurphy is almost a manifestation of rebellion, a larger than life figure that inspires the people around him to break out of their ordered routines, and Nicholson imbues this Lord of Misrule with a sly, ferocious charisma that's both dangerous and magnetic. It was a departure for the actor, who at that point had mainly played more brooding, understated types, but really defined his screen persona for the years to come, solidifying his both his stardom and place in the New Hollywood movement.I found MacMurphy a compelling character, but for a long time he seemed a bit too invulnerable and self-assured to fully connect with, never seeming to be affected by anything that happens. It's only towards the end that Nicholson lets some vulnerability in, showing MacMurphy deciding to stand up for his friends and put his own motives to one side, and this let the character feel even more rounded than before.After I saw the film I read that Ken Kesey's original novel had the Chief as the narrator, which makes a lot of sense for the distanced, almost mythic way MacMurphy's presented. It also explains why the focus seems to shift to the Chief's story towards the end, as while watching it the change felt a little abrupt. The deleted scenes also give more of a sense of it being from his perspective, although in the actual film the character's arc is still really well done, slowly gaining confidence and inner strength through his friendship.Foreman's semi-documentary approach makes it immersive to watch, bringing us into the sterilised, claustrophobic world the characters inhabit in a way that feels incredibly realistic. However, I thought the boat excursion in the middle was a bit unnecessary, though, as although it gives more insight into the characters we lose some of the confined atmosphere the rest of the film builds up, opening the story up too much.The actors all lived on the wing while they were filming, which gives their performances a lot of credibility, often never feeling like they're acting. Because of the ensemble approach, the supporting characters aren't developed all that much, often blending together, but each actor brings a conviction that humanises the patients, the film never feeling like it's talking down to them. Foreman seemed drawn to films about outsiders and outcasts, and it's quite touching to see the makeshift community form as time goes on, even if MacMurphy does seem to be using them a lot of the time.This was Dourif's breakthrough role, and he really shows Billy's inner struggle between his deeply repressed side and a desire to break out of it, and you can almost see the conflict playing out in his mind. This results in a scene near the end where his newfound confidence is shattered that's stuck with me since I saw it, Dourif's performance helping to make it an incredibly raw and poignant moment.Each character adds something to the story, with Lassick's childlike sidekick, Redfield's pompous outsider and Devito's quiet shellshocked veteran each having their chance to shine, but it's Fletcher who stands out most amongst the supporting cast. What makes the performance so chillingly effective is how rationally she plays it, avoiding caricature by making Ratched seem almost relatable at first, but with a coldness behind the eyes that increasingly manifests itself as we realise just how ruthless she is.She excellent here, providing the ice to Nicholson's fire, and the conflict between the two characters is absorbing to watch. Even though I knew what would happen, the ending is heartbreaking, effortlessly managing to move from comedy to intense drama to tragedy without ever falling into melodrama. The themes of entrapment and maintaining your identity even in the hardest circumstances still resonates today, and these final scenes help to round that off perfectly.For me, a few little things keep One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Near from being a masterpiece, but it's still a brilliantly astute, offbeat and empathetic ode to non-conformity that features one of Nicholson's defining performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Nicholson at his peak,"We have always seen Jack Nicholson as somewhat of a Lunatic in his movies, slightly evil, slightly murderous, but never have we seen a bad performance.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the Movies that best suits to Jack's Style, not to mention his face, one look at his grin and you want to run to mama. Playing a convict who is not necessarily crazy, but does seem to be a challenge, but he pulls it off with such perfection that I dare you to find a flaw. The accompanying cast provides an interesting and colorful backdrop to his crazy shenanigans, but be on the lookout for the performance of Oscar Winner Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, she is one evil nurse, she inhabits her role with such a powerful presence, that if she were really a nurse, most patients would pretend health just to be free.

Additionally, he managed to perform a great job catching the spectator's attention. In my opinion, what we see here is one of Jack Nicholson's best performance EVER. You can barely differentiate between the thin line that he's crossing; you can't tell if he's acting or that's just himself displaying his inner craziness. And that's beautiful.

Groundbreaking film with flaws.,"The 1970's brought us films and books that showed us how an already competent system could also be cruel and inhumane. Due to following policy on Mental Health programs in the US, lawmakers with naïve hope thought everything would remain normal, but more pleasant and humane. The result is that matters have become much more dreadful and have brought more misery to everyone.Cuckoo's Nest, based on the acclaimed novel by Ken Kesey, is not a movie about Mental illness. It is a movie about oppression, power struggle and abuse. It by no means tries to address the state of affairs with those afflicted with mental illness, but rather serves as an indictment against Mental Institutions. Herein lies the many problems people have with this supposed cinematic masterpiece. I have read some critics reviews who are experienced people in the Mental health profession. They didn't feel the characters were authentic or believable to the patients they have worked with in their respective jobs. I believe that. It's also insulting, as one person noted, that to think that all these patients need is a field trip with some booze and hookers to guide them on the path to sanity and freedom. That's a very immature viewpoint that this movie assumes.Jack Nicholson, along with the rest of the cast give energetic and bravura performances, but the film's point really jars with my sensibilities on a few levels. Nurse Ratched, the supposed heartless villain, is really just a firm, no-nonsense woman who's trying to do her job under stressful circumstances. If anyone has ever worked in the mental health profession, they will attest that this film's viewpoint is disingenuous and inaccurate. Mentally unstable patients are often deceptive and violent people causing harm to themselves and others. This movie presents them as passive and gentle souls who are being wrongfully abused.If you're an anti-establishment person, this is the movie for you. If you're more moderate and reasonable in how you balance justice and humanity you will be bitterly disappointed. Most uninspiring is how it never explores mental illness and how it impacts the people who are affected by it. It just shows these mentally deranged/incapable people as zoo animals that you gawk at out of curiosity, or even worse, for laughs. That I found to be disappointing from a movie that needs to reassess its values. So we don't really get any insight on the complexities of mental illness. The central theme is one of a power struggle between our main protagonists, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and Nurse Ratched) Louise Fletcher.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece that everybody must see,"This film tells the story of R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), whose criminal record earned him a season in a labor camp. To escape this verdict, this smart guy decided to pretend to be crazy in order to serve the sentence in a mental hospital. In this new environment, McMurphy show resistance to rigid and austere rules of behavior imposed on patients and zealously fulfilled by the head-nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), causing a number of situations where he seeks, in his own way, returning to colleagues the joy of living.Directed by Milos Forman, a veteran of the seventh art that this film helped to immortalize, this movie has great actors, among which are a remarkable Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicholson, who took here one of the most memorable performances of his career. Sydney Lassick, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito, in the role of some patients in mental hospital, are also noteworthy. It's a film about freedom and resistance to oppression, a film that teaches us to seek out the good side of things, even in the worst circumstances, and that the worst prison is what we do about ourselves when we give up. The film is full of scenes that range from humorous to the touching but conquers by it's bewildering end, seemingly incomprehensible until we reflect about it and understand the kind of freedom that McMurphy was entitled.Touching, exciting, touching, are adjectives that aren't enough to properly characterize this true work of art, whose beauty was dimly reflected in awards it has received, and which contained the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Actor Drama, Best Actress Drama, Best Actor Debut, Best Director and Best Screenplay and the Oscar's for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest: A Cinematic Rebellion of Madness and Individuality, Earns a Perfect 10 for Unforgettable Characters and Timeless Impact.","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a perfect 10, man! Jack Nicholson's performance is off the charts - the rebellion against the system and Nurse Ratched is like the ultimate mental game. The characters are a mix of crazy, quirky, and unforgettable - it's a rollercoaster of emotions, and you're hooked from the first scene.The whole vibe of the mental institution is insane, pun intended. The rebellious spirit, the pranks, and the camaraderie are pure chaos, and it's like a rebellious anthem against conformity. The film doesn't just entertain; it makes you question authority, rules, and sanity itself. It's a cinematic journey that transcends the screen, leaving you with thoughts that linger long after the credits roll.Sure, it's not your typical blockbuster, but that's what makes it special. It's a trip into the human psyche, a rebellion against societal norms, and a testament to the power of individuality. A solid 10 because it's not just a movie; it's a masterpiece that challenges, entertains, and leaves a lasting impact. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a piece of cinematic brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Jack Nicholson is always good at what he does!!,"Jack Nicholson truly did an amazing job in the making of this film. Although he is a man from prison just trying to get out of work duty by coming to a mental institution, you are still on his side the whole time. He befriended all of the patients and saw them as people not patients. He formed a clan with them. He helped shine the light on how tragic and terrifying the staff of hospitals and such places can truly be. Although she was such a horrifying character, Nurse Ratched, was very well played. You couldn't help but just hate her!! I liked that this movie showed that any sort of patient is still a person.

Big props to Milo Forman for his outstanding directing and it isn't a surprise that he won an Academy Award for Best Director of the year (1975. If you're to take a look at its box office success you're going to see that people at the time realized the issues portrayed in the film along with the ride One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest provided was well worth the cost of a ticket and popcorn.

The Greatest Motion Picture of All Time,"This movie was the most touching movie I have ever seen. Nicholson's character was so free and spirited that you couldn't help having a feeling that you were the one in the movie following his lead. The supporting cast, especially Brad Dourif, all should receive a huge pat on the back for making a masterpiece out of this film. Dourif makes you laugh and cry as the young, stuttering and suicidal Billy Bibbit. Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd have good supporting roles too. Louise Fletcher is superb as the evil yet soft spoken Nurse Ratched. This movie definitely shoots for the stars and beyond with two well deserved thumbs up.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Film Critique,"I feel that the film ineffectively uses the two techniques of characters and acting. When the movie first started the only three characters I could recognize right away were Patrick McMurphy, Chief Bromden, and Nurse Ratched. After viewing the film for two days it still took me awhile to figure out who was who in each character. Billy Bibbit was easy to identify by his stutter, but Harding was hard to distinguish. It took some time to see which character was who.The characters' acting was not that great in my opinion. McMurphy's actor was very thin and didn't look built enough to play that character. His temper towards Nurse Ratched was perfect though. Chief Bromden was the main character who's actor fit him perfectly. Aside from being an Indian man the actor was great at keeping quiet through the film and also his body structure fit the character. Nurse Ratched in my opinion was to calm and didn't react to some of the situations in the film like she did in the book. She was also described in the book differently than what her character looked like in the film.I would recommend both the book and the film for anyone. I really enjoyed the book. It starts off slow, but it is worth it when you get to the end of the novel. The film was also enjoyable. It contain a lot of humor and fit the book pretty well. There were minor differences in the movie that weren't in the book, but it makes the film more interesting. If you do decide to read the book, you should see the film as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

They and everyone else were fantastic. And you know how they say and actor did a great job when you hate their character?

A Milos Forman character study masterpiece and societal expose,"The celebrated book is transformed on screen as Jack Nicholson introduced the common man to R. P. MacMurphy, the wildly excitable convict sent to a psychiatric ward for evaluation. We experience a mental institution through his experience as well as the thin veil of mental illness itself. Witness the horror of institutionalization emasculated by Nurse Ratchet, calmly justified through Louise Fletcher. Mac shares his gusto of live as best that he can, but you always have the gut feeling that it's a losing cause. Many a film in this time period were not meant to appease but to enlighten. Cuckoo's Nest remains a tough watch, but like many of that genre of film, well worth the time and empathy.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Milos Foreman tells the story so crisp and clear it is like viewing a movie in 4K. Nicholson gives hands down one of the most memorable characters ever that has ever been in film and the patients besides McMurphy (Nicholson) are portrayed so well that it is easy to forget that they are acting.

Sweet,"I just watched the movie. It's a powerful show, but i won't be commenting about the powerful performance made by the cast.I think this show is a satire of the society outside. The nurses, the staffs the doctors, feel like a beaurecratic government to me. The patients of course, are the masses. The nurses don't repond well to any of he patients' problems, and give reasons and excuses for not helping them. Ther also seem to give an air of superiority and never treated the patients as who they are but treats them as what they are afflicted with.If you guys can remember , there's apart where the nurse Fletcher said that most of the patients are remanded in the loony bin voluntarily, just like voters they are.McMurphy is just like the anti-government that tries to change the little things that go on in the mental hospital, like trying to watch the ball game, or bringing the boys out fishing.A powerful show....

There is no development of her character. Then, there is Cindy, who is in the movie just to be the arm candy of McMurphy. I could handle this much sh*t, but then she slept with Billy just because McMurphy said so. Writers, please write believable characters.

Our heart beat with Jack Nicholson and his nutties!,"The story of ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" is particular: at the beginning none believed in this film except Kirk Douglas and and Saul Zaentz (a producer,but a jazz producer!!), but finally the success was incredible.This film was the emblem and the swan song of a great and unrepeatable season.When America was crushed but still young and its cinema was dirty,utopian,visionary and rebel.In 1975 there was great film, like Altman's wildness of Nashville,like Kubrick's Barry Lindon, but won McMurphy, with his cap,with his basketball,with his girls,with his rage that push himself to jump on the neck of the nurse-jailor Flatcher and to pay,for the extreme rebellion,the highest price.And in the heart of many people won Great Head that finally destroyed all and conquest freedom.The hospital-prison is an evident metaphor of America, that stifles your brain and your desires with pills (or, if are very bad like Nicholson,with lobotomy).

Majestic and moving cinema masterpiece,"While there is an abundance of personal reviews and comments for this film, I truly feel the need to add my own opinion that is so similar to just about all the others.I first saw this film when I was about 14 and was moved even then by its powerful and sensitive drama, the wonderful characters and particularly the hero R P McMurphy.I've seen One Flew many times since and am constantly surprised by its depth, complexity, and emotive power. It is a film that will live on forever as its themes are universal and unending. Most of all the film will continue to live on on the back of the flabbergasting performances by the actors and particularly the amazing and superb Jack Nicholson.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it and from then on life is just slightly different.

Amazing!,"From the moment R.P McMurphy is admitted into the mental institution, he's instantaneously likable. He's daring, thoughtful, witty, and affable; He's the type of guy that can become friends with anyone, and Jack Nicholson plays him Perfectly!I have 0 complaints with the acting department on this film. The patients were all great, and while they weren't really developed (with the exception of a few), they (most of them) felt like their own thing and were interesting (particularly their reasons for being in the institution), rather than just copies of each other or stereotypical crazy people. Louise Fletcher was also phenomenal at being hateable. Her character is such an evil, threatening, controlling killjoy, and it's actually frightening for a person like that to have such excessive authority over people.One thing I really loved about this film were the relationships. The relationship between the patients was immensely charming. --This is not really a flaw, but I wish there was more on-screen time between them. I can honestly watch them together for hours.-- The brotherly relationship between McMurphy and Chief is just wonderful, and, of course, the relationship between R.P and Nurse Ratched is just fantastic to watch; From their immediate annoyances with each other to their nail-biting climax. Apart from their confrontations they're also able to build their relationship just with stares.On top of that, the film was successful at playing with my emotions Masterfully! It went from Joyous and Hilarious scenes where I felt like cheering and I laughed aloud, to chilling scenes where I was just appalled. Even up to the bittersweet ending where I, unashamedly, cried both tears of sadness and joy within minutes, and my god that ending theme is so damn inspirational.There were however a couple of moments I didn't like. One minor thing was in a scene where McMurphy does something bold, AND HE DOESN'T GET INJURED AT ALL. I just thought it was stupid. Also, near the end of the movie there's something that McMurphy doesn't do that just annoys the hell out of me.Aside from that, I genuinely loved this film. It's beautiful, inspiring, and really took me on an emotional roller-coaster. It's also possibly the best anti establishment film I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Golden Age of Mental Health Care in the U.$....,"Here in ""No Care"" North Carolina, what we find in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST seems almost quaint. Let's say you were feeling a tad suicidal after a serious operation about ten years ago. What would happen is this: you'd find yourself shackled to a chair in a ""mental health facility."" The following day, you'd be driven to another city, where you'd find yourself in a run-down building in the worst part of town. In the bathroom, you'd find the floor and walls literally covered with blood. Some of your fellow inmates would be controlled via ""chemical restraints."" They'd walk around like something out of a George A. Romero movie, drooling and staring sightlessly at you. If you could get to sleep at night (because of all the snoring), you might find yourself awakened by an old man standing over you, cursing you for no reason at the top of his lungs (which he would do once too often and end up being beaten so badly by the brutal, hulking staff members that he literally wouldn't be able to sit in a chair); or find yourself flat on your back, the stitches from your heart surgery just a few days old, lifting your feet to try to fend off a pair of combatants coming your way (they would stop just short of where you lay, but would tower over you until they resolved their ""issue""); or find yourself mere moments from defending- very possibly to the death- a nurse attempting to give out the daily ""meds"" to a psychotic patient actually seven feet tall... In the end, they would give the patient a bus ticket and put them on a bus to any other city in the country they wanted to go to. That facility, I've been told, has been closed for the better part of a decade. Nowadays, if you're extremely lucky, you can talk to a therapist in another city on a television screen once every two to six months for thirty minutes. The solution to the problem of mental health care in this state has been to outsource everything to the Prison Industrial Complex. And Electroshock Therapy IS still used these days.

"A disheartening, heartwarming, and joyous classic about a serious subject matter.","Not many films have stunned me over the years. There's been some great ones and then some brilliant ones, but no film really 'did' it for me. I have my favorites like 'Forrest Gump' and 'The Shawashank Redemption', but again, that's not a lot. Cuckoo just did it for me.It's been about 30 years (if not exact) to when this masterpiece came out. As a mainstream success, it won many awards, including 5 Oscars. One of those 5, was for Best Picture. That was why I decided to see this film. It came on this website as a high-rated classic. To that point, I was not surprised at how much this film affected me.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is an unforgettable classic that affected me lots. It contains fascinating performances, an excellent screenplay, and great direction, not to mention a joyous soundtrack.The performances in this film are so worth the watch. Jack Nicholson gives his career-best performance as 'McMurphy'. He delivers his soul towards his masterful performance and demonstrates an advanced understanding towards this film. His other films don't reach the heights of this one. Loise Fletcher, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance as the 'nurse'. She lawfully is completely different, self disciplined and serious. Both these performances cause a dramatic on- screen battle. For me, its Jack Nicholson who wins.An excellent screenplay is orchestrated throughout this film. Michael Douglas hasn't ever done such a wonderful job. This film, however, is disheartening at times, but also heartwarming, forming a nice combination. When a film deals with a serious subject matter, but has a hilarious tone to it, not to make it depressing.Lastly, the soundtrack of this film is highly praise. The joyous moments of this film flow very well this soundtrack. Unbelievable, indeed...Overall, this film is certainly worth the watch.

Solidly Disturbing,"One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest: well-acted, compelling, funny, and symbolic, but 5 main Oscar- worthy? I don't think so. Nichols gave a masterful performance (as he usually does), and was well-deserving of his award, but though Louise Fletcher was very effective as the cruel nurse, I didn't think her performance should garner a best actress nomination, let alone a win in the prestigious category. At best I think it could possibly have deserved a nomination for best supporting actress, and, in my opinion, that would be generous. Very solid ensemble cast, almost any one of the patients on the ward could've been nominated for best supporting actor. The story worked well, I was intrigued from the start. I loved all of the scenes with the ward meetings; the performers seemed to feed off one another and they all worked very well. Cukoo's nest also had its humorous moments and its surprises, and of course the psychological struggle for power between Nicholson and Fletcher, but ultimately failed to wow me. However, I still recommend it, it is without a doubt still a very well-made film.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
What crap!,"Firstly, I would like to say, What the hell is wrong with all of you people. The movie sucked, for many reasons. Firstly to any of you who didn't know, this movie was a remake of the book written by Ken Kesey, who refused to work on the screenplay because it would not be told in the same way as the book. If you had read the book you would understand my reasoning. The movie is one of the worst portrayals of a book that I have ever seen. They left so many details out of the movie that were in the book. Two Thumbs down, hopefully this crap will again be remade into something way better than what this is. This should not have been nominated for best picture (1975), and should not have won.

You'd be nuts to not consider this one of the best films ever made.,"What can I say it's a masterpiece. It's both funny and it strikes a vital point. As a matter of fact I don't really know how to explain the greatness of this film. i guess the main question is; how do you define insanity? And do we have the right to pretend we're any better? Or for that sake how can we claim to be able to cure mental disease when we have no clue how the brain works.The movie starts with a minor criminal McMurphy (Jack Nicholsen) who pretends to be insane to avoid prison. But as he observes the patients, who by the way becomes his friends, he starts feeling sorry for them, and questioning the doctors means for ""healing"" them. Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher), the woman who is supposed to help them, seem to stir up more problems than she fixes them. So he decides to rebel against the doctors and learn the patient how it is to live again and have some fun. Now to prevent myself from spoiling any of this movie I'll stop here.Now of course Jack Nicholsen is not the only who should get credit for this movie, although he's performance is great. Christopher Lloyd as Taber and this film also introduces Brad Dourif in his first film role as Billy Bibbit. And the one character that holds this film together is Will Sampson as Chief the mute and deaf native American who is more than everyone suspects. i must say he was my favourite in this film.So what is my verdict from this film, 10/10 of course. This film is brilliant, I can't recommend this film enough, go out and rent it, buy it or whatever, this movie is a must see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A great movie directed by Czech Milos Foreman, which was the movie Jack Nicholson was born to star in. Also an impressive supporting cast Christopher Lloyd and Danny De Vito spring to mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

This will remain a classic for all time.,"Based on Ken Kesey's novel, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is still the ultimate story of rebelling against authority. Jack Nicholson gives the performance of a lifetime as mental patient Randle Patrick McMurphy, resisting the dictatorial Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I just can't describe how great this movie is; you have to see it to understand that. Among other things, it disproves the notion that Oregon-filmed movies suck (mostly caused by movies like ""The Postman"" and ""Men of Honor""). Watching ""OFOTCN"", anyone can see why it won the top four Academy Awards for 1975. You don't even know the definition of ""classic masterpiece"" until you've seen this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A man is sent to a mental asylum in Oregon and challenges a nurse for the souls of the inmates.,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the best films of the 1970s. It is based on Ken Kesey's novel of the same title. The title comes from the children's nursery rhyme that goes, ""One flew east. One flew west. One flew over the cuckoo's nest. It later became a hit stage play starring Oscar nominee Kirk Douglas. Kirk's son, Michael, later bought the film rights and felt that his father was too old to play the part of Randall Patrick McMurphy. James Caan turned down the lead role. Jack Nicholson also turned it down and then changed his mind. The film became a box office hit and won five Academy Awards. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Bo Goldman, Milos Forman, and Michael Douglas were awarded Oscars for their excellent work. Brad Dourif was nominated for best supporting actor, but lost to George Burns.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
so BAD and OVERRATED movie,"I am kicking myself for being so unobservant. Films, books, and plays are three different art forms and 'Cuckoo's Nest' has the (mis)fortune of existing in all three stages. None are good examples of their respective forms. This is a good movie but it doesn't deserve to be in the top 10 IMDb list. I think the reason why this movie has so high grade is because people like Jack Nicholson so much. This movie may deserve to be between the top 100, but no way in the top 10.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nothing else comes close!,"This is in my opinion the greatest American Movie of all time (be it directed by an Eastern European and produced by a second generation Eastern European/American.It has everything I personally look for in a film. The acting is so convincing that if you didn't know otherwise you'd swear it was real. The script and ad-lib are fantastic. It's intriguing, humorous, emotionally charged, heartbreaking and politically biting all at the same time.Foreman, Douglas, Nicholson, DeVito, Lloyd and co will never (ever) top this or even get near it if they live to be a hundred.I hold this movie responsible for my failure to pass the Biology, Chemistry and Physics exams of my final year of School. The night before the papers, I was so engrossed in this movie I stayed awake until 2am and could not get back to sleep after.I know Jack Nicholson could play the standard non-conformist in his sleep but ""One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest"" is the closest Hollywood has come to genius. It should be shown to anyone having a hard time fitting in, feeling a bit different, getting force-fed useless crap from teachers, bored in a tedious working environment, dominated by parents or pushed around by work management. If you watch it and absorb it it will bring out the MacMurphy in all of you.A total timeless classic because it was relevant when it was made (five years before I was born), it is relevant today and it will still be relevant after I am firmly in the ground.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superbly acted drama that raises so many important issues,"Randall McMurphy (Nicholson) serves time in a mental hospital where he encourages the residents to fight against Nurse Ratched and enjoy themselves.If there is one film in the history of cinema that will stun you into silence with a delicate ease and demand a hard fought battle against tears then this is it.Made over 30 years ago, this picture has not lost any significance in its depiction of the 'system'. Not many films have shown us what a mental hospital is truly like. The tough scenes from Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Changeling have us gasping but this representation shows us a true heartbreaking dramatic struggle of right and wrong for patients and the treatment in which they receive. The rules to maintain the peace are justified through strictness and a lack of activity for new opportunities.Enter Randall McMurphy, a man who wants to bring the outside world into the safely maintained hospital. Nicholson's Oscar turn as central character McMurphy shakes the plot up and gives a stunning feeling of freedom to a place confined by rules. So convincing is the Easy Rider that you feel he has the potential to set you free.The supporting cast couldn't be more impressive. Fletcher, De Vito, Lloyd, Sampson and an unforgettable debut performance from Brad Dourif as Billy. One of the finest collections of actors ever cast.Portrayals aside this is all about the concept of freedom in a place which wouldn't allow it, a fight against all odds. This is not like a romantic drama where the guy has to fight against his mistakes to win the girl, this is about a battle. A long fought battle of emotions that brings the best and worst out of people that will scar the contestants for life. The strong concept of freedom is juxtaposed against ideologies of suicide, punishment, sex, loyalty and professionalism, making a highly dramatic story, an important watch, which isn't for the fainthearted.The setting for this 1975 picture gives the story a dark image, even though it appears white and pleasant.Winner of 5 Oscars, One flew over the cuckoo's nest raises important issues about the system and people's well being and with stand out performances it is one of the most important films you will see for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Great acting performances from everybody,"R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been sent to the mental institution for evaluation. He's in prison for statutory rape of a 15 year old girl. He has a history of fights and assault charges. The prison thinks he's faking to get out of work details. Inside the mental institution, he finds a whole range of people with disorders, and one controlling Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).Jack Nicholson is a rebellious man who's itching to break out of the oppressive dictatorship of nurse Ratched. Louise Fletcher is completely cold hearted, and projects great interior anger. It's all on her face. This is a movie of great performances from everybody. It's not just Nicholson and Fletcher. Everybody is spot on. There isn't a false note being struck.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This is a movie that gives you everything - laughs, cheers and tears. One of the American cinematic gems.","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is a movie that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a man in prison who behaves in a way to get reassigned for psychological evaluation. He uses every opportunity he can to escape and secure his freedom while also making friends with other inmates and figuring out what makes them tick. He has some success, and he has some failures but as momentum arrives for his master plan he will need to jump or stay put; and by staying put, he may never be able to leave.This movie is directed by Milos Forman (Hair) and stars Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Louise Fletcher (Flowers in the Attic), Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes), Scatman Crothers (The Shining), Danny DeVito (Twins), Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) and Sydney Lassick (Carrie).Everything about this movie is perfect. The writing is out of this world in terms of characters, circumstances, dialogue and settings. This film is unique in just about every way. The cast delivers outstanding performances across the board. Yes, Nicholson delivers an all-time great performance, but Lloyd, De Vito, Will Sampson (Poltergeist II) and Fletcher were amazing also. Nurse Ratched is a legendary villain despite being so subtle. Each character you find yourself rooting for. The ending is absolutely awesome, especially the music that runs as the credit rolls.Overall, this is a movie that gives you everything - laughs, cheers and tears. One of the American cinematic gems. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful.,"This movie is something most people have seen, and for those who haven't' seen it, I highly recommend you to see it. The plot is riveting. I've seen many movies in life, but this is one of the very best I've ever seen. All the other ""nuthouse"" movies that were made after merely had the hopes of surpassing this one in terms of being remembered. Won't happen. Maybe this movie was so great because it was the first of its kind, but it's still amazing. The ending is very sad, but it's also unavoidable. Really don't want to give anything away, so you'll have to watch it yourself.Despite the facts this movie is a drama, it still has funny parts. Overall the movie is something that will always be remembered for causing changes in the mental hospital status. As a bit of trivia, the mental health ""profession"" actually hated this movie once they heard what it was about. There were even several attempts by the mental health profession to boycott the movie. Again, I advise anyone interested in a good flick to watch this.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The acting from the entire cast is absolutely brilliant, especially Jack Nicholson, but sadly this could not save the film for me. I found it dragging with too much talking and too little happening. Yes, it is a very well made film. Yes, it was interesting to see how the criminal (Nicholson) changed everyone's lives and added life to their otherwise monotonous existence. Nevertheless, I'm not fond of talkies, and also found the film just too long to remain interesting.Somehow the film also seems pointless in the end.

The Battle of Free Will vs Complete Submission...,"I saw this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and I was amazed at how true the portrayal of the mental health system is in this movie. The way that the head nurse belittles and degrades the patients and turns their minds to pudding is absolutely astonishing.Jack Nicholson does an excellent job of portraying a free-thinking man who refuses to bow down to the system and the nurse, especially. The scenes where they go head-to-head, trying to one-up each other are just amazing. She wants to be able to dominate him and his mind, but he doesn't want to give that up. He sees her as a threat to his free will and she sees him as a threat to the entire system. It's just amazing to see the conflict between the two sides.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Great stuff, worth checking out!","I usually hesitate to review any movie based on a Book,musical or any other medium before knowing the source material. However I can say that despite not reading the book, One Flew Over The Cuckoos nest is an excellent film that is sure to entertain any fan of movies. The plot follows Mick Murphy, a convict who on his last couple weeks of his sentence pretends to be insane so he's moved to a mental institution as he figures it'll be more comfortable. Well after several instances of disobeying the cold Nurse Ratchet,he learns he's committed to the institute and Nurse Ratchet isn't going to let him go. That's the main jest of it but a lot of time is spent getting to know the other mental patients and and their interactions with Mick Murphy, the most interesting one being Chief, at least for me. The cast what can I say? One of the best cast films ever in my opinion. You see many future stars in there early years including Danny Devito,Christopher Lloyd and more. Of course Jack Nicholson's here and delivers one of his best performances to date. I won't spoil the ending, but it's a nice, bittersweet ending to a film that's harsh but never ceases to entertain. Definitely in my top 20 favourite movies. Certainly one of the finest films I've ever watched.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Still one of my favorite Jack Nicholson roles,"I watched this movie for the first time this year. I wasn't sure what to expect or if I'd like it. I watched it twice to truly digest the film. In the movie Jack Nicholson is sent from jail to a mental hospital for evaluation due to his rebellious stubborn ways. Though his personality can be rather crass and he does like to break rules and make mischief he just wants to enjoy life and help the other mental patients to have fun. This film reminds us of the power psychiatrist wielded then and even now. They decided what happens to you and when you get out. I thought this film did a great job of showing the traumas that people in mental hospitals have experienced in the past and here in the present. This movie invoked happiness, laughter, anger, and sorrow. Its a great ride I recommend anyone take.~KW.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Masterpiece,"One of the best movies of all times.

Totally Memorable,"I saw this film when it first came out nearly 40 years ago, and the impact it had on me then has remained with me to this day. It saddens me that some people have been so obtuse as to score a 1 simply because it doesn't ""stick to the book"". This site is about 'films' and really the whole army can't be out of step (witness the overall 8.8 score despite its detractors). Treatment of mental health has moved on a lot since this film was made, but this film brought to light the type of horrors that were happening in the 70's. An absolute classic, combining humour, pathos and hope.Jack Nicholson's name became synonymous with the film and, with the exception of ""The Shining"", it is probably the film for which he is best known. As the self-committed 'lunatic' who sets about changing the lives of the other patients in an asylum, his wacky charm and disregard for authority seem to epitomise the characteristics of the different roles he has played over the years.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Mixed feelings,"I wanna first state off that I have currently been watching top rated movies on IMDb's ""Top 250"" list. Being a majority of movies being older than I am, I have quite a few to watch. In ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances in the character RP Mcmurphy, a man that is admitted in a psychiatric asylum for being nonworking towards his prison duties. He plays a rather very believable character. Getting to the story, Mcmurphy thinks the patients have no control over themselves actually working towards leaving the place because of the head nurse. Mcmurphy notices this and wants to show them whats beyond the white walls of this psychiatric asylum. I don't want to give away more of the story so i'll stop there. Overall I liked the movie, I like movies that have a meaning and reason that people should start doing. Like under estimating that the ""crazy people"" around us are not capable of our regular human activities and should be kept away of the public. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Mcmurphy and how he thought differently was a major satisfaction and showed me that there should be more people like him out their. The only thing that couldn't leave my mind was how disappointing the ending was for ME. I don't approve of what they end up doing the people in mental hospitals. I don't like how bad things happen to good people. Overall I liked this movie, It was a good time. -James",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A real movie about insanity,"I usually do not comment on movies. This excellent piece of work shows how insanity is actually a society and not a medical problem. Society decides who is insane and makes sure the individual feels insane and guilty! Especially the less ""romantic"" approach and character development give this movie a very real feel. It does not mask what putting away the ""looneys"" really is - a willful act of society to warrant conformity of the masses.Many philosphers deal with the role of insanity in society but this movie lets you grasp the problem with your senses not just with your intellect. It shows without veil what living in an asylum means even if the conditions of holding the ""inmates"" improved.This movie is a definitive MUST SEE!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A masterpiece both uplifting and disheartening,"This is a very interesting and creative movie with emotion and power. It's about a man named Randle McMurphy who goes to a mental institution. Then it shows his many battles with Nurse Ratched. Nurse Ratched is an obstructionist and nasty character who everyone in the institution hates. Her attitude annoys people greatly even though she barely shows any emotion. Louise Fletcher did a great performance but Jack Nicholson is the one who steals the show. In my opinion, his acting was perfect. He was perfect in timing and character perception. The cinematography was excellent and the haunting score is also equally amazing. The ending takes a dramatic turn making it highly tragic but it shows a great deal of power and emotion and that is what makes it so great as a film. 4 decades later, it still holds up great and it's just as entertaining and moving as it was back in 1975. This is one of the 3 movies in history to receive all 5 top Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). This is also the most deserving film to receive those awards.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A power struggle with a tragic end,"""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" is about a power struggle. A struggle between head nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and patient McMurphy (Jack Nicholson). Ratched stands for order, regularity and stable routines. McMurphy stands for lust for life, adventure and improvisation. Both Nicholson and Fletcher did a perfect job, but Nicholson got most of the credits,The novel of Ken Kesey is situated in a mental hospital but maybe for director Milos Forman the hospital was a mataphor for society at large. We must not forget that Forman grew up in a communist society with heavy pressures for conformity. In this review however I take the mental hospital at face value.Relevant for the interpretation of the film is that in the mid 70's there was a discussion in the psychiatry if patients had to be seen as mad or just maladjusted (to the society, maybe it was the society that was mad?) Part of these discussion were the following questions.(A) Is the goal of the mental hospital to cure the patients or to just keep them calm?(B) Is the mental hospital there for the patients or is it the other way around?Ragarding question A the goal of the mental hospital in the film is just to keep patients calm. Tranquilizers are used heavily. Today we would ask ourselves if the daily routine that nurse Ratched guards so fanatically is for the benefit of the patients or just a symptom of her own autism.Regarding question B the patients seem to be there on behalf of the mental hospital. McMurphy is for observation in the hospital. Although clearly sane he is quickly transformed to a lifelong inhabitant. In one of the most interesting scenes McMurphy managed to organise a nightparty. During this party Billy (Brad Dourif), a shy boy having problems contacting girls, has a date with a hooker. The next morning he does not stutter anymore. Of course it is simplistic to suggest that a night with a hooker can cure a psychiatric patient, but the therapeutic group discussions from nurse Ratched didn't do the job either.In some reviews I read that ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" was a comedy. I was amazed. For me it is a tragedy, because in the end the lust for life loses. There are comic scenes for sure. One example is the fishing trip in which McMurphy introduces the patients to the owner of the ship as academics. We see them in close up one at a time and indeed, it could work if you saw them for the first time. These comic reliefs are however not the highlights of the movie, I would rather say to the contrary.At 80% of the film there is a mysterious moment. During the nightparty McMurphy has the chance to escape, as already planned. He lets his chance passes by. Why? Has he already given up? Does he think he can still win the struggle with nurse Ratched? Does he want to give Billy more time with the hooker? I don't know. I hope it was the reason mentioned last, for McMurphy was a rebel, but one wit his heart on the right place.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

This coupled with the film's powerful message makes it a film that easily surpasses something like the ovverated Shawshank Redemption (of course its different- but they share similar themes- freedom, institutionalisation, the corruptness of the seemingly unaccountable institutions).I really can't reccommend this film enough.
