"Interesting idea, poorly executed","If there's something instantly captivating about a movie - it's when the idea's new. In ""In Time"", the plot revolves around the interesting idea that time is the new currency and rules the world like the Dollar once used to. The poor must fight to live for a few days, the rich are practically immortal.This could have become a new scifi milestone, if it wasn't for the poorly executed script, stiff acting and highly predictable plot. The scenes are thrown together and feel like reenacted from typical ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", two against the world and enemy of the state type movies. None of the scenes seem original or well executed. Actions and reactions by the actors seem unnatural or rushed, unrealistic even. Some character development just feels plain wrong. Not because of the plot, but because the characters don't seem to be portrayed very well. Although a scifi movie, realism is still necessary. ""In time"" shows a world that is not believable and many scenes seem straight stupid.It's not a great movie. If not for the cool plot idea and the likable main character, it wouldn't be worth watching at all. But if you want to see a world, albeit fake, where people fight over time to survive, give it a go.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great idea, mediocre execution","Everyone is on a clock. What keeps the general population from devolving into id-driven mobs is the fact that no one knows how much time they have left on theirs. If you had a constant reminder on your forearm, however, you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.""Time is money"" was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to ""money is time"" is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"In Short, Thoroughly Entertaining.","I don't know about you but looking down at the reviews there seem to be an overwhelming amount of negative responses. I was completely disheartened by this.In my opinion, In Time was an original well written and well acted and truly thought provoking production and I loved it. The fact that it subtly questioned our morality and made us question real world issues such as poverty and political stance was just one of the things that made me love this movie.To the people who dislike the feature and to those negative reviews which I have read I have a few responses. Firstly, I saw a point about not enough back story into the body clock. The first thought that struck me was really? The movie is not centred around the body clock, and furthermore throughout the film we are told of its uses and get to a fairly good understanding to how it works. Do you not agree that any more back story would waste time and most likely just bore the typical viewer? Finally to those who disliked the acting and script I strongly disagree. I though both Justin and Amanda played there parts very well and there chemistry was as good as any action film I have scene.I would highly recommend this film to anyone, and suggest if you haven't already seen it you should definitely make some time if you think you will enjoy this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very unique film,"'In Time' was a film that I saw advertised when it was released and thought it looked good but then I didn't hear any more about it until I came across it on DVD. I'm glad I did manage to see this at last because it was very enjoyable.The plot for this film is very unique, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this. There was a lot of familiar actors in this (Cillian Murphy, Johnny Galecki, Vincent Kartheiser to name a few). The acting was very good overall I thought, even from Justin Timberlake in the lead role.There was some good drama as well as good action scenes (car chases, shooting etc). It is the sort of film that will keep you guessing as to what will happen next and it was just a very interesting concept overall.It would have been nice if there was a bit more back story though, it was never really explained why the world was like it was. Apart from that, just take it for what it is and enjoy it.Would recommend it to anyone who fancies watching something a bit different.8/10.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What A Pity,"Looking at this film and its concept I was intrigued. With this said the film does fail to live up to the potential of its concept. One of the few major issues i have with this film is the lack of back-story with regards to the implementation of the 'body clock', along with the lack of true quality acting and a well written script. As a result of this what the viewer will get from this film experience are moments (and i mean moments) where you are enjoying the film, but by the end of it all you can reflect on what you have seen and notice that you could have done a lot more with your money if you had not gone to watch In Time....What a pity",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's all very familiar, which doesn't make it one whit less awesome.","I went into this one with the lowest expectations, and boy was I wrong. For one thing, before I saw his name in the opening credits, I had no idea this was an Andrew Niccol film, and since he is the stylish, stylized genius who gave us GATTACA, suddenly things were looking up. Then, wow, this cast! Sure, I knew about Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, but check out the rest of them: Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy, THE BIG BANG THEORY's Johnny Galecki, WHITE COLLAR's Matt Bomer and genre-It Kid, Alex Pettyfer. I mean, come on! How can a movie be directed by Andrew Niccol AND contain so much of the pretty AND also be science fiction and NOT be completely, exactly, entirely the kind of movie that I would love, love, love?Want to know why my expectations were low? I'd seen a snippet of the trailer -- which just looked to me like a bunch of TRANSFORMERS-style running around the place -- and had read the basic film synopsis sent to me by Fox Studios' publicity department. So what I knew was this:""Welcome to a world where time has become the ultimate currency. You stop aging at 25, but there's a catch: you're genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich ""earn"" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system.""Why was I hesitant about this premise? Because, come on! How many sci-fi tropes do you want to hit? Predetermined age-limit to combat overpopulation: LOGAN'S RUN, among many others. Being able to effectively purchase immortality: Elizabeth Moon's Familias Regnant series, among many others. Falsely accused and on the run in a future, dystopian society: hello MINORITY REPORT, THE ISLAND and who knows what all else! But you know what? Much like he did in GATTACA, where he took the already well-worn path of the genetically-superior being not necessarily being superior and made it his own, writer/director Niccol brings a freshness, almost a whole new sensibility to these and the other trappings of classic sci-fi he offers up to us here. We also get action, suspense, romance, humor, social commentary, gorgeous visuals and, as I mentioned, bucket loads of the pretty -- I would pay good money to see Matt Bomer and Olivia Wilde in anything; impossibly beautiful doesn't even begin to cover that blessed pair -- and wow, what a thoroughly, unexpectedly fun, truly thought-provoking and utterly engaging time this movie was. I am still flabbergasted at just how much I dug this. I actually broke into spontaneous applause as the credits rolled. And I can't wait to see it again.But the big question: how was JT? He was, I will have you know, excellent. I have long felt that there was something effortlessly engaging about his whole persona, whether in interviews or on SNL or in roles as diverse as beleaguered rookie cop in EDISON, Napster hipster Sean Parker in THE SOCIAL NETWORK or squirrelly substitute Scott in BAD TEACHER. He doesn't really seem to act: he just IS. Here, he is an unlikely action hero, but somehow, he pulls it off in grand style, looking simultaneously earnest, dangerous and adorable, and easily holding his own even alongside someone the likes of Murphy, whose hypnotic eyes can convey more in one blink of an eyelash than many a lesser actor can get across in an entire soliloquy.All of the other performances are top notch, particularly from Wilde and Galecki -- who brings most of the funny in the film -- and hey, you know who else is in here! Vincent Kartheiser, AKA Connor from ANGEL! And he's not bad at all, either. In fact, he and Pettyfer are our main bad guys, and both pull of criminal cool pretty damn well.The long and the short of it? See this film. It's entertaining, it has a message, it is a feast for the eyes, and we definitely need to be encouraging more of this kind of genre filmmaking. True, it's not a truly original piece of work. In fact, in addition to all of the other things it reminds me of, it also brings to mind EQUILIBRIUM -- not so much in its content but in the way that it is essentially a mashup of a whole bunch of established ideas out of speculative fiction, but gives them new life (Equilibrium went with BRAVE NEW WORLD, FAHRENHEIT 451, 1984 -- and also LOGAN'S RUN as its inspirations). But that's okay; I really like EQUILIBRIUM, too.In doing a little research for this review, I discovered that the ever-litigious SF luminary Harlan Ellison is suing Niccol and various studio-types for plagiarism, given this movie's similarity to his 1965 short story ""'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman."" Having not read the piece in question, I can't comment, but considering Ellison's unrelenting pursuit of copyright infringers, one would think that if Niccol WAS to knowingly steal from anyone, he'd have picked a safer target. After all, most of the ideas in this movie can be found all over Sci-Fi, not to mention in Action, and Drama and Crime, as well.But sometimes it's not about the provenance of the ideas, it's what you do with them. And here, Niccol has done wonders. (As long as you suspend your disbelief and go with the fact that Timberlake, Seyfried and the rest are, biologically, only 25. Luckily, Hollywood's been conditioning us to do just that for years.)-- Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time is money and the science fiction romance genre is money for Hollywood,"In the world of ""In Time"", time is money. Literally. Set in a future where everybody ages until 25, then they have one year left to live, except that one year is currency. The rich can live at age 25 eternally and the poor don't always have a chance to live. Time zones are classes of wealth and you can't cross over without upsetting the order of the world. It's quite possible that they have taken this time is money equation too far.But I enjoyed this twist on the same old action movie. It even starts with some thoughts on philosophy. A rich boy finds himself in a poor man's bar where everybody wants a piece of him, so much so that his considerable wealth and time line are in danger. While the poor are in constant need of money, it turns out that the rich don't have the same drives for life. This rich guy is impressed by Will's (Justin Timberlake) honesty and earnest desire to find out how the other side lives. Will is then faced with the possibility of an infinite life time of money.From there, we get a Robin Hood action movie. Will pairs up with a daddy's girl vixen, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) and they are on the run from the time keepers (Cillian Murphy). I have enjoyed Timberlake's recent foray into the world of movie stars, but I like him more as a comedic straight man than as an action hero. Seyfried, on the other hand, proves that she can play pretty much anything. A mysteriously innocent, sharp-shooting, sexy action girl suits her well.The logic that this new world presents is pretty easy to figure out, but as you are doing that at least you are distracted from the usual action movie set-up. Hollywood has ventured again into the science fiction romance genre, and has again come out with an intelligent, action-packed film with something for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nice idea, poor execution","IN TIME bears some similarities to LOGAN'S RUN in its depiction of a youthful society who never outwardly age and who are consigned to oblivion at the age of 25. However, the narrative then takes on an extra twist and runs with it (literally, as it happens) in its depiction of time being treated as a currency; you can buy, sell, and steal it, and when it runs out (which you know thanks to a handy tracker on your wrist) you die. It's as simple as that.I actually like the premise, which has the potential for lots and lots of suspense; it's like having a ticking bomb strapped to your wrist. What could go wrong, right? Well, the answer is most things. IN TIME is an insipid, soulless Hollywood blockbuster, happy to copy the look and style of recent films like JUMPER without ever bringing anything new to the table. Kiwi director Andrew Niccol once made the excellent GATTACA so it comes as a surprise he made a film so unoriginal and uninteresting.One of the worst things about this film lies in the central casting of Justin Timberlake as the hero. He's wooden, never less than wooden, and merely cast due to his popularity with audiences. I hated his protagonist throughout, so that made the film as a whole hard to sit through. Amanda Seyfried is better, and Cillian Murphy is always a pleasure to watch on screen, but when you have such a vacuum of acting talent in the central role then your film's going to be flawed. It doesn't help that the family-friendly rating means that there's nothing contentious or powerful here, or that for a film with a chase-focused storyline there aren't really any good action or suspense scenes to enjoy.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Make Time for this Movie.,"A very unusual film screen-play, well written and shot, don't expect any CGI effects here, this is a very down to Earth sci-fi that bears more than a passing resemblance to our current problem with world banks. Surprisingly Justin Timberlake puts in a very professional performance, and not a song in sight, Timberlake carries the part with a very grounded performance being so laid back that he is almost horizontal. Amanda Seyfried submits a polished performance although her make-up makes her look like one of those Japanese animations of what a European looks like, complete with over-sized eyes. The film holds the attention from the first to the last frame and provokes some emotion from the viewer on several levels. Certainly worth a watch, not quite a Rolex, but much better than a Timex.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bonnie and Clock,"This movie is fine if you don't think too much. First of all, there is the fundamental premise that one can use time as currency. Who decided that at 25 years of age the denizens of the future, would die unless the begged, borrowed, or stole time. We are never given that explanation but all people have a sort of countdown clock on their forearms. Those who have accumulated time become hunted by those who wish to steal it. There is also a set of sectors where people have as much time as they want. Everyone stops aging at 25 and either dies or maintains that age (hence mothers may be 100 years old and look just like their 25 year old children). Also, a grasp of the wrist of another person can transfer time. Justin Timberlake is given a huge cache of time by a suicidal man and sets out to avenge the death of his mother, who has succumbed before she can get ""reloaded."" He takes a spoiled young woman with him and they go around blowing up the system. They are pursued by a sort of latter day Javert, who has dedicated his miserable life to being a timekeeper, arresting those poor souls who are just trying to live. Anyway, it's all pretty absurd, unless you look at it as a parody of our own grasping society and our social classes. Pretty far fetched, even if disbelief is suspended.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I had envisioned.,"Well this film was surprisingly better than I was expecting it to be.. Justin Timberlake isn't a very strong actor in my opinion, but he took the spotlight in this one. Amanda Seyfried looked beautiful as ever with her little bob, and the acting really wasn't too bad.There's sad and happy moments all with that little bit of constant tension as you'll find if you watch it.It was a really good concept and an enjoyable film, I gave it an 8/10 as I think they could've thought of a better lead actor but it was enjoyable none the less. I would recommend it to anyone, it doesn't really ever become boring and the tension keeps you focused at all times.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Values and a High Concept,"You should know that this movie will never delve into deep psychological nor sociological studies. It will never satisfy anyone who wanted something deep and thoughtful. What is is, is an entertaining movie with a very good idea to back it up. While some may argue that Timberlake might not have been the best choice as lead actor, I think he does a good job with the role he has on hand here.You also get Alex Pettyfer in a role that hints at him being more than a pretty face. Still not a real challenge of course, this may lead to more serious roles for the guy. While the film got quite a lot of momentum during the ""Occupy"" movement (you can see why, after you watched the movie), it will never be able to get close to movies like Blade Runner and others. But try not to judge it like that and you will have a good time watching this tension filled Sci-Fi Thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"The word 'time', time and time again.","I wonder how many times the word 'time' is mentioned in In Time. It's a lot of times, I'm sure, but I didn't take the time to count. Maybe next time.Starring Just-In Time-berlake and Amanda Seyfried (whose name doesn't really lend itself to any clever time-related puns), this film has a very intriguing premise - that time is a commodity that can be bought or sold, allowing the rich to live indefinitely while time runs out for the poor.Sadly, writer/director Andrew Nichol fails to do the idea justice, his film spending most of its running time being little more than one long chase, as his photogenic leads try to bring down a big-time time magnate, while Timekeeper (i.e. cop) Raymond Leon works around the clock to call time on their antics.It'll only be a question of time before you'll be picking holes in the plot, Nichol having clearly not spent enough time ironing out In Time's wrinkles.4/10, just for keeping me amused for most of the time with its incessant use of the word 'time'.Best line of dialogue: 'Time'.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time well spent!,"This is a really cool idea for a film. A day in the future when the commodity of value is not cash or gold, it is time. Everyone gets to live to age 25. After that you have one year to live, or less. It all depends upon whether you use all your time credits or you earn more. Regardless, if you live to age 100, or longer, your body physically remains looking twenty five.On the plus side is Justin Timberlake coming back and showing that his misstep in Bad Teacher (2011) was just one of those embarrassing Hollywood screw ups. Timberlake has real drama and acting talent and is definitely here for the long haul. (Too bad Elvis was never given such chances.) Timberlake gave us a glimpse of his depth last year in The Social Newtwork (2010) , but his talents were not fully developed for Friends with Benefits (2011).The script starts with the eerie, sobering reminder, and all too familiar words, ""We don't have time...we don't have time..."" Think if today you had to buy everything with time, instead of bank credit or cash. Coffee costs four minutes. A bus ride costs an hour. A car costs two years. People can give or take time from each other. Just don't run out of time or you will die on the spot. If this were real, would you treasure and spend time more wisely? The real interesting question may be that time really is the currency we live by now, we just fail to see it that way. The simple fact is that you can earn countless piles of cash and gold in this world, but you really cannot buy time. Despite the wealthy in today's world sometimes being able to cheat a few years with better health care, we all are going to die in the same average years.While the script is the superficial tale of Will Salas (Timberlake) and his Mom (Wilde) trying to pass time in a futuristic world, the messages of the film go far deeper. It is really a tale of class warfare. People who have time, like the mega ""eonaire"" Phillipe Weis (Katheiser) and his rich daughter Sylvia (Seyfried) and those who constantly struggle to keep time (or run out of it) like the Salas family. Will gets the chance to move up into a better time zone thanks to a man who has just decided that after a hundred years or so, he prefers to ""time out."" He leaves Will the prophetic warning ""Don't waste my time."" How Will chooses to spend his time, for himself or for the benefit of all, is now the story.I really did not mind that the future depicted in this film was not futuristic looking and all the cars were vintage 1970's models with updated lighting and electric sounding motors. It saved a huge budget rather than try to make the world look like it probably will in 2013 or so. And I think the point was that the future is really now.As an entertaining film, my 7.5 rating is spot on. As a thought provoking experience, I might have given it a 10.0. After seeing this film, you should go out and visit with friends. Your own clock is ticking down. Are you really using it wisely? Unlike the time down clock on the arm of the people in this film, you never know when your time is about up.This film...it's worth your time.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Definitely worth seeing, so original.","In a future world, time is currency, and once people hit 25, they have to acquire it, buying it, and stealing it, Will Salas is lucky enough to inherit some, a lot of it, but people want it, accused of murder, he goes on the run with a hostage.I am really surprised by so many of the bad reviews, it's so much better than some would have you believe.I was blown away when I first saw this in the cinema, I expected a follow up, a TV series, it just got forgotten about, which is a shame.It may not be a world beater, but there is a real cleverness in the plot, it's so original, the countdown timers really do add a sense of urgency. Production values are strong, it moves on by at a good pace.Time is the great leveller up, rich or poor, it's one thing that we can't change, when your time is up, it's up, but what if your wealth allowed you to buy time, literally stealing it from others less fortunate.As a social commentary, it worked back in 2011, it would actually work better if it were released in 2023, it somehow seems even more relevant in this troubled time. The rich get richer, the poor literally die on The Streets.I loved the way everything had a time cost, from hotel rooms and cars, to a plain and simple cup of Joe.Sumptuously stylish, this film looks terrific, sharp suits, car chases, futuristic tech, it really does deliver in terms of visuals.The acting was great, we have the delectable duo of Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, they're excellent, I really did rate Cillian Murphy.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
surprising,"I don't believe this film earned as much credit as it should have done. The 6.6 rating 'In Time' received definitely does not depict the unique ideas and innovative aspects that this film portrays. When I first heard of this film I was put off by it's rating and reviews, but after sitting down and watching it, I think it is one of the best films I have seen in a while. Andrew Niccol's futuristic view of life and the comparison between living in the ghetto and the city emphasises the severity and the nature of each individual as a categorised human being. I was skeptical at first about Justin Timberlake and his presence in the film but surprisingly his professional performance intrigued me to keep watching and write this review.

I enjoyed it but missed opportunities.,"In Time (2011) presents an intriguing dystopian concept where people stop aging at 25 and must buy more time to live. The film features impressive special effects that make the futuristic world feel real. Justin Timberlake fits well as the main protagonist, and Cillian Murphy excels as the antagonist.The cinematography is visually stunning, with proficient use of lighting in both daylight and night scenes, although the lighting in some club scenes feels a bit off. The film makes effective use of medium and long shots, complemented by great editing, particularly in the car chase scenes, which are thrilling and well-executed.However, the editing feels clumsy and choppy at times, detracting from the overall experience. The pacing is intentionally rushed, aligning with the protagonist's characteristics. Despite enjoying the film, it feels like there are missed opportunities, especially in exploring its rich concept.The writing captures the dystopian feel well, with time as the currency in a world where the poor and the rich are starkly divided. The film raises philosophical questions about life, death, time, justice, generosity, capitalism, poverty, morality, and trust. The dialogue is engaging, but the concept sometimes feels underdeveloped, lacking depth and straightforwardness.The chase and fight scenes are entertaining, and the production design, with its contemporary buildings and futuristic cars and clothing, enhances the film's atmosphere. The soundtrack is unique, with a calm, mellow, and slightly electronic touch, featuring gritty bass lines and a dystopian feel. It's not generic but purposeful in its composition.This film feels like a school project with a high budget. It could have benefited from extended scenes and more action sequences to fully explore its potential.Overall, In Time is an interesting watch with visually stunning cinematography and a unique concept.

Time is wasting and you may want your time back at the end of the film,"I'll start straight off the cuff. Niccol is one of my favourite writer/directors. In fact, one of my favourite films is Gattaca, which has been so under-rated over the years since its release. To me he's been a great Sci-Fi writer, so going into this I was hopeful of something of quality.Alas, ""In Time"" is not for the true Sci-Fi thinker. It paints a world in which time is money. That isn't that new an idea, but Niccols does succeed in pushing the metaphor as a commodity. Those with time are rich, those without time are poor. It's a simplistic analogy. As with Niccol's other films, the cinematography is beautiful. The best actors in the film aren't the main characters, rather Cillian Murphy, Vincent Kartheiser and (surprisingly) Alex Pettyfer present more interesting characters. They all shine, especially Murphy. The film seems like one long car chase, when what you actually want to delve into are the complexities - the debates between the characters themselves over the issues of the world they live in. Not a single clever conversation happens between anyone. Murphy is a great actor and I would have been interested to see the debate about right and wrong become greyed through some thinking. Life is not black and white. The film ending is unrealistic and I wonder if this was the ending envisioned by Niccol or the ending the producers wanted to boost sales.Sadly this film could have been a great deal more. It had a good topic. It had some great actors, yet it failed because the story lost the nuances and complexities to meet the lowest common denominator, rather than raising questions or making the viewer think critically. See it, but be prepared to be disappointed. It isn't subtle.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
excellent plot..excellent ending...excellent entertainment!,"all I can say IS WOW..it was right up there with INCEPTION!!...LOVED MURPHY , TIMBERLAKE AND SEIFRIED...I saw this movie in a private screening in Thousand oaks CA, 2 hour drive from where I live but well worth it! the cinematography was decent. My only complaint was with the cat and mouse soundtrack . They should really have chosen Hans Zimmer or Zack Hemsey instead. The future however didn't look very futuristic AT ALL, in fact the fashion and designs were very circa 2002-2007 ..the only futuristic aspect was perhaps Murphy's car with a ton of headlights..no they didn't fly either..I think the producers were too afraid of making a BTTF 2015 mistake with bringing in glitzy gadgets..it obviously wouldn't help the movie other than a distraction...I guess the fancy gadgets weren't going to serve a purpose..it wasn't about them, it was about ""time"". There were characters that couldn't be ""can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with"" Coming from a non-professional but avid movie goer I think JT has come a long way from his ""Alpha-dog"" days..I didn't take him seriously in the face book movie because he tends to chose ""safe"" non-leading roles.. I'm glad the chose him for this one, anyone else (like Dicaprio or Bale for example) would have been inappropriate..I don't think JT's acting is as lazy as Shia labeouf or costume filling like Ryan Reynolds. I've just seen him do so many funny skits in SNL its often hard to take him seriously. JT is no James bond but there is something genuine about his acting.Was he as good of a choice as Michael Fassbender (magneto) was in Xmen? probably not. (You could see all the tiny emotions on Fassbenders face, all the hate, all the joy..) Alex Pettyfer nailed it!..he was playing one of the darker characters. His acting was so spot on I was convinced he was really a 75 year old. Would I want to see the movie a couple more times? definitely.Lots of puns in this movie.

Time is the commodity in the future. But the best part is how the filmmaker show the audience how to use this commodity in normal everyday life. How much time you pay for certain things, where to get extra time, etc. Simply brilliant.I never cared too much about Timberlake before, but his performance in Social Network caught my attention, and In Time further proves that he can act. The pace can be quite a drag here and there, but its full of suspense all the way, many chase scenes and all.For those of you who are tired of prequels, sequels, three-quels, superheros, robots, aliens, etc, give In Time a shot, its definitely worth your time. The most original movie this year. 109 minutes is a commodity well-spent.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Robin Hood Story set in a time-based plutocratic economy,"IN TIME has a brilliant idea: let's take Benjamin Franklin's bon mot ""Time is money"" literally and use it to create a story of class warfare between the haves and have nots in a near-futuristic setting.The central premise of the story is that in some future society, after each person's 25th birthday, a clock starts ticking in their body which keeps them at that age for one year. After that, they either die or buy more time by means which are exactly like how one would buy something with money. There are no upper limits on how much time can be added, people who can afford it basically stay 25 forever, and time has in fact replaced money as currency in all transactions.In this system, the rich and powerful keep adding more time to their lives while the poor have it ever harder to just scrape up a few minutes, and when they fail, they just drop dead on the street.Our hero is a resident of a ghetto who lives from day to day because everything costs time and keeps on getting more expensive. One day, he saves a man who has still over a century left but is tired of life. He gifts the hero his time and thereby sets into motion a sequence of events with dramatic consequences.While the production values, acting and direction of the film are good, the execution of the wonderful premise in terms of the plot is still seriously flawed. Apart from various plot holes arising from questions of the nature ""well, if they can control personal clocks like that, why can't they do X?"", the film explores the topic in a much more superficial manner than it could have.In particular, while the story does a great job of drawing a parable of real societies with drastic social inequality, it does a rather poor job of examining how a system brings it about. We are shown a super-rich guy who, it is implied, is part of a global elite that runs the system by means of time earned through essentially loansharking, but there is little indication of how this system is enforced.For example, when a ""time keeper"", an inspector Javert-type cop hot in pursuit of the hero, speaks to his supervisor, we have no idea who or what the supervisor's relation to the elite is. There is also no military or any comparable force which would definitely be necessary to keep such a drastically unequal and therefore unstable system from exploding. But then, the people who are literally seconds away from dying generally don't seem to act as forcefully on their survival instincts as one might have expected.When an oligarchic system is firmly entrenched, even knocking out the most powerful bad guy will do little to change it: he might just be replaced by an even worse one. And the fact that the movie fails to characterize the system (as opposed to its consequences on the lives of people, which it does) in a meaningful way is all the more disappointing, given that the film itself makes the point several times that the fault is to be sought in the system, not in any particular individuals.So, this Robin Hood/Bonnie and Clyde tale is really a story of how to apply band-aid to a a massively unjust system, not how to change it, no matter how much the elites wring their hands about the hero's destabilizing actions, presumably to give the audience the illusory feeling that he really is changing the system. Although I did not like V FOR VENDETTA(2005) much, I think it did a better job of characterizing a failing system and how it could be effectively changed in a science fiction context.On the other hand, I really did enjoy the exploration of some of the philosophical issues raised when time is literally treated as money. The movie raises even something of a philosophical paradox in that in the ghetto environment, giving someone too much time can amount to them ultimately losing time, either because someone steals it from them, or they begin to act irresponsibly.There is also a lot of running in the movie, which I take as a metaphor for time running out.This film is not as good as writer-director Andrew Niccols' masterpieces of conceptual science fiction GATTACA (1997) and THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998), but is still worth a watch for fans of this subgenre (of which I am a big one) because, despite its flaws, it tells a sci-fi story based on a very neat concept in a well-produced manner.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So much potential, yet poor execution","Wow this movie has so much potential. The concept is great and interesting. It kinda showcases capitalism in a different realm.

So far, I've heard the words ""time"" and ""ghetto"" so many times, seems like they're just use to fill in the dialogue. The story is also very loose, normal and subpar.

Great film,"IN TIME.I loved this film. I have never seen a film like it... the story was awesome.In this film, there is no money... you buy everything with time. Everyone has a clock in their arm which they can see. The time just keeps ticking down and if the counter gets to zero, you are dead. You work for time... to get paid you have to put your arm in a machine that adds time to your clock... to buy things you have to use the time you have to buy it.The story really did appeal to me... i thought it was a great idea.It has got Justin Timberlake in it... Now, I don't like Justin much, but the more films I see him in the more I like him as an actor.He does a great job. The main actress in it is Amanda Seyfried. She does a good job too... the film also stars Cillian Murphy.There were 2 things in this movie I was not really impressed with. Firstly, there was a scene where a car crashes and falls down a hill before crashing to a halt at the bottom... the effects were terrible. You could clearly see the car was computer simulated. It didn't fall like a car would. Secondly, in the film people could fight for time... I liked the idea of this, but Justin had a way of winning these fights... but his way of winning was weak... i just didn't get how he could win the way he does. Watch it... you will know what I mean.All in all this film is great. I really enjoyed it.I will give it 8 out of 10.Justins best film so far.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beter than imagined. Stronger than not!,"Damn fine little movie that gives a new perspective on currency and trade. It keeps a decent tension throughout while offering slightly more than an above par 'B'+ movie, yet with added twists that pervade the film. Damned original in how it approaches the subject of universal exchange and certainly well executed from a cinematic perspective. Much as I don't care for Justin Timberlake, he always impresses me in film. It's truly an emotional ride in many ways by way of an improbable future, 'Logan's Run' being an obvious inspiration to this visage.

"Intriguing premise, banal execution","In time if an enjoyable (I guess) sci-fy movie good for killing time, or when you wish to zone out and not think about the moving pictures too much. The premise is very interesting, the implications are somewhat explored. Everyone looks 25 years old and the currency is lifetime left. Someone obviously thought about the saying. ""Time is Money"" and took it to the extreme.The execution ends up being a bit mundane. The Cinematography offers nothing memorable, the plot is sort of simple. The actors do a good enough job, there might even be something like chemistry between the two leads.Concerning the plot, I am contemplating if you even call something an allegory, if it is so obvious and in your face. The plot deals with the distribution of wealth and class differences, only they use Time as currency.All in all, the interesting premise is handled in an OK way, making the movie an OK experience, if somewhat forgettable. Good for killing time, pun intended.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Standard chase thriller that isn't that well done and doesn't seem interested in its own message,"In Time starts strong. The idea here is that time literally is money as it has become the currency of the world – those that make time (the rich) can in theory life forever as they have loads of time on their hands (literally as the clocks are embedded on their wrists); by contrast the poor life day to day, working to keep time on their clocks for as long as possible. As an allegory for money and the contrast between rich and poor in our world, it is a clever one and it offered the potential for quite a smart piece of sci-fi – I was hoping that it could keep the ""ideas"" coming while delivering an enjoyable thriller as well.Unfortunately it doesn't really do either of these things and while i hoped it would get cleverer and more engaging as it played out, the reality was that it did the opposite – getting sillier, less thrilling and less interested in the ideas it had originally. Early on we have plenty of good things – the death of a character is impacting and little things like rich people doing nothing at speed etc are clever observations within this world. However, once Will goes on the run with Slyvia the film takes a dramatic downward turn. Funnily enough this section of the film also marks a low point for special effects too as it features a car crash which is done with hilariously bad model-work. At this point the film becomes some sort of Bonnie & Clyde thriller and it suddenly loses interest in many of the things it had been doing well up till that point.In terms of the thriller content, this means that the air of desperation and the air of vulnerability that was in the film early on just evaporates and suddenly Will is an action hero who cannot be stopped. It is a shame because without this atmosphere a lot of the action is exposed for what it is – rather silly and basic. Harder for me to take though is that the film loses interest in the message it is delivering – what we have here is basically a film rallying against the world of capitalism and stating that it is only fair that those with the time share it fairly among those without rather than hoarding more than they need. A fairly brave message but by the time we get to that at the end, the film doesn't seem to be convincing even itself and it seems more interested in getting cool shots of our characters with guns and creating false dramatic moments of running and clock-beating. It is a real shame that the intelligence went out of it – and the lack of strong thrills and ideas means that you end up thinking about other things in this world and picking holes in them.The cast list is young but decent. Timberlake gave me pause but he is actually pretty good and it is a shame that the second half of the film gives him nothing to do. Seyfield is oddly pretty but her character makes less than no sense and she cannot sell it to herself far less us. Murphy is always watchable and his presence deserves more than he got – in particular his final scene in the film is poorly done. The supporting cast is an odd mix of TV faces that you'll recognise from things like House, Mad Men and White Collar – none of them bad, but like the main players, the material isn't there for them in most cases.A good one-line idea of a film then. I was hoping it could be thrilling and smart but in the end it wasn't really either as it descends into a Bonnie & Clyde scenario that doesn't make much sense and doesn't play out convincingly. While it does this it also stops caring about the message it is rolling out – by the end it seems like the ideas in the script are just an inconvenience getting in the way of the simple thriller the film is trying to focus on. Distracting but disappointing.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great concept, not so great execution...","I remember this movie getting pretty bad reviews when it came out but with a pretty high score on IMDB now I thought I should give it a try.

But on the flipside the writing isn't so great with some actual pretty terrible moments in the movie, and the acting is very uneven.

No need to keep checking the time...,"I was recommended to watch ""In Time"", so I sat down and watched it, though I must admit I am not particularly much fan of Justin Timberlake (neither his movies or music).However, I did find ""In Time"" to be rather good entertainment. The story was easy to follow, though you knew from the first minute exactly how the movie would end. Yeah, it was just that predictable. But still, the movie managed to keep me thoroughly entertained from start till end. The story is basically that people stop aging at 25, and then have this green digital marking on their arm to indicate how much time they have left to live before they are 'timed out'. The rich have lots of time, while the poor struggle from day to day. So basically this is turned out to be a high-tech Robin Hood tale, of sorts.Now, the concept of people living on limited time and being able to extend this lifespan by adding time to the counter was really interesting. However, I would have assumed that with such technology, that the rest of the world would be more upscale high-tech, such as the cars, utilities, etc. I didn't really find the whole setting of the movie that believable, because I would have assumed that it would require more high-tech stuff to work.As for the characters in the movie, well then you have Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) and Sylvia Weis (played by Amanda Seyfried) who are basically your time-stealing Bonnie and Clyde, trying to steal time from Sylvia's father Philippe Weis (played by Vincent Kartheiser). Will and Sylvia distribute the stolen time to the poor - can you say Robin Hood here? - and they are trying to elude the Time Keepers that are chasing them, lead by Raymond Leon (played by Cillian Murphy).The acting in the movie was actually quite alright, and I must say that this is one of the better movies I have seen Justin Timberlake in, he was actually putting on a fair performance here. However, the movie was carried by Cillian Murphy's performance. He was simple so amazingly cast for that role.""In Time"" is a good thriller with just the right amount of action and drama in it. It is driven by solid characters and a fairly good story, despite some flaws in the lack of high-tech stuff. However, personally, I don't think that this movie has enough value for a second watching, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Robin Hood is back on stage!,"Andrew Niccol obviously plays with Marxist ideas. What a nice example of how the profit-hungry Hollywood machinery ones more proves its dynamic flexibility by fulfilling the current demand for critical thoughts on our capitalist system.Bearing in mind that In Time is a sci-fi, one should not be overcritical with small discrepancies, such as Amanda Seyfried always running with high heels. Comparing time with money, however, is not only a creative approach, in combination with surprisingly good (or at least acceptable good) actors and nice pictures this movie is definitely worth watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When Life is Money,"""Do you want life or money?!""Apparently this is the question thieves ask. Because we all know that no matter how much we wanted 'money', there is no use if we have no 'life' to use them. Which means we have to obediently and reluctantly give our 'money' to the thief. (But of course it is not the case now, because thieves just snatch. That's why they are called 'snatch thieves')But in ""In Time"", it is a different story. Because Life IS Money.Ever wish that you can be young and look young forever? or even live an immortal life? Well I'm sure everyone does. And in the movie, your dreams come true. But with a price to pay, and you have to earn them.In the movie, people stop aging at 25. And after that, you have a timeline for your life. Imagine having to live your life by constantly looking at how much time you still have. But you can earn them, like how you earn money by working, and paying everything with the time of your life left. When you gamble or fight, you don't gamble or fight for money, you gamble or fight for exchange of your life. Pretty challenging task. And you kind of have to be a good 'time' manager and organize your 'time' well.Like the real world, they have borders which divide the 'rich' people and the 'poor' people. 'Poor' people live day by day, with not much extra to spend, earning enough for a day's living. Maybe spend 30 minutes for a meal, 1 hour for a bus ride. 'Rich' people have a higher possibility to live a longer life. Even can afford to spend years to buy assets. But they all live in fear that their 'time' might get 'stolen'. Which then, they die.Well imagine today in this world, if all these are real. If you can earn your life, and live to be young forever. Would you want to be immortal and live forever? If you are among the poor, what would you do to continue living? If you are among the rich, how long do you want your life to be? how many years do you consider as 'enough'? or you think you will never get tired of living? Would you keep all the years to yourself?The story reflects very much to the reality, when money takes its place. In the real world now, people see money as important as their lives. Money is important, but how much money is considered 'enough'? Are you living happier with lots of money? Is earning a lot of money really the achievement of life?The movie focused a lot on actions. When Justin Timberlake, starring as Will Salas, was incidentally given a lot of years to live. So he wanted to 'transfer' to the 'rich' zone. But he was tracked by the police, or better known as the 'timekeeper', because they thought that the years he got were stolen. I will leave you to watch the rest of the story, because the truth is, as a movie (or action movie), this was actually not such a great film. There were lots of plot holes that you could not really explain or list down, but you know they were there. The transformation and the flow of the movie was not quite there, and it could have been better if it was written a little differently. But if you actually watch the movie on different perspectives, you could gain a lot from the movie. If you are willing to go deeper from just the surface, it could make you think further and comprehend the true message of the story. I personally think that the idea or concept is actually bloody damn good. And if it was given to a different director, for example someone like Christopher Nolan (Inception), the movie could have been turned around.I find the movie funny at some point though. Was it fun when everyone looks 25 years old? Imagine our grandparents and parents look exactly the same age as us. Or you might be dating someone who is actually 100 years older. :) But well that is just a minor opinion on the movie.Now let's come back to the real world, you are back to a normal human, earning money, not life. You have the ability to earn your living. But you have a limited life.

Do you have Time?,"From director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Lord of War, S1m0ne) comes a sci-fi thriller that paints a stark world where time has replaced money. In the real world if you run out of money, you can still survive for a day where you work out alternative means for survival. But in this universe, you have to ration it out so carefully because if your time runs out, your heart stops beating. So your every action has an catastrophic effect on your time. So if you get your head around this concept, you will find that this world has been mirrored in exactly the same fashion as the real world, where there are Ghettos with people who are always struggling to get time and on the other hand are the rich people with eons on their hand to spend. I will not talk about the intricacies of the plot, which i will leave for the viewer to discern.(because as is the case with any good sci-fi thriller, the number of time you watch the movie, the more it unravels its mysteries). Niccol does a terrific job at throwing the viewer in the deep end of the pool, and expects them to swim as the movie progresses. The cast is top notch here with Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Cillian Murphy, rendering a credible performance. They are ably supported by a supporting cast of Olivia Wilde (House), Matt Bomer (white Collar), Johnny Galecki (Big Bang Theory) and others who keep adding layers to the plot. Special mention for the set design, cinematography & special effects as they paint a contrasting universe which is so real and so different and yet looks exactly like the world we live in and the way it functions. There are a few areas which might stick out as sore thumb, but in the end it will certainly leave you satisfied.

Ridiculously bad script,"It is a paradox that blockbuster American movies are so well made in terms of acting, directing, editing and overall resources, but they often suck where it matters most: the script! This is one of those unfortunate cases where an intriguing idea is utterly destroyed by a childish story.Imagine Bonnie and Clyde in an overly capitalistic world that looks a lot like Equilibrium. People are immortal, biologically frozen at 25 years, but they have this ridiculous green glowing clock on their arms, counting down to a moment when they die. They use time as a currency, earning it, stealing it, buying with it. A very interesting concept, an abstractisation of reality. But they botch it up!A society that can genetically engineer humans with a glowing clock on their hands can also insure some cryptographic safety in the mechanism, so that people don't steal it away. The cars sound electric, but they are normal looking. People work in factories doing meaningless tasks, computers seem to do only voices and almost anything can be done with a single gun and a bit of determination.

""" In a land where time is precious and valuable, one must guard each second ""","The writer/director of this film is Andrew Nicol and he has created a masterful work of art. I would not hesitate to predict, this film will become a S/F Classic. From the first few scenes of this movie until it's end, the audience is in for a wild unpredictable ride of it's life. The story involves life in a world where life has become the standard currency for all things worthy of being purchased. Thus if one wants to buy something, he or she can trade their time life for it. Thus Time becomes the coin of the realm. Thus, Time becomes money. What's further unusual is the cast for this incredible bit of entertainment. Already recognized as an established singer, Justin Timberlake now plays Will Salas with Amanda Seyfried playing his rich and mostly ambivalent girlfriend who's Romeo and Juliet relationship leaves their tire tracks all over the screen. There is intense drama and incredible excitement, enough to create memories which will certainly generate requests for a sequel or a TV series.

A movie this bad should not remind its viewers that time is limited.,"OK, so I had high hopes for this movie. I saw the trailer and as a closet socialist loved the clear underlying theme of the rich having to keep many people down in order to maintain their power. So as I sat down in the theatre I was hoping that even if the movie wasn't up to scratch at least the underlying message would make it all worth while.But from the very beginning there are so many flaws with this movie that I could not bring myself to enjoy it. The concept itself is so flawed that I could not bring myself to see past it.The idea is that in the society of the future (which looks strangely like today but with slightly modified cars) there has been a breakthrough in medical science that stops people aging at 25. This is somehow achieved with the price tag that everybody must have a time display on their arm that counts ever down to zero. When you get there, you die. An interesting idea which brings up many good questions such as ""is time rationed or is it being hoarded by the authorities?"". Sadly these questions are lightly glossed over rather than any in depth exploration.JT is a character in the ghetto and lives his life permanently ""broke"". This means he rarely has more than a day or two of life left. And here we come to the first major flaw of the concept. Everybody around JT is the same. They all have almost no life, ""in the bank"", all the time. And yet these people walk around casually drinking coffee (costs 4 minutes) and drinking in bars (also costs time) when they are just hours from death. Thinking about this for even a second it becomes clear that people this close to kicking it would be doing anything in their power to try and get more minutes. There would be no semblance of society as any body who was prepared to steal time off others would, and very quickly they would be the only people left alive. JT casually gives time to a girl on the street, a very nice gesture to be sure, however completely unrealistic given that at the time he had less than a day to live. Its all very well to give away money when you are broke but to give away time when you are about to die, that is a very different story. People this close to the edge all the time would act very differently from you and me, something this film does nothing to explore.There are many many more flaws in this film but I won't go on about them. But the thing that finally tipped it for me was when they started trying to expand on the commentary of the capitalist system in the US by having outlets that lent time to the poor people in the ghetto for extortionate interest. These are the same people that seem to constantly have less than a day of life to their name. Once again this does not stand up to any real scrutiny. There is no way that a person who has allowed themselves to get down to less than a day of life is going to have any assets. If I was going to be dead in a day I am definitely selling my TV to try and get more time. I am certainly not likely to have anything that a loan shark considers capital enough to back a loan.But enough of my whinging. In the end because this movie could have been so good I couldn't enjoy the aspects that where well done. I have focused on the story flaws because they are what annoyed me the most. I am prepared to look past JT's bad acting, I am prepared to look past the fact that the future looks just like the present but with cars that have slightly strange lights, I am prepared to look past all the poorly thought out and completely unnecessary action scenes and I am prepared to look past whatever was going on in that hand of poker. But in the end this movie is flawed from the very beginning when the society they create could never exist due to basic human nature. Very few people would ever allow themselves to be just days from death when so many opportunities exist around them to gain by taking advantage of others. This movie had so many interesting areas it could have explored but in the end it is just disappointing.In the end if you are prepared to look past these things and you just want to see JT without his shirt drive round in a damn sexy old school E type jag and just generally be cool then you will probably enjoy this one. However if you are like me and have trouble ignoring the big holes in the basic concept and can't watch such an interesting idea be butchered then best to save the time this movie will take for something else.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't know why everyone disliked it...,"I mean, yes they could have done a little more with the story; however, it keeps relatable topics.

"Well-explored idea, solid movie.","Due to a bit of a dearth of sci-fi releases around the release of 'In Time', I think it will unfortunately be labelled a sci-fi flick that never held down enough sci-fi to grip fans of the genre. It's in the future, yes, and it creates a new concept for humanity, but I would only put it on the sci-fi shelf along with Equilibrium, Minority Report etc. A near-future, ""wouldn't it be terrible if..."" kind of a setting.The main draw of the movie is its concept. That of perfected capitalism, where money has been done away with and instead people are faced with the choice of living long but frugal lives, or living to the full and dying very young.The result is plausibly shown as somewhere in the middle, and whilst the true capitalist fat cats at the top are basically immortal, the majority get by from day to day, month to month, as we do anyway in our time.What I like about In Time is how it sticks to its concept and really explores it. I thought I had grasped the idea early on and thought 'ok got it, now get on with the movie' - but what it does is constantly throw up new ways in which this system might affect your life, and (hopefully) in ways you hadn't thought of.Timberlake has proved himself an actor in this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised by that. Seyfried is also very likable in her role and plays the part well. Cillian Murphy is again excellent, and I would love for a director to hire him in a really challenging lead part so we can see his true potential.Overall, In Time covers a lot of bases, different audiences will take different things from it. Some futuristic shenanigans, some relieving fast-paced action scenes, some tense set-ups and a good idea that runs through all of it. The plot might not grip you for the duration but at least it never goes totally AWOL.7/10 and well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Writing the story =/= good direction,"I have been a fan of Andrew Niccol's writing since watching The Truman Show. I had watched Gattaca previously as a kid, but it was strangely made to the point where it didn't feel like a classic. The Truman Show is an absolute classic movie, amongst the top 250 here on IMDB. The difference? Niccol wrote both story/scripts, but only directed the more poorly executed film. It seems he is his own worst enemy: taking amazing ideas and scripts and directing them into mediocrity.In Time is an example of a great concept turned mediocre movie. It definitely has a few high points, but they're marred by an overwhelming sense of ""this scene could have been punched up a few notches"" throughout the entire film. The same thing could be said about the delivery of lines by the actors. This sci-fi, dystopian future film lacked exactly what makes a film sci-fi and futuristic. All the locations are bland and are lacking in any real uniqueness. Many lines and characters feel completely out of place, due to the nature of the age (or LOOK of age) that the actors had to be. Taking the blandest of existing cars and giving them a ""futuristic"" sound doesn't constitute conveying a future setting. These are just many of the small things that add up to make the movie not hit it's mark.The reason I gave this a 7 instead of a 5-6, is because there is one scene in particular that was perfectly executed, heavily emotional and brought me to tears. It made me think had the rest of the movie been constructed with such care, this could have been an amazing sci-fi movie.7/10.

In some level, I can understand this critique, but I think this movie suffers from a concept that´s too good for it´s own good, if that makes any sense. Yes, the concept it´s better than the execution, but that doesn't make the execution poor in anyway. Justin Timberlake, it´s competent enough, as is Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy.

Makes more sense a decade later,"The movie makes more and more sense 12 years later - I watched it now in 2023. Watching how fast everything is changing - both for the better and for the worse, the things that used to take humanity centuries to change , now only take decades.The film may have seemed more fantastic just ten years ago, but today the symbolism in it is even stronger: there is no money, there is no material value of things - everything is just the time we have to live. And in order for some to live like kings, others must live poor, in this case even less. This is simply the great value in the film, and as such it is good not only because of this - camera, effects, music - everything is up to par. The actors too, maybe there is some overexposure of some of the main characters, their behavior and skills, but let's say it's acceptable.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Brilliant idea! Not that brilliant executed.,"Taking off horrible car actions scenes and the unstoppable message of ""time is money"", In Time is a brilliant movie, with an original idea (at least I haven't seen a movie treating the ""life span"" like this one before).Timberlake does a good job on his character, and its impossible to see Johnny Galecki and do not remember him on The Big Bang Theory. Because his laugh is exactly the same, haha. Apart from these two, there is some bad actors doing poor acting. Something to take care of, if someone intent to make a sequel (or prequel, because how science evolved to the point on put a clock on people's arm and make them share life time like a USB cable from arm to arm is still a mystery).Right in first 10 minutes we can see we're about to get bored about how many times they will spend talking about time and enjoying life, and bla bla bla. Really, this was supposed to be subjected, and not repeated throughout the whole plot.Another issue is the car action extremely slowly moving scenes. Is this the best stunt man can do? They're clearly the worse part of the movie. They're so bad produced that we can see when the car is ""running"" 5 miles per hour. Really, they suck.What salves In Time is photography and the fact producers used old muscle cars instead of prototypes in a futuristic scyfy movie. That was really a well though idea! Amazing! it gives a kind of retro atmosphere to it. Thumbs up! Apart for some mistakes, In Time is really a great movie. To bad it doesn't make you think like one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Watchable, sometimes engaging, but generally underwhelming","In a society where time is money (yes literally, time is the new currency), and the average citizen is programmed to live twenty-five years, a poor kid from the slums finds himself on the run when he is accused of illegally holding a hundred and ten years on his life clock.I see a great idea behind In Time, but it never aspires to anything more than a chase scene movie. Andrew Nichol's third feature works on a superficially as an action film that doesn't rely on bullets and explosions, but the experience feels a bit too much like a video game. (especially when the characters are constantly rushing to refuel their time clock). Characterization is fairly wooden, and the whole movie is cut together in a manner that makes you feel like it's all taking place within a few city blocks. I would have liked to have seen a bit more helicopter mounted camera work myself.Although he's far from being a good actor, Justin Timberlake is good at making a boring character feel less boring, by bringing some energy. Here, that's definitely a positive. Part of Timberlake's strength of course is that he has wit. The same cannot be said about Amanda Seyfried, who is once again adorably boring. That said, perhaps she shows a little improvement over her last couple performances.What bothers me most about In Time however, is the credibility of the setting. Of all the Orwellian societies I've seen in the movies, this is the one that struck me as the one that would never function. Nichol has taken a potent concept and put it forward in a kind of B- grade fashion. It's not impossible to watch, but it's not really worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This movie will give you nightmares,"I think this film's rating is too low. This movie not only presents a plausible nightmarish idea for what life might become in the future, but also provides a thought-provoking critique of the present. We already sell our precious time, of which we have an only limited amount, for money. It is already true that some people's time is worth many times more than the time of others, and that many poor people in America spend their lives working and running around, with almost no time left over for themselves, their family, and what they actually *want* to do in their lives. It is true, also, I think, that people now have much less free time than they did in past centuries - ironically despite all the new technology that was supposed to have given us more free time. It is likely that in the future there will be even less free time left, and that if healthcare continues to be in private hands, it will really be a matter or life or death. I can forgive this film the car chases and the guns (which, I agree, are not needed and boring, and could have been taken out), but I think that the dialogue was interesting, and the characters were not one-dimensional. For all this, I think this film makes a lasting impression and will even give you nightmares.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extremely disappointing considering all it had going for it!,"'IN TIME': Three Stars (Out of Five)A futuristic dystopian science fiction film that starts out with a great premise but loses all of it's creativity and originality to routine by the numbers action scenes. It's written and directed by Andrew Niccol, who also helmed the similar themed 'GATTACA' which was quite good. Niccol also wrote 'THE TRUMAN SHOW' which was a very good film as well so it's a little surprising that he handled this one so ham-handedly. The film stars Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy and Murphy is the only one who brings anything to the table. The film as a whole is very clunky and disappointing.It's set in a world where people stop aging at 25 and will die a year later if they don't earn enough currency to prolong their lives. Time is traded as money and the rich live as immortals while the poor scrape by what ever they can just to make it another day. Your remaining time is worn on your arm, in a digital readout, and scanned to pay all monetary transactions. Prices and taxes are raised all the time without warning in order to keep the weak majority at bay. Timberlake plays Will Salas, who lives with his mother (Olivia Wilde) in the ghettos and never has a full day's worth of hours. One night he helps a rich man, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), from being mugged and killed in a bar by gangsters known as the Minutemen. Hamiltion repays Salas by giving him all his remaining time, 116 years before committing suicide. He passes on some words of wisdom and lets Will know that everyone could and should live a happy natural life and then die. Will is then suspected of murdering Hamilton and goes on the run with a millionaire's daughter, Sylvia (Seyfried), he meets while flaunting his new money. The two begin robbing from the rich and giving to the poor while trying to disrupt the system and avoiding the Timekeeper (Murphy), who polices time.The idea behind the film is the perfect social commentary and is especially relevant to our times and modern economy. Life in the film isn't really that much different from modern reality. It's a shame that such a great idea was wasted though. It could have been the perfect Philip K. Dick type sci-fi film and instead we get a weak action film starring Justin Timberlake! His casting was the first way the movie went wrong but there's a lot more at fault to it than just that. Every word of dialogue seems forced and every scene seems like nothing more than the plot and action formula just pushing itself forward. There's no heart or character to it at all. Most of all the film is just disappointing, considering all it had going for it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In Time to change the world,"A very intresting idea, in this dystopic futuristic world (2169) time is what matters above anything else: every human being has been genetically engineered to age 'til 25 years, then live another yer and die after, unless you purchase time. So everyone is desperate and tries to live forever young in all of the different time-zones the world has been divided into.This 'til Will (a poor worker) and Sylvia (a wealthy heiress) decide to steal time from the fewest rich and nigh-immortals people who own banks and live lustless bored lives. They have nothing in common but along the way, on the run from Timekeepers and Minutemen, they find a cause worth fighting for.Aside from a lack of a true climax, i really enjoyed the concept for this film and who it was displayed: unlike other action / sci-fi movies, this is quiet and makes you really dive deep into the scenario. The main cast is good and Amanda shines in her role, she's one of the best actress of our times!Back in the days it could have seemed a little too gloomy and pessimistic, but nowadays it shows a world that could really be closer than it seems. Post-apocalyptic sci-fi with a foreshadowed knowledge of the possible future are in my opinion the real trend out there now if you wanna make true box office smash hit. Great work Andrew Niccol!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply Put: This Movie is STUPID,"At an unspecified time in the future, humans are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. Everyone has a bright green counter embedded on their forearms which show how much time they have left to live. As a byproduct of this new system, time becomes currency; the rich have decades, even centuries to live, while the poor are lucky to have more than 24 hours on their arms at any one time. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) works at a factory and never has more time than hours in the day until a chance encounter with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer), a rich man whose life he saves from a vicious gangster (Alex Pettyfer). Hamilton, though, doesn't want to go on any longer and while Will sleeps, he transfers over his 116+ years of time. Before he can celebrate with his mother (Olivia Wilde), she runs out of time and dies, prompting Will to make it his mission in life to bring down the system. After being tracked to a mansion by Timekeeper Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), Will makes a hostage of his host's daughter, Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), and sets out on the run. The pair soon becomes a futuristic version of Bonnie and Clyde as they attempt to stay one step ahead and right the wrongs their society has imposed on the poor.Concept films almost never pan out, the reason being that ideas are easy to come up with; putting those ideas into motion is a different story. Make no mistake, writer/director Andrew Niccol has a great concept to work with. But as is often the case with sci-fi films, the concept at the heart of In Time is approximately one hundred billion times better than the film itself. This movie could succeed as a sci-fi book or short story but the way in which it is executed on screen makes for an excruciatingly bad experience.In Time misses the mark on virtually every front. To start, it is rife with poor acting. No, that's not enough. In truth, most of the performances within this movie are downright terrible. Niccol assembled a cast of attractive individuals who unfortunately have yet to figure out their way as actors, aside from Murphy, who looks like a man who knows he's boarded a sinking ship. Timberlake, Seyfried, and Wilde may end up being worthwhile performers at some point but at this stage of their respective careers, they need real guidance and good material, neither of which is provided by Niccol. (It should be noted that I did not include Pettyfer in that list because while the others show at least some promise, Pettyfer does not. He is genuinely talentless.) In the end, though, the numerous sleepwalking portrayals and elementary-level dialogue don't come close to measuring up to the train wreck that is this movie's plot.To list the holes within the plot would be to craft a short novel. Absolutely nothing about In Time works the way it is supposed to. The film simply doesn't make a bit of sense on any level whatsoever. I'd love to know how it got green lit in the first place or how it made it past the test screening phase. It seems that no one anywhere in the chain of command ever asked some rudimentary questions about why this or that happens. Add to these crater-sized holes a staggering number of side plots that serve no purpose and receive no payoff. The most interesting character within the entire mess of a film is Timekeeper Leon and yet his development never enters into the equation.Really what I'm saying in this review boils down to this: In Time is stupid. (I almost just wrote that sentence as my review but I felt that wouldn't be received too well.) It is riddled with head-scratching plot holes, anemic dialogue, and cringe-inducing acting and worst of all it is a waste of an interesting and potentially dynamic concept which, as a sci-fi nerd, makes me furious. Stupid. It's just stupid.Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good fable that looks at the consequences of income equality,"The movie ""In Time"", offers a unique look into human nature and the coarseness of humanity. The film starts off by offering a general explanation of how time can literally be bought and time is literally money. Justin Timberlake's character, Will Salas, learns this lesson the hard way when his mother does not have the means to purchase time. Salas comes into some ""money"" and from then on pursues a vendetta against the upper class. He comes into contact with Amanda Seyfried's character, Sylvia Weis, a girl from the right side of the tracks who is somewhat of a spoiled brat and is bored with her rich lifestyle.The film has several common underlying themes including a look at income equality and how money is the difference between life and death. It is essentially a fable about the selfishness of humanity that means to show the path that we are headed down if the gap between the 99% and the 1% continues. In the film, each character must pay for and bank enough time within their time clock, which is embedded in their arms, in order to stay alive. The rich keeps getting richer and the poor keeps getting poorer. Will Salas is also relentless pursed by Cillian Murphy's character Raymond Leon. Leon is a timekeeper whose job it is to ensure that the poor keep a safe distance from the upper class. This is much like in real life where it seems the police are more at favor with the upper class. Many movies use the element of time to express a human need for immortality, but in this movie it is not about immortality; it is about just trying to stay alive.Throughout the movie, you waste ""time"" by buying your basic needs. Coffee costs ""time"", the bar costs ""time"" etc. This provides an accurate look at the rising cost of living that we are experiencing in real life. For many, just buying basic items can make or break a person. The movie utilizes specific motifs to express the grim lives of the people who live in the ""ghetto"" and the people who are the upper class. One is the consistent use of the bodyguards, enshrouded in black, who are tasked to protect the rich. They drive bullet-proof heavy duty cars in order to ensure that the rich are protected. We also see the use of shiny, clean glass buildings in the better parts of town while in the poor parts of town we see drab, concrete buildings throughout. The relationship between Will Salas and Sylvia Weis is a pretty typical depiction of opposites attract.But, what makes this movie great, is the music score that was used. The music used was a great choice. It helps to set up the mood and while the movie is set in the future, the music is reminiscent of the past and makes you connect more with the characters and their plights. The theme of the rich being separated from the poor as also been done in countless movies and more recently in the film ""Elysium"". Both ""Elysium"" and ""In Time"" take place in the future and we see that the rich inhabit the best areas.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Futuristic Robin Hood,"I put off watching this film for a long time, purely based on Justin Timberlake being the leading role but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I found the concept of the film intriguing - time is money - if you want to take a bus ride or buy a coffee it will cost you time, time taken off your life. Once the clock runs down to 0, you're dead.Of course there is then the separation between those who have a lot of time/money & those who don't - one man, JT, doesn't like this idea very much.It turns into a Robin Hood type film, I won't say too much.I would recommend watching this film.

Just-in Time - a great thriller!,"What a fun thriller! Not only does it have a very intriguing premise, but there's a ton of eye candy and countless exciting action scenes. Why does it have so much eye candy? Because everyone in the movie is young. It takes place in an alternate universe where time has replaced money as a currency and everyone's time ""runs out"" at twenty-five. Once you hit twenty-five, the timer on your wrist starts ticking down. At work, you earn time instead of money, so you are literally working for your life. If your timer ever reaches zero, you drop dead.And while yes, there are ugly twenty-five-year-olds, this movie doesn't feature any of them. Everyone is young and good looking. Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Cillian Murphy, Matt Bomer, Olivia Wilde (who plays Justin's mom!), and other beautiful people grace the screen. There's a definite class distinction, with the ""wealthy"" betting thousands of hours at the casinos and the ""poor"" borrowing time from their neighbors just to make it to the next day. When Justin decides to spread the wealth (with the help from his new main squeeze), he's at risk from the wealthy people who want to stop him, the poor who are desperate for time, and the cops.I love this movie and own a well-worn DVD copy.

Exceeded Expectations!,"The concept of using time as currency totally intrigued me into watching the movie. When the time runs out on a specific person, the person dies. This also means that some can live forever. Then there's Justin Timberlake. I like him as an actor as much as a singer, whether solo or N*SYNC. The rest of the main cast is great as well. I have been a fan of Cillian Murphy since 28 Days Later. His performances in the new Batman franchise and Inception really sets him apart from the pack. He did not disappoint in this movie. I like Amanda Seyfried's contribution to the movie as well. The only other lead role that I've seen her in was Red Riding Hood. She has great potential and I will definitely be following her career, Les Miserables now became more promising as a good movie to me now.The set, the props, the visuals of the movie all complement each other and formed a great stage for the actors to perform upon. This is a science fiction film, but it is made so that the viewer can relate without being alienated. In the movie, people drove cars that are recognizable, dressed in current fashion, and used technology more or less familiar to us. Of course, the whole concept of time as a currency and its transaction methods will be new to us, and that is pretty much it. The viewer will not be distracted by flying cars or outrageous clothing.I recommend this movie to all with an open mind.

Great concept but not strong execution,"In Time had a great concept that was so intriguing and thought provoking. The futuristic element and concept was both amusing and so interesting to see where this story could go. But sadly this was never explored and it never lives up to its potential. A lot of the issue is to do with the male lead, Justin Timberlake, who is not cut out for acting whatsoever and does a poor job at carrying this film. He seems unbelievable and lacks charisma. A strong male lead could have done wonders for the film. Amanda Segfried does a decent enough job in her lead role. The pace and direction also falls apart, it feels like this story descends into chaos where its simply hard to piece together a strong coherent story with any sort of emotional depth.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

No one gave me the impression that they really care about the time they have, the actors were rather like the characters of a computer game. There was no attraction between the two main characters and the director tried to save the most dramatic scenes by choosing large angles rather than focusing on people. But maybe all that was because of the poor script. I don't understand how can you fail starting with such a good idea, but Andrew Niccol did. He tried very hard to make the life of his characters miserable and they concentrated so much on how to survive one more day that the denouement seemed random. Maybe it should have remained just a trailer. After all, Justin needs just four minutes to save the world...",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In the end, it leaves you with lots to think about, even though the ending is not in the same volume as the rest of the movie. The director did a great job in keeping the love story in normal paces and emphasizing in the main idea, the resistance to the unfair time system. Dramatic characters, with passions and strong believes, are combined nicely into the story, which has also heartbreaking moments, such as the scene when Will's mother dies in his hands.

Brilliant Sci-Fi Premise Ruined By Silly Love Story,"The first twenty minutes of this movie are amazing -- it looks like the beginning of a kick-ass, blue-collar remake of LOGAN'S RUN. Justin Timberlake IS Will Solace, a bad-ass rebel trying to take on a whole world full of ""beautiful people."" Ghetto hustler Will is used to living minute-to-minute on the street. And he is drawn to the rich at first. But their opulence hides a terrible secret! So far, so good, and I have to say that, contrary to most reviews you see here, Justin has NO trouble playing a street hustler who's seen it all and has the natural reflexes of a killer. He's brilliant at keeping his cool in the fight scenes and chase scenes, even going ""unbelievable"" in a totally bored tone when a time cop shoots right at him! No, what really sinks the movie (after a killer half hour) is when Will meets up with the little robot-chick who's supposed to be ""the rich man's daughter.""Suddenly the kick-ass sci-fi film noir becomes a lame, MTV-flavored remake of BONNIE & CLYDE. Two crazy kids on the run -- can they take on The System?Hell no!!!!Justin and Amanda what's her name have no chemistry, no funk, no soul as a couple. Watch Michael York and Jennifer Agutter in the original LOGAN's RUN, or watch Natalie Portman and Hugo what's his face in V FOR VENDETTA, and you can see how real chemistry between the leads can overcome even the silliest sci-fi premise.Here it's the opposite. The lifeless love scenes totally derail the chases and ruin the film's climax. Worse than that, as a tough guy Justin has much more ""chemistry"" with the Time Cops, the Minute Men, and all the other baddies, including Vincent Kartheiser as the Barbie Doll's father!

So Wooden You'll Reach for Thompson's® WaterSeal®,"In Time comes from writer/director Andrew Niccol and tells the tale of one Will Salas (Justin Timberlake), a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering a wealthy man. This isn't murder by our standards but the running off with of a borrowed time in a future where everyone stops aging at 25 but must work to earn more minutes.Will travels across ""time zones"" that serve as tollbooths separating the poor from the rich. Can't have any low on time mingling with the immortals. In the affluent city of New Greenwich, Will encounters debutante Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). In a confrontation with a Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy), i.e. cop, Will runs off with Sylvia and sets out on a quest to make those in power pay.There are better movies in this genre, and one of them is written and directed by the same guy who made this movie. In fact, In Time is a crappy knock-off of Gattaca. Don't believe me? In Gattaca a man goes up against a class system that exploits genetics. He acquires a redhead, is chased by a cop, and drives a vintage auto. The differences are that Gattaca doesn't halfheartedly attempt to be an action movie, Gattaca has a quality lead actor, and Gattaca makes sense.Unfortunate for everyone who sees In Time, a host of problems prevent it from being even a shell of what could have been. Timberlake is simply not a movie star. He isn't believable and his thin character is not likable. Being in a dystopian future everyone is a stoic incapable of expression, naturally. In Time is played so stiff with seriousness that the lack of humanity prevents and audience from caring a lick for anyone.The actions scenes are sparse and nothing inventive. There's a car chase, albeit a brief one. There are guns, which many characters seem to be capable of using, but not with action movie gravitas.The technology hindering so many is not explained in a satisfying manner. Using time as currency presents a variety of problems upon investigation. Money is already applied to time in our world so the metaphor is too blunt. Who mandated these laws, witnessing a birth, or attempting a birth outside of the system are never mentioned.The problem imposed on the characters of In Time is all that is ever talked about. You'd think/hope that if you knew you could live forever that you wouldn't spend all your life talking about living forever. Instead of addressing the curse of being born with LCDs on their forearms and trying to do the logical thing like preventing newborns from suffering the same fate—the typical but tried and true savior of humanity narrative—they run off and loot banks for more time. When characters care so little about the movie, I know I shouldn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just another Okay movie,"I just got back watching ''In Time'' with a couple of friends. When I first sat down I thought ''Wow! A glowing watch on his arm, very creative very creative..'' Needless to say, I was quickly captivated by the angles and camera work put into this. Very subtle movements that really highlight the action and drama.The Acting: How can I put this..? The acting was....unemotional and unreal most of the time. Hence, most of the time. Real acting is when you're watching a movie and you connect with the actor; traveling deep along them on their journey/adventure. They're able to bring out the emotions from the audience. Anyways, the acting in this movie didn't do any of that for me! I just didn't feel like connection the way I do when I watch a great movie. Felt really pushed and one-noted. Bleh.The storyline: Great concept, but, failed to delivery I think. The whole idea of ''Time is Money'' is really interesting; but the way it's presented didn't really piece together to me. Such as the idea of having your bank on your hand and anyone can take it with a simple touch.Overall this was an okay movie.

Surprisingly new,"This is a movie surprisingly refreshing. Not only the idea (some reviewers pointed out that that's not quite new; regardless, it's certainly new in a movie, and here works superbly), but the movie itself. Without aiming too high (still much more than average though), this movie really works - at all levels.The last one to make you think (as to new ideas into play) in the last 15 years or so (Inception) failed - was too full of itself (see my review on that one). This one on the other hand, works differently (more than average on everything: acting, camera work, music etc. and especially the story), and guess what? It works. You won't see any cool FX here, but what you'll see is far from cheap too.On the other hand, it's also low on violence, swearing, and sexual content (without which, apparently, you can't make a movie nowadays) - which means your entire family can enjoy it - as long as they had already jump-started their brains.So don't expect the cool FX from Matrix, but not the diluted and full of holes story from Equilibrium either. Rounded, surprising little gem, worth seeing more than twice. I had already planned to buy the DVD - and haven't bought one in several years, which should tell you something. These are not the days you build up a collection. Unfortunately, these are the days you rent your 2 hrs. entertainment, then immediately forget it (the dose to make you run another day - how cheap we have become).Its real value is at a solid 8, but I give it a full 9 only for the (courage and) novelty of being novel.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The best sci-fi film I've seen in seen in a very long time. Excellent!,"In Time is a fine film with a terrific storyline, excellent acting and a pace that will have you glued to the screen. I'd seen the artwork and trailer for this movie quite a while back and I thought it looked good, a bit of fun trash with an attractive cast, however it's so much more that that, it really is an exceptional film that exceeded my expectations enormously.The story is set in an unknown time in the future when money has been abolished and time is the currency, when you turn 25 you have a year to earn time or your life is over, your clock stops and you die. It's a pretty complex storyline but the script enables you to get a hang of it rather quickly, and you get drawn into the story instantly. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are excellent together, they have a chemistry on screen that is electric. Amanda Seyfried is the wealthy girl who comes ""from time"", who is kidnapped by JT but then abandons her previous life to become a fugitive, her character is one of the best in the film, she is a tough lady, and Justin continues to get better and better.Basically to me this movie seemed like a futuristic sci-fi version if Bonnie And Clyde, it's just as awesome as that and I definitely recommend that you go and see this film on thebig screen.

The concept gives way to a movie that is shot and acted well, with a likeable main character. But the script is immensely shaky. Half the time the movie spends explaining it's world (even by directly narrating to audience) and half the time the script is filled with zingers with the word time (being in or out of time or times' up - they might just wink at the camera with those kind of lines). This is why the emotional and hard hitting moments of this movie fail their impact.The other big distraction is the way the movie layers it's critique of capitalism over the script. One of the antagonists plainly narrates the system into the camera as ""Darwinian capitalism"". I won't comment too much on how this commentary is like that of an eight-grader discovering the communist manifesto. The movie ends with the message that everything is good and the big evil system just puts down their guns as soon as our Bonny and Clyde hero-duo provides infinite money to everyone - making everyone rich.

Truly makes me despair,"Where to begin? Every aspect of this movie was so bad I don't even know how to. I must try ny saying that I sincerely despair of the world after finding out this has a 6.6 out of 10 rating here on IMDb. This is way worse than global warming, overpopulation, rising garbage mountains, ozone holes or any other reasons one might despair for the human race. This means the great majority of people, assuming the average moviegoers are a fair representative of people in general, are utterly and plainly stupid and with no means whatsoever to distinguish quality from pure trash.Now I always try to be as just as possible when reviewing a movie and in most cases I think I can see it for what it is, who it targets and see its qualities even though I don't necessarily belong to its target audience. Here however I can't see how any adult could possibly find this anything other than offensively bad. The directing and editing is awful, the shift between scenes is awkward and seems more amateurish than anything I've ever seen in this budget scale. The plot is really stupid and has more holes than I can count. I would have given a few examples but then I'd have to mark this review as containing spoilers which would shun people who haven't seen it from reading the review and spoil the opportunity to deter them from doing so. The dialogue is absolutely laughable as well but the worst part of it all is the horrible acting. It's really like watching amateur theatre. Especially ludicrous is the portrayal of the wealthy Mr. Weis: A powerful and incredibly wealthy old man, albeit inside a 25 year old body, who still comes across as insecure and awkward in his mannerisms as a timid teenager. Surely this has got to be the worst casting mistake ever?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great concept,"In TimeI watched this film with friends not knowing anything about the plot,found it was a great way to spend a couple of hours.The cast are an interesting bunch each with a strong screen presence. Having seen Justin Timberlake in the Social Network,i knew he could act but in this film he provides a polished performance.The actor Cillian Murphy who reminds me of Tom Hardy in Inception plays the head timekeeper holds you to the screen with his unwavering dedication to his employers .Amanda Seyfried who plays Sylvia Weis and Justin Timberlake grow to have a believable on screen chemistry.Another larger than life character played by Alex Pettyfer is Fortis who plays a bad guy but with an upmarket presence.In a nutshell i would say this film has more to it than you first think It raises some moral issues which i am not going to go into as it would spoil the film for you.I am a sci fi fan so may be biased here but ignore the negative reviews and go and enjoy a sci fi classic I feel there are a few similarities to Logans Run but maybe that is just me.Phill Mackenzie",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Felt like this was written by a 10 year old,"The first 30 mins or so, the premise was interesting. Nothing was explained but they made it clear the concept was that time is money BUT no explanation to what the laws and rules are and this is where it all crumbles.I could not believe it that with this rating the glaring obvious of $hi**y lazy writing. It doesn't take much thinking to see that the society in this movie is just dumb as hell, that by a mere handshake you can STEAL a persons time they have left and that time displayed so brazen on the forearm for everyone to see.An hour in is when it gets worse but before that it has gotten bad that you'll see it for what it was. For example, Justin knocks or shoots a guy then delivers one liners as if the knocked out or dead guy would be conscious to be aware of anything. Garbage scrip. Garbage writing.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's not 'Inception' or even 'Logan's Run' it's 'In Time',"No spoilers here but let me just say that the trailer doesn't give the film any curious benefits. Timberlake can act, that goes without saying now, but he is let down a little by the story. In a nutshell, there's no money in this futuristic world, there's time. There are also zones as named in the film that start from the ghettos to the ultra high class. Once someone is 25 they need to work to earn time to stay alive but the higher the zone the longer the life. J.T plays Will, who after an unfortunate family circumstance and a meeting of a stranger ends up with lot's of time. Moving up zones he meets a beautiful daughter (The china doll-like Amanda Seyfried) of a rich banker type with infinity time in his possession. The pair get together and go on the run in an inspired Robin Hood type escapade. Andrew Niccol also directed the superior 'Gattaca' and this does have a few unique ideas, just not enough explanations either. Cillian Murphy rocks though.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nice idea. Not great execution,"In Time is actually a neat little idea for a movie. The idea that everyone on earth stops aging at the age of 25, and then from then on, money literally becomes the life force that keeps you going. You go to work to earn time. You pay your rent with time, you pay for coffee with time. People steal your time instead of your wallet. And yes, when your time runs out, then you die.Will (Timberlake) is from the ghetto, where every day, he survives just enough to see the next one. However, one night, a stranger hands him over 100 years of time, enough to buy a nice car, move into the nice neighbourhood, and finally live like a free man. But, in a poorly explained intervention, the authorities don't like the poor getting time that easily, and Will soon is on the run with the daughter of a powerful banker, eager to make a change to this bleak world before his time runs out.I have a problem watching these sort of movies, in that I could never envision a world where we would ever let ourselves come to this sort of situation. A bit like The Hunger Games, where I could never see us, as a civilisation, enjoying an event where teenagers kill each other. But that's one of the things with sci-fi. You need to accept what isn't currently possible. As Will kind of half-ass gets away with covering at the start, he can't explain why we got to this situation, but that's just the way it is.The acting isn't great. Timberlake really is more suited to support roles. He was good in Alpha Dog, but clearly, leading roles maybe aren't his forte. It may not be entirely his fault, and his character is pretty-stock standard, but you can kind of tell he doesn't really have a great range of emotional acting to draw from. Amanda Seyfried, as Will's hostage-come-helper is equally flat. The usually excellent Cillian Murphy, as the dogged cop trying to track down the wrongly accused Will, is wasted in his 1-dimensional character. The script won't excite any scholars, and the action is decent but nothing special.It's an OK movie. As I said, the idea is quite neat. But if this was going to be a great film, it needed something more, and better acting and a better script would've helped. The film is shot quite well, but it felt rushed, and that's probably why the characters seem weak and under- developed. Give it a go for the novelty of the idea, but don't expect too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When Time Is a Valuable Commodity,"This film begins in a futuristic setting where once a person reaches the age of 25 they only have one more year left to live. However, they can change that circumstance with technology which allows them to add or subtract time from one another. Additionally, they can also add time to their life by working for it, trading for something of worth or even borrowing it from a bank. But once the electronic device in their arm reaches zero it's all over. To that effect, ""Will Salas"" (Justin Timberlake) meets a man in the bar by the name of ""Henry Hamilton"" (Matt Bomer) who is eagerly buying drinks for everyone as he has managed to accumulate plenty of this valuable commodity. However, since this is the poor side of town-where most residents only have a few days of life accrued and are desperate to find more-this is most unusual to see and Will warns him to keep a lower profile lest someone try to take his time by force. Sure enough, a local gangster arrives and tries to do just that but Will helps him to escape and together they find a safe place to stay for the night. When Will wakes up, however, he notices that Henry has downloaded 100 years into him and has departed with the intention of killing himself. Although Will tries to stop him he arrives too late and suddenly the police suspect foul play on his part--and he becomes a wanted fugitive from that point on. If that wasn't bad enough, things get even more complicated when he travels to the rich part of town and meets the real power brokers who eagerly accumulate time at the expense of everyone else. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film which started off well but eventually reverted to the usual chase scenarios depicted in countless other movies through the years. Likewise, although Justin Timberlake performed adequately enough, other than possibly Olivia Wilde (as Will's mother ""Rachel Salas"") nobody else really stood out in my opinion. That being said, while I didn't consider this to be a blockbuster film by any means, it was still entertaining enough and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent movie, concept too simplistic","The concept of the underlying idea is excellent. I am not very picky, there may be some minor flaws in the execution. Like woman running very fast with high heel shoes, or people swimming in deep water without never touching the ocean in their life. I can cope with these little issues with no problem. As long as there is no major absurdity that contradict the main theme.What I find as a flaw, and this is just my personal opinion, is that the concept is too simplistic. I find unrealistic that the ""poor"" people in such a society could be that law abiding. These ""poor"" people are more civilized than most of the richest men on Earth today! With real human behaviour, a country like that will actually turn into chaos in no time.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Relatable Dystopian Society,"As fictional as this story is, it is so relatable to our present world; but ours does not fall into an organized caste system. The opening scene of Will standing by the window gazing into the world, smoothly sets the plot of the story. The window bars with the padlock clearly portrayed how confined he is to the world created by the bourgeoisie. That scene was nicely set up.Favorite scene for me, would be that of Henry and Will at the abandoned house, when Will tried to save him from the time keeper and his thugs. The ambient lighting too was commendable, it was warm and beautiful - setting the mood for a heartfelt moment.""No one has to die before their time;"" He says.As much as there will be chaos should everyone live forever, that is, due to overpopulation and shortage of resources; no one really has to die before their time. But it is not in my place to decide who gets to live and who gets to die.If this were to be in reality and everyone gets to decide how long they wanna live, I bet most persons wouldn't wanna age, and also be in good health of mind and body for as long as they are alive. And those presume to waste the time they have like Borel, drinking themselves to stupor, would be awarded shorter time.Borel's death actually geared me towards a deep reflection of past years and how I spent it chasing the wrong things and the wrong people. Such wastage of time! I wish young people learn in time, so they can get back quickly on track and not repeat similar mistakes that alot of us millennials and generation-x made during our youthful days.I didn't quite get why Will and Sylvia were still having guns on them at the climax and was about robbing yet another building after they'd already successfully created distortion that made time available to the persons in the ghetto; but whatever be the essence of that last scene, if thrillers could pass off as melodramas, I'd tag this movie as such. Beautiful Reflective Storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disappointment,"Given the pedigree of the director of this film (notably GATTACA which I'd rate as one of the best science fiction films ever made and criminally overlooked), I really expected more.The production is very much in the same mould - the 'future' world is understated, in many ways a retro-styled present day bereft of any CGI or flashy special effects. That's in keeping with the high concept underpinnings of the film, which much like GATTACA is based on extrapolating the ramifications on human living of a development of medical science.So far, so good and it certainly seems to hold promise initially. Unfortunately the subtlety of the earlier film is quickly lost as the plot leads not toward a considered analysis of social implications, but instead a heavy handed adventure thriller which succumbs to a misguided appeal to popularism (or perhaps its stars' vanity), by becoming a melodramatic action-flick.I can't lay too much blame at the feet of Tiberlake, Murphy and the rest of the cast as the material really doesn't lend itself to credible performance from its cast.I find myself left to ponder if this is one of those pieces of cinema which started out as something which would have been thoughtfully considered and delivered a genuine emotional resonance, that was then ruined by the desires of producers, actors or other influence to present something which might attract a greater box-office. In the end the effect was just to butcher something of potential into a dog's breakfast of an offering that satisfies as neither a piece of escapist entertainment, nor a work making serious points about serious issues.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting idea but poor development and execution,"Interesting concept, but quickly it becomes obvious that the writer/director's concept was too clever for its own good. Many holes in the concept and plot. Plus, there is an attempt to build a moral implication and stand to a fictitious, barely-believable, concept. Quite lame.After the initial scene setting, the movie quickly degenerates into stock-standard chases and action sequences. So, quite predictable after a point.Solid enough performance from Justin Timberlake. Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy are OK. Pity Olivia Wilde only has a minor part.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""In Time"" Quickly Becomes a 'Waste of Time'","When film distributors slap an embargo on the reviews of critics, it usually means that the movie in question stinks so much that they don't want bad reviews to mar the movie's opening. This one was embargoed until the day it opened (Oct 26) - and you guessed it, it stinks. The premise, about time as currency, is flimsy at best - and it provokes more questions than answers.The premise: It's the future and it's a world where time is literally being used as money. Aging somehow stops at 25, and the only way to stay alive is to earn, steal, or inherit more time. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives from hand to mouth in a slum-like sector of the city, until a windfall of time gives him access to the world of the wealthy and powerful.There, he meets beautiful young heiress Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and they team up to become a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde, despite being relentlessly pursued by a 'Timekeeper' cop (Cillian Murphy).The sci-fi world where people stop aging at 25 - is novel and attractive, until you start thinking about the mechanics of it. One of the most disturbing is the LED timer embedded in the left hand of everyone. Is this timer embedded at birth? If so, it is curious how it stays on when the child grows up. What if the timer is discarded before the age of 25? Will the person die at once? People transfer time by clasping each other's hands and even in arm-wrestling. How does the exchange really work, especially in cases of robbery? These questions mar our acceptance of the movie's premise - and makes the whole idea trashy. And even if we can overlook this set-up, the main plot of Will and Sylvia robbing banks of their time and giving it away sounds so implausible that we feel cheated. Will has spent his whole life fighting for time and he has even lost his mother (played by Olivia Wilde as Rachel) because of just a few seconds. To see him squandering it in that Robin Hood manner is just bad writing and poor motivation.Timberlake and Seyfried are acceptable in their Bonnie & Clyde roles, complete with a titillating underwater scene. Basically, they just need to look macho and sexy respectively, and they succeed in this. Murphy, as expected, shines in his portrayal of a 'time sheriff' where he is part villain and part hero! Thanks to him, there is at least an emotional side to the whole movie. Otherwise, it is a sheer waste of time. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great Movie, Always room for improvment.","Simple answer: If you like futuristic, scifi, thrillers go ahead and watch. Its a great movie, re-watchable, holds interest. ( I keep it simple because go watch it.)The problems (non spoiler)For a timeline of humans that got rid of money, stop human aging at 25, and allow immortality it was not futuristic enough. I'm guessing lower budget.Character inconsistencyExtending the time could have helped (assuming they would use it wisely)Problems (spoiler)Henry needed some more backstory.Will gave his friend a decade because he knew him for a decade and he didn't know the friend was an alcoholic? When he was introduced he was tipsy at a bar. The timekeepers didn't use that against him ""see what happens when you give the wrong people time"" or something.The main antagonist later on was spared AND saved by the protagonist and didn't have a change of mind?

I'm not the fastest but after the second time watching him cut it close to refilling I knew that was going to be his end(some would've guessed as soon as he forgot the first time lol).Thats all I could think of a bit after watching thanks for reading!Important note: I'm not overly critical.

Overall Liked It,"I liked this movie, for the most part. I guess I felt like something more could have been done with the concept, but in the end it was neat and fascinating and a fun sort of sci-fi crime movie.I like Amanda Seyfried in it! And Justin is pretty good too. The rest of the actors sort of fade into the background for me, not bad but not that memorable either. I guess that's a good sign of a good movie.The effects worked well too, the numbers on the arms look great. The practical futuristic locations aren't exactly mind blowing, but they don't need to be for this story to work.I would probably recommend waiting for this on DVD / VOD, rather than seeing it in the theater, but I certainly wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it.

This science fiction thriller is set in the year 2169 and people are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 with one year allotted after that.,"This science fiction thriller is set in the year 2169 and people are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25 with one year allotted after that. If they don't keep their time replenished, they are susceptible to ""time out"" after they use up all their time. Time is used as a means of currency for the world. The main character is Will Salas, played by Justin Timberlake, and he works in a factory as a way to earn a living in the ghetto, literally. He comes in contact with a girl named Sylvia Wise, played by Amanda Seyfried who lives in a rich neighborhood called New Greenwich, and they run off together. They are up against time and struggle to stay alive. Both have come to the understanding that the rich is stealing time from the poor. The basis of the movie becomes: only the strong will survive.The theme for In Time focuses on ideas. Will and Sylvia represent figures from two different aspects of life but still, in time, come to trust, need, and help one another as well as others in the film. In a particular scene, Will asks Sylvia to give allow him to borrow some time and she refuses. Fast forward a few scenes, Sylvia becomes the one who is almost out of time and asks Will for some time and he obliges. The mood in the film which the director is trying to display is compassion and understanding for those around us who are from different social classes. The film also displays the struggle for human dignity because Will truly does believe that everyone should be given the opportunity to survive, regardless of their status in life. Through his determination to emphasize this he displays courage, sensitivity, intelligence, and strong individualism as mentioned in The Art of Watching Films written by Joseph M. Boggs and Dennis W. Petrie. (p. 27) The movie is similar to another sci-fi flick, After Earth. The main character was given a few skills to survive, but beyond those skills he had to figure it out to make sure that the rest of the world didn't die as a result of his mistake. He portrayed many of the same characteristics as Will Salas.The movie had a few other plot points within the man plot. One in particular involves the fact that the ghetto is always being watched by video surveillance. This is true in modern day society. The ghetto represents people who will steal from one another which are represented by the Minutemen; they will kill each other, and go to great lengths to survive. Due to this fact there are always police, represented as Time Keepers, lurking around to catch criminals. The separation of time zones between the ghetto and New Greenwich is also a reality. Such as the rich are separated from those who are poor by different suburbs, housing communities, lifestyles, and social classes. Deep into the movie we come to an understanding of why prices are steadily increasing on a daily basis. The rich are trying to kill off the poor to make space for themselves. The movie also weaves in a romance between Sylvia and Will to show that they are human and have emotions that don't rely on the time they have allotted.Two techniques that were used in the movie are motifs and lighting. Throughout the film we see each character look at a digital clock on their forearm. The clock represents how much time they have. We see and hear the clock as time adds up, is taken away, or is cleared off and becomes the end of a person's life. There is great emphasis put on the clock because it allows us to see what that person is worth and we see how precious it is to each character. The lighting in this film is great in the fact that there are great scenes when the low-key lighting helps us to understand the mood of the scene. During these moments there is usually a struggle or fight and we only see the defining moments needed to interpret what is happening.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I was skeptical at first, but I must admit, it is a fun film to watch . . . and yes, the concept of time as a commodity has been the quest of many","Of course, everyone will no doubt think of this as a remake of Logan's run . . . but wait, hold that thought.As a sort of side note, I personally have actually had some interaction with what might be referred to as applied nanobiology in the context of treating the pathology of aging, as an attainable medical regimen.These concepts are no longer strictly confined to the realms of science fiction, as I can attest to such from direct personal experience. In today's world, are we anywhere even remotely within reach of the world depicted in ""In Time""?. No, hardly, but that does not suggest these exact questions have in fact been discussed quite seriously, in various academic and scientific circles.So it was with this particular background that I wanted to see this film, to get a gander on what Hollywood would do with such a concept, extruded through the lens of early 21st century technopop culture.Some aspects of the film were just plain silly, but that can be overlooked to a certain degree. Justin Timberlake does deliver his character well enough, but for me at least, Amanda Seyfried was the real sparkle in this production.Was it entertaining? Yes indeed, I'll probably see it again with various comrades. Does it beckon some interesting questions? Yes it does, and that may be what makes this particular production so timely (please forgive the terrible pun).The questions that have been raised in previous eras, encompassing the entire overarching arena of ethics in a biotech enhanced, genetically contrived reality preserved for the privileged few, the agony of overpopulation vs quality of life, ""genetic capitalism"" and so on, have been discussed many times, by very serious people.But now, it is within some potential future timeline that the tools for crafting such a genotopia for privileged elite is actually being considered not as fiction, but rather as the next level of priceless possession, an outcome of artificially induced evolution as an acceptable ""norm"" in the eyes of some. I should know, having personally seen bits and pieces of this puzzle already being assembled.If nothing else, if this entertainment platform inspires further thought into this realm, perhaps that is the real value of this film.Even if all the potential viewer is looking for is an entertaining bit of fantasy filmcraft, I don't think many will be disappointed. As I said, I was initially more than a bit skeptical at first, this could have been much worse . . . but I will confess (perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure), it was quite fun to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Story might sound silly at first, but it is executed credibly. Unsentimental portrayal of survival of the poor. Good acting, suspenseful story and beautiful photography.","I had my doubts when I read about this story in which people all die after the age of 25, unless they start paying big money to add more years to their short lives. Did sound silly to me, but I am glad I tried watching it anyway, because however silly and futuristic this story may sound, it is directed, acted and photographed with impressive suspense and credibility.The futuristic settings are run down and gloomy, without any scifi stuff. I liked that look a lot. It's basically a portrait of almost the same society we live in nowadays, only a few decades ahead.The story is a portrayal of the survival of poor people in society, who cant afford to live much longer than 25 years old. Justin Timberlake is one of them. The rich can buy time to prolong their lives, the poor can't. But by accident Justin Timberlake gets the chance to live a hundred years, while his poor family and friends are about to die soon. What will he do with the long life he has been given?Without being depressive or sentimental about this struggle between the poor and the rich, this movie is quite suspenseful, with enough riveting action. It is also quite an impressive emotional character driven story with really good acting by Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. This movie is definitely a bit better than one would judge by it's cover. Not a terrific movie, but a very decent action / light drama flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Such an Intriguing Idea Gone (for the most part) to Waste,"What an intriguing idea. This is the type of SC-FI that I usually tend to like over just another film with space battles. SC-Fi films that make you think and make parallels to real life. Once I saw the previews to this film I thought this film would be something special. Not only did the film have an intriguing idea but only draw from mythic arc types like Robin Hood and numinous of great themes but the film falls short on such a great idea with a failure to really understand what type of scope there really could have been with this story along with a less than stellar cast the film is entertaining but only a footnote of what it could have been.The film's concept is a future where humans have been genetically engineered to stop ageing after age 25 but after that you have only one more year to live. Time is the currency of the time, no such thing as money. You work to get more time but it is a bleak future where the rich have all the power and all the time. Meanwhile the rest live in the ghettos where almost everyone has only has 24 hours to live and they live by the clock.While the story opens with a man in the ghetto named Will Salas is given the gift of time from a man who doesn't care to live anymore from the rich-infected lifestyle. Will is then accused of murder and on the run from a police force known as ""timekeepers."" With a rich man's daughter at his side he hopes to effect change in the system.The film's story should have been one of the best of the decade. I mean the idea is so good it feels awful that it was a bit wasted. The film story does a good job on laying out the ground rules of the universe they live in. This was great about it a short speech in the beginning and then you are trusted into the life of Will Salas. You get a pretty good picture on how he lives just from the first 10 min. You learn a lot about the world and the film starts to set up some story lines but that's where a lot of the film's really strong points end.The film starts up several story lines and just never delivers. Some just seems abandoned by the end and others that kept building and never got the final ""crescendo"" or pay off. It seems like not only that with these great ideas and scary parallels to real life class warfare the idea could have been bigger than it ended up being, It hard to say exactly what it was missing. I feel like the film could have been even bigger with its ideas and themes. It fact with this idea the film could have been a great long SC-FI epic. Maybe my expectations for the film was just too high but I feel I was let down by story because of the potential it had and that's just aside from the plot holes and incompletion of certain story lines. There were also some scenes I honestly thought could make for some classic scenes like when we finally get to see what ""a fighter"" is and how they fight. The scene was too short and was a number of others felt a little short in fact the film overall felt a bit short without a real good conclusion.The film seems to leave the possibility of having a strong story oriented film instead opting for an action fueled story. The film has no shortage of action sequences and that is properly the saving grace to the film. It does keep the viewer entertained and it does keep the story moving. Without this factor the film would unsalvageable. There are some good car crashes and also on foot chases. A good number of gun battles to be boot. Even with the PG-13 rating it is able to have some real action and violence. However I think I could have done without a couple of these so we would have a stronger story.The acting is also questionable. I would have made different choices. Justin Timberlake stars a Will Salas and Justin is good here for the action sequences but he isn't the greatest with the dramatic scenes. This is a shame because I thought he would because I really liked his performance in The Social Network (2010). Amanda Seyfried's performance falls flat in my eyes even though she had some nice chemistry with Justin. Cillian Murphy is amazing as the timekeeper Raymond Leon. This is an outstanding performance from Murphy as he usually delivers. The rest are decent but nothing special. Shyloh Oostwald is okay; I liked Johnny Galecki as Borel. I didn't love Olivia Wilde even if she didn't have a big part. Alex Pettyfer is finally getting better roles since his role in Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker (2006). He is good here as Fortis the ""minutemen"" which a ""gangster of the future.""Andrew Niccol is a great talent behind the camera and I don't doubt that either. His look to the film to perfect for this film. Also his of practical effects over CGI heavy effects is defiantly noticeable in a good way. The music by Craig Armstrong fits perfectly.Really with this type of idea it really could have been something special. The acting hurt the film a bit with the exception of Cillian Murphy. But with a talented director behind the camera and talent behind the scenes also with some really entertaining action sequences makes the film watchable but you can't help but feel it could be so much more. If there was a film that I would like to see remade, this would be it.Final Score5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mind clocking out early yet movie overstaying its welcome,"It's an interesting concept that deserved a much better story, better actors and several other things. I clocked out rather rapidly when things that didn't make sense started happening. Combine that with stupid behaviour from the protagonists, and my suspension of disbelief just got waylaid. I kept thinking to myself how and why? Just a few examples. How does he have that amount of time left (more than once)? How is it so easy to steal from a loaning bank? Why is there no security? Why does the fugitive stay at his own address when he knows the police knows his identity? I could go on.I found the acting rather poor especially from Amanda Seyfried (the ravishing redhead daughter), with a couple of exceptions (the ""older"" guys being two). The suspense was rather pitiful and the few action scenes were unexciting. That forearm ""wrestling"" with the time codes was just ridiculous. As for special effects, besides the glowing green digital clocks under people's forearms and a few cheap-looking modified vehicles, there wasn't much else. The thinly-veiled social commentary on the woes of capitalism was badly done and I'm one who usually enjoys such criticism. Emotional moments fell flat and artificial. The dialogue too often seemed awkward or cliché even when not delivered poorly. This movie was weak on all fronts (except lighting because I'm nice). It's a badly implemented sci-fi concept, lame thriller and boring action movie that felt longer than its actual running time.Rating: 3 out of 10 (Poor)",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
For a few to be immortal the others must die.,"It is a time in the future when genetic refinements have allowed human bodies to age to 25 and no further. However as you reach exactly 25, your timer kicks in and, unless you earn more time, you have exactly one year, only 52 weeks, to live. However if you can earn (or beg or steal or borrow) more time then you can potentially live forever. Your own time is cleverly displayed in yellow-green glowing numbers on your left arm, constantly counting down the seconds. This can get very dramatic, and several times does, as the few remaining seconds count down to zero.To me this is an allegory using time instead of money to comment on our social issues. Where the powerful may have thousands or millions of years, while the ordinary citizens live from day-to-day. Instead of wondering where their next meal is coming from they wonder where their next 24 hours of time will come from.Cillian Murphy is Raymond Leon, a ""time keeper"". He has been doing it for 50 years and it is not at all clear how old he actually is, but it certainly is at least 75. But he looks 25. He chases down those suspected of gaining time by criminal activity.Justin Timberlake is arguably in the lead role as Will Salas. He lives in Time Zone 12 which is their ghetto. When he comes upon a man who is over 100 years old (he looks 25) and with over 100 years of ""time"", and just tired of living any longer, when they both fall asleep gives Will all his time except 5 minutes, which allows him to walk across the street to a bridge over the Los Angeles River and when his time counts down to zero he falls dead into the river. This leads authorities to a manhunt and a convenient street camera identifies Will as a suspect.The movie is novel and entertaining, we enjoyed it. As I watched fictional characters trying to figure out how they would get their next time increment, I naturally thought of all those people in our real world not knowing for sure how they would get money for next month's rent or for food. It really is an issue, the small % of very wealthy people having more than they will ever need while so many are starving and homeless.Amanda Seyfried is Sylvia Weis, the daughter of a time-wealthy man who owns a number of businesses. She and Will become unlikely fugitives and eventually love interests.SPOILERS: After overcoming the time-keeper's hunt, and almost running out of time, Will and Sylvia bond emotionally and become a team. A sort of Bonnie and Clyde, destined to knock off all the big time-keeping banks and redistribute time to those who don't have much left.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Important story and thus an important film!,"It's 2024 and I just only now have watched In Time. It's a revolutionary tale. It's about our capitalist society. People in the world of 'In Time' pay in life-years in stead of money. Working class citizens have like a few days on their wrists. They need to work in factories otherwise they'll die. The rich and powerful live in a different city zone with hundreds to thousands of life-years on their wrists. And those at the top have even millions of life-years in their safes. It's the same in our society. The more money you have, the more life you'll have. The better quality consumer you can be, with better housing, healthcare, educations, holiday houses, cars, quality clothing et cetera. Research shows that rich people live longer and healthier. It's a system. It's a game. That's what 'In Time' is telling us. And the film is right when one of the characters says that it's impossible for everyone to be that rich. So those in power keep rising the prices of food, of produce and products. So that always the majority of people will just get by. But the film also states that there's more than enough money for everyone. And the rich aren't even really happy because they don't have real freedom because they need to go around guarding their precious lives with gates and guards. This film is now 13 years old, and our societies are just the same. I even dare to say that inequality is growing ever since. People fall into the trap believing that 'foreigners' are to blame, that people with a different skin colour are to blame, that drag queens and transgenders are a problem. But who has the power and the money? They go freely and make everyone believe that indeed the other poor and average people who look different, dress differently, speak another language, eat different foods, pray to other gods, are to blame. The end of the film hints at a sequel. I just read that not too long ago Justin Timberlake tried to get a sequel produced. With no succes. Should this film have won many Oscars? No. Is it an important film though? Yes. This film should be shown in schools when kids are being taught about our capitalist societies. It's a game we are playing, folks. And we all play along. And we sit and watch human beings become billionaires. Billionaires! All that money taken from societies. Taken from people. And we look at them and do nothing. Unlike the two protagonists in this film, who deserve many sequels to continue their fight. But more than one of this kind of film will probably be too much for those in power.

Peep This Reviews,"I avoided this movie because I judged a book by it's cover. Sci-fi action thriller where the minutes and hours of your life are literally currency that people will kill for. That sounds interesting, oh but it's got Justin Timberlake in it. No thanks. I was wrong.

But it turned out a little bit prolonged in the middle because it became kinda obvious and I just wanted the plot to grow, but it was kinda slow. I wanted more energy or something.So the movie seems kinda overestimated, it gave hope and then partly smash it. But still, the idea is great! So many senses!

Snappy sci-fi,"Why is this movie not rated more highly? I've seen it twice now, and found it thoroughly engaging and entertaining even the second time around. The Darwinian premises are ""time is literally money"" and ""earn money or die young"". The other premises are more Hollywood fantasy: ""look good"" and ""live forever"". The conceit of being able to electronically transfer time to another person is neat, and neatly executed. I found it fairly easy to buy into. It's a gritty, snappy, sexy, well-written, well-acted science fiction film with social commentary that is not irrelevant to our modern world. Timberlake was great, as was Seyfried. OK, there were a few too many shootouts and chase scenes, but you expect that in every American movie. It's worth about 7.5 but I'll round it up.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In Time is an intriguing thriller about the value of time as literally money for survival,"Just watched this futuristic thriller with my movie theatre-working friend. It has people wearing a ""watch"" on their arms which digitally gives them a certain number of time that they use to pay for whatever means they need for survival. It stars people like Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, Amanda Seyfried, and Cillian Murphy. Oh, and also Johnny Galecki from ""The Big Bang Theory"". The writer/director is Andrew Niccol who also penned the screenplay for another movie I liked called The Truman Show. This was almost as good as that with many expositions in the dialogue that explain whatever plot points you may be a little confused by. So on that note, In Time is a worthy thriller that makes you think about how precious time really is.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not too bad,"Seyfried is very good, her character is credible; Timberlake's not so much, he is too detached. I would give her 9/10 and him 6/10. Murphy's cop is pretty good, too. I cannot decide on the banker, I keep seeing him as his character in Mad Men. The local bad guy and his gang need an upgrade to be more believable. The movie plot is good but some of the technological advances are far-fetched when compared to other aspects of the world these people live in. There are other minor ""glitches"", such as the girl who shoots so well from a distance the first time but then apparently needs to learn how to fire a gun. Anyway, I think this movie is a message to politicians -- not that I expect any of them to watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The future where everybody stops aging at the age of 25 but can be only kept living by buying 'time' - the only currency for everything.,"It's not as flashy in terms of effects as other sci-fi movies but I believe 'In Time' has successfully conveyed the message it was suppose to deliver: To appreciate the NOW - and spending it on Quality Moments that has real value in our lives. It gives us a view of 'time' in a different angle, from one that we casually dismiss or take for granted in our daily lives - to one that means starvation, losing all the comforts in life even Death. From a luxury to a necessity.The actors are apt for their roles and are well chosen.I must admit though it had become like a futuristic 'Bonnie and Clyde' gig towards the end.Other than that it is a very good movie to watch without making you feel you wasted time or money.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A pure masterpiece,"I wanted to wait a while before I wrote this review, because when you see film as this one it's natural to be very excited and pleased with it. So, I did wait and I saw it again just to be sure, but nothing's gonna change my mind about this one. A PURE MASTERPIECE! According to me, it's better even than Inception (with all due respect to Christopher Nolan and the wonderful cast behind that legendary motion picture). I was surprised by the performance of Justin Timberlake, and I was very pleased to see Amanda Seyfried in an action film, because she usually plays in drama or thriller films. It's a very good film with a very good point and it makes you wonder all the time: What will you do if you knew you have seconds to live? Is it fair that someone has more time than someone else? How will you feel if you knew how much time you have left? How big is the cruelty of men? Can we be more greedy than we already are? This film got it all: lots of action, romance, drama and it triggers moral questions that we're all bothered by. It's not only a sci-fi film - it's a legendary classic that will go down in history.

"Hey Buddy, Can You Spare Some Time?","Greetings again from the darkness. Now this is a terrific premise for a sci-fi story. You have surely heard the phrase: Time is Money. Well in this world, Time is not just money, it is Life itself. Time is everything ... and it's displayed for all to see via a neon green counter on everyone's forearm.The film has an odd look. Vehicles look like modernized versions of 1970's classics, but fashion and other technology seems basically unchanged. Society is divided more severely than today. but the commentary is clear.All people live until 25 at which time they stop aging and the clock starts. They are given ONE year and are free to earn, gamble or spend their time ... heck, some even gamble. When your clock hit Zero, you drop dead immediately. So, the working class is isolated in time zones, running from place to place and taking extra shifts at the plant to pay the rent. The rich live in Connecticut and try to find ways to leisurely spend their days that will never end.Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, one of the poor ones. In a scene that will have you scratching your head, Olivia Wilde plays his mom (remember, you stop aging at 25). Will has a chance meeting with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who has lived more than 100 years and still has more than a century left. After a deep, philosophical conversation, Will ends up with Henry's time and is a suspect in his murder.Will runs off to Connecticut and is pursued by the Timekeeper Police led by Cillian Murphy. Will ends up in the lavish home of Philippe Weiss (Vincent Katheiser from Mad Men) and falls for his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). They end up on the lam and turn into the ultimate Time Bandits ... Robin Hood who steals time from the rich and distributes to the poor.While the premise is promising, some of the best stuff is left untouched. Henry Hamilton would have been a fascinating character to get a little more backstory on. Cillian Murphy's character is obviously talented and a bit burned out. It's a bit disconcerting to see most of the people in a movie to look all about the same age, but that's a very cool product of this society. As is the ""big board"" of time that looks eerily similar to the Stock Market boards we see that track movement every moment of the day. Time is precious and is of course watched over.Writer/director Andrew Niccol also brought us Gattaca and Lord of War. I would have liked this one to go a bit deeper, but it's fun to watch Timberlake and Seyfried playing Bonnie and Clyde. Thinking about this from a monetary standpoint is pretty interesting, but it also reminds us that there's never enough time!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
2/10 only for the concept - childish film,"One of the worst mainstream action films I've seen in a long time. Sure there are worst but not of this budget and actor calibre. It deserves a much worst rating than 6.7 because it's not redeemable by anything apart from the main concept.Dialogues are moroning and the entire script seems to have been written by high schoolers.Everything happens so easily, the plot develops with next to no suspense. Because action is frictionless, there is almost nothing that makes the protagonists struggle, viewers are not captivated or worried since there are no stakes.I'm wishing someone redid this film with some action writing and film making experience.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Almost didn't watch this because of the cast...,"I thought it was going to be another singer-turned-actor star vehicle, with girls in the audience drooling over Justin and the pretty-but-bland Amanda Seyfried included to persuade the boyfriends to accompany them to the cinema.I humbly admit that I was completely wrong on every score.Justin Timberlake was awesome. Whereas most singers-turned-actors bring their star persona to the screen (Beyonce will always be Beyonce, no matter what role she's cast in), he looked like he was an actor, period, up there with any of the contemporary Hollywood A-listers. I could easily see him taking roles from Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire or Ryan Gosling, maybe even Leonardo Di Caprio. There's a surprising grittiness about him, along with a real sensitivity to the needs of the role - he inhabits the character in a way that honestly blew me away.Amanda Seyfried's previous work in Mean Girls, Mamma Mia and Dear John didn't exactly endear me to her either, but far from being just pointless eye-candy, she totally held her own in the role.As regards the movie, it's an extremely interesting premise, well-considered and well-executed. While it's ostensibly a sci-fi, it plays more like an alternative present with realistic social themes - think V for Vendetta, Gattaca or Equilibrium instead of I, Robot, Total Recall or Minority Report. But it is equally an action movie, with car chases, shoot-outs and plenty of bad guys chasing the good. The movie also has some surprisingly tender scenes - it definitely has heart - and a little bit of romance thrown in along the way.In short, don't ever judge a book by its cover. In Time surprised me by being actually very good and, unlike many other action/sci-fi movies, it sticks in your mind long after you've finished watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
it could have been better...,"This movie bored me for the most part and I was not too impressed at all. I enjoy a few actors in this film. To me Cillian Murphy was great as he is always. I liked Olivia Wilde as his mom, but she got killed off too soon (which you can see in the trailer). I also really loved Matt Bomer who should be in more movies cause he is talented and beyond handsome. I also fond myself very surprise to even like Alex, who was pretty OK in this.Justin and Amanda did nothing for me. Justin needs to go back to singing or whatever else he does. Amanda and that fake wig was just crazy. I enjoy some of the style but the future seemed very boring.The movie itself was just filled with plot holes. I understood the idea but it could have ended much better than what it did. The end was a cliché'. Over all I give it a six. I think the story was missing a little something. I don't know what but, it really could have been much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The correlation between now and then is timeless,"In a time when time is money and you can literally pay with your life, murder is rampant, death common by theft of time and life truly day to day and hour to hour and .. If you have the guts to take life to the second, you could win eons. But, the real question of life is how much are you willing to give to the ones you truly love? This is a true Robinhood adventure and only time will tell whether or not anyone really ever wins. The cars are the only draw back for me. I know cars pretty good and old 1968 Camaros and Lincolns don't quite do the movie justice. The acting is beyond phenomenal. Olivia was truly the perfect 25 year old mother to a 25 year old Justin. Even the oldest Time Barron was depicted as just that but 25 years old, worth millenniums. Excellent, by far the best movie I've seen this year.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great concept for a movie,Yes I liked this but I think it could have been better. Everyone acted well especially Justin Timberlake who was great. Loved the concept and the original idea for this movie. Just that damn timekeeper chase dominated the whole movie. Cilllian Murphy fresh with boot polish hairdo just got on my nerves. Yet the more interesting minutemen didnt last long. Very early role for the up and coming Bella Heathcote. Amanda Seyfried eyes are a little to big for her face.

"Very Good ""LOGAN'S RUN"" Reimagining WITH A MESSAGE","""In Time"" surprised me! Justine Timberlake does a good job here, Amanda Seyfried is adorable & feisty & Cillian Murphy continues to be a presence in film.But can I just take a second to congratulate OLIVIA WILDE (from TV's ""House"" & ""Tron"") as she's excellent here and has a scene which is truly heartbreaking & proves she's not just a pretty face...EXCELLENT Job Olivia.The story is very 'Logan's Run' (Limited Life Span) but it's set in a different time & scenario, there are no flash special effects, no robots, no sanctuary, no big cityscape but the twist put on it is EXCELLENT.Time is Money...The Rich get richer & live longer...The Poor remain poor and die young...The Government is corrupt & has everything in order that is until Timberlake is given a gift which he tries to use to change things for the majority rather than the minority.The story is pretty basic but the MESSAGE is a good one... Life is precious and much can be achieved in JUST 1 DAY A Sci-Fi Drama that holds the attention and plays out well.

Enjoyable style over substance,"This movie has a promising premise, if nothing else. The idea of using lifetime as currency has been done before, but it's still uncommon enough that the idea enough makes this movie intriguing. And at first the movie treats its premise well. The urban ghetto of those living one day at a time is portrayed well, making you to feel for its citizens. By the time the rich and immortals are introduced, you have begun to understand the blight of those less fortunate, which in turn causes you to side with them. There are some plot holes and questions about how such a economy can function and why don't the people rebel against it, but you'd need at least a full trilogy to fully delve into those questions, so I don't really blame this movie for not fully examining every little nuance about the world it tries to portray. It's full of stuff as it is.So, the start is a promising one? So what goes wrong? Well, it stops examining the world and turns into an action film with car chases, gun battles, mooks, criminals and your basic Robin Hood wannabes. It's still not bad, per se, as most of the actors are rather enjoyable (Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried with those humongous eyes of hers were especially pleasant surprises), the cinematography and the score are both above average and the whole movie manages to look extremely stylish and easy on the eyes. But I would have liked to see more of this world. How it works? How it came to be? Why did it came to be? Some of those questions are hinted at, but never answered, while some of them are not even mentioned. I didn't expect the movie to answer all of the questions, but it should have tried to answer as many as it comfortably could. Now it stops way too early.So, in the end, what did I think of the film? Well, it's intriguing and thought-provoking, yet it falls flat after the first third. It's well-made and enjoyable to watch, but it's also disappointing, there's no denying that. So... if you like scifi thrillers at all, you'll probably enjoy this one just fine. If you want an intellectual film, there's something here for you as well, but don't expect too much. And if you just want a good action film, I'd give this one a watch. It's entertaining all the way through, very much so in fact.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Execution matters,"In Time by Andrew Niccol is very similar to his previous film Gattaca, even sharing same plot points and almost feeling like a remake. The change here is that time is currency and you die if you lose it, like a strapped-on ticking bomb. Interesting concept it is but I wished everything else is just as interesting.The movie starts off interesting with a strong message about the corrupt higher-ups abusing the poor but slowly, increasingly becomes less interested in trying to sell that message, becoming a Bonnie & Clyde-type movie that me lose interest and seems like Niccol was running out of ideas. There are several plot holes which I hand-picked around ~20 which detracted from the movie, some of which grind my gears for how stupid it they were. The acting wasn't great either, the two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and Justin Timberlake is as wooden as well, timber but Cillian Murphy does do some good with his role, but one can do so much when deserved more. There are some good things here, the visual style was eye-candy and the action scenes do help the movie get along even if they provide false sense of danger and there was one chase scene which ends in a laughable CG-Model work.Overall an interesting concept with an equally interesting message wasted on a below-average execution that fails to deliver anything new or interesting as its premise instead relying on reused material to fill in its runtime. Undemanding audiences might have a good time out of this one and makes for a great time-passer but until then, save yourself some time.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than expected - good casting,"This movie is better than I thought it would be. It is stylishly made with an attractive cast and has some good points. This is a dramatic science fiction story about time left to live being the currency of the future. The premise is quite interesting and isn't too ridiculous. There is tension from wondering if some characters will die when they run out of time. The casino segment makes use of this. The casting is good. Justin Timberlake is the Robin Hood type character trying to redistribute time. He has matured a bit as an actor. He is less teeny bopper than usual and his voice is a few registers lower here. The supporting cast is good especially Cillian Murphy as the cop or time keeper - his obsessive look is quite convincing. Vincent Kartheiser of Mad Men has an eerie preserved look and is well cast as Amanda's father. A lot of the humor comes from the ""science fiction young"" characters like the slim Olivia Wilde as Justin's 50 years young mother. One of the scariest things is seeing Amanda Seyfried run around in very high heels. Don't get her hair style and color. Johnny Galecki of Big Bang Theory has a small but against type role. Matthew Bomer plays a suicidal man who doesn't want to live any more and gives Justin a present of time. Alex Pettyfer plays a villain thug with a British accent - something he is quite suited for. Liked the use of vintage cars but the city scenes were a bit science fiction drab. A couple of weak points. The story has Justin and Amanda running around a lot and it gets a bit repetitive. It drags a bit in the middle to last quarter. Overall still worth watching if you have the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Do not spend a dime on this movie. I found myself finishing it just to see how bad Justin Timberlake has ruined his career.Terrible dialog, cheesy lines that don't make sense, horrific directing, and Justin Timberlake cannot act to save his life.

ORIGINAL,"Starting from the opening where the movie explains the world that we will witness, which is the world where time is truly money where human aging is programmed to stop at the age of 25 years. In each person's hand there is a time indicator that they have. In this film time is used as a medium of exchange similar to money in our world. The more often they use their time to buy something, the less time we have which will led to dying.In my opinion, this movie was so phenomenal and very original to watch so the concept of the story delivered was still embedded in my mind even after more than 5 years the film was first aired. But starting from the conflict part until the resolution part of the conflict, in my opinion this movie failed on conveying the story well, where the conflict and motivation of the protagonist to resolve the conflict is not conveyed in depth so it is very unfortunate.But still this movie provides an experience that is worth the time we spend watching it. There is the sad part, angry part, happy part, all emotions exist in this movie so this movie provides a satisfying experience. Also the moral of this story can be implemented in the real world.

In time is worth the time,"I suppose there are hard core science fiction fans who may pick apart some of the premises in this movie, I don't think it would be hard to do so, but, just accept the idea and enjoy the ride. The concept is interesting enough and the story is compelling enough to keep most of us entertained.I have been quite critical of Justin Timberlake in some of his recent performances, but he is credible here, perhaps just one step away from a serious lead role. In fact, most of the acting is up to par. The movie is true to itself in that it is guided by the concept and not by what they think the audience expects. This is made clear in a scene in a hotel room where I expected the obligatory sexual encounter, despite the fact that the two lead characters were in danger all the time. However, adherence to realism triumphed over audience expectations and, perhaps, even higher ratings. The director deserves some credit for this.In short, this is a film worth watching that will give you much to think about in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely not a waste of time,"Watching this movie is another one of those things where you go away feeling a little different. The ideas projected by this film strike a chord with many people, especially when you make the comparison between time in this movie and money. It really does make you think.Instead of money, people earn and pay in time, but, as with any movie this style, there's a crime going on. The rich are living forever and the poor are dying young. So out to change he system and saved thousands of lives is...Justin Timberlake, as Will along with Sylvia, portrayed by Amanda Seyfried.Surprisingly Seyfried and Timberlake make quite a dynamic couple and it's always refreshing seeing actors in different genres for a change. The two main characters come across surprisingly well, Will (Timberlake) making an almost instant emotional connection. Sylvia (Seyfried) is a little more clichéd character, but adds beautifully to the film none the less. Although her heels were practically sellotaped to her feet through the whole film....you never actually see her with any normal shoes...Overall the film is quite jumpy at the start, a little bit rushed and then a little too slow, but it really comes into its own in the middle and towards the end, even some comedy is unearthed here and there.The addition of the talented Cillian Murphy, gives the film that little extra glamour that adds to the list of reasons of why you have to see it. And the touching moments really do tug at your heartstrings. The music, composed by none other than Craig Armstrong, emphasises the gravity and power of the scenes, creating, at times, quite a tense atmosphere.Watch this movie if you liked Contaigon, or just generally any action/adventurey type movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Just about what it should be, and lives up to realistic expectations","Will(Timberlake) lives in a different world than us. Since it's barely futuristic at all, I'd say it's more appropriate to refer to it as an alternate reality than merely something set years from now. In it, time is the only currency(and this point is hammered home... one thing is that the word replaces the word ""money"", but there are painful puns on that, where the meaning of common phrases are turned into something else, such as how here, ""do you have a minute"" is the equivalent to ""spare some change"". The points made are great, the communication could sometimes use some work. Niccol's biggest flaw is that he tends to overwrite scripts when he has something to say, and the conveying gradually loses subtlety... with that said, there are bits where it is spot-on, and the ending of this is fantastic), you do not age beyond 25(leading to a world where most people are supermodels... to be fair, the film itself does poke fun at this aspect) at which moment your life will only have one additional year, and you can now earn more by labor(and don't expect to be able to pay debts, taxes and the like and have much at all left for yourself or your family). The metaphor is entirely clear, and not only does this this fit nearly perfectly with the current Occupy movement, some of the better of the plenty of good, quotable dialog in this lends itself to slogans for it. Our hero does go on to fight the wealthy elite, who do not enjoy their lives because they're worried about losing what they have, so they take no chances. Some of the logic and consistency is a tad iffy. He is joined by rich girl wanting to break free from her sheltered existence, Sylvia(Seyfried), and they do the Robin Hood thing. While the inclusion of a romance between the two is predictable, the execution isn't bad. The characters are memorable and their arcs tend to be convincing. This has some of the shallow Hollywood standards going, with the poor being largely honorable and doing little wrong(if it does admit that a lot of crime happens in the ghetto... however, this feels like it's blaming those in power for creating that situation, which is true a lot of the way... still, no one is that black and white), and, well, you can guess how the other side is portrayed. I like that our main cop, Leon(Murphy), is clearly a person of integrity, he's not drunk on power. The acting is impressive. This is the first thing I see Justin in, and I would like to see other movies starring him. Though the action is somewhat derivative and uninspired not to mention in very brief stints(Andrew is not comfortable with the genre, and I support him sticking with what he does well, see what immediately follows this parenthesis), this gets quite intense. There is a little moderate language(one strong, as per what the PG-13 rating allows... and it's placed so well), mild violence and somewhat disturbing sights(when your clock runs out, you collapse from a heart attack) in this. I recommend this to anyone who cares about the current political and financial situation, as well as fans of thought-provoking thrillers. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In Time (2011),"Great idea with incredibly dumb execution. In the future, time is currency and everyone stops ageing at 25 for some reason. Timberlake finds himself receiving thousands of years from some guy tired of immortality. He ends up being chased by the cops in charge of time, and by some very non-threatening gangsters. The idea is wonderful, and the perfect vehicle for social satire. The poor spend their lives on food and essentials, literally living day to day, meanwhile the rich just spend, spend, spend. It also has the great chance to view the pain of immortality and how it's not how long you live but how you live. Which is why I'm so angry at the stupidity and nonsense in this film. I understand that nobody ages, but why does everyone look like a model? Characters just vanish, and it just becomes one huge assault on the 1%. Like a teenager with a good idea, but doesn't understand what they are talking about. There are huge lapses in logic. A major character dies because of time running out, even though simple maths would show that she would have survived. People run at each other in slow motion, with dramatic countdowns, but it doesn't play in real time. Timberlake's character knows how to fight, which I put down to his mention of his father being able to fight, and then we find out that fighting just involves holding hands. This makes for the most boring confrontation between Timberlake and the antagonist. Let's hope for an intelligent remake in the future, because this just ruins the premise.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time proved this movie is a classic,"Ironically, I think people needed time to appreciate this masterpiece of a film.This films is a marvel because it seriously makes you wonder you think about your life-time, and how important little moments are.Its fascinating to see the dynamics between people in a world were you can't get physically old, but your mind does.More than 10 years of its release, and everytime you see this movie, you can pick new subtle details.Another aspect of this movie is that you remember it.

One More Time On The Run,"Well, the time thing is stolen, or maybe a bow to Logan's Run, but anyway, the movie is well produced, got some charismatic actors (good: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, nice chemistry) and still here and there a little fine idea.Gattaca, also directed by Andrew Niccol, is the better and more interesting movie, but In Time, even if it's no masterpiece, is no fail but a solid contribution to the sci-fi genre regarding dystopian stories.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
interesting and unsettling,"A science-fiction movie set in a future where people could live forever, if they didn't have a time limit on their lives. It shows a very good plot and continues having a lot to say. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried are the futuristic Bonnie and Clyde, whose destinies are crossed with Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving it to the poor. The movie is decent, acting-wise, and soon turns into a chase film examining all the possible moral quandaries. Cillian Murphy as well, playing a Timekeeper — cop charged with making sure people stay where their place in society — is an interesting character. In Time has its rhythm in the right place, it's not a masterpiece but certainly clever and original.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A brilliantly written alternative commentary on society.,"On top of that the cinematography is just gorgeous to look at especially in digital theaters. It puts you in a very realistic parallel world that resembles ours but just not quite the same in a strange and unsettling way.The social commentary of the plot line reminds me of the '70's Charlton Heston movie, ""Soylent Green"" except time is the valuable commodity instead of food.I think the ""Occupy Wall Street"" folks will see and appreciate the similarities between the two class societies portrayed. At the end of the movie I was so outraged for some reason because of how close to home the similarities were.It's definitely a sociopolitical movie that doesn't pound you over the head with it. It just makes you see what's going on from an intelligent, inert and quite lyrical point of view. It ain't the Matrix but it does give you something to think about with a different perspective.I liked the movie very much because of this which is why I gave it ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

a decent idea very poorly adapted,"The film starts somehow promising by confronting the viewer with an absolutely unusual get-together as Olivia Wilde plays Justin Timberlake similar aged mother (at least physically). It proceeds by showing a depressive utopia where people are buying goods & services with their lifetime and earn them likewise (people are genetic modified that they get 25 years old, don't age, but also have only 1 year from that point on and have to earn their further lifetime). Timberlake comes into the possession of great number of years, but is hunted by the ""time-keepers"" for that unjustified time. Sounds nice, right? Yes, the film had a lot of potential, but it was so bad executed that it is an insult to everybody who has brain. I wanted to watch a pop-corn movie which I didn't have to think about - since my days are stressful enough. But even with that attitude towards watching the film it was hard to ignore all the logical inconsistency, besides that it has no surprising twists at all. ... And of course their is the usual ""bad"" guy shoots after ""good"" guy, but only hits handrail @ their escape. Cliché and nothing but cliché. So if you don't think Amanda Seyfried and others are hot, it probably will be a 1 of 10.+1 star for potential of the story at beginning +1 star for the hot actress -1 for all the shouting illogicExamples for missing logic?their is ""poker""-match within the movie where the players bet their lifetime ... it is no-limit poker, but for everybody at the table the whole lifespan is always at stake. That means that the player with the highest number of years can force every other player into an all-in situation every time (meaning their potential death), especially unfair when one has disproportionate number of years ... no one would play such a gamelifetime can just be transfered by connecting the arms, without any security measurements such that time-thieves just can rope your time at will (of course those are not hunted by the ""police"" -.-)humans are that advanced that they can manipulate genetics in such a way that we can life infinitely, but use cars, guns, basically everything out of the 80s/90s ???? wtf?wtf was this ""fighting about time"" in one of the scenes, ridiculousthe society would not hold together 1 week if such a system would be implemented without large oppression, nevertheless people just stay in their habit, don't protest or whatever and work in stupid industry jobs ...what does the stealing of 1 million years of life mean overall to the system that it collapses??? bullshit ... 1 million years for 7 billion people on the earth is 1 year per 7000 humans, which means just some few hours more of life ...

Very original and correctly done,"Don't be mislead by the not so good reviews for this film. In Time is among the best recent SciFi films you will see, give it a try. A very original story, which (not many seem to have realized about it) is a clever allegory of today's capitalist world, but with time except money as currency. The structure of society and economy are a mirror of our own society, but in the much more scary version that those affluent can live, as they earn enough to have years or even centuries of life ahead them (genetic engineering has made it possible to remain young for as long as one lives), whereas the less affluent ones have to struggle daily to get more time to remain alive. Banks give you loans of time, at very high interest rates, and the system is controlled by the rich and powerful, whom just raise the interest rates and prices and lower the salaries when they detect that something may threaten their privileged position.... doesn't this ring a bell to you??Other people have commented about the inadequacy of the actors chosen for the main roles (don't agree), the lack of chemistry between them (same) or a weak plot (strongly disagree).

subversive economic commentary disguised as SF thriller,"If all you understand is the sci-fi thriller part of this, you should still enjoy it; there are car chases and bullets flying and action-y music and people climbing fire escapes in the night: all that thriller stuff. It's done well.Plot: In the future, longevity science has reached its pinnacle, and everybody is given to age 25, physically frozen there, plus given one ""gratis"" year to set up an adult life, which counts down on a readout on your wrist...and as a consequence, time--your own time left to death-- becomes the commodity that we work for, trade for, spend, and that rich people horde by using up poor people. Poor people, running madly from one job to another, pushed harder and harder by inflation and rising work quotas, living in dangerous conditions with their peers, always at risk of having their few remaining hours stolen, fight the countdown. Endlessly they fight it. Many lose the race, get ""timed out,"" their clock stops, and they fall dead on the street. (But they sure look good when they do.) Poor people inexplicably waste their precious minutes on booze and low-level gambling. Our hero, a ghetto wage-worker, rebels against this and becomes Robin Hood, stealing time from the wealthy and returning it to the poor, whence it came.What's so clever here is that, of course, this is the world we already inhabit. We sell our precious limited moments to corporations in order to buy stuff we don't need that they advertise to us on their corporate television programs (both in the programs and via commercials) and we don't say ""no"" or use our critical minds to see what's going on. We buy lottery tickets and stuff on credit. And so they eat up our lives and we keel over dead before they do. (in the US, if you are poor, you can actually do that on the steps of a hospital and if you have no insurance, well, good riddance to ya, is the attitude of the plutocrats and the hospital administrators who work for them.) I found myself laughing and nodding through this as clever points of similarity arose.And this is what s-f does well, when it works. It says, here, let me tell you this wholly imaginary tale about the future or another planet, but it's really holding up a mirror about today for those who have the wits to see themselves in it.

Great potential wasted,The idea put in this movie is simply great. It reflects the events of nowadays just in a little different value which generally is the same. But that's it. Great movie potential wasted on: 1) bad story line 2) not the best acting (in my opinion Justin's emotional spectrum isn't wide enough for several movie moments although it wasn't so bad either) 3) very bad character development 4) plot flaws (you could clearly see that in many moments time left wasn't enough to do certain actions) When i found about who is the director of this movie i was waiting for so much more and was really disappointed to see so many flaws and imperfections...

"Great Idea, Poor Execution","This movie could have been great. The idea is very original-- set in a dystopian future where people live forever as long as they have ""time"", this world's currency. But lack of a coherent plot/storyline, bad script, and no character development really keeps this movie back.When I first started this movie, I had almost no expectations (having not even seen the trailer). After about 10 minutes, I was pleasantly surprised. The world that it was set in was a very refreshing idea. However, soon after that, I began to saw the many flaws. It seemed that each of the main characters had a complete lack of fluid character development-- they were almost all completely one dimensional (With the characters that ""changed"", it did not feel like a natural progression-- it seemed forced).The blame isn't fully on the actors, however, as the script dialogue seemed awkward at times and choppy at others. It really kept the movie from being believable. Especially the cliché ""time"" related one liners that one or another character would say. What were they thinking?The plot, too, had massive holes that kept me from losing myself in the movie. A lot of the times it didn't really make sense. And many parts of the story brought up, but not expanded upon. It almost seemed like the director added those scenes in as an afterthought.Overall, if you have a couple hours with nothing to do, ""In Time"" is worth watching if just for the interesting concept. It really is a shame because I think this could have been done much better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thoroughly Enjoyed This,"I watched this movie, as I read the thousand and more people comment and I sat dumbfounded at why anyone would rate this as a poor movie.It is pure entertainment. And with entertainment, I have learned that all movie plots are not perfect. They never please absolutely everything and the ones for whom it is not a pleasure always seem to find the time to berate and belittle the movie.I have been around for 56+ on this earth and I cannot underestimate the number of movies, the thousands upon thousands I have seen.This does not make me an expert on movies. But I must say it does make me understand the medium much better than most people. I doubt, seriously doubt that even 1% of the reviewers on here have seen movies from the entire 134 years which moving pictures have been made. Of course I haven't seen all of them. That would be ludicrous to claim. But I know what movies are, and what they can be...And this movie was a truly good one. It was engaging, thought-provoking, took you in, you care for the characters, you ever so curiously found your way around a plot and there was action, suspense, intrigue and solid Hollywood ending. I challenge anyone to explain away the contrary.Science fiction is a thoughtful medium. In movies, it cannot ever be what we read in a book. That is nearly impossible. This science fiction movie, while dystopian in nature, managed to have a heart, a premise and a plausible resolution. Was it perfect? I dare say, no movie has really come close - not even the greatest of them. After all, we imperfect beings are the creators of them. And because of this imperfection, our intrinsic realities will come to surface in them all.This movie was no exception.

Overt socialist propaganda,"Usually, I prefer my movies to have a bit of subtlety to them. I dislike being hit over the head with overt, trite messages. Sometimes, when the rest of the movie is done well enough, I'm willing to overlook the lack of subtlety. Unfortunately, this movie isn't really done as well as I'd like, but it's still enjoyable for what it is.The concept, as many people have said, is quite good: in the future, a corrupt system is put in place, where genetically engineered humans stop aging at 25, yet have only one year to live after that. Everything they buy reduces their lifespan, so most people end up living desperate lives in a near-panic, constantly attempting to find enough work to survive another day. The wealthy and powerful, on the other hand, live for centuries, with no worries.The execution is a bit heavy-handed and clichéd. The plot is predictable, and most of the points raised are a bit simplistic. Of course, the antagonist is a mean, old, wealthy capitalist whose philosophy basically amounts to ""screw the poor"", while the protagonist is an idealistic young man whose charisma and daring acts of valor threaten to topple an entrenched totalitarian system that's been stable for over a century.Still, I like Niccol's work, even if it does get a bit didactic and heavy-handed at times.

"Egnore the fact it stars Timberlake. ""In time"" is great!","Why all the hate? I thought ""In time"" was very good. Although I want too hate Justin Timberlake, I can't fault him as an actor, and too tell you the truth, I've been impressed with most off the movies I've seen him in (I have too say even his music, though not my kind off thing, is good for what it is).I Believe that Timberlakes presence is perhaps what has cursed ""In time."" An otherwise original movie, that sci-fi fans should be lapping up. Maybe it would off done better if it starred someone the average bloke thinks is cooler, but for now it's probably a film guys are getting dragged too by their girlfriends. If my girlfriend had dragged me along too see this though, I'd off been glad, because it's entertaining.Maybe I'm too overwhelmed with excitement when something is actually ""original"" these days (it does cause me too dish out a high rating straight away) but the unique premise off this flick is what people who didn't particularly enjoy it even admit too it having. Judging it by everything else that's in it though, I still think it's good. It's got a good cast, some half decent (though small amount of) action, and even uses the way clocks are always counting down in the movie too add some extra excitement too it. Plus Amanda Seyfried looks great in it. Oooft!""In time"" also doesn't overdo it with the way the future that is represented here looks, meaning it will age reasonably well. Even though it hasn't been that highly praised now (people complain that it's not explained how these people off the future are the way they are, even though it clearly says that they have been genetically engineered this way at the beginning) I can see it becoming a cult classic off sorts in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Truthful, but understated","The movie was done rather well, even though it could've been longer and more thought out, especially towards the end. The premise is set sometime in the future, but obviously portrays a world that is similar to our reality. Ie: The rich control too much of the wealth (time/life/money) while the poor starve and suffer thanks to the immoral social rationality and misguided idealism this/that world chooses to poison itself with. Will Salas (J. Timberlake) is a normal young man from a very poverty stricken part of the world who happens upon a fortune (great amount of time) by saving a stranger's life. A man seeking to end his time on Earth (simply because he is tired of living) gives his remaining time to Will, seeing that he will put it to better use than he can. This sets off a chain of events where Will meets the Weis family (most notably Sylvia- the female lead) and then begins to understand, firsthand, the ways in which the rich flaunt and hoard the wealth that could so easily save millions (ie: the ways the rich rationalize their situation/s to ease their conscience so as to block out the atrocities they indirectly cause). The rest of the movie is somewhat underwhelming with a good love story and a great moral message. The main point the directors try to convey (speaking directly to the world we live in), is that while money is infinite, wealth is finite. At a certain point if you have to much of it, you are stealing, albeit indirectly, from the rest of the population. Who, by the way, have just as much right to exist as anyone else, including the rich (most of whom were born into it). No matter what your last name is, who your parents are, how smart you are, where you were born, what color you are, etc.... if you are born of good circumstance, it is a position of responsibility and not of power. Therefore, taking advantage of it is, in fact, immoral. Honestly, the movie was bland and the acting so-so. But, the message of this movie is vastly understated. It is one that this world should heed before it's own greed suffocates the very freedom our ancestors fought to preserve: That those who were born with everything have an innate responsibility to share with those who were born with nothing. That, in our current system, all of us no longer have a right to life, liberty, and THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"It looks good and moves along, but the dialog and the whole concept are really really weak.","In Time (2011)The idea here is clever on paper, but it's squandered and made ridiculous.Here's a near future where everything is bought and sold in terms of the hours or minutes remaining in your life. Everyone is physically frozen at age 25, I guess at some kind of physical ideal. But most people are right at the end of their lives, literally, with just a few hours or days or sometimes seconds on their clocks, which are visible on their arms like glowing phosphorescent tattoos. Simple things like catching buses or getting paid for a day's work is sometimes down to a second or two. If your clock runs out, you're dead. You might think this is dramatic, cliffhangers after cliffhangers, but it's to contrived to work.The writing is bland to the point of awkwardness. The big moments are timed (naturally) down to the second in a brinksmanship that is more silly than dramatic. There are shades of lots of dystopian movies, from ""Minority Report"" to ""Twelve Monkeys,"" and with maybe some ""Back to the Future"" with the retro-cool ""Men in Black"" edge. There are slicked out 60s cars and warmed over noir dialog. It's not supposed to be realist, of course, but it lacks some other kind of credibility to make you think any of it is reasonable even in its fictional world.What's almost painful is the vision of this future where there are rich and poor and cops in black coats and bad guys in suits, that's fine. But the men are all hunks and the women traipse around in mini skirts and heels. All of them, all the time. Did I say dystopia? It's true that everyone is frozen at twenty-five years old, but youth is one thing and this thin, small minded cliché of a man's future world is thin at first and tiresome after the third scene.You can see the influences here--call them references, homages--with some classic borrowed themes. Most of all, the two unlikely heroes, man and woman, end up being a futuristic Bonnie and Clyde on the run. It might seem entertaining. No, it IS entertaining, only if you don't give it too much credence. The light is terrific in a lot of scenes, and the photography is very fluid. The sets and scenery themselves are fun, lots of empty concrete bridges and night stuff and neon, and those beautiful big drainage canals in L.A..It could have been terrific, but it's anything but timeless.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"For a few to be immortal, many must die...","""For a few to be immortal, many must die"" Philippe Weis, ""In Time""It is with mixed feelings that I am starting to write this review. On one hand, ""In Time"" is a fun to watch, engaging movie with an original, thought provoking concept. On the other hand, and this is a phrase that I unfortunately have to repeat in too many reviews, uneven, lacking depth story did not allow the movie to fully realize its potential.As much as Andrew Niccol, who wrote and directed ""In Time"" should be satisfied with the commercial success of the movie, he should be dissatisfied its overall quality. We expected a better script from the author of the smart and conceptually creative screenplay for the famous ""The Truman Show"". We expected more depth and insight into a human nature from the writer and director of the stylish, atmospheric, and mind bending ""Gattaka"".While ""In Time"" never reaches the heights of ""Gattaka"" or ""The Truman Show"", the movie still worth watching as it bears some signature features of a typical Andrew Niccol's work: an original concept that touches various philosophical, moral, and ethics issues, a compelling mix of action, suspense, thrill, and strong emotions, a great cinematography (Roger Deakins), and a stylish directing.Unfortunately, a delicate balance between the deep and thought provoking and the light and purely entertaining components of the movie is heavily tipped in favor of the latter, which makes ""In Time"" significantly ""dumber"" than it could have been.The acting is a mixed bag, just as the movie as a whole. While Justin Timberlake's performance is solid, his action hero Will Salas still lacks the charisma, drive, and charm of the unforgettable Sean Parker from David Fincher's ""The Social Network"".Similarly, Cillian Murphy is quite convincing as a merciless, relentless, driven Timekeeper, a police-like authority in the dystopian future of the Earth, sketchily portrayed in the movie. However, he is not as good, as he was in Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" where he played a smaller, but more professionally significant role of Robert Fischer – a multi-billion dollar oil company heir with a difficult relationship with his father.While Cillian Murphy and Justin Timberlake were solid but arguably underachieved, Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis) expectedly performed on her usual level – quite unexciting and unimpressive.The true star of the movie turned out to be a less known actor Vincent Kartheiser who managed to accomplish a very challenging task – remaining believable while playing a century old man with an appearance of a young adult - magnificently well.Of course, it helped that the Kartheiser's character, one of the richest men in the world Phillipe Weis, had the most interesting and complex personality in the otherwise bland and stereotyped character mix of ""In Time"". It is not a coincidence that he was the one whom Andrew Niccol entrusted with saying the least conventional, the most controversial, thought-provoking and emotionally charged statements.The strongest of these statements is a statement of a fundamental, pervasive greed that almost uniformly affects both rich and poor. In the dystopian reality of ""In Time"", the society as a whole silently agreed to daily sacrifice the lives of the vast majority of its members in order to secure an eternal youth for a very small minority. ""For a few to be immortal, many must die,"" says Philippe Weis in the movie.The sad irony of his words is that those who must die whole-heartedly support the order of things that is so deadly for them. Blinded by their greed more than by anything else they easily trade an opportunity for a normal, but finite live, for an ephemeral chance to join the small minority that possesses a key to an eternal youth - an ephemeral chance that surely brings a premature death instead.Overall, despite the obvious flaws plaguing the movie, recommending watching ""In Time"" is almost a zero-risk game: those interested in exploring a peculiar web of intricate weaknesses and defects of the human nature should be more or less satisfied, those simply looking for a thoughtless Sci-Fi thrill should not be too much disappointed.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An amazing thriller,"This film is about a world in which people stop aging after 25 years old. It sounds great, except they only have a year more to live unless they earn more time.""In Time"" is a great thriller that keeps me on edge all the time. The story starts right from the beginning without wasting any time, and throughout the film it's one race after another against time. There is so much urgency and thrill, keeping the adrenaline going.It is thought provoking as well. Using time as currency, the race to make ends meet is agonisingly intense. People who are poor (not much time left) may not even have time to earn more money on the clock. It highlights and magnifies the problem of poverty. The contrast between the rich and poor is very well portrayed. Another message is to live life fully, as every second literally counts.It would have been satisfying to see the film explain what adverse effect would follow Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried's actions, but I guess we have to wait for the sequel to find out. And I am definitely waiting for a sequel.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Any excuse to see the extraordinary Amanda Seyfried in an exquisite evening dress through most scenes.For me, time most definitively not wasted.Time will be spent wondering why Justin Timberlake is not more of a movie star today than he is, over a decade later.This cat can act and more than adequately so across different genres.I'm not going to say they should have titled this movie, Justin Time.I'm not.But they should have.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In Time has pretty good cast with: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy, & Vincent Kartheiser. The performances are what you expect; they're good, but nothing special. Timberlake has always stood out as a good actor and I really enjoy seeing him as an actor. Seyfried still sucks as an actress and I don't think she'll ever be good. The best performance in In Time is by, Vincent Kartheiser. Kartheiser is an extremely talented actor and his talent shows in this film.

Great Script Which Could Have Been Unforgettable,"The entire idea of In Time is very unique in itself and has a very engrossing factor in it.

There are no complaints about the movie as the movie is complete in its sense but the only thing one can complain about is with such an idea there is so much more that could have been shown and so little was displayed. The scale f presentation could had been much bigger. The idea definitely deserved that. The performances in the movie are great and the movie keeps a good pace. The story is well written but stumbles a bit under its own creativity and lack of expression that could have made it unforgettable. Direction is great by keeping the look of future as present as possible and not displaying much of CGI on it Honestly, the entire movie does not have much CGI on it which comes across as a positive aspect of the film giving it a more livable look.

"Tedious film, but good idea: 'Don't waste my time'.","Writer/director Andrew Niccol had a good idea - having time be the trading commodity for a future time when everything is bought and sold with a person's inherent time on earth. But is it is a one-note song and that note gets so overused that monotony sets in.The official description of the story is as follows: in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.' Plug into this simplistic explanation the fact that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in a time zone equivalent to living on the wrong side of the tracks. He decides to go for the gold and with the help of his buddy Borel (Johnny Galecki) he sets out to cross through all the barriers (using his allotted stored time to buy passage) to get to the wealthy part of town - an area run by the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) and his staff (Alex Pettyfer et at). Will gains entry into the gambling casinos, bets his hours on Timekeeper at the table, wins, and meets the beautiful Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of the richest man in the city. From there on it is a 'catch me if you can' chase as Will and Sylvia try to outwit the Timekeeper and of course we know who is going to survive.The dialogue is plebeian, the characters, with the possible exception of Will, are only given to us in outline form, so we end up not really caring about anyone. There are some interesting bits of surrealism tossed in but even those can't alter the fact that there is very little to work with in this little star turn for Timberlake.Grady Harp",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Time really IS money...,"I found this movie to not only be engaging, but refreshing in its originality. In an era where remakes and comic book story lines have been exhausted, it's nice to sit and watch something original. I was surprised at the number of negative reviews on this movie. I feel as though everything this movie attempted to address, it nailed. From the lack of balance and equality among the haves and have-nots, to the credible depiction of an age-old comparison of time and money- they do a fantastic job of taking something we've all thought about, and making into an entertaining, action packed, thought provoking movie.I also think Timberlake brought the intensity that the role deserved and required, and I can't think of any actor that would have served the role better. He left nothing to be desired when it comes to bringing his character to life. The notion that for a few to be immortal, many must die is the crux of the film, and it subtly addresses that reality in our society using an imaginative story line.

could they  have found better actors....In Time....,"I give this movie a 7. The story and whole set up was pretty solid, interesting, and definitely open to a lot of possibilities.

Like chewing a bubblegum,"I was actually looking forward to this movie, since I like the director's previous films ""Gattaca"" and ""Lord of War"".The plot: A future society in which time replaces money. People after the age of 25 are given one year to live and then they have to earn their additional time, without getting older than 25 (interestingly enough, almost all the actors in the movie ARE over 25).An original (well, not really, they got sued) but simple idea that isn't developed all that well during the movie and serves as an allegory to capitalism, with all the in-your-face consequences you're expecting.This movie is like chewing bubblegum: You enjoy it, you continue to chew it even after the flavor has gone and when you finish it you know you chewed it way too long.Except for Cillian Murphy, I'd have replaced the entire cast. Justin Timberlake is not bad, but... he'll always stay Justin in my mind, a boys-band singer, not an actor.

"Umpteenth recycling of the Marxist fable - don't waste time on ""In Time""","Ugh. Here we go again.

Stop me if you've heard this one before, but...(I was screaming STOP mentally about 10 minutes into the movie).I gave this movie a 2 for all the neat explosions, gunfire, car chases, and lavish sets. The idea of using time as a metaphor for money also deserves a 2, for minimal creativity, since even Marx's antithesis, John Locke, who predated Marx by a century, taught that property (capital) was created by labor (time spent working).It has always astounded me that so many people could be fooled by a bitter, envious, perverse man (Marx) who wrote an immense tome on a subject (capital) of which he was clueless, like a eunuch writing a sex manual. After a century, Marxism maintains its perfect losing streak - death, poverty, refugees, falling life expectancy, starvation, about 100 million victims of executions and gulags in China, the USSR, Cuba, etc. Perhaps someday a REALLY brave Hollywood studio will make a movie about this abominable story.

Needs time to appreciate.,"Contrary to many of the other reviews I have read regarding this movie, and indeed contrary to my accompanying movie buddy, I thought it was awesome. The plot is pure genius, the time-as-currency metaphor is a clever social observation and the interplay of the two is written real well into the dialogue. Before heading to the movie theatre I took a few minutes to acclimate myself with the plot; which was well worth doing as the movie itself jumps quite quickly into the main story without explaining the premise in much detail, which adds to the confusion a little, and means you don't truly appreciate how smartly conceived this movie is until maybe the next day, having thought more about it. In terms of execution I enjoyed the future-meets-retro styling (i'm calling it Futro because i'm creative like that). This is most evident in the vehicles, but also in the costumes, hairstyling and architecture. Often it's easy to imagine the future as a blank canvas of high technology and spaceship-esque style, but the future imagined here is much more realistic of our repeating retro trends, which I guess adds to the movie's ""this could actually happen in our lifetime"" feeling; with the added bonus that it looks cool! The 3 main characters were well played, although Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried did not have the greatest chemistry, it never felt that they were truly working together either in or out of character. The Timekeeper character could have perhaps had a little more screen time, Cillian Murphy's role was limited mostly to looking moody while chasing after Timberlake and Seyfried. Toward the end the character seemed to show potential for a lot more depth that was not realised. Once again it is an example of where this movie lets the audience work things out for themselves rather than ram the plot down their throats. So in conclusion, if you have the time to truly involve yourself in the movie and understand the underlying messages and plot twists then it is well worth the admission, otherwise, for the more casual viewer it can understandably leave you confused. I say, take the time.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If You Can Buy the Premise an Enjoyble Dystopian Story, 2 Hours Possibly Worth the Time","What if our bodies never aged passed 25, and we could conceivably live forever? Obviously, this is a situation most people would probably desire. Except, what if there was one hitch: that at the age of 25 we are given only one additional year to live, and the only means of extending our lifetimes beyond that one year, passed the age of 26, is to trade time like money which is in turn used to trade for other goods and services. A cup of coffee costs 4 minutes. A room in a sleazy hotel costs two weeks, while one night in a luxury hotel costs 5 months. A luxury car costs 50 years. A day's wage at a factory might give you a few days while working at a higher-end job can give you more. Rich people can make hundreds if not thousands of years, while poor people are often scrabbling to add a few days, hours, sometimes a few minutes, trying to extend their lifetimes long enough to allow them to get ""more time"". This is the premise of ""In Time"", in which commodities are not traded with money but with lifetime.In this world, people can give their lifetime freely or may be forced to give up their time by the government or thieves known as minute men who mug people for their time. Time is usually not wasted but stored on devices which can be transferred to others. The amount of time each individual has is shown on their left forearm through 13 digits. Some people have literally hundreds of years while others are continually scrambling to add days. Once the clock on the arm reaches 13 0's, the person expires immediately. People can give time to each other by engaging in a kind of hand shake, although this can be done by force as well.On the outset, it seems like a level playing field. But in this dystopia, it isn't. The world is divided into Time Zones. The lower numbered time zones are where people with thousands of years reside, while those in the higher time zones are in the equivalent of a ghetto where people are constantly fighting for time. To keep the lower classes in their place, it costs a hefty toll to pass between time zones. Will Salas lives in Time Zone 12. His mother, who doesn't look a day passed 25, is celebrating her 50th birthday. Over the course of 25 years, she's been able to add time, but like most people living on the edge, she has to take menial jobs to add time. On her 50th birthday, she doesn't have much time left according to her arm.Will goes to work, and upon check-out receives his pay, an increase in time reflected on his arm, although he complains his pay was lower that day. After work, he goes to a bar and meets someone from one of the lower-numbered time zones. The new-comber shows his arm which indicates he has over a century left. Will warns him he will be the target of muggers called minute men who will try to steal his time. He helps him escape, and later learns the man is 105 years old in real time, although this man says he's ready for his life to be over. They fall asleep, and the stranger gives Will a century of new life, leaves the premises and dies shortly thereafter.Will now has over a century of life, but doesn't realize that there are governmental forces in place to keep ""time"" out of the hands of the lower classes. Using his gift, he enters into another time zone where the wealthy reside. He begins to mingle with the elite, some of whom have hundreds if not thousands of years to spend on luxury cars, luxury mansions, and casino gambling. As one character put it ""Many must die for a few to be immortal"". He meets an older gentleman Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser of ""Mad Men"" fame) who is 75 years old, again who looks very young. Weis owns time banks which loans out time at inflated prices in the other time zones allowing him to be a kind of Donald Trump of time. Weis invites Will into his circle and introduces him to his daughter Sylvia Weis; unbeknownst to them Will is from the lower classes and wanted by the time police.The only aspect I felt was missing from ""In Time"" is a further explanation of the nature of time itself and how it came to be traded to buy commodities. We learn how the world works but are never told how the technology came into being and if there was a time before when lifetime wasn't traded. I expected a scene where maybe the two leads would find out the inner workings of how this came to be. I also wondered if there was a means of ""turing off the clock"" but the story never questions its own premise.Still a very interesting idea and works if you buy into the premise. The analogy is maybe a little obvious, in the sense that we are all constantly trying to buy time to some degree. The constant references of the prices of goods in terms of ""time"" are quite amusing, and done naturally and tastefully. One of the best scenes is when Will engages in a poker game in which the ""time"" stakes become very high.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Breathlessly,"This film is a delight. It restores my faith in the ability of contemporary film makers to pick up where Godard and Arthur Penn left off with Bonnie and Clyde and Breathless. Because the City in the Movie is not identified as LA. and because the zones are either New Greenwich or Dayton, the author who stated there is a goof, didn't understand this is a fictional place not a real one. Therefore, no goof! This story is a time machine! Lastly, Harlan Ellison wrote a terrific story( repent Harlequin cried the tick-tock man) about time as a commodity and the obsession with time, therefore , the auteur of this film must have read that story and improved upon it in a very fetching and fun way.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic first 25 minutes. After that...,"I was sold from the first minute of this movie. The set up was fantastic. The acting and direction of dialogue is a miss at most times.

Very original.,"When you consider how many Sci-fi books have been written and movies made, the idea of an original Sci-fi concept is slim at best, yet this feature delivers precisely that. The Idea that time is currency; simple, yet brilliant. This is a character led movie, so if into special effects, look elsewhere. The acting is very good, and was surprised by how good Justin Timberlake was, and the plot kept you interested throughout. If you've got time to kill, this is worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A compelling concept makes this decent heist film worth your time.,"In Time's unique premise asks interesting questions and ultimately puts a fresh coat of paint on the typical heist stereotype. I love heist movies and In Time is an interesting take as the characters steal seconds of life instead of money. While posing intriguing questions about life, worth, and economic tension, In Time fills its runtime with car chases, shootouts, bank heists, and a little bit of character development. In Time is not a perfect movie, but it has pretty good action, a great cast, and a provocative concept making for a solid film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So many holes in the screenplay that makes the Swiss cheese laugh,"first of all, what's the purpose of making this lukewarm movie stand out among those already played older but definitely much better sci-fi movies? there's nothing excited about this movie and the scenario simply failed to get people connected during the viewing. a ridiculous storyline and horrible formulaic gesture by asking all the actors kept watching their arms to verify how many years, days or minutes they gained or lost. the screenplay was just awful and boring. the scenes they arranged to shot this film were just overly used bridge, storm drain canal in los angeles, or the curvy pacific coast highway. cars looked extremely antique, old models but all electric, but when the guy rushed on the pacific coast highway, the engine sounds still gave off combustion noise that could only generate from a gasoline piston engine. the sound effect guy(s) should be fired. there were so many better movies in such genre, maybe hundred times better than this bore-to-death, brainless, sleepy movie. actors in this movie also performed mindlessly due to a spiritless screenplay and a non-talented director. a big yawn to lure the people who got insomnia to finally have heavy eyelids.

This film just In Time.,"No one ever claimed this was an Academy Award winning effort in writing or acting. What it is would be entertaining. What's wrong with that?

Excellent movie!,"A very excellent movie, In Time is just as good as other popular sci-fi movies like Inception, Star Trek, Star Wars and a lot more.

I really liked this movie and it has blown me off from the very beginning of the story.I could prove that this is an excellent movie for three reasons. First, it has very captivating effects. Every sci-fi movie needs to have good effects, or else they wouldn't be called sci-fi. This movie has succeeded in capturing the eyes of many watchers. Second, the concept of the movie is unique. Whoever thought of the plot has a very creative mind. True, it may seem unrealistic but still, the plot was very appealing and definitely worth watching. Lastly, the morals watchers could get from this movie. It shows us that discrimination between the rich and poor still exists, even in the future. Watchers can relate to this since that discrimination is still evident in the present. It also implies that not all the wealthy succeed in the end.I hope that the movie industry would make movies like this one.

In Time - a good movie.,"The Movie In Time is a good movie. Due to the youth of the lead actors I under estimated the quality of the movie.

Also the way the wealthy feared danger because it was the only way to die. While the poor only had a Day at a time to live, very creative.

As i expected..,"Seven is a little generous for this film, BUt from the moment I saw the advert for it I knew I would like it regardless. Even though it is yet another George Orwell 1984 spin off, these stories never fail to entertain me.The whole concept of the film is that due to overpopulation, everyone has a countdown which starts at the age of 25. All currency is now time, and you have to pay for everything with your life essentially. For instance, to make a phone call you have to deposit one minute of your life. It is a good idea, and a fascinating world in which to place our two heroes.I cant be bothered to check what the budget of this film was, but it seems fairly low. Its like they used all the money to pay for the digitally created 'clocks' on the arms (probably after effects) and a few rich expensive sets and then when it comes to big things like explosions etc they had to really cut back. There was one scene when a car tumbled down into a river bed and immediately it was noticeable that it was simply a toy car being pushed over. It was pretty bad for a 2011 sci fi film.But all that aside, Timberlake does rather well for his acting ability and the story is good fun. It is on par with the likes of Equilibrium, however Christian Bale is a far superior actor.I gave it a seven because the concept was what carried the movie. There are many bad things to say about this movie really, the ending was drab, the father did not convince you at all that he was one of the richest men on earth, the chief of police was a slimy un-likable character that was very poorly casted. The 'ghettos' in the film are hardly ghetto's whatsoever.

"Premise lifted from 1975 short story by Lee Falk ""Time is Money""","I had a Deja'vu reaction when seeing ""In Time"" trailer and subsequently the movie. It isn't a direct lift of the plot but certainly of the premise of Lee Falk's ""Time is Money"", published in 1975. Lee Falk died in 1999, so probably there is a reason why there hasn't been a challenge to this from his quarter. Since he wrote The Phantom and Mandrake the Magician comics, he is well known enough to not be just laughed off. Couple that with the publish of the short story in Playboy in 1975 should be enough evidence to at least get a writing credit as prior art. His estate would have to challenge it though. Great that the story I remembered fondly got a good treatment never the less. Hopefully he will get credit where it is due.http://tinyurl.com/cowbxvz",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great vision pi**ed by poor casts and script.,"The story was great, concept was great. This could have been a cult, a legend. This was such a great concept. But what we get is a great vision poorly executed. Casts were poor. Justin Timberlake just couldn't do the justice for the role. And the script was terrible, terribly poor. No character development whatsoever, no explanation why Justin could fight like Jason Bourne, with utmost confidence, no development of story, and no character development on the villain played by Cillian Murphy, when i saw him persistently and passionately chasing Justin, i was just waiting and waiting for him to step-up to the story where he turned into such a character, till i found him dying an UN glorified death. Pathetic. Throughout the movie i was just thinking, what if, the role was played by Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington, trying to chase down the established system and bring it down on fury. But what i was seeing? A cute boy Justin Timberlake focusing all of his energy on stylish run and poor acting executing one of a great concept, he couldn't just present the fury, the action, the revenge, the charm. Throughout the movie he seemed subdued by the supporting casts. Cinematography was awesome, sets were awesome, all of the original ideas of 'different time zone', witty dialogs like ""out of time"", ""i need some more time"", ""i need some of your time"", ""time is all i need"".

"In Time, it Delivers","What you will be handed is: A fresh spin on a dystopian-bound future featuring the concept of time--literally prolonging the expiration date of your life--replacing the value of money.A good serving of drama; they don't just go all adrenaline on this concept. They focus on the reality of human struggle how there's almost no hope for the future if you're living on the edge of paycheck to paycheck. Or, on the other hand...what does life feel like when you're earning and freely enjoying all the coveted time and wealth in the world that the whole world is suffering over? Some moments in this movie will punch you cold-blooded and it hurts.Great life-or-death situations. Since the clock is always ticking in this movie, the suspense never dies when someone's life is on the line and the suspense has been some of the most unnervingly close calls I have seen in a while. The accompanying action is decent, but nothing too impressive or never-before-seen.Okay acting. Cillian Murphy and Vincent Kartheiser really had the best performances, the two leads were just okay, yet fell flat on an often basis.A plot that can be steadier. The pacing works well, though the tone doesn't maintain it's level all the way through, it does in the beginning, but not the middle and end. Some humor is thrown in but it doesn't work well. Some scenes try to have that fun, pump-up-the-music bad-boy action style and that has no flow or belonging either.A guarantee that you will do some of the thinking and drawing some of your own conclusions. Some motives/outcomes feel under-explained though. But most importantly, the writers didn't go through the hassle of explaining how the clock and all the complimentary commodities work with your body, but I commend them for skipping out on it. Don't worry about the past calculations, worry about the present effect. Go in preparing to accept a challenging concept, this is one for the thinkers.Overall, this was a pretty solid sci-fi movie.

you must use your imagination ....,"for this to work. In this movie, once a person turns 25, a clock starts on their arm, and that is how much time they have left. There is no money only time.

Will is angry because his mom timed out and he wants to make things more fair. So he goes to new grenwich, which costs a lot of time to get there. By this time, the time police are after him because they think he killed the guy whom gave him his time. Will wins big at poker and is invited to a rich guy's house where he hooks up with his daughter, Sylvia. The cops burst in and he takes Sylvia on the lam with him.So the rest of the movie, the two become sort of like robin hood, stealing time and giving to the poor. I guess the big suspense is will they get caught or run out of time?FINAL VERDICT: OK, but there are always too many plot holes with sci-fi movies.

Twenty minute coffee? Who hasn't had one of those?,"I have to admit, I had high hopes for this movie and wasn't completely disappointed. The basics, for those of you who don't like to read:Interesting concept. Decent acting. Brilliant action sequences.I'm sure a lot of us 70s geeks watched the trailer and had Logan's Run flashbacks, but I actually found a lot of this movie original. In a future where immortality is possible, very little has changed. ""In Time"" shows a world where time is currency and just like in our own lives-- where we never have enough money or time--many must suffer, so few can prosper. And if you have ever wondered at the human limit for digesting puns about time, this is a must see (we get it: word games make you clever!).There's lot's of plot holes and un-sciencey stuff that I'm sure the sci- fi geeks have already picked a part, but ""In Time"" is a really good way to waste two hours of your life. If you can afford it. (Oh look, it's contagious.)Like other reviewers have suggested, this movie was thinly veiled social commentary. Class warfare has taken to the big screens, and I hope no one in Occupy Wallstreet has the the cash to see it. The rich live forever, the poor die young and no one complains--supposedly, because those with time are greedy and those without it are stupid enough to think they have a shot at immortality. Apparently, only one world-weary immortal has the brains to put it together (but not the guts to do anything about it).I really hope it was time constraints that made this movie so one- dimensional and filled with deterministic culture. (Where were the bleeding-heart liberal elites? The underground proletariat intelligentsia?) ""In Time"" might understand the injustices of a capitalist system, but it's failed to portray what we have always had in abundance: good intentions.The acting was good, though not flawless. Somehow it's always surprising when pop-stars give passable performances, and Timberlake always does. Seyfried is adorable as the bored, over-protected socialite, but this role left no room for emotional depth like her parts in Big Love or Chloe. The leads' chemistry was awful and the romance left me cringing. Cillian Murphy stole every scene. Maybe it's because he played the only interesting character. He plays a justice-mad ""Time Keeper"", in charge of policing time thieves and anyone still naive enough to believe in upward mobility.With wonderful world-building and a complete lack of depth, I'm sure this movie is begging for a franchise.

Review of In Time,"Justin Timberlake is quickly becoming one of the most popular Hollywood actors of 2011. After performing in two romantic comedies (Friends with Benefits, Bad Teacher), he finally got leading role in Andrew Niccol's sci-fi movie In Time, where he has to do a bit more than just be handsome. In In Time Andrew Niccol (writer of great movies like The Terminal and The Truman Show) presents the idea of people stop aging at the age of 25 (50 years old woman is played by Olivia Wilde, God bless this technology). But everything is not as idyllic as it sounds, after reaching 25, your time is limited to only one more year, after your time expires you are simply shut down because there is no space left on the Earth. Time is a currency, a key to get everything from cup of coffee to couple of prostitutes, so logic is simple – the less you spend, the longer you live.The story is quite simple: Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) was ordinary, but exceptionally honorable Ghetto boy counting his last days and one night he accidentally got rich, at the same being accused of murder. He runs away from Ghetto, becomes a rebellious fugitive and tries to make world a better place. Oh, he also grabs attractive rich man's daughter as hostage on his way.In Time tries to be action thriller and has enough elements to be considered as such – racing cars (ugly modified, weird sounds making American muscles, I must mention), hiding, running, chasing, shooting scenes – but its social aspect rises above them all. Relationship between rich and poor, drama of both sides, different views to life (immortality and 25 years long insecure life; living free and living surrounded by bodyguards and high walls), finally, an allusion to importance of time and money in our real lives.The main idea of not aging after 25 made whole cast choice a bit limited; all the actors had to be really young, sometimes lack of experience can be felt, especially when the lead actor is not a real professional. However, J.T.'s acting was not bad, so as it was not very impressive. Age restrictions didn't prevent Cillian Murphy from showing good performance, even though he is a whole decade older than his bad guy character – Time Keeper.Besides really unique main idea, In Time sometimes might feel like a sci-fi flavored Romeo and Juliet's love story, with Robin Hood'ish elements at second half. It has interesting and believable environment, scenes are filled with catchy dialogues, which only improves atmosphere (""Will: Four minutes for a cup of coffee? Will's Friend: Yesterday it was three! Coffee worker: You want coffee or you want to reminisce?""). Sadly, this movie manages to keep interest only for the first half, later on it becomes chaotic and predictable at the same time.To end with, In Time is not a bad movie, but it probably won't make people who do not like sci-fi change their opinion. Unique ideas like this do not come very often, it had a lot of potential, but, I believe, not all of it was used. Anyway, it still remains pretty interesting new experience, when everything in cinemas starts to give sense of repeating.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Some of her shallow comments seemed appropro for her character -- yet, deep without trying. His responses, too. Delivered also within the context of his character and situation without it appearing as acting, i.e: ""Unfucking believable!"" was so dead on. Pay no mind to the reviews.

HK Neo Reviews: In Time,"""In Time"" is the type of film that transcends grip onto the audience and never let go till the final minutes. It is what you call an effective science fiction thriller that is both original and interesting. It is one of those chase movie that never stops. What makes ""In Time"" so effective is because the underlying theme talks about time and money. There is a line in the film, ""the rich can only be immortal, if the poor are dying"". Imagine living in a world where time is literally money. It other words, the time you spend alive depends on how rich you are. It all sets up an interesting premises and the casting is pitch perfect, with Justin Timberlake impresses this time around as a poor person who wants to put the wrong things right and the ever sexy and dependable Amanda Seyfried as daughter of the richest man in the world.

A great film that sadly many will not be able  to follow,"IN TIME is a modern day spin on ROBIN HOOD in Orwells 1984. Director Andrew Niccol shows a future society in which literal time is the commodity of the age, used to pay for anything and everything. Want a cup of coffee, that will be 5 minutes; it was only 4 minutes just a few days ago.IN TIME shows us just what our world might look like if everyone stopped aging at 25 and was able to live forever so long as they could afford it. For those with great wealth, time is a valued and guarded surplus; something to allow the lessers in society to have in small controllable amounts. For those in the ghetto who live day by day time is life and most would do anything get just a little more time.While the acting is on par with what you'd expect there are a few let downs but mostly due to the direction of the character and not by any fault on the part of the actor. Cillian Murphy is awesome as a Timekeeper, the 'IN TIME' verse-esque equivalent of the current day detective. His job, to keep track of time and when necessary , re-posses it.Justim Timberlak, the protagonist of the story does a wonderful job of portraying the ""live one day at a time"" Will Sallas. A 2 time 25 year old (will make sense when you seethe film) who lives life one day at a time literally. He also represents what we all would like to believe we would be if we were in his shoes, alway6s willing to give others a little more time, even those who would do harm.In the end IN TIME makes one ask What is wealth? What is living? Do we miss life in the pursuit of wealth? Some will find IN TIME unbearable because its not the Mid-fall, mindless SciFi action flick they were hoping for. Others will find it offensive and preachy since the rich and wealthy are shown to be selfish and uncaring.What IN TIME does, it does well and thats giving us a glimpse at just how precious time really is because in the real world you don;t know how much time you do have but you do know with certainty that you will not get any more if it so you better spend it wisely.If your still in doubt about IN TIME then catch an early morning showing or the matinée and save your self a few bucks.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Concept outlives the script,"In a futuristic dystopia money has been replaced with life - the moment your credit runs out you end up dead. Life as a commodity to trade had changed society into those who can afford eternity and those forced to work at dead-end, quasi-slavery, jobs only to survive the day. This order remains unquestioned until time-stricken Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is gifted over 100 years by a rich outsider fed up with the reality in which he lives. This allows Will to venture into the most expensive living zones, where he soon unravels the corrupt system created for the egotistical few. Followed by authorities led by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy), who fail to believe that someone would have gifted 100 years of life to a complete stranger, Will meets up with heir to Weis Time Bank corporation, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). Hungry for adventure and a life not dictated by fright of death Sylvia and Will create a gungho Robin Hoodesque / Bonnie and Clyde team who steal time from the rich and offer it to the poor.With a strong concept rife with capitalist and philosophical undertones, director Andrew Niccol takes the bare minimum exterior, filling it with action fluff, instead of some well-crafted idea-expansion. Tragically empty with some uninspired performances by the surprisingly wooden Seyfriend and Timberlake, the whole movie rings hollow, echoing of wasting opportunities. After some initial promise the whole story spirals downwards, playing with gimmicks resulting from the base idea, instead of exploring the possibilities it offers. Lacking any clever observations and fronted by two leads with absolutely no emotional pull, ""In Time"" dissolves any initial interest, making it forgettable drivel not worth the time credits spent on it.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining Justin Timberlake film,"In Time (2011) starring Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, and Olivia Wilde was actually a pretty good movie. This movie has a very interesting plot and very good acting. Justin and Amanda has great on screen chemistry together, and Olivia really does do a great job as Justin's mom. This film is also written well and has really cool looking visuals. This movie can be enjoyed by any teen or adult looking for a fun, entertaining, visually stunning good time. The romance between the two leads was very real and authentic looking. Matt Bomer also appeared in a small cameo here, he was nice to see, even though his role was very small. There were some scenes that drug just a little, but luckily they were far and few in between. The costume design for the film is also well done, same goes with the makeup and hair styling. The action sequences are pretty fun and well constructed. 7/10 for In Time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One in the eye for the rich,"In Time is an interesting premise - set in an Orwellian, dystopian future where everyone only ages up until they're twenty-five then stays that way (why? We don't know). Also, once they hit the big two-five they only have a single year left to live! (why? We don't know that either). Anyway, the year you have left is displayed on everyone's left arm by a green digital clock that's constantly ticking downwards. Instead of earning money from your job etc, you earn time for your arm-clock (why? No idea. You just do).Justin Timberlake is an average Joe who works hard in the poor area where everyone is earthy and noble, while at the same time being horrible exploited and put-upon by the evil rich people, who have years worth of time on their arms in a different district (some of the evil rich are so evil that they're also British, making them doubly evil).Justin Timberlake saves the only rich man on the planet's life and he gives Justin a load of time on his rich before he kills himself for no real reason at all. Now Justin has enough time to head to the rich zone and get back at all those nasty rich people who like nothing more than watching poor people run out of time and die.Luckily, Justin doesn't have to do it alone. No sooner does he arrive in Richland (or whatever it's called) does he bump into Amanda Seyfried, who happens to be the only woman in Richville who also believes that poor people shouldn't be made to work until they drop and then laughed at as their corpses rot in the street. Throw into the mix Cillian Murphy's cop trying to hunt them and you have a chase movie where Justin continually gets away from the authorities because he can beat everyone up at once (he just can). Also, he can drive a car better than the police force (or 'Time Keepers' as apparently they're known), so he does have the edge.The idea behind 'In Time' is nice, but sadly it's poorly executed, with a clunky script and riddled with one-dimensional characters and clichés. Lots of things don't really make sense (like the way you can 'steal' someone else's time by basically just going near their arm (?). The good characters are amazingly good and the bad ones are bad (because they're rich).The film tries to be really hip by replacing all words that should be 'money' for 'time;' it thinks it's being clever by putting these sorts of things in, in an attempt to appear really deep and meaningful. Sadly, unless you're a massive fan of that working class hero, Justin Timberlake, it's actually pretty shallow. You've seen it all before and you've seen it better.Just remember - all rich people are bad. Justin Timberlake is good.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Very cool idea, but didn't quite deliver","The concept for this movie is so cool and very original. I remember having pretty high expectations for it when I first saw it, and I left feeling a little underwhelmed. I'm not sure what it was, but it just didn't quite deliver the way it could have. Such a cool concept could have had Inception level success, but it just wasn't executed to its full potential. That being said, there is plenty of action, emotional moments, and I genuinely did want to keep watching to find out what happens next, even if I wasn't totally enraptured.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
appalling nonsense -- a perfume ad stretched out to two hours,"This is a shockingly bad feature film, considering the budget and talent involved. The sci-fi dystopia it portrays is unbelievable and poorly explained. The economics of the world are downright absurd. But even if you don't care about that, it features an endless parade of actors doing their darnedest to be non-emotive and devoid of personality.The premise seems to have been used as an excuse to put together an ensemble of pretty 20-somethings, who are working hard in every single scene to be sultry and jaded. Sultry and jaded are okay for a 30-second perfume ad, but they don't work so well to keep us involved through two hours of sci-fi clichés.Cillian Murphy's relentless policeman is perhaps the most inadequately explained character. We're never provided with any motive for his determination to prop up an outrageously inhumane and plainly unsustainable regime -- except perhaps that, well, he's been doing it for a long time now, so, I guess he, like, feels some sort of force of habit or something.Timberlake and Seyfried have shown signs of real talent in other productions. But any such talent has been carefully hidden under wraps here. Like everyone else, they come across as sullen, slow-witted and drab.The second star was awarded only because the movie makes some amusing use of various locations in Los Angeles -- with a weird cameo from the casino in Monte Carlo -- and because I liked the way the production designer enjoyed remaking ugly cars from the '70s as high-style vehicles of the future.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pretty good movie, and not as bad as the critics think it is","Critics these days have gotten pretty stupid, and clearly do not understand this movie. It's as if they read the book ""Animal Farm"" and started nitpicking things like ""Animals can't talk! Animal's don't know how to cooperate! Animals can't wear clothes! This book sucks! Huge plot holes!"" without realizing that it was actually a metaphor/criticism of communism. Similarly, In Time is a metaphor/criticism of capitalism, but instead of animals we have good-looking 25-year-olds. There, I explained the movie for you dumb critics and I hope you can enjoy it now.The movie is an extremely good criticism of capitalism. It hits all the main points, and is pretty relevant for 2011 considering the recession and the OWS protests. Besides the intellectual goodness, it looks good as well. All the actors are good looking and sharply dressed. The sets and props are retro-futuristic. The special effects are good. Dumb critics seem to nitpick one scene (which I won't mention), but what they should be paying attention to was the glowing green tattoos that appeared all over, because I'm pretty sure those were all CGI, which was probably complex due to all the green light scattered.So overall a pretty good movie. Compared to recent movies I have scene, I would say that this was much better than Transformers DotM or The Adjustment Bureau, both of which sucked terribly, but not as good a X-Men First class, which was very good.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Intriguing Idea Held Back By Niccol's Direction & Lack Of Chemistry,"In Time, a film set in the near future where the currency has been replaced with time. I didn't expect much from this film as seeing the posters with the leading actors didn't aspire much confidence. After watching the film, elements of the film did surprise me but some of it was disappointing as expected.Andrew Niccol is a director who also writes his films. His films are at times a hit or miss but most of them are creative and imaginative, which is something I get excited for when I come into his films. What held my interest in this film is the concept of the currency of time and how it has divided the world to the rich and the poor. This idea, to me at least, is brilliant as it allows Niccol to create tension as time becomes more precious than ever. The first half an hour of the film, dealing with the life of the common man in the ghetto is so fascinating that if the film stuck with this direction then I would have appreciated the film much more. There is a particular scene involving Timberlake and Wilde which was one of the strongest moments of this film, the tension was high and it put me on the edge of my seat hoping. There is a storyline in this film about Will Salas' father and it just felt a little too forced and unnecessary.Niccol's direction is an area where he has let me down. Niccol has changed the tone and direction of the film within 30 minutes of the film. It starts of as a day in the life of the common people using Timberlake's character as the example, making the film feel like a survival film with the villain being time. The film then changes it's direction to a Bonnie and Clyde mixed with a Robin Hood agenda, which is also interesting but suited for a sequel or a separate film of it's own. Also the climax is very similar to a moment that happened earlier in the film but the earlier sequence was executed with more flourish than the ending which was very disappointing. If Niccol just stuck with the tone of the first half hour then this would be much more appreciated from me.I'm not sure if the budget has set the picture back but I felt the visuals was lacking, in the rich time zone in particular. This would have been a visually spectacular film, even the ghetto doesn't look very frightening. In Time has a setting that is very similar to a film like The Hunger Games, and yet Gary Ross was able to vision a beautiful and advanced city.Oh Roger Deakins, why couldn't you make this film look spectacular. Deakins has done the cinematography of many films that I love but yet here, it feels like he's not even trying. Not sure if Niccol's vision held Deakins back but this film feels so generic and bland that it brings the film down. Dialogue driven scenes where characters are just inside a small room, Deakins at least get some great shots like for example when Timberlake and Bomer were sitting alone in a room with the light coming in from the window, sharing each other's lives.Craig Armstrong's score was blended in within the scenes and doesn't become a force of it's own. As I watched the film, I didn't notice a lot of his score as I was too fascinated with the concept of the film and the life of the citizens in the ghetto.The acting in this film is sub par and some casting choices were poor. Timberlake is the main example of poor casting as I felt he is too attractive and distracting. The chemistry between Timberlake and Seyfried was fine but Seyfried, being the better actor, shows more of her skills than her partner. When the partner in crime scenes started to roll, their chemistry became a little better. The supporting cast was also good in their roles, in particular Murphy and Kartheriser. Murphy can play a decent villain but the film's script, being filled with one-liners, makes him seem a little corny at times. Kartheiser is a great actor, I particularly enjoy his work in Mad Men and he pretty much plays almost the same person here. His acting feels classy and smooth, which makes his role entertaining to watch. Olivia Wilde and Timberlake had decent chemistry but I think it would have been a little more effective if they replaced Timberlake with a stronger emotional core.The premise of the film is exciting and has ambition to become a sci-fi masterpiece but it is held back by Niccol's jagged direction, boring production design, and sub par chemistry between the leads. It is still worth a watch for the idea alone as it is a fresh take on the sci-fi genre and also the film's setting feels more relatable to the current conditions of our economy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Life in the USSA,"I just saw ""In Time"" again for the third time or so, and it's my new favorite movie. It's hard science-fiction, much harder than most. The future doesn't look like ""the future"" at all, but more like the 1970s. The cops drive 1970 Dodge Chargers, not goofy electric golf- carts. There are phone booths, no cell phones, and the Internet is not a major force in anyone's life. No one is emigrating to Mars, as in ""Gattaca (1997)"" -- also written by Andrew Nicol -- and there are certainly no star-ships, and no space aliens. The single technology that has gone forward is medicine, and that life clock thing, naturally. ""No one dies; no one gets sick."" That's the thing that makes it ""hard"" science-fiction; it resists throwing a bunch of stuff on the wall, instead holding tightly to its premise.Because of the immortality-with-a-price premise and the 1970s action-movie styling, comparisons to ""Logan's Run (1976)"" are unavoidable. Whereas ""Logan's Run"" envisioned a future where we got everything we ever wished for, only to see it wind down, ""In Time"" envisions a sort of stagnant future that one rarely imagines in a movie, not even obviously dystopian, just stagnant. This is what I love about the movie: it's not really about immortality at all, but about Economic Fascism. In the movie, people have jobs making widgets, making just enough to live day to day. Prices are methodically inflated so that no one gets ahead. There's no upward mobility whatsoever. It's like ""1984"", except Economics (with the help of that clock thing) does all the work of the secret police. It's a metaphor for our modern post-2008-crash economy.This movie reminds me a bit of ""The Island (2005)"", which I also liked, a big difference being that there's no ""secret"". The characters in ""In Time"" tacitly consent to their situation.This is a fast-paced, beautiful action-adventure science-fiction film with a brilliant premise, destined to be a cult classic.

Great Idea....needed more money.,"In this age of Producers and Directors finding old stories, and re-done stories, and anything and everything under the sun that already has an audience, it was nice to go to the movie theater and gamble with my money for once. I think Woody Allen once put it in one of his scripts, when he has Joe Mantegna utter, ""Tom ""so-and-so"", HUGE star...he's in town doing a sequel of an adaptation of a remake."" And, then we get to the real and very delightful fact that there are STILL great minds in Hollywood that can give us something new to look at, and something else to hold our imagination while they dump a load of Social Drama all over us, and take another social engineering, soap-box position, even when that position (contrary to how Hollywood normally does it) stands in direct, middle finger up, f-you status. No 'smuggled' messages here.IN this FILM. TIME is MONEY. Literally.Everyone pays for everything with time, and time is what they earn when they work and even when they gamble. And, it is all recorded in a glowing bank account right on your arm, with checks and balances constantly shifting to the whims of whatever events bring about the next turning point in the film.I was surprised about just how intelligent and able Timberlake has become as an actor. This film is basically a movie for teenagers, but there is some of that Penny Marshall, Tom Hanks ""Big"" type wisdom in this film, and I think in the hands of a better screenwriter and art director, this could have been as big of a movie franchise as the Matrix, and the jury is still out on that. The story left much to be desired, because most of it was cliché. But, I couldn't help soaking up this new world, which was funny, because there wasn't much IN IT. No lavish sets. All the cars appeared to be the same, except for JTs sequence with a James Bond car, and there was a lot of kissing in the film, which we don't see that much anymore, and not quite in this way. Amanda Seyfried was, eh, so-so, and Vincent Kartheiser and Cillian Murphy proved yet again WHY they are actors working in Hollywood: They sell the role. See it, but don't get too hung up on it. It is a movie that could have done so much more in the hands of the right Producer, and still, it made it out to the audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

But around once Amanda Seyfried is introduced, it becomes more of a film with her and Justin Timberlake on the run from a few clumsy cops (lead by Cillian Murphy) and her wealthy youthful father.The climax ending is anti climatic and it seemed too easy how they were able to steal the million years time capsule from Seyfried's father.In Time has the very stylish and lavish feel of an expensive clothing or fragrance commercial.

Waste of an Excellent Concept,"""In Time"" has an excellent concept that can be potentially as attractive, thought-provoking as the multiple layer of dreams concept in ""Inception"". What would the economy and human life would be, if time itself is the currency? Imagine: ""live quick, die young"" could be literal: you can spend your allocated life-time for a luxury but short life; another example: earn/spend ratio, the ratio between the time your earn for doing a job and the time you spend on that job; a job with earn/spend ratio more than 1 is an ""immortal job"", in theory you can live forever because your time will never decrease... I can go on forever.However, few of these interesting topics about time currency is interpolated in the film. It is a shame to see such good concept wasted; In Time is nothing more than a cliché boy-girl- run-away-fall-in-love and car-chase-gun-fire movie. The time-as-currency concept is merely elaborated as a count-down-to-zero-and-you-die mechanism to create feel of intense. It works for a few times in the beginning. And then it is used a lot. So it is cheap.And the acting? Justin is handsome but that has nothing to do with the film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well it had potential...Still not a bad movie,"This movie had a intriguing and interesting concept going for it but it just wasn't executed that well. It's still not a bad movie and is worth seeing at a dollar theater but unfortunately it just didn't reach the potential it should have reached. The ending is what really irritated me, the movie builds and builds and goes in a very cliché and stupid direction at the end. Some parts just doesn't make any sense and there is some obvious plot holes that is just so noticeable. Movies like this can have a far-fetched premise but it should at least have somewhat of a believable direction which this does not. Again it's a wasted potential and could have been better, maybe if they at least made it a bit more believable and had better dialogue. Still it isn't a terrible movie and I didn't really regret seeing it and it isn't a complete waste of time.

"Great Fresh idea.. but,","The plot has already been broken down thoroughly by others. It was really a unique and clever idea that I had not seen in a film before, but...Sadly, Timberlake in this role, just didn't have the charisma or charm needed to pull it off. There were parts that a smile, wink. or glint was needed... I felt like - a Clooney-Pitt-Ryan Gosling-like Actor, was needed.. but I DO think Timberlake is a charming guy, but just not in this film.So overall it lacked ""chemistry"" ok yes
that ""magical glue""between the leads that keeps you watching their sparks and sparkle- and I don't know if it was the directing or if Timberlake didn't have it in him to pull off some of the witty dialogue, unspoken, subtle sexy moments . perhaps he bit off more than he could chew on this one. The movie was in his shoulders and it slipped off a bit.Still JT pulled off the action and running for sure.. worked hard, and I'm giving Amanda +10 for running in 22"" heels!

"Hey, it's Occupy Wall Street the movie","With just a little sf concept — time is money, becomes money is time — this movie highlights income inequality and global disparity between the haves and have-nots in different zones.Perfect timing, this film hits the zeitgeist.It's also time to rewatch writer, director Andrew Niccol's other high concept sf film ""Gattaca"" with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.""In Time,"" is notable for casting and costuming and an sf film that focuses on faces and film angles over special effects.Vincent Kartheiser plays an intriguing Philippe Weis, an 85-year-old, 25-year-old time millionaire who expects to remain immortal. Kartheiser nails this with perfect stillness, those ""from time"" do everything slow, and an eerie, older than his appearance, demeanor.Don't get what the Occupy protests are about? Philippe Weis could spare his first million to ransom his daughter. ""It's nothing to us,"" his wife says. But Weis refuses. It would break the system that holds him in a bubble at the top.Speaking of bubbles, Amanda Seyfried could be cast in the film version of Scott Westerfeld's ""Pretties"" — no CGI required. Funniest line: ""We make a cute couple,"" Sylvia Weis says upon seeing her wanted poster. True! Pairs well with these reads: Victor Hugo's ""Les Misérables"" (intrigued or confused by Cillian Murphy's dedicated timekeeper character? Look for Javier the fanatic police inspector in ""Les Misérables"".), Marta Randall's ""Islands"" (which also explores how humanity would be effected by immortality), and Harlan Ellison's short story anthology ""Paingod and Other Delusions"" (Ellison said ""In Time"" was too similar to his short story ""Repent, Harlequin! said the Ticktockman"" — the time as money idea is unique, but ""In Time"" is a much more linear take — still, its a good excuse to read the story and also ""Wanted in Surgery"" from Ellison's collection).Aside from the sf conceit that places clocks on our arms, ""In Time,"" captures the harshness of institutionalized, systematic income inequality.

Police officer wear long leather coats and drive muscle cars and rich people all act like aristocrats and much more of such nonsense.But the very worst part of this movie is that their are no black people or Latin, or Asian or even vaguely European people.

I know this is a scifi fantasy movie but the only reason I can come up with why this movie features white people wearing fedoras as gangsters is because the makers of this movie consider non white people as being too threatening for the general public.

It was nothing super profound, but was a decent story about the effects of unfettered capitalism, with a twist.But the stupidity of the supporting actress wearing high heels when she knew she might run is just so tired. Guys, if you can't appreciate a movie without a woman wearing high heels, get your heads examined.That poor actress could very easily have suffered long-term damage from having to run, run down stairs, and climb a fire escape in ridiculously high heels.They even went so far as to have her run in lower heels in one scene, then when they reached their destination, she magically had much higher heels. This is to train young girls to think that they ought to be able to run long distances in heels with no problem. Talk about unrealistic expectations.The Mom running for almost 6 miles in high heels was also ridiculous. Anyone who has ever had to even walk a while in high heels knows that eventually, you take them off. The pain of running in high heels is so much greater than the pain of running on soles where the skin has been peeled off due to friction.Shame on these movie makers.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In Time: A Gripping Tale of Time as Currency,"In a world where time has become the ultimate currency, where every tick of the clock is a countdown to your inevitable demise, In Time emerges as a thought-provoking and thrilling sci-fi adventure that will leave you questioning the very nature of time itself. Justin Timberlake delivers a captivating performance as Will Salas, a young man born into the lower class, who discovers that the rich have the ability to steal time from the poor, extending their lifespans while condemning others to an early death.The film's concept is as original as it is thought-provoking. The idea of time as a tangible commodity, something that can be bought, sold, and stolen, raises intriguing questions about social inequality, human nature, and the value of life itself. The film's exploration of these themes is both thought-provoking and entertaining, providing plenty of food for thought as you sit back and enjoy the ride.On the entertainment front, In Time delivers in spades. The film is packed with action sequences that are both visually stunning and adrenaline-pumping. Timberlake, known more for his pop music than his acting prowess, surprised many with his solid performance as Will Salas. He brings a depth and complexity to the character that makes him both relatable and admirable.However, despite its strengths, In Time could have benefited from a more developed plot. The film's central concept is so fascinating that it could have supported a more intricate and nuanced story. The decision to turn the film into an action-packed blockbuster instead of a thought-provoking thriller left me feeling that the film's potential was not fully realised.Despite its shortcomings, In Time is a solid film that is worth watching. The concept is original, the action is thrilling, and the performances are top-notch. While the film's plot could have been more developed, the overall experience is still entertaining and thought-provoking. In Time is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, making you question the value of time and the very nature of reality. While it may not be a cult classic, it is a worthy addition to the sci-fi genre and a must-see for fans of thought-provoking entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why this might be my favorite movie.,"Let me start by saying that I don't like Timberlake, I still don't know the leading lady's name, though she and Ms Wilde were both admittedly superb, and before yesterday had never heard of this movie.What made this movie great was the simple and beautiful trick of solidifying each daily decision into taking minutes off your life. The connection of that simple truth when you allow it to trickle through the movie and into the real world is so profound that every thing else is just a dust jacket.There is a character early in the movie who leaves a message to us written in dust on a window, that I am having tattooed on my soul.See through this movie for what it means, not just for what it looks like. But see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Too serious for me, but an impressive movie still",Acting was awesome. It is a movie that expresses a problem with upper and lower classes. I'd say it is a critique of current day healthcare and is under the guise of a futuristic world so as to be not too obvious. Anyways. Worth watching story that reflects modern day realities in regards to medicine being expensive.It has a bit of that sci fi gloomy serious dread sort of feel to it of which I do not like. That feel that was in Logan's Run and Planet of the Apes. I don't dig that feel. Hence the lower rating.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A decent attempt,"Good premise, good acting, pretty mediocre writing and direction though. Not horrible, but mediocre. If starts out good, but it's like the movie can't decide on a plot line and just switches track randomly when ever the writer has to think deeper than surface lever and when ever they do try to go deeper it comes off hammy AF. It's a classic case of too much ""and then"" writing and too little ""therefore"" writing. This movie definitely had potential and with a better writer this movie could have been really good. 4/10 from me, but one decent script treatment could easily have made it into a 7/10 at least.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In Time Review,"what can i say. it is amazing! Andrew did such a great job filming this movie. it was action packed, a bit of romance.... it was good. if i had to critise about anything about the movie i would say that the casting could have been a little different. Cillian Murphys role as Timekeeper Raymond Leon was spot on! it was perfect! He pulled the role off so well and he was strong, confident and looks good in a leather jacket. Give him any role and he does it well. Well Done Cillian. Your an awesome actor! Amanda Seyfried role as Sylvia Weis was really good. she portrayed he character well and did a very good job. she was always strong and confident throughout the film and it was exiting to watch Justin Timberlakes role as Will Salas was OK but he could have portrayed the character better. Most people say that it was a weak performance from him and it was. he could have done so much better.All up, this was a great film to watch. very entertaining and i absolutely loved it.

There are better movies to spend your time,"I saw the trailer for this movie and found the concept to be quite original and interesting. A world where time is money and if your clock reaches zero you die, a world where rich people live forever and the poor struggle to survive.After seeing the score here I though It probably was one of those generic action movies that have a nice concept, kind of like The Island but maybe a bit better. Sadly the movie falls short in almost every way expect for its original concept. The acting is average at most, the script is bad, the is no character development and the story is boring, predictable and lack any sort of back story to help us understand, there is really no explanation as to why this ""money=time"" was implement or where it came from. I also felt that most of the time there wasn't anything relevant going on.In the end, this sadly another case of a good idea ruined by a bad bad execution. To stay honest the movie has some entertaining part and it wasn't until near the end that I started to get bored, as a somewhat entertaining time killer movie it's not so bad",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Interesting premise,This is an interesting premise that doesn't quite work. One of the main problems is caused by its premise. At 25 you start living on borrowed time and because of this all the actors have to look 25 years old which means that you get a bit of a 'Bugsy Malone' syndrome. They are mostly good actors - mostly - but this is one of the reasons in my opinion it comes across a bit flat that and the script could have done with quite a bit more developing. The Bonnie and Clyde/Robin Hood story becomes just that and it all becomes a bit messy with everyone after the two criminals. It's a shame because I like the writer/director Andrew Nicol's other work.,4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Time is money literaly in this movie. A unique concept, first of its own kind, poses dilemmas, and social messages.","Fantasy/action/future film. A unique central idea that differentiates it from all films of the genre. First, no man ages anymore, but his phenotype stops at the age of 25 for the rest of his life thanks to advanced gene modification technology. Secondly, every person from 25 onwards has life for another year, but the system has been created so that he can buy more time and theoretically live forever. So literally time is money in this film, it has replaced every currency and it is the main currency that one pays for products or services and that is paid for in his work. So on the one hand there are some who have hundreds of years, the rich class and waste time without much thought, and on the other hand the poor who live for each day literally as if it were their last and appreciate the time they have left to the maximum and therefore they are never lazy and never waste their time. Can one endure eternity? Or does man not endure so much vanity? What if someone was given many years as a gift, what he would do? Can a man change the world? A film with its own special concept that poses its own dilemmas and gives its own social messages. An extremely unique central idea that could inspire many other films or even better have its own sequel. Nevertheless, as an implementation, I would like it to have something more so that it is worthy of its own idea. Overall, however, it is quite good and is recommended to everyone as the only film of its kind.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
On the line?...,"On the performance front, I thought Cillian Murphy and Amanda Seyfried stood out with Justin Timberlake lacking the required screen presence to carry it off (IMO). I thought Michael William Freeman who had a small role as bad guy Nardin did a good job of playing a very believable loathsome thug. With virtually everyone on screen being around the same age (25), barring the occasional kid, I found this one quite odd to look at (even a bit ageist! – just a joke, honest). It's pretty well made with some great ideas behind the plot and even some great dialogue thrown in here and there but at the end of the day it just failed to get over that mark. It's not that it's a bad film, the problem is, it's just not the great film it deserved to be.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED just.My score: 6.4/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"This movie is kinda terrible, but I enjoyed every minute of it","In Time is a movie that goes back and forth between two extremes. At times it present some interesting concepts and quirks within it's core ""time as currency"" mechanic, while there are other moments that dive deeply into the ""so bad it's good"" territory.That said, the core message it's trying to convey about income inequality, while valid, is so on the nose and lacking subtlety that it makes Elysium look like Oscar bait. Even as someone who pretty much agrees with the ""eat the rich"" mentality that the movie tries to convey, simply changing the economy from being based on dollars to time is an absolutely meaningless way to do so.I'm not exaggerating when I say there is no middle ground with regards to this movie's quality. Every scene in the movie falls into one of three categories : (1) Mindless action, (2) a remotely interesting point about this society, or (3) a crappy pun about time.There are also so many logical inconsistencies in this movie's universe that you can't help but think about them. While I'd normally give these a pass in a well-structured sci-fi universe, In Time is so all over the place and randomly tries to throw hare-brained philosophical gotchas at you, that you can't help but wonder about all the other very obvious things that the movie doesn't even consider. For instance, where are all the 16-24 year olds? The movie basically forgets this age range exists, even though in the context of the universe they'd logically be the most significant group of people, as they can work but have no impending doom clock.Additionally, the movie makes passing remarks around overpopulation and also the value of older and more experienced adults, but never connects the dots between the two. Logically, you'd expect that the system would want to preserve older workers since they still have the bodies and brains of a 25 year old but with far more experience, yet it's explicitly called out that they use inflation to replace these ""elderly"" workers for younger ones.I'd really like to give this movie a pass on weird logical holes like that, but the movie explicitly implores you to think about them. I guarantee you that most of you, even if you ""turn your brain off"", will at some point ask, ""wait, what about this aspect of society?!"", and be at least little disappointed that the movie doesn't even touch on that thing.It's quite literally a movie of missed opportunies that it proudly dismisses, but that nonetheless makes it the perfect guilty pleasure film.All in all, my biggest criticism with this movie is that it frequently depicts people who have less than 24 hours on their clock and need to constantly work to survive, yet literally nobody utters the line, ""I'm living daycheck to daycheck!""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tried to be clever,"This Robin Hood story is masked in sci-fi and that is what's its major problem. It's not a real sci-fi movie.

And the arm wrestling trick was just so stupid and made me laugh in disbelief.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Average at best...,"The idea of a perfect socio-political society has been a driving theme in countless sci-fi movies, many of which take place in a futuristic utopia. While sci-fi classics like ""Total Recall"" and ""Blade Runner"" not only raised the bar for its time, these movies have also stood the test of time as benchmarks; even for this day and age. As such, there will always be movies that try to top the sci-fi genre by any means possible. ""Gatacca"" was one such film that looked at genetic discrimination and individuality, when comparing the weakness of humans with the strengths of clones. Writer-director Andrew Niccol had a lot of things going for him with the Academy Award nominated ""Gatacca"". This time around, Niccol returns as writer, director and producer, but fails on almost every aspect of this film.It is the year 2161 and humans are genetically engineered to live up to the age of 25. As this is just the early part of the plot, it is safe to assume that this must be a drastic but necessary step to curb (the current) population crisis. To sit through the remaining part of the movie, you have to suspend reality and everything thing else you may know about what makes the world tick. Taking the age old idiom that 'time is money', time is literally currency in this movie. The more time a person has, in units of hours, years, or decades, entitles that person to live that much longer beyond the age of 25. Surprised? Wait, there's more. An implant on the hand of a person displays just how much time they have left and time can also be transferred from one person to another. Salaries or loans increase (extends) time, while purchases decrease time .When a person ""times-out"", that person dies instantly. With less than two hours remaining, Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) discovers to her horror, that she cannot board a bus home due to an unexpected price hike from one hour to two hours. Not finding his mother on the bus, Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) runs down the street to find her. She times-out just before falling into his arms. From here on, the plot goes from ridiculous to ludicrous. Will learns that time is imbalanced, where rich people live longer and poor people die every day (who would have guessed!). To avenge his mother's death, Will does the most sensible thing- he kidnaps the daughter of Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) a wealthy banker, and demands a million years as ransom. As it turns out, Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) is not too fond of her father either, and becomes Will's accomplice in a series of bank robberies aimed at distributing time to people in the ghettos. In hot pursuit are mobsters known as the 'Minutemen' and a police force run by the 'Timekeeper' (Cillian Murphy).What I find unbelievable is the fact that Nicool also wrote the scripts for ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Terminal"", both critically acclaimed movies that placed lead characters in the middle of an identity crisis. Having said this, it is a big mystery as to what was going through Nicool's mind while scripting the screenplay here. I get real world comparisons that the rich will get richer as the poor get poorer, or that all the money in the world can't buy happiness or even save a loved one's life. What I don't get is how hard this movie tries to vindicate its inbuilt philosophy that only through the sacrifice of many, can a few claim the right to immorality. As that ideology is never really justified, that pillar of thought crumbles under its own weight. Then there are the plot holes. The most obvious is that if everyone is supposed to stop ageing at 25, why do most characters look well over 30? Plot holes and loose ends aside, this movie is also the mother of all clichés. Its bad enough that the very few scenes that are actually worth watching ends up as the most predictable moments in the film, corny dialogue, misplaced humor and a slight case of Robin Hood comes with it part and parcel as well. Moving on from bad to worse, Justin Timberlake is not the least bit convincing and Amanda Seyfried is eye candy as usual. Together, there is no chemistry between the two leads, so don't expect anything along the likes of Bonnie and Clyde. JT, stick to singing dude!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Somewhere a Clock is Ticking,"The thought behind 'In Time' made me want to see this movie. I usually do not find action movies worth my time (hahaha) but I found that living in a world that values time as currency was interesting enough for me to pick it up.This is the first movie that I have seen with Justin Timberlake and while he was likable as Will Salas, there was no real hook- he looked good in his tux, played the rags to riches man well and the romantic, but it came across as generic or robotic. Maybe there is room to grow here but it seemed that as the main character he failed to pull me in to his world, yes he displayed some emotion and that was what saved him in the end. He appeared tough when he needed to be, sweet and angry, sad even but all the while I was thinking, Will could have been so much more.I am not a fan of Amanda Seyfried and here she was a spoiled little annoying rich girl. One thing that really drove me crazy was something that she probably had no direct control over and that was her make-up and hair, not to mention the dresses and heals. I am sorry but do not expect me to believe that she (or anyone) for that matter can run over roofs, down dark alleys, up fire escapes in four inch heals and be okay. I mean I know this is a fantasy film, but that was just pushing it. The story between Seyfried, who plays Sylvia Weis, and Timberlake is so predictable it was ridiculous. Make an assumption in your head about what happens between the poor cute boy and the rich hot girl and there you go.It was the performances of the minor characters that held it together, though for the life of me I cannot believe that Cillian Murohy agreed to some of the dialog that came out of his mouth. I like him as villain and he did well, but it not the best performance I have seen from him.I do not really know much about Matt Bommer, but I really liked his character and the role that he played in the film and he was easy on the eyes thats for sure.Alex Pettyfer was a confusing addition but once I started looking at him like a slum lord, his character made sense.The action was well placed throughout the film and was not over done. I found the romance element annoying and on a side note it was frustrating how every romantic scene was preceded by music- a couple times I thought I was watching a bad Lifetime movie or something.The film no doubt is a message about the 'half and half not' of the universe. Time is the currency and so the more one has the more powerful and longer one lives. There is a feeling that people beg, barrow and steal time in order to live forever and that is the driving force behind the mission that Will takes upon his shoulders. Its a metaphor for out current situation and the financial crisis that his happening across the globe, but I did not feel as though I was being preached too, which is rare. There was one speech that I rolled my eyes at, but I get what the writer was getting at, it was not necessary, but then again I do not think the target audience were adult, college graduates. I knew what they were selling before the movie was half way over, I did not need the rhetoric, but I did expect it.Overall it was a descent film. The music and the make-up department was a bit over the top- do not even get me started on the makeup of Vincent Kartheiser (who played Seyfried's father). The premise was excellent, the actors mediocre and the production over the top. 'In Time' also laid the foundation for a sequel, which I may check out it I have the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Exciting, Enjoyable and Frustrating","In Time, is a very exciting movie. A thriller that has you rooting for the main characters and hoping nothing bad happens to them.

Who can I blame for this?,"I went into this movie hoping for a reasonable remake of the 1976 SF movie ""Logan's Run"". Well, that's not what I got. What I got was an unworkable premise, bad actors(or un-actable scenes and/or dialog) and extremely unbelievable situations. Premise - In a way that is not even attempted to explain, you are born with an embedded time clock that will 'go off' at 25 and begin counting down your last year of life, BUT this clock can be manipulated by 'pert near anything. So, as we find out (eventually) the poor work hard to afford a little bit of luxury, while the rich live forever. Immediately I saw that it would never work. If there was a device that interfaced with the clock, then it could be reversed engineered and THEN where would the system be. Acting - How would someone behave if your world revolved around this concept?? That thought gives my critique of the acting some slack. Since I have no baseline on how emotionally retarded the extreme classes presented in the film would be, it's hard to be too damning. But damning is what my instinct say be. Wooden, purposeless? I suppose Flat would be my best one word for the acting. Unworkable situations - Without being a spoiler, there are several scenes in the movie which are just... ridiculous. Even if I had put my brain in a jar, my butt was smart enough to see the implausibility of several scenes. I gave it a 3 simply because there were a few entertaining moments, the nice set on Amanda Seyfried, and the acting may have been inhibited/warped by the director (& screenwriter).",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"More Propaganda ""Crack"" from Leftist Cultural Pimps","If you can get through watching this in spite of it being a terribly-written script and poorly assembled movie, you will realize that this movie is just more leftist propaganda spewed from the big leftist-funded cultural media machines.The truth that centralized planning is what builds and maintains ""ghettos"" is purposefully ignored in the premise.It is not free capitalism that creates uneven playing fields (indeed, free capitalism is about the only way to ensure an even field), but instead, it is tyrannical gov't that uses the illusion of ""fair"" law to impose it's coercive and crushing will that keeps people enslaved. It does this by using 'private' business scapegoats (and/or crony partners) to cover itself. If gov't ""owns"" the businesses (either through forced ""loans"" or through threats), then they require no freely-given complicity, do they? - it is guaranteed). This situation is the true definition of Fascism (read your history books).The film touches on these ideas, but from a skewed, spun, and erroneous perspective. Furthermore, that this ""movie"" (term used loosely) ignored the real facts is evidence of it's true intent. It misleads the uninformed and ignorant in a very deliberate way.

It seemed like they were going in the right direction for a while (disregarding the holes in the plot) and then I don't know what happened, it's like it lost it's plot line, with a confusing ending too. Oh well, it was alright I guess. I'm a guy who likes sci-fi action movies but with a good story, this one started off without ANY explanation why things are the way they are and continued rapidly into the story. They left A LOT to our imagination instead of having a decent explanation why things are the way they are.

A story as old as time,"While I agree there are numerous plot points that don't work, the real aim of this film is an allegory about capitalism and greed. It has strong echoes of the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists of Tressell's book. It's a story as old as time, but one unlikely to ever time out.Timberlake is a likeable actor but I don't think he does the role justice, while Seyfried shows her acting chops easily.The film is paced well and you never feel bored or the impulse to fast forward, and happily, graphic sex is never on the menu so that's a very pleasing element.However the tension is always there just as it is in excitement sense that the film manages to make you feel. Everyone who hates capitalism will love this film. I certainly did even though like other, similar stories before it, it won't change the world.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good story,"The script is masterful, it's interesting enough and close to modern life that people who are not fans of science fiction can bind to the agenda and enjoy the movie. Dialogues are equally high-quality. ""In Time"" contains the action, tension, romance, humor, subliminal criticism of modern society and a lot of well known names from the world of film.

Plot has MAJOR holes,"Not only is the acting unemotional, the story progression boring, and the graphics/scenery lacking, the plot has terrible holes.SPOILER ALERT:OK. My major beef: Why?... Seriously. Why time? I could have been okay with it if in this world this is the way it had always been, but the story is such that SOMEONE started this time-as-money system. But why?You have the same effect if everyone is immortal anyway and you just kept money as the currency. If you want some people to live in the lap of luxury and some to be poor, just keep money and have everyone live forever. If it's for population control, why not just have everyone who wants to live forever give up the right to reproduce? What was the point in creating this very unsecure (no PIN numbers or anything?) way to judge wealth and value that actually allows someone to kill me in the night by putting their wrist up against mine? If you have the technology to engineer bodies that never age and never die, you can do it without the time limit currency. They keep mentioning that ""in order for a few to be immortal, many must die"", but I don't buy it. The fact that this was never explained and had no place in any society where this wasn't a natural fact of evolution or whatever, prevented me from getting immersed in the movie. Not that would have been easy even if they had backstoried it in somewhere.Which leads me to a summary of the other problems:* Said many times on IMDb so far, but seriously; why is it so easy to rob a bank and escape ""time keepers"" and why are JT and AS the only people who've ever thought of it.* Except in Post-Apocalyptic movies, A society set in the future should have technology that is greater or equal to the technology of the present. Why were cell phones, cb radios, stun guns (the cop seems hesitant to shoot cause it might kill someone, and there is a point where it's mentioned ""shoot on sight is against policy""), and many other technologies uninvented.* Has the art of providing security/policing a city died in the future? Why is the 20 strong group of ""Agent Smith's from the Matrix"" security guys infiltrated by JT just because he put on some shades?*Also, the film doesn't really go into the behind the scenes workings of the conspiracy they allude to. Maybe they were trying to set it up for sequels, but if you're going to put a shitty movie out there that makes it impossible to do a sequel, at least give us the meat of the story.*There are obviously those mistakes that any movie inevitably makes that are actually kinda fun to spot, such as the fact the driver went through zone 8 to get to zone 4 from the ghetto, which based on the map of the zones from the time keepers headquater is a long detour, or instances where someone should have run out of time because they weren't filled up.So, overall....it's hard to disappoint me on these futuristic movies. I'm very forgiving, but this one just missed in two many areas. I'd rather you be great in one aspect and fall short in all the others, as long as you stuck that one point. Here it's all kind of thrown together and corners are cut everywhere.ps - when JT's car flies off the road it looks like a 70s movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Chix Chat on Film - Tick Tock,"Let's see.. a film where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. What does that remind me of? Oh yea, the government. Instead of the currency being money, it is time. But in this film it all translates the same. The film illustrated that sometimes if you get too much too soon, it can lead you down a self-destructive path. It also illustrates that the less time you have, the faster you move. There is a lot of running in this film. I kept thinking that if that was me, I would have been caught by now. It also reminded me that I need to hit the gym. I think that writer/director Andrew Niccol did a really good job incorporating the Robin Hood / Bonnie and Clyde theme throughout the film. And although there was some explanation about how things work at the beginning of the film, it really did leave a lot of questions that were not answered. I guess the director did not want to waste our time (smile). I guess that I should talk about Justin Timberlake (Will Salas) a bit. Is there anything that this guy cannot do? He has jumped around film genres like a rabbit in heat. He has gone from bio-pic (Social Network), to comedy (Bad Teacher) and now a full out action star (and a headliner to boot). You go Justin!!! I still want to know when the next album drops (smile). Amanda Seyfried (Sylvia Weis) as the poor little rich girl became more likable as the film progressed. I thought that the chemistry between her and Will was well developed and portrayed. Every time I saw Cillian Murphy (The Timekeeper) on screen, it always reminded me of the nut-job he played in the Batman films. He was one dedicated cop. I think that this film did a good job in showcasing the class warfare that occurs in the future (or is that now I forget). It's really not too different from what is happening today. I do think that some of the editing was a little choppy, but that being said, I thought that the film is definitely worth the time. Although the characters spend a lot of time looking at their watches, you will not be looking at yours. The film was entertaining and I think it is definitely worth spending a little of your time. I give this film a green light (tick tock).",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant concept goes to dust due to bad performances.,"I was desperate to watch this movie from the time I had seen the first trailer. The trailer of this movie was amazing. The concept of people not aging after 25 and an age where ""time is actually money"" .The direction of the movie was decent considering that Andrew Niccol has given us gems like Truman show and Gattaca. The way he directs movies is always different and unique .One can get a different feel in every film he has directed. The action sequences were believable and well choreographed.The problem with the movie was the acting. Justin Timberlake as Will Sallas couldn't get into the skin of an action star , he couldn't get me excited about the movie like I would in an Arnold or a Jason Stathom movie. Amanda Seyfried as Sylvia Weis was decent in the role of a rebellious daughter. There was no chemistry between the lead pair. The best part about the movie was Cillian Murphy who was brilliant as the timekeeper Raymond Leon. The rest of the cast did a good job and a special nod of appreciation to Alex Pettyfer for the role of Fortis - the minute man.When it came to the story, I thought it lacked depth in characters and should have been a bit more detailed when it came to the life story of each character in the movie. The concept was brilliant but had a number of flaws which people will catch considering the acting is not that strong from the lead pair.Overall the movie is worth a watch for people who have time on their hands but nothing better to do. The concept should be appreciated but the cast and the lack of depth in story made the movie mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Poetry is Capturing the Essence of the Ordinary, the Overlooked","Usually I don't like, don't watch sci-fi. But the reviews here & elsewhere were intriguing, transcending the genre. And Amanda Seyfried usually is watchable no matter what. Dropping a dollar in the red vending machine turned-out to be rewarding cinematically.This film has been called an ""action movie,"" a ""sci-fi"" flick. What it is is an ingenious ""morality play."" Congratulations to the writer/director and Fox for greenlighting it, no pun intended relative to the embedded arm timer(s).We've all heard, ad nauseum, that ""time is money."" And that's the poetry of this production, to take that which is ordinary, known, obvious maybe, oft stated, and overlooked, and restate it in a way that captures and captivates. In this film time IS money, and therein also is its genius of concept and revelation.Is the plot perfect in every regard about which some reviewers are nitpicking? Not sure; probably not. It's not important though. It's close enough to be sufficiently provoking. And it's original, creatively so.TIME also is LIFE itself, stating the obvious. Without it, money does not matter, the old ""you can't take it with you."" And by flipping the time-is-money thing used mostly by bosses of the world as a people-prod - those who have plenty of money that others often are making for them - it hits close enough to human nature to make one think sitting there in the cinema seat, on the couch, commenting on how we value what we have, or don't have - and those who are greedy hoarders. Those who have TIME have LIFE. And since time is currency in the film's world, it shows us ourselves in an original, clever, and even poetic way - in today's cinema vernacular of guns, action, and violence.The one-day-at-a-time sub-theme was interesting & stimulating.This film is an intelligent concept staffed with actors good enough to make it really interesting. Timberlake was fine, even well cast; Seyfriend is nearly always totally watchable, and is here, too. Her make-up and hair was effective, almost subduing the Seyfriend look, while emphasizing it for a futuro effect. Good job.The '70's retro-techno-non-piston (I think) cars were a warpish concept, interesting for some kind of future world & alternate universe environment. ('70's Detroit product was America's ugly automotive nadir, opening the door for the Japanese.) However, as other reviewers have noted, the Jag car crash early in the film looks like '50's model not-so-special effects. It's so bad it seems out-of-place in a film that otherwise is slick. The money must've run out here in the real world ...Filmed with the ARRI Alexa, the digital capture uses a lot of the ugly fluorescent green and sodium orange available practicals of our real world. But it's effective, especially for the grittier parts of the action. To see how digital and available light can look superb, see Soderbergh's ""Contagion.""As for ""In Time,"" it's that rare original concept where the Hollywoodie stars & production make it work effectively & provocatively. Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Keep an eye on the time Timberlake!,"Set in the future outlook, In Time, replaces money as a source of living, authority and prestige with time. Niccol's alternate perspective on life reveals how from your 25th birthday, everything you do, every step you take and every decision you implement takes time, time which results in life or death. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) struggles through life in Dayton, waking up looking at his left forearm knowing that sacrifice or a life of stealing is his only way of staying alive. A drop of fortune, after rescuing a feeble Henry Hamilton, a man of many years who donates his digits to Will after revealing his ennui of immortality takes Salas on a small, expensive excursion to the fortuitous side of the city. Hamilton's death draws the attention of The Timekeepers led by Cillian Murphy, as Raymond Leon, who attempt to blame Will for the bereavement of 105 years of life. After passing through the zones know for being the neighbourhoods of time, Salas finds himself in the elegance of New Greenwich, a place where people walk through life without urgency as they have all the time in the world as Niccol emphasises in an artistic fashion. Here, Will catches the attention of Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) a doll-like figure, whose father plays a major role in implementing the global time market. After a short confrontation with The Timekeepers at a graceful house revelry, Will grabs the girl and makes a run for it in an attempt to even out the costs, or in this case, time.The purpose of Niccol's stylish alternative outlook on life gives the film urgency, freedom and also lucrative tones of darkness once the truth of greed is revealed as the film's progression moves along quite convincingly. The film employs countless themes as we pass through the neighbourhoods which reflect concerns of class and honour in today's global financial climate. Although Timberlake and Seyfried's impressive growth and transformations on the big screen continues, the film does endure a repetitive nature as expected due to characters trading, stealing, begging and surveying of time and the constant lack of it in most cases. One way of looking at it is to reflect how much the price of a ticket for the cinema is and to determine whether you would trade in your ""time"" for the Niccol experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good idea, terrible execution","How can a good idea be so poorly executed? The film starts with a very interesting premise: humanity, able to provide immortality, has now only one worthy trading value, which is time. Based on this you would expect to see some radical changes in human behavior, with lots of existential issues at stake. What this film delivers in an absurd device to control the ultimate human currency, a society which is pretty much the same as nowadays and tons of ridiculous scenes which cannot be believed even if one tries really hard. Characters in this film have zero depth, the story develops to more and more absurdity and it looks as if in the middle of filming they really didn't know what to do about it. On top of it acting is bad, so... what else can go wrong?I give it a 2 just because of the original idea, and I am completely lost by the current rating at IMDb at the time of writing this (6,7: did I watch a different movie or what?)",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Great Premise and Some Fun to be Had but a Lack of Subtlety and Half-Baked Concepts Hold In Time Back,"To avoid spoiling this remainder of this review completely, this movie is a huge mixed bag and I'm going to have more than a few complaints. But despite the execution, I have to applaud Niccol on the ambition of the project and putting it out there. The idea of humanity using time as currency, the implications of that, how it would affect our way of life is a bold idea and the potential of that premise got me to go see it in the theatre. I don't think the movie capitalizes on its full potential but instead of just remixing an old recipe or rebooting an existing property, he went for it here and this movie is memorable for that reason.When I think about the characters of In Time, I sigh a little. Can you imagine how much this would have worked better as a mini-series? In Time was made years before it became fashionable but being able to flesh out the world and the characters over 6-10 hours would have really made this something to watch. Will is your everyman blue collar hero that lucks into fortune when he comes across Matt Bomer's character. He knows there's something sinister afoot but he tries to improve the lives of those around him before a bogus murder charge forces him to start running. He's not given much dimension but you admire his spirit and understand where he's coming from. Sylvia is your spoiled rich girl who wasn't evil or mean-spirited but through her time with Will, her eyes are opened to what the other half lives like and she grows as a person (and more or less becomes Bonnie to his Clyde). This is all pretty typical for this kind of story it doesn't reinvent the wheel but there was potential there. If there had been more ""time"" maybe I would have attached myself to the characters more but it's pretty standard fare here.This movie was made during the select few years where studios were trying to make Justin Timberlake a movie star. Upon re-examining this movie, Timberlake was better than I remembered. I think Timberlake is solid if unspectacular, he does good work but he has to work in his wheelhouse. Tough action hero isn't in his specialty and while he's trying very hard, there's a reason it didn't translate fully. Amanda Seyfried was also getting a push at this point in time; she never really got her due. Her career reminds me a lot of Rachel McAdams (same type of arc but Rachel was more successful) where she had the required talent, she just never got the projects that would have launched her to super stardom. She's about on Timberlake's level in this, good but not great and to be fair, the entire cast is a victim of the script. Cillian Murphy is the most wooden of the three and that's a surprise in hindsight. He's the most talented actor of the bunch and I wanted to believe he's being directed to be super stoic as opposed to him just being that way naturally. Olivia Wilde is surprisingly good in her supporting part; she's always been a better actress than she's given credit for and she's more emotional and accessible as Rachel. Johnny Galecki and Matt Bomer are both good in their brief screentime and while I'm not trying to be mean, I'm not disappointed that we no longer have to deal with Alex Pettyfer anymore. I've seen worse actors but he just can't get where he needs to go in every movie I've seen him in and its too bad.In Time isn't trying to be subversive about the moral of the story or even complex in trying to hide it. While sometimes that can be brave (the Purge franchise comes to mind), this movie handles its message like its wielding a sledgehammer at a wall that needs to be smashed. I don't disagree with what they're trying to say even but this movie is ""high-concept"", its trying to build a world and develop an interesting mystery and the message isn't the subtext, it's the actual text. You also have this futuristic world but the buildings, cars, architecture are all just slight variations on what they had at the time. Let alone how Will is built up to be this amazing fighter and then you find out that battling in this world amounts to an alternative form of arm wrestling. If you also start asking questions about the rules of this world, its going to unravel quickly so if you're going to get any enjoyment out of this movie, you have to hold your nose and wade through it much like the characters are trying to.This is a short review for me but despite In Time stumbling instead of sprinting to the finish line, it didn't just fade away 15 minutes after seeing it like so many movies do. It wasn't disposable and it wasn't just a campy mess that I cackled throughout, it made me think and imagine which makes the movie worth watching. Niccol has done some really great stuff in the past (I love Lord of War, its my favourite Nicolas Cage movie) and while he's swinging for the fences here, he's hit a double to left field in reality. If you can push past the not-quite-there aspects of the movie, In Time is worth a watch and it might leave you with a couple of existential questions after it wraps.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sci-fi with a twist and a political message,"First things first. Justin has become a very good actor; he wasn't always so, especially in the beginning of his filming career. Secondly, ms. Seyfried is a very talented actress, and quite balanced alongside Justin. It's a powerful duo.The film tells the story of a future, quite dystopian in terms of life conditions, yet in a decent environment. Unlike ""Total Recall"" (both versions), with which this film has many similarities, ""In Time"" evolves around an every-day neighbourhood aka ""the ghetto"" or ""timezone"" where people live and die by the day, whereas there is another ""timezone"" of insanely time-rich people, a forbidden zone. The reason for all this, is that they have been genetically programmed to reach an age of 25 and then... good luck; they have to always buy their next day until they run out of life credits. Time is the new currency, and the rich had manage to steal time from the poor.So there's this poor guy, a street-wise, Salas, who's inherited 105 years from a man who wants to end his centennial life; he is now being targeted by the Time-keepers, a police force, that are keeping a biased balance in the lower timezones. Salas and the daughter of a millionaire fall in love and become vigilantes and restore equality amongst the lower timezones and the rich people's higher timezones.The topic itself is intriguing; I mean, who could imagine our lives being measured -in time currency? And it has a deeper meaning; man had always been superstitious about time elements and life expectancy practice -hence the hundreds of myths around immortal men and semi-gods of the antiquity. In terms of sci-fi is clever enough; we've seen all sorts of time-related topics: time loops, time travels, parallel universes, time reversing, time interrupting. But time stock exchange? That thing alone is a hit maker.As a movie, I got the feeling that it did put me inside the action and the overall environment, with a very-very well set and minimal production. Lighting, props, even distances are carefully put, so as to give the real impression of a futuristic ""but not so"" atmosphere. Both Justin and Amanda were really good together, and Cillian's physique completed the triangle ""hero-angel/hero-villain/evil's angel"". But I can't help noticing the intervention of the director who prevented many scenes from falling unbalanced, working the camera angles away from Justin's expressions, and focusing on Amanda's mostly. I'm fine with that, as long as the overall feel is OK.But it's the political message that is being surfaced, sometimes very boldly: just as it happens in the original ""Total Recall"", there is social injustice, but here the story touches the very delicate topic of controlling the masses' lives through some kind of ultimate technology or weapon that affect life span. And I found that as up to date as it could be, plus a very good realisation of a long-discussed issue, mostly driven by indie conspiracy theorists.My overall feeling after watching this movie can be concluded in this quote: this is how you can achieve a very good and clever sci-fi movie, using your imagination and means the right way.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Movie,"In Time is based on a futuristic world where time has now become the new currency and people stop aging at 25 years old and have only one year to live and are required to earn ""time"" by working or die young.The movie begins with 28 year old Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and his mom Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) making plans to celebrate her 50th birthday; they live in the ghetto and barely make it from day to day. Will has a chance meeting with a New Greenwich (the wealthy town) resident 105-year-old Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) who is tired of living. He explains to Will that there is enough life for everyone to live a long life and that human are not meant to be immortal. Henry gives Will 116 years of time and ""times himself out"". Will becomes prime suspect in the murder of Henry and makes his way to New Greenwich where he is followed by the Timekeeper aka the police, Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) and his crew. Will meets time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) and his daughter Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) at a casino and is invited to Philippe's home, Will is then captured by the timekeepers, and he escapes and kidnaps Sylvia in the process.The main theme of the movie is about getting equality for all no matter where you come from or where you live. Will was also on a mission of revenge he wanted the rich people to pay for his mom's death, Rachel died just seconds before Will was able to transfer some of his time to her. The people who controlled time made sure that the rich had lots of time by constantly increasing the cost of living in the ghetto to ensure that lots of people died. You see this as Will and his new partner Sylvia set out to upset the time zones by robbing mostly Philippe's Time Banks and giving away the time to needy people. Their efforts while appreciated seem unproductive because the cost of living keeps rising. Will and Sylvia however did not give up even with the constant threat of Raymond on their trail. Sylvia came up with a new plan to put a huge dent in the time zone; they steal one million years of time from Philippe.The acting was somewhat mediocre. Timberlake and Wilde give a believable performance, however Seyfried performance was not as strong as it could have been. The theme of the movie was in reminiscent of Robin Hood Prince of thieves where the star Robin Hood robs from the rich and gives to the poor.The lighting throughout the film was dismal adding to the suspense of the movie. The effects of the time clock on each persons' hand even babies that lit up when they were alive and go out when they died added to the importance of the theme it showed clearly who was privileged and who were not. The actors overall do a great job in representing the theme of the movie as in the end Will and Sylvia go after even bigger Time Banks in an effort to disrupt this corrupt system.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprising!,"A generous *8* for the gift to me of surprise. I was quite ready to hit EJECT from the start and this never occurred to me as I watched.Well, this is a reversal approaching epic for me.Prior to this I had absolutely no use for Mr. Timberlake.Here he is damn good -- I suspect because he was cast to type -- the correct type for him. Will he find the chops to act in later efforts?Ms. Seyfried rises to a new level in my estimation as I have not esteemed her other efforts that highly. Graced by nature with astonishing eyes and a willingness to reach beyond reason to display herself in other efforts that are merely pretty -- here we see her in transformation from the most shallow to an involvement in her character's world and neatly done.Most astonishing of all is a rather petite woman in absurdly high heels running with grace -- and you know that she had to do this over and over -- without clunking, galumphing, tripping, gashing up those knees that we see throughout the film nor apparently tearing up her feet! This is Hollywood magic!I strongly suspect that this reversal of opinion is entirely attributable to Andrew Niccol.Here we see a new take on vampirism, on Robin Hood, on Bonnie and Clyde, on the fall of the Greek Gods, Logan's Run, the Fall of Empires -- while delivering scathing social commentary.AND -- its a new twist on a standard dystopian sci-fi story.Commendations are due to all those young actors and their director who delivered maturity where it was needed and youth where that was needed. This sort of image realization is not easy to do when all your crayons are pastels around a single primary color.Can we expect more of the like from this Auteur and his cast? We can but hope.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great idea and a decent sci fi actioned,"The best bit of In Time is the central idea that time is both a currency and a date of death thing. Director Andrew Nicol is one of the best grown up sci-fi writers for Hollywood movies
The film spends a lot of tome hammering home this concept before it begins to loose itself in the last act a little.The cast is quite the star studded affair as well, Timberlake, Seyfried, Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy, Johnny Galecki, etc.It dies a decent job of world building, the politics, the effect of inflation and what people would do if they could live forever and/or knew when they were going to die.

I smell a metaphor,"Class struggle is broken down into a simplistic metaphor that wouldn't tax the smarts of a 5 year old and just in case you missed the blunt force allegory you have plenty of visuals to remind you, such as a countdown clock on everyone's arm and time zones dividing the rich from the poor. Director Andrew Niccol takes an idea that isn't clever and is just high concept and wraps it up in a generic plot about taking down the system. Justin Timberlake who has already proved himself a more than competent actor, barely registers a pulse as our thinly written lead and Amanda Seyfried looks bored and annoyed to be apart of the production. For a society that doesn't age over 25, Cillian Murphy looks suspiciously 10 years older and Timberlake can barely pass as someone in their 20s. In Time does offer some very good unintended comedy, especially at the expense of Olivia Wilde's character running out of time and Timberlake being inexplicably blamed for killing and stealing the rich man's time who personally gave Timberlake his time, even though there's surveillance everywhere. This is a spectacularly stupid picture that entertains from collapsing under the weight of it's own clumsy premise. It's made by people who all should have known better and somehow even managed to attract cinematographer Roger Deakins who used In Time as his first foray into digital cinematography.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Also I would wish more from Olivia Wilde, her performance was way too short. A good surprise was watching Johnny Galecki in a role completely different And Cillian Murphy as the corrupted cop Raymond Leon was good, that role fits him really well. The movie rhythm is way too slow and repetitive. Resuming, the idea of the film is quite interesting and original, but poorly developed by director Andrew Niccol.

The movie itself was just okay, taking on a ""Bonnie and Clyde/Robin Hood"" vibe while still remaining intriguing enough with the time gimmick and a lot of action scenes.Set in a future where time is the currency, people stop aging at 25 and then must purchase more time in order to stay alive, which gives a whole new meaning to the class system. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) is targeted by the ""Timekeepers"" (Cillian Murphy) after he is gifted time by a wealthy suicidal old man (Matt Bomer), putting him on the run as they think he stole the time.The story idea felt very original and a little trippy at times because everyone looks the same age, fathers-daughters-grandparents etc. And while this did peter out into just an okay action movie I thought about the ""time is currency"" idea for days afterwards. 11.13",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
enjoyable futuristic thriller with a robin hood nod,"""In Time"" is one of the movies that feels like reading a good novel. The beginning sets out like the utopian classics (eg. ""1984"") and explains a world that is divided between the rich and the poor where the only currency is credits of time.The story between Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) and Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) is a fight of questioning law and order that enslaves the society. Will's love interest Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) becomes the spark that ignites the fire and she sets the changes in motion we all want to see.Amanda Seyfried plays absolutely adorable. There are only beautiful people in this movie so it is no surprise Olivia Wilde appears too (as Rachel Salas). The score by Craig Armstrong is full of suspense and creates a fitting atmosphere.This film gives you hope during times of lockdown. For it is only when seeds of doubt are planted, humanity can end tyranny.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I can understand why Ellison dropped his lawsuit,"I've read ""Repent Harlequin,"" and it's nothing like ""In Time."" The wrong author sued, however. This movie is a great deal like another short story - ""Time is Money"" by Lee Falk, published in Playboy Magazine in 1975. Don't ask why I was reading Playboy as a teenager, but this story stuck with me, more because of the premise than the writing. The use of time as currency, with death when your clock hits 0:00, the super-rich with centuries in the bank, the desperation of people about to time out, the population never aging, even the manner of transmitting time - a touch, are all reminiscent of ""In Time,"" so much so I can't believe that whoever wrote this script hadn't seen the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cracker-Jack Box Morality Vehicle,"Good movie idea, but becomes pathetic with a diatribe after about 32 minutes, spewing the weary old Marxist saw, that ""capitalism"" describes the free exchange of goods and services between humans, and always results in the dread ""greed.""Why these hyper-moralistic pinheads of pictures are so preoccupied with the 3rd Deadly Sin (""Greed"") and not the 1st (""Lust"") or 6th (""Envy""), I'll never know. The motion picture morality moguls dictate a blue law that states that ""Greed"" must be avoided at all costs, and ""Wall Street"" = ""Greed is good.""In movies' beloved communism, the government sets the prices, which is instrumental in causing all the privation, suffering and murder in real communism, so it is irony that government sets the prices in this film, too, but the murderous system is blamed on capitalism.

Hopefully the movie viewers (the 99%) will not notice that the actors, the writers and the studio are trying to get into the 1% by make the others pay for the privilege of watching this dreck.Ah, it's not THAT bad.

Rad. Fun. Realistic. Pre- Steam Punk.,"ENGAGING. The story of In Time shows us what life would be like when ideas like credit, loans go too far-into the world of birth.Timberlake and Seyfried (Letters to Juliet) are timeless. I can't wait to see them work together again! From love scenes to action scenes they mix well, but not without a few artificial takes. Complimented by Cillian Murphy (The Dark Knight, 28 Days Later), Olivia Wilde, and Johnny Galecki (Roseanne) the movie soars.CLOSE CALL!!! I was almost sure all of these (previously mentioned) actors would ruin the movie but they don't! Olivia does an amazing job here, better than last two movies, and Galecki tried his hardest to blend in and it works. As for Cillian Murphy I thought he did the best here showcasing the details of his past without saying much at all. I thought he would also ruin, but he did the opposite!The cinematography was ravishing. I loved how this movie had a 40's aura, similar to Batman! It really made the world come alive. This is a great way to balance futuristic movies. You also get a ""girls with guns"", Terrintino, Anime splash blended in to everything smoothly.The directing was great. There were a lot of great running shots and action scenes!BONUS; There's a lot of great moral chatter here, and it makes In Time current, and fresh. Population control is a popular, with those of Hillary Clinton mentioning it recently, and China already enacting laws with birth. This movie will only become more important as time goes on. This is a great stand out feature that you don't find in similar movies, though sometimes the cliché moral dialogue is too repetitive.See this before time runs out!This is the best movie I've seen on this topic.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining Movie - Well Worth Your Time,"In Time was an interesting and entertaining movie set in the distant future where humans were genetically altered to stop aging at 25, at which point they receive one year of time. Then, they must earn more time to live, and, when they run out, they die.The movie did a great job of highlighting the different classes. The poor lived day-by-day and hour-by-hour. They watched their time closely and always lived near death. The rich, however, had unlimited time and resources, but they lived in fear of someone killing them for time. The movie had great social commentary - using time instead of money.Justin Timberlake did a great job as the main character who is given a century of time then becomes a future day Robin Hood, stealing time from the rich and giving to the poor. I loved Timberlake in Social Network, and he shines here as well, dominating the film with a captivating performance.Amanda Seyfried did a good job as Justin's love interest, who lived a trapped, sheltered life in a wealthy family. After being held captive by Justin, she falls for him and they face their future fighting the system together.In another excellent performance, Cillian Murphy shines as the Timekeeper trying to stop Justin's character. Although I still picture him as the creepy Sandman from Batman, he does a great job as a timekeeper living day-by-day but committed to protecting the system.Overall, the movie was entertaining, had engaging actors, and made you think about what it would be like to constantly figure out how you would survive day-by-day collecting time to survive.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Incredible Idea of a film, very Bonnie and Clyde","This film makes you look at the world on completely different perspective where time is literally currency for everyone. The idea of this film is excellent and theres a lot of the film that gets really suspenseful in certain areas but the film is loosely based on a bonnie and Clyde/ Robin hood esque plot where he steals from the rich to help the poor.Everyone has a timer but it is paused up until the age of 25 and then they stay at 25 until they die and they give everyone a year from that point forward and they have to work and pay for amenities and things they want and need day to day.

Yes, the direction is odd, the film has weird jumps, characters illogically run low on ""time"" throughout the film for no other reason than story convenice. Yes the villains of the film are so shallow that it is physically impossible to immerse yourself in them. Our heroes are a bit better on that front, but not much.

IMDb users have made poor ratings a bad habit.,"Before bypassing this movie, please bear in mind that most of the negative reviews have inaccurate information. Based on what I've read, the naysayers had trouble understanding what happened beyond the first 30 minutes of the movie. Their failure to follow the plot does not mean that the movie was poorly executed, it means that the plot was too complex for those without vivid imaginations. There were no plot holes. Many events and circumstances in this movie can be explained by sociology and common sense. In example, a vacant room with 2 seats was not necessarily staged, it was likely the hiding space for someone in a similar situation. Does the director really have to explain something so basic? Does the screenwriter really need to think for the viewer? The characters explained their motives throughout the movie. So those with complaints about fairness to the rich should simply rewind or watch it again. There is no viable excuse for rating this movie below a 7 for the plot alone. Then points should be added for artistic design, realism, and intensity.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"good, could have been great!","Time is money- our parents used to say, and in an era of declining personalization and increasing digitization some of us still bow in reverence to that farsighted thought. In Time takes this concept a step further, to a cacotopian earth, where time IS everything indeed, including money. And it is this subsumption that makes the movie distinct, and watchable.In this world, through genetic technology, everyone stops aging at 25, and from that moment they have 1 year to live. Their life henceforth can be extended if they are able to conjure up deals, trade-offs or of course, crime. And this earth too like ours can provide for everyone's need but not everyone's greed (Gandhi). Hence this presumably utopian society has similar set of problems- an even deeper rich-poor divide where the poor live in ghettos, amid a life of crime and misery, and on borrowed time, while the rich live in opulent mansions, ride swanky cars, and have literally, all the time in the world.The first scene in the movie presents one of the biggest fallouts of this theory- that a 30 something Olivia Wilde playing mother to, well, a 30 something Justin Timberlake. The people here are born with a digital clock in their hands which tells them exactly how much time they have left to live, which, when over, leads to sudden death. This is all a ploy to maintain balance in the world- ""for a few immortals, many people must die""- as one protagonist explains. In this carefully orchestrated world of orderly chaos, Justin Timberlake is Will Salas, who when falsely accused of stealing time from someone rich, starts a chain reaction which ultimately brings down the system.It would be foolish to read between the lines in this type of an alternate world movie- just how does one keep track of global time supply? How can exchange of time, and in essence life, happen just by holding someone's hand without putting into play the intent of the person (which means a criminal doesn't need a gun to kill you, just hold your hand)? And it is fairly obvious that there wasn't a lot of budget to play with in this movie.But what matters here is the amount of thought and detail that the director has been able to put into the story, which is good when it starts, mediocre in the second half, when the film resembles a version of Bonnie and Clyde, with Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried turning modern day Robin Hoods. And while there is not an iota of doubt that both of them look pretty all the time, there is a shocking lack of chemistry and interest in the movie on their part. In other words, they mostly sleepwalk through their role- begs the question, were they paid money for this, or time :PThis year has given us some grand movies- superheroes, aliens, superspys, witches and warriors, all with mega budgets, 3D renditions and little thought. But In Time is perhaps the years first science fiction movie that has some originality, and makes you sit up and cogitate, and in that, the movie is just IN TIME, before the year ends :)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"I enjoyed, but didn't love this movie","I wanted to love this movie, I really did. I enjoy the sci-fi genre so much, that I even bought Sucker Punch and Battlefield Earth, and haven't gotten tired of watching either one of those movies yet. It's pretty hard to find a sci-fi movie I don't love.This movie had everything going for it; intriguing concept, incredible cast, and the action-adventure scenes certainly weren't lacking, in any way whatsoever.What was missing from this movie was the entire back story, and at least for me, that's the most important part. I have no problem enjoying B, or even C rate sci-fis, with cardboard cutouts space ships, just as long as it has a decent back story.The entire point of sci-fi is to explore the possibilities, to answer the question ""What if....?"" Well, this movie explored possibilities, but to what? That question is critical, it's the entire basis for the story. It simply doesn't make any sense to create an answer, for a ""what if?"" question that the movie never even formulated.What I mean by this is how did the conditions created in this world come about? Obviously, medical science found a way to prevent disease, and stop the aging process, but fear of overpopulation alone is not enough of a reason for those ""time"" devices. There are other ways to prevent overpopulation, including simply sterilizing the population at birth, which certainly would be far more humane. A civilization with the technology to halt the aging process surely has the technology make ""test tube"" babies when replacements are needed, so why not? This alternative solution is so horrifying, who could possibly have come up with it, and why would anyone ever agree to it?Exactly how did those time clocks get on their arms? Was it genetically engineered into human beings? Or is it implanted in the hospital at birth, and if so, no one's figured out that they could save their children from suffering this fate by giving birth at home? If not, why?Seeing how ""stealing"" time was just fine, why wouldn't most, if not all, big strong men with 30 seconds left on their clocks, just turn around and find the closest, smaller weaker person and take some of their time by force? After all, if your only other choice is to die, it's self-defense. Who wouldn't defend themselves against certain death?Developing and incorporating a back story to explain the circumstances under which the conditions in this world were created, would have made the movie more interesting and enjoyable. For example, ""WHAT IF... there had been an impending disaster of such magnitude, that it threatened the very existence of the entire human race? One so dire, the only possibility of survival, was by having 95% of the adult population work 10 hour days, 7 days a week, keeping them young and strong to ensure they could maintain 100% production levels that were absolutely necessary to survive, etc...Instead, there's no back story, nothing to explain how or why those in power are anything other than evil despicable, single dimensional, selfish monsters, who see nothing wrong with not only letting others die, but deliberating creating circumstances to ensure they do. All just they can live forever, in the lap of luxury. They have no qualms admitting to it either.Even the evilest of villains can usually come up with better rationalizations to justify their actions than that.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sad waste of a great concept,"IN TIME is not a complete waste of your time. It's just... so... disappointing. And it was really close to being good.The writing is just awful. I can't believe this was scripted by the same person who wrote GATTACA (one of my all-time top 5 favorites). Justin Timberlake is a good actor, but there's only so much that can be done when starting from poor dialogue. If IN TIME is your type of movie, but you were disappointed, try GATTACA.Terrible production. It's supposed to take place in a slum, but really felt sterile. Like a Dukes Of Hazzard episode shot on a Hollywood back lot. The streets were too clean, everything was too quiet and organized. Just throw in a couple bland extras in the background, have the cast say ""ghetto"" a few times, and expect the audience to accept it.The storyline, particularly the last 30 minutes, was pretty much what I would've written for the ending - back when I was in the 7th grade.Unrealistic math. These people are living day-to-day - literally. It's just too close to believe. Some more thought into this really awesome concept could have saved the idea.So you start with a bad script, silly caricatures, sad dialogue, then direct the movie with no sense of excitement or tension, while not doing any production to give the movie the correct look and feel, and you have IN TIME, a neat idea, sadly disappointing.

"Worth watching, on balance, I think","I had In Time on in the background as my in-flight movie while I was doing ""stuff"" on my laptop, as I felt it was the right level of attention for a film which hadn't really received enough hype or recommendation to be really worthy of my attention.And that's about right. The film has an interesting concept, and the production spend is good, but it feels like an interesting concept that has been 'dumbed down' and not properly explored, in order to fit into a big-budget action flick.However, the day later, the more I thought about it, the more the concept grew on me. I realised that while the movie didn't really explore the concept of time as a currency as much as, say, an independent movie might, it did at least present them.... And with them, the underlying social inequalities present in today's society.If you read the film in this way - as a metaphor for current social and political challenges, such as the fact that billions of people in poverty do live day-to-day, with a bad day meaning death from malnutrition - then it's a powerful film. There are also lots of time- money set piece situations that range from fun to thought-provoking. It's just that this potential underlying message is lost in the screenplay and production style.On balance - yes, this film is worth watching for those reasons, while the big budget production makes it easy enough to watch, whatever you take away from it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

How long do you think until enough is enough?I first heard about ""In Time"" during this year's Comic-Con and was most intrigued by the premise. In this alternate reality, everyone is genetically engineered with an internal timer and aging stops at the age of 25. Once you hit 25, you would only have one year to live.

The haves, with excess amount of time, have the privilege to live to eternity. The have-nots live on a day-to-day basis and struggle without the possibility of upward mobility. Those who can't earn, beg, borrow or steal time, zero out their clock and die on the streets from a fatal shock to the heart.Will Salas (Justin Timberlake, ""The Social Network""), a laborer with a good heart, saves a wealthy man, Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer) from time thugs led by 'Fortis' (Alex Pettyfer, ""I am Number Four""). The suicidal man who possesses more than a hundred years has decided that he's done with life and donates all his time to Will, unbeknownst to him. Tragically, Will couldn't arrive in the nick of time to transfer some of his time to prolong his mother's (Olivia Wilde, ""Tron Legacy"") life.With his newfound lease on life, Will gets out of the ghetto, skips zones and arrives at the well-to-do's doorsteps, with the intention of taking away what they've got. Having the wealth of time allows him to mingle with the well-off and catches the eye of an heiress, Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried, ""Letters to Juliet"") . She's the daughter of billionaire Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser). It's like a twilight zone to see Philippe's mother-in-law, wife and daughter all appear to be the same age, frozen in time.When timekeepers, headed by Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy, ""Inception""), finds Henry's body and a security camera leads them to Will, Will becomes a wanted man, falsely accused of murder. He ensnares Sylvia, who eventually becomes his accomplice in his ""Robin Hood"" mode, in a race for survival and to distribute the gift of life to those less fortunate.Aside from the futuristic aspect, the thought-provoking premise isn't helped by a mediocre script, a pace that drags and cardboard characters. There are chunks of Bonnie-and-Clyde actions with Will and Sylvia on the run. Actions that become rather lifeless after a while. A standout scene, of all things, is an arm-wrestling between Will and Fortis, a clever way for Will to gain time.""In Time"" is stylistically entertaining, but the story could have been a lot more developed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fun, flawed sci-fi flick","The cast is pretty surprising. I've only seen ""JT"" in Black Snake Moan, but I thought he was adequate in this film. His acting skill might have been deficient with a heavier script, but that is another problem I had with the film. Amanda Seyfried is a hottie here before her Les Miserables fame, and her character was a cliché, but portrayed well. Again, the script I think failed to demonstrate her motivation and attitude change, but she did good with what she had. She and JT actually run a lot in this film and that kept me excited.The action is good, no doubt. Cillian Murphy was the biggest surprise; I liked his character the most and his motivations. Lastly, Vincent Kartheiser I am fond of for his work in Larry Clark's Another Day in Paradise and he looks a lot like his Mad Men character, but his boyish face works.The script: What did the father of ""Will Solace"" do as the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy in a remarkable performance) alludes to? This felt unexplored to me. Nice symbolism with Will Salas (sp?), which I suppose plays to the theme of time and no rest for the wicked.I felt there were some contrivances and unexplained ""BAMF"" moments like when JT outsmarts a room full of armed thugs or when he escapes the mansion in the beginning, or how they get through all the time-zone barriers after the escape, since the movie showed the process not being so easy and quite costly the first time and why JT runs his time down and I feel like most of the script wasn't fleshed out enough, and if elaborated would have made for a more satisfying experience. Most fans from what I gather like the concept more.I would agree with that, but I did like the film a bit more, so I will be buying the Blu ray for my collection as it seems to have nice replay value for the creativity and brisk pace. The concept was neat, yet I would say I was bothered more by it than the film itself. Not much detail is given to why these people are being genetically engineered (cloning?) or why society has reached that point.There is also a lack of cohesion with how the ""time is life"" system works. Is it just a visual aid for the viewer? I think not, since these people can physically see the timers on their arms, but maybe it is still just a metaphor? E.g. the rich and powerful have all the time they want, the poor and meek more of a struggle? Other minor issues like the time-arm-wrestling were vague and the actual process of how people exchange time. Sometimes people seem calm and mentally processing the transfers, like when JT gives his buddy ten years of time, but sometimes seem anxious to make sure the other person doesn't take too much time during the exchange.The pacing: The run-time of the film is pretty short, and the pacing is a bit problematic for me. It makes sense to be quick-paced, but scene after scene felt robbed to me of tension and character development because one minute the protagonists are relaxed, the next on the run. Terminator I felt did much better, and this is no Terminator, but just an example of how you can keep tension and balance quick and slow moments better. The two lovebirds don't even get a proper love scene or any real relational development. One scene he's holding her at gunpoint, the next she's digging him. Like I mentioned, Seyfried isn't given much to work with then and I wondered why she would not make a break for it from this fellow. Overall, this movie was too short.The themes: Robin Hood, poor vs rich, etc. It was interesting, and another reason why the movie should've been longer. The ending feels insignificant. This might just be a political message by Niccol, but all the more reason to keep it going. The ending felt very ""sequel-y"" to me, similar to the sci-fi flick 'Push.' The more worthwhile theme that is handled better was the aspect of time and vanity, how people get cosmetic surgery, are always in a rush, like old Brooks complains about in The Shawshank Redemption, and how the rich would ironically value time and wealth so much that they miss out on what it means to ""truly"" live and take some time to enjoy the world.Production design: The guns and costumes are pretty neat. I think I saw some AUG rifles. Murphy's coat was cool, his car design too, almost Knight Rider-esque, and was that a Shelby Cobra? Not sure, very 007-looking. The scenery/locations are perfect for the movie, being LA and whatnot. The mansion scene is on-point, and the costumes were pretty dapper. Seyfried's outfits looked nice, but that was another issue too: Where was she getting these clothes? There seems to have maybe been some deleted scenes showing these in-between moments.I'm interest in the Blu-ray version because I rented the standard definition, so wondering if the movie looks better and if I'll be able to see the color better. Nothing wowed me with the cinematography, but there wasn't too much ""shaky cam"" and nice overhead shots if I recall and a good chase scene.Better than it was bad. I was thinking a 6, but this movie is fun and surprisingly substantial. Check it out if you're a sci-fi fan. I hear that Niccol took a lot of inspiration from other films, which might bother sci-fi fans as did Oblivion. I would say this is not nearly as good as Oblivion which I gave an 8/10 but it's still not bad. I was surprised that it was not a comic book.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awful Movie,"What a waste of time indeed. That, and money. It is just a Robin Hood-wanna-be, only here Robin Hood steals time, rather than money. Everything else is the same. Robin Hood steals time from the time-rich people, and gives it to the time-poor people. So there is no such thing as money.The idea is so stupid, transferring time from one person to another by touching one another's arms, or by using special devices that store time. And how is time transferred from one direction to another, and not the other way around, is never explained. This movie undermines my intelligence.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great original concept with a poor execution,"The story's original concept about time being just about everything is a great original idea. It develops very nicely showing all the details of the consequences of such an idea.

Yet the execution in the acting parts is not the satisfactory. For me honestly, the lead role should be given to anyone other than Justin Timberlake. He acts just below okay for this movie. Not that it's a bad acting, but with a great concept like this, it should be played by someone else with a better reputation for a sci-fi. Amanda Seyfried also didn't give a good performance here. Her use of facial expression is dominantly flat. Cillian Murphy and Olivia Wilde, on the other hand, id a very nice acting job to make this movie feel alive.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Entertaining, but forgettable.","""The truth is, for a few to be immortal, many must die.""In Time is a decent action movie, but nothing more. It's enjoyable for an afternoon, but never rises above disposable entertainment.The cast is likable. Timberlake and Seyfried have good chemistry, even though Timberlake occasionally seems like a less than convincing fit. I like the guy as an actor, but he doesn't entirely match the character he's asked to play. To be fair, though, the character (Will) is like an amalgam of every positive protagonist trait in movie history. He's completely selfless, generous, smooth, charming, crafty, and seems to be able to transform into an invincible action hero any time the need arises. That would be tough for any actor to sell. Amanda Seyfried is here only to look hot running around in heels and be won over by the hero. She does a good job, but since those criteria are accomplished by her genetics, wardrobe and the script (in that order), that's only to be expected.Cillian Murphy isn't given anything more than a generic ""tough and relentless, but fair"" detective/antagonist role to work with. Vincent Kartheiser, on the other hand, is the one actor in the movie that's absolutely perfectly cast. No one can play a rich d-bag like Vincent.The main problem with In Time is that the script needed a lot more polish. The concept is cool (people are essentially immortal, but every moment after they turn 25 must be ""bought""), but the ""time is literally money"" angle could have worked a lot better if it was wielded with a bit more subtlety. Yes, we get that the rich and privileged few are ""living"" off of many.  The story hums along at first, but then seems to waver in tone and purpose. What's simple and straightforward at first eventually unravels to the point where even the characters themselves seem to not know what they're doing or why. Timberlake and Seyfried never seem to be in any real danger, and the climaxes are thoroughly anti- climatic (the fight scene between Timberlake and a bad guy in the third act is absolutely, though unintentionally, hilarious).Still, I didn't dislike In Time. It has a lot of flaws and certainly didn't live up to its potential, but if you take it as a faintly ridiculous Bonnie & Clyde-lite action movie with a thick and cheap coat of social issues slapped on, then you can have a good time with it. The movie definitely wants to have substance and a message, though, and it fails at that.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not enough time spent in development,"In Time is another undeveloped action/scifi/adventure flick marketed to a teenage male audience. In it, everyone is pretty, the male hero takes the female hero's hand as they run, there are almost no black people, the boy helps the girl escape from her controlling father as they take down society/the patriarchy, the boy has really bad one liners, and everyone looks like a supermodel no matter their socio-economic upbringing.The first thing a sci-fi writer needs to do is establish the rules, especially in a complicated world like this. This writer gets around this by having our protagonist say in the opening monologue something along the lines of, ""There's no time to explain how this all began, but we're here now so just live with it.""
Yikes.
The concept of replacing Time as a currency is unique, but poorly executed. Wouldn't farmers be like the richest people in the world then? They need a lot of time to make food. And what are the jobs of people in this world anyway? Just industrial stuff? And if everyone is so low on time, why not just go out in a blaze of glory and start a revolution or something? Also, what about hackers? Couldn't someone hack into the ""system"" and get more time that way?Whatever. Ignore all logic and just enjoy the movie, right? Wrong.I wouldn't expect much of the acting in this teenage male schlock, and I was right to do so. Either JT really needs some acting lessons or this director didn't care about making a quality movie and was aware of his audience and how many ducks to give.
But unfortunately, despite the cinematography looking sleek with the help of Roger Deakins, the direction of the camera is rather poor. Most of the movie is in closeups and the editing is rather mediocre. In the kitchen scene in the beginning between JT and Olivia Wilde (who is somehow his 50 year old mom? I don't understand how these people don't age...), when they get close together at one point there are around 5 cuts within 3 seconds just between the two of them and it's rather jarring.
The music is also unfortunately bland. The main theme is repeated throughout the movie but it doesn't change much and at times feels forced and inappropriate for the moment. Sure it's nice to listen to on its own, but in the context of the scenes in the movie it just doesn't work.A movie with time at the center of it should also be suspenseful. Literally everyone has a ticking clock on them, but it's just used as a gimmick. At one point our leads have 2:30 left before ""time runs out"" (what a tagline). It sure is a good thing that there just so happens to be a pawn shop right over here and we can sell somethings for time! OH and during a car chase, it's sure convenient that the bad guys have stormtrooper aim and that this wall the protagonist is about to drive through is not made of concrete, but rather cardboard about as thick as our protagonist's personality.But look, at the end of the day, this is just another teenage male fantasy action movie. It cost $40 million and grossed $170 million. So good for them. I guess it was worth the producer's time after all.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Justin Timberlake CHOSE this Movie,"No one seems to understand the economic and symbolic significance of this movie. Anyone who has traveled the world understands exactly what the director and Timberlake are saying.

Nothing is priced according to how much it costs to manufacture, but why? Because manufacturing costs have plummeted in the past few decades but pay rates have stayed the same, while retail prices have gone up? There is no such thing as the Free Market anymore, prices are set according to the country or District you live in.

Poor storyline,"The dumbest science fiction ever. The story line tried to replace money with the time. Everyone has an allocated amount of time for their living. They can earn, lend or borrow times from and to others. That is the whole idea of the film. The second half of the film tried to develop a concept of digital robin hood. However, the idea that totally failed in this film is that the time transaction cannot be compared with that of the money. Because, in real life, money is being safely protected everywhere but in this film, anyone could have stolen money from others without any effort. Bank robbery was so easy that just one truck could have broken a whole bank vault and stolen all the money kept. The core sci-fi base of this film along with the concept of establishing a robin hood are total failures. Except Amanda Seyfried, everyone was pathetic in their acting.

Great concept for a smooth and straightforward movie...,"This film is a blend of appealing actors, a straightforward script, and an imaginative concept, enhanced by one of Justin Timberlake's commendable performances, ensuring an engaging experience for the audience.In Time represents an anti-utopia of the city in the future in which the majority of people must work terribly to achieve more time for living because in the storyline of the movie, ""time"" has replaced money as an intermediary commodity that can be acquired, traded, and even saved.In Time portrays a dystopian future city where most individuals toil hardly to gain additional time for living. Here, ""time"" serves as the new currency, surpassing conventional money, being obtainable, exchangeable, and storable.On the flip side, there are very few individuals who do not need to struggle to survive and somehow embody the affluent class of the future.In the same way, the story of the film tries to show the fact that the wealthy class is always looking for a tool to enslave the majority of the people, and this tool, which is called ""money"" today, can change its nature in the future, but its function remains the same.In fact, the main message of this film is to introduce this tool (slavery) in the most disgusting and clear way possible and to criticize it from the point of view of the less privileged section of society.In a way, it is a metaphor for the situation in today's world...",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Review of In time,"A Fan's Review of In Time (2011)As a fan of sci-fi thrillers, In Time is a movie that I keep coming back to. It's not just an action-packed film-it's a thought-provoking experience that blends futuristic storytelling with real-world social commentary. From its unique concept to its sleek visual style, the movie delivers an engaging ride that keeps me hooked every time I watch it.A Brilliant and Original ConceptOne of the best things about In Time is its premise. The idea of time as currency is both fascinating and terrifying. It creates a world where the rich can literally live forever while the poor are forced to fight for every second. This concept isn't just science fiction-it's a reflection of the real world, where wealth inequality determines how long and how well people live. The film takes this idea and pushes it to the extreme, making for a gripping and immersive experience.Great Performances and ChemistryJustin Timberlake shines as Will Salas, a man from the poor ""time zones"" who suddenly finds himself with more time than he ever imagined. His performance is both emotional and intense, making him a relatable underdog to root for. Amanda Seyfried's character, Sylvia, starts off as a privileged young woman but quickly transforms into a strong and independent partner in Will's mission. The chemistry between Timberlake and Seyfried makes their journey even more exciting. And then there's Cillian Murphy as the relentless Timekeeper Raymond Leon-his presence adds a great sense of urgency and danger to the film.Stylish and Futuristic World-BuildingVisually, In Time is stunning. The sleek, minimalist cities and the contrast between the wealthy and poor zones are beautifully designed. The cars, fashion, and technology all have a retro-futuristic look that gives the film a timeless quality. The cinematography, especially in action scenes, is crisp and energetic, keeping the pace thrilling from start to finish.Action, Suspense, and High StakesThis movie isn't just about its message-it's also packed with action and suspense. The high-speed chases, the tense time-trading moments, and the constant race against the clock make for a gripping watch. The idea that a single second can mean life or death adds a unique level of tension that keeps me on edge throughout the film.A Thought-Provoking MessageWhat I love most about In Time is that it makes you think. It's not just a cool sci-fi movie-it's a reflection of our world, where the rich have access to resources that allow them to live longer and healthier lives while the poor struggle to survive. The movie forces us to ask, ""What if time really was money?"" and ""How much is a life worth?"" That kind of storytelling sticks with me long after the credits roll.Final ThoughtsIn Time is an underrated gem. It's stylish, action-packed, and full of intriguing ideas that make it more than just another sci-fi movie. It may not be perfect, but as a fan, I love its originality, its thrilling execution, and the way it challenges viewers to think about the world we live in. If you're a fan of thought-provoking action films with a unique twist, In Time is definitely worth watching. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I almost timed out.,"Timberlake plays a working class factory drone in a reality that is more N'sane than N'sync. The currency is time and nobody in his part of town ever has much on hand ...or on their wrist that is.When chance throws him a bone and a tragedy strikes soon after, Justin sets off with enough money to pay for his freshly righteous purpose. What his endgame is beyond dropping decades in the swankier part of town, we don't know. But the important thing is that things kick into high gear when he attends a post-casino party and literally gambles with his life. Thus comes the first hint of the ""man-of-mystery"" spy vibe that will play on and off throughout this film.Amanda Seyfried's character falls for Justin when he encourages her to swim for the first time. But the love connection really develops after he takes her hostage at gunpoint. They proceed to embark on a Bonnie and Clueless venture. Noble as it might be, it gets pretty tiresome when the robberies are interspersed with frequent make-out breaks. The atmosphere is already one of fake-grime matched with perfect haircuts, so these ""sexy"" moments have about as much substance as a luxury whiskey commercial. The danger-makes-me-so-hot-for-you posturing is so tedious that when the bad guys close in at the one hour mark, you have to remind yourself to feel sympathetic for the protagonist and his kidnapee.In Time has a solid basis for an engaging story, but ultimately can't escape what feels like a very generic genre routine. It doesn't help that it's stylistically familiar with an atmosphere that's kind of Matrix-lite meets Armani dystopia. That may sound slightly interesting until you realize that you've already seen it in movies like Inception and Looper. The genre tropes are always around the corner and chief among them is Justin's Bond-like finesse with a gun in a story that provides no explanation for him having such skill. His character is from the ghetto but he doesn't even dabble in petty crime, let alone any triggerific activity on par with Jason Bourne.The acquisition of time currency is a good allegory for greed and needless wealth. Still, the morality gets pretty redundant. Your interest may also start to fade given that none of the unethical ""have-mucho"" antagonists develop a change of heart. Similarly, none of the have-nots ever get so persuaded by the life of excess that we ever doubt their intentions or motives. Cillian Murphy's timekeeper cop is intriguing as an ambiguous antagonist who might be an ally. But his character arc is underdeveloped and one of the missed opportunities of the film.Anyway, it's entertaining enough. Certainly not timeless though. Wink!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So interesting!,"What does he conceal in himself? In fact, after watching the trailer, I had very mixed emotions. On the one hand, I was discouraged, I was waiting for the premiere to see it sooner, however, on the other hand, it seemed to me that the idea was a little overwrought
As a result, I waited for the premiere, watched it. Surprisingly, the film intrigues from the first minutes and you can't tear yourself away from it.During the viewing, I had a huge number of assumptions, guesses and various theories about how everything would turn out in the end and why all these incidents happened....
To my great regret, the ending disappointed me, because initially the film was fascinating, but in the end it disappointed. There was a clear feeling that the ending was made in a hurry, just to finish.Despite the end of the movie - I think it's possible to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The cost of living must go up so people keep dying""","I recently watched Logan's Run again and decided to give this a go since on the surface it sounds very similar, but of course, a modern rendition.And this is similar in some ways - a forever-young society with a time limit, a man being chased, running from the system and trying to destroy it...But the main cast isn't exactly great. Our main guy and his stereotypical female companion through this movie are both pretty wooden and not very charismatic, unless you're a teenage boy or girl, I assume. The rest of the cast isn't great either, nor the acting. At one point in the beginning a little girl obviously looks at the camera and the people behind it while talking to the main character.The worst issue here is that the movie is boring, and its plot - not very compelling.I would have givens point for good music or cinematography, visuals... but there's none of that here either. Just blandness.Watch Logan's Run instead, or any of the other modern movies and show episodes that copy the premise but execute things better.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Outstanding,"How do you get a society completely ignorant of social injustice- at best, or enabling cheerleaders of it- at worst, to become aware? Perhaps by presenting an allegory of it. A society where money has been replaced by time. If time is money, then money is also time. In In Time, time is the new currency. Your work is paid in units of time. You pay for things in time units you have earned. If you run out of time, you die.Just as in real life, in this movie, society is divided into classes, the haves and the have-nots. Those who don't have time are constantly facing death, having to fight for it, borrow it, steal it, pawn things for it. The ""rich"" have centuries to live, without aging past 25. They have so much time, they have nothing to do with it. They live leisurely, while those who come ""from time"" are constantly in a hurry, a life racing against the clock implanted in their arms. The poor are convinced that there isn't enough time to go around. Those who basically live in eternity, the bankers of time, so to speak, have rigged the system and allow only breadcrumbs of time to make it to the poor areas, while in reality, there is so much time, no one needs to die. They also constantly toy with the ""price"" of things so that the poor are always on the brink of dying. It's a world of hyperinflation, where prices double from one day to the next for no good reason- not unlike gas prices in our world.Salas, our main character is from the lower class and lives with his mother. On the day of her birthday he wants to meet her after work but she runs out of time and dies. Salas then meets someone who has more than a century to live. He reveals to him the secrets of their world- the corruption of society that convinces them of the lie that they live in a zero-sum game, that for someone to get time, someone else has to lose it. Before he commits suicide, he gives Salas all his time, who then goes to the rich time zone. But he is pursued by law enforcement- the time keepers who ensure that not too much time escapes into the poor areas.Unfortunately from there, In Time turns into something of a Robin-Hood type action movie, where Salas converts a rich girl into joining him in his fight against the evil time plutocrats (chronocrats?) and against the time keepers who are always on their tail.In Time looks pretty neat, stylish and bleak. The cars are spectacular, combining classic design with futuristic features. Performances all around are OK. But it's the script that shines. It's astonishing how much our language uses the word ""time"" and once time becomes the currency, many common phrases take on a startling meaning. The premise is quite brilliant. It translates injustice and makes it so much more poignant, these days that we are downright anesthetized to the sickening corruption of banks and financial institutions.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A must watch.,"What a gripping sci-fi thriller! Justin Timberlake shines as Will Salas, a poor man who inherits a century. Justin Timberlake shines as Will Salas, fighting against a system where time is currency. Amanda Seyfried's performance is equally impressive. A clever, suspenseful & timely commentary. Amanda Seyfried impresses as Sylvia Weis. Director Andrew Niccol's clever script critiques social inequality & human life's value. Visually sleek, thought-provoking & intense.

A Black Mirror episode stretched into a movie,"Great cast, pretty faces, cool cinematography, but wholly aimed at an audience focused more at visuals than ideas. What this movie lacks in depth it makes up for in the superficial.Would have been much better as an hour-long episode of Black Mirror or some other platform for commentary on the intersection of society and technology. As a standalone full-length feature film, it becomes self parody, laughable at points.It's that excessive length that wears on the reviewers here who feel battered by the political ham. All that said, the low-budget hi-tech and the main characters are fun to watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic,"I was first told of this film by my brother. I was very intrigued by the concept and after finding Justin Timberlake is the protagonist, I was sold, based on his heart-wrenching performance in Alpha Dog. I went in to the theatre with expectations of a ""good watch"", I wasn't at all prepared for how epic the films was due to the fact I had not seen a single trailer or TV spot for it. Timberlake and Seyfried are a great team and Cillian Murphy is as gloriously stone-hearted as ever. It's a very surreal world, given that everyone in the movie looks 25 or under and you are really pulled into it. The sympathy I felt for these people in the 'ghetto' who had to borrow minutes of a friend's time just to stay alive long enough to get paid was massive. Without babbling on, I'll leave you with the notion that the film has a similar atmospheric feel to Inception. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Extras required: Must be aged 25 or under...,"The central premise of this film, that time replaces money as a commodity in a world where you are zapped one year after you reach twenty five unless you have time credits to live longer, is a creative Pandora's box but it isn't well worked out here. In fact it is very poorly rendered. On the good side the atmosphere is, in places, really well expressed but somehow it just doesn't convince on a greater scale, especially the idea of time zones. There are scenes that are touchingly, almost movingly, painted, but they are few and far between. In the main the plot cannot make up its mind what it wants to be, thoughtful or obvious.And the pity is that the opening five minutes or so are very promising as if the participants really cared about what they were doing. And the best acting by far is contained in this brief period of the film. But sadly, by the end, you'll wish time had run out for all of them.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Unwatchable,"The premise of this is basically ""omggg what if time was literally a commodity"". From this half-baked idea comes a confusing, shallow and silly film. It doesn't have the intelligence to interrogate how such a world would really unfold. There are too many plot holes to name in that regard. It doesn't even really matter though - what it does is just treat time like it is the same as money: everyone wants it and almost everyone doesn't have enough of it. Everyone is hustling for it. So this is just like any other ""get rich or die trying"" film. The time stuff is not really important except as a gimmick.This could lead to an anti-capitalist take that looks at why we are all (forced to be) so obsessed with money. Except it can't do that because Justin Timberlake's character loves fast expensive cars, sharp suits, rich ladies and luxury casinos. The film idolises these things in a totally uncritical way. So it is saying ""money is greaaaaat get rich and buy cars"". While also half trying to say ""the way our society thinks about money is bad."" Except the film doesn't know how that is bad, exactly, except that it means not everyone in the world gets to drive a Porsche.Basically it is dumb and thoughtless. And conceptual sci fi can't afford to be that, because you watch it to try to understand an idea of a new world. If you are an educated adult who likes concept sci fi, I would not watch this under any circumstances.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A topical commentary on the nature of modern global economics,"A unique social critique on the current economic crisis, seen from the perspective of both the super rich and the super poor, with no particular resolution on either side of the coin, but plenty of spills and thrills in the process of toying with the metaphor.In the future, time is currency and when your time runs out, you die. In order for this to work a dystopian federation of zones house the various classes, ranging from poverty stricken ghettos where people live each day as if it were their last (literally) to the mecca of the rich and powerful where possession of hundreds, maybe even thousands of years of lovely long life are the norm.In reality, it wouldn't work, of course. But it's important, going into this film, to understand the importance of the analogy being made. The dystopia is our own world, rendered in a way we can understand without delving into the mind numbing complexities of global economic logistics. The time-as-currency idea allows director and writer Andrew Niccols to explore the effects of inflation, derivative bloating and hoarding of wealth to show how such concepts affect everyday folk in real life.The lack of any solid resolution is understandable. There really is no resolution, either within the fictional world of Niccol's screenplay or our own ailing international community where pieces of paper create the same miseries as Timberlake and his fellow bottom feeders are forced to suffer.Breaking the loop is no solution. The loop describes itself. Pumping our own economy with more cash only increases the problems we face. The problem is not the paper currency, any more than the problem within the fictional In Time world is lifespan. There is plenty of both to go round. The problem is management of a system, choices that are not just difficult but impossible to make from a human standpoint and ethically beyond any decision maker save the cold and cruel logic of a computer.In Time shows the paranoid, guarded and insular lifestyles of the super rich where wealth is relative to the price of comfort and the comfort wealth affords is undermined by fear of losing that wealth. In turn it shows us the endless struggle of the have-nots, tempered by the idea that suffering and hardship may actually define the experience of living. Something the super rich cannot enjoy within their ivory tower.Seen from the confusing perspective of the 'Time Keepers', quassi-cops charged with moderating the distribution of life-span, are themselves beset by their own subjective humanity. Missing from the equation, then, and barely explored or even touched upon by Niccol, is the presence of the technology and science that ensures the continuation of the system by sidestepping subjectivity and determining who lives, dies, suffers or lives in comfort without much care for the human condition. This is the only aspect missing, in my opinion, but doesn't reduce the quality either of the movie nor the message Niccol is trying to express. That the system we use to manage the human experience is, in itself, inhuman.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lost potential,"This film had very interesting premise with a world that based on time as the primary commodity rather than money.It was unfortunate that things were lacking in explanation throughout, leaving many unexplored gaps in the story at all levels.There was so much potential for something much deeper and existential to be extrapolated, with the untapped juxtapositions of the real world that we all know very well indeed.Aside from this major flaw in the scripting of the film, I felt the soundtrack was well put together, and good lighting too. The acting was very average, but a poor script doesn't help with that, so the cast can probably do better with an improved script.Overall, this was a very average film.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spending time wisely till the clock reaches zero.,"This is a great concept for a film, its just not as fine tuned a film as it could have been. Time being the most important thing in everyone's life, becomes a statement that was never so true.The premise is this: The characters live In a world where money is obsolete. A persons age, or the time they have to live, becomes transferable, which can then be used to purchase life's essentials. No one can live past 26, that is unless they can get extra time, either legally or illegally. The rich of course, don't have the problems poorer people do and live in a different 'time zone'. Thats where the question, can someone poor escape their existence, is pondered! I won't add more, as it may spoil your viewing.There is some fine acting from the cast in the movie, but unfortunately that doesn't include the lead. Timberlake fails to impress and his acting is not quite good enough. Strangely enough, I feel that Mark Wahlberg could have done a better job as the lead. They're both former pop idols, but Wahlberg is definitely in a different acting league.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If you've got the time, its pretty good","The acting in this movie is average, yes, however Justin Timberlake has shown us here that he has a talent for acting, I'm not saying he is a Marlon Brando but hey, he can act :)What I liked about this movie is this concept that our lives are limited by a clock, and time is a currency that if you run out of, you die. This film brings new meaning to the phrase "" I haven't got the time"".An 8 is fair I believe, you will walk out of this movie extremely satisfied that you have seen something very unique and out there, seriously its bizarre how this movie is really good :)You may leave this film with a straight face about the acting but meh, as I said, you'll like the story",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Time really is money.,"How's this idea for a scary future: everybody who lives past 25 years gets one more year to live, and all their time can be earned and spent as currency. It can be quite interesting to see this scenario and how it's implemented; if nothing else, the film does a fine job of presenting its main concept and sticking with it. There is a fair amount of action (some fighting and car chases), but nothing that really stands out. Fortunately, the film never really bored me at all.I found the story and concept to be quite interesting. Anybody who knows sci-fi inside-out may immediately draw some parallels to ""Logan's Run,"" and given the standard dystopian setup, they may find this film quite predictable (although throughout the last hour or so, I felt this was some kind of sci-fi version of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and I thought it was cool that way). With the premise, there are a lot of inherent implications that can be drawn (with some help from the script, which makes clever use of time-themed phraseologies); the film seems to occasionally hint at the audience that time is short, time is precious, and we gotta make the most out of what little time we have. It also goes on to underscore the dichotomy between the rich and the poor (as do most dystopian stories). At the core, the story has a serviceable set of characters; they're not mind-blowingly deep, but they aren't totally boring either.The film is competently made, with decent photography and editing. Acting is a mixed bag; it can be hard to take Justin Timberlake seriously, but he does have his moments. Amanda Seyfried is gorgeous and I loved watching her in her role; Cillian Murphy was pretty darn cool as the Timekeeper. Writing shows a few good strengths and a few bad weaknesses. This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. It's one of those movies that uses modern locales and props to show an ultramodern setting. Music is alright.In the end, I didn't really see that much wrong with this film. I'd recommend it as a rental for anybody who's interested.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
