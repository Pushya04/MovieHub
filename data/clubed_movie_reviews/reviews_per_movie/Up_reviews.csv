Real tear jerker opening,"Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as a young quiet kid idolized explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his discovery of Paradise Falls. Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.The first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie's lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
No one is too old to live an adventure,"This lovely film tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, a little friendly widower who lives alone in a house restored along with his late wife, Ellie, whose memory he cherishes constantly. Forced to leave his home, threatened by real-estate interests, to live in a nursing home where he didn't want to go, Carl decides to go on a long journey that always wanted to do with his wife but that life never allowed... and departs with your home through a system that he created and that makes it fly. But the journey is bound to change radically when he meets the scout Russell, eight-year-old, grabbed on his porch, an unwitting passenger on that trip.Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two brilliant directors of Pixar Animation Studio behind hits like ""Wall-e"", ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", this film has a number of experienced voices and a touching soundtrack, which earned the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl's trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.The most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present. Russell's goodness also move us, especially when he is confronted with the harsh ways of stubborn Carl, who sees in Russell a problem. Another deeply moving character is Dough, a friendly and affectionate dog who speaks through a device placed on his leash.For all these things, ""Up"" is a film for the whole family, is a film that touches us, moves us and thrills. It proves that, if love cannot move mountains can still move homes, and that no one is too old to live an adventure or fulfill a dream.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best animated movies ever made,"This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"I felt like a completely new person, truly moving","Honestly, I found the DVD of this film in my house and decided to give it a watch as I had nothing better to do. Truth is I really should have made the time before.Although I enjoy all the other Disney/pixar movies, I am at that teenage age where I mainly seek Violence, sex and gore. Thankfully my teenage boredom did me a big favour in helping what this fantastic masterpiece. This film was so fantastically deep, meaningful and moving beyond relief, as soon as I switched it off I rang my grandparents to tell them I love them.It should be made necessary that everyone everywhere should see this film and I think the world would be a much better place - it really is that good.100/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"In my personal opinion, this is Pixar's funniest and most poignant film","I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.First of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.I have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.And finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.Overall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Pixar hits it out of the park, again","I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no ""new"" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.As the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can't wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An outstanding movie.,"A young Carl Fredricksen wanted to find and explore Paradise Falls. Years later, he and Boy Scout Russell embark, transporting his house with thousands of balloons.I don't think an animation ever had such a huge impact on me, as Up did. I watched it in the cinema with my young nephews, they sat there laughing their heads off and giggling, I sat there in floods of tears.The story is wonderful, and I know it's an animation, but how nice to see an elderly gentleman as the lead. Carl is a fascinating character, he's a little quirky, he's funny, but he's heartbroken.The animation is glorious, it holds up incredibly well, and looks better than many that followed, it also sounds marvellous. It's wonderfully bright and vivid, it will appeal to viewers young and old.Up never gets tired, it's an outstanding, funny, moving and heart-warming movie.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a ""bird"" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Possibly the best Pixar film to date.,"I was luckily able to catch a screening a few weeks ago here in Houston.As an avid lover of Wall-E, I felt Pixar could never reach those heights again.I was wrong.UP's story will probably seem peculiar at first glance. An old man as a protagonist? It definitely blew my expectations. The first 5 minutes demolished every other Pixar feature just because it was the first time I cried in a theater.This just shows how much heart there is to the movie. I really don't want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.Amazing visual effects.Amazing sound.Hilarious comedy.Breath taking action.Heart.All those combined equal something special. Today's movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, Pixar is different.

"""Up""","""Up"" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us ""Wall-E"" and before that ""Ratatouille."" ""Up"" suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.The story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager ""wilderness explorer,"" has stowed away beneath his porch.The second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless ""three days"" from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: ""Kevin"" a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and ""Doug"" a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.Where the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.Muntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.The visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.""Up"" is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against ""Up"" greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that ""Ratatouille"" or ""Wall-E"" were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Brilliant, another Pixar home run","If there's a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It'd be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I'd place it among so much stellar work.Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you're looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it's the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There's an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don't feel gives anything away. It's pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn't make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you're reminded of it, but I suppose it's up to one's own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don't really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that's just simply unprecedented.I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn't really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you're better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn't take away from Up mind you, it just didn't add to it either.Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It's pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we're entitled to the entertainment. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Drag me to heaven,"UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.The one clue I can give away – because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle ""Bambi,"" this film should be a breeze.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Another Feast For The Eyes,"This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork.Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong.

It's Just a House,"Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along.

"Sweet sentimentality and raucous kiddie comedy...not always a sublime mixture, but the intentions are true","The opening eleven minutes of Disney/Pixar's animated ""Up"" are pure poetry in motion. Chronicling a man's journey in life from boyhood to married adult to lonely widower, director Pete Docter gives us images which are extraordinarily heartfelt, so elegiac in tone they should take an audience's collective breath away. Big dreamers but relative homebodies, an elderly man and his wife live happily together alone in their house until her passing. Faced with eviction, the man gets an amazing idea overnight: attach thousands of helium-filled balloons to his rickety old house and sail it through the air to a revered point in South America. But, as with 2008's ""WALL·E"", there has to be dramatic conflict, a villain, a chase, and lots of outrageous comedy in order to attract the youthful target audience. In a perfect world, there would be a Pixar effort designed to steadfastly avoid this kind of commercial pandering to 10-year-olds. Once the house reaches the next continent, the man, now joined by a chatty juvenile, encounters a rare bird being hunted by a world-renown explorer--the 78-year-old's childhood hero--who fails to live up to his newsreel notoriety. The bird only wants to get back to her babies in their nest (how's that for conflict?), while the man and his kid-companion are held off by a pack of dogs who have voice-boxes in their collars. If this isn't bad enough, at one point the dogs even prove to be flying aces in fighter planes apparently held in storage since WWI (it's a lackluster homage to ""King Kong"", and a highly unnecessary one). The screenplay, written by Pete Docter and his assistant Bob Peterson from a treatment by Docter, Peterson and Thomas McCarthy, is so wonderfully cognizant of an elderly person's traits and attachments to their beloved belongings, to then witness the central character being chased by talking dogs is an insult. And yet, because the filmmakers are wise enough to keep returning to the tale's likable principles, ""Up"" is often vastly entertaining. The detail is marvelous, often beautiful, as is the subtle music score by Michael Giacchino. There are a handful of near-terrible moments in the film which keep it from being a true masterpiece, but Docter and his team are surprisingly honest when it comes to the sentiment. The friendships made and lost in ""Up"" are genuinely touching; and, though the slapstick is noisy and sometimes mean-spirited, the overall intent to somehow steer this vessel to a happily-ever-after ending is clearly evident and commendable. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar do it again! Up soars to new heights!,"Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted 'talking' dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.Visually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can't help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.I have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.Anyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.Up is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar launches their funniest film out of their tank to date.,"What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of ""robot"" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Hands down! Best animated movie ever,At first i thought it was borin. Not gonna lie watchin it as I grew older really changed my perspective. It hit's ur feels in the right places. The soundtrack is beyond beautiful. Just an honest review coz this movie really was something special. As a kid it seemed like a normal movie but later as u grow older it changes a lot at how u see things and take things for granted. Life just isnt that long.

"Good movie; wouldn't call it great though (but you can, that's fine!).","Perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kid's cartoon. Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.A lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.A real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.Soooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.What I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it. Think about best movies you have ever seen - remember them clearly, and then ask ... was this one of them ... really?",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up is great!,Up is wonderful and well written story that is very well animated for its time. It stands out from other movies not only due to its animation technology but through the uses of character archetypes. Along some ingenious planning throughout the movie which will certainly grip you on your seat for the whole time. Each part of the story fits together seamlessly and as directed by Pete Docter who has shown potential in the past with Monster.Inc. It is no surprise that Up would not have been better. Easter Eggs are bound to be found as this is just another part of the Pixar and Disney family. It ended very gracefully with a happy ending for the two main and primary characters that lies within the movie. I am very glad that I had spent my time and money to watch this exquisite animation. It is well made and deserves to be recommended if you are seeking the adventure that lies beyond the unreachable.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Move Thee Reviews: Up Lets Me Down,"Up is a funny adventure with very well rendered and well animated 3D images. It delivers a message that we, irrespective of age, should never forget about dreams and are able to lead meaningful lives. It also sheds some light on the importance of letting go.However, some ideas are underdeveloped and puzzling. First, the relationship between the old man Carl and the kid Russell is not well-developed enough. Judging from Carl's indifference to Russell's visit, I do not feel his desire to have children after Ellie's death. Simultaneously, Russell's admiration for Carl as his role model can be further developed so that their very good relationship in the last two scenes can be better prepared. For example, what skills has Russell learned from Carl who used to be an adventurer? After watching the film, some may find the ten-minute Carl-and-Ellie love story much more touching and memorable than the Carl-and-Russell adventure. Second, Carl, who relies on an electric chair to move downstairs and staggers along with a stick, suddenly becomes so strong that he can even climb the ladder with his feet hanging in the air, which does not make any sense even in the created world. Third, it is too easy for them to ""float"" to Paradise Falls, a mysterious place, without scenes showing Carl's prior knowledge on aviation or science, which not only makes the plot contrived, but also the first-15-mintue adventure less exciting. Fourth, why and how does the bad guy invent a device helping his dogs talk with different languages? Fifth, the bad guy should be much older than Carl and I wonder why he is still alive and looks even younger than Carl. Sixth, why does the dog, a loyal animal, betray the explorer, even when he has the upper hand?On the whole, Up is interesting, visually stunning and suitable for kids to watch. However, the story and characters can be further developed. Wall-E, with robots who cannot speak, is more touching, while Bolt, a Disney animation, is funnier than this one with hundreds of dogs. Until now, my favorite Pixar film is still Finding Nemo. Toy Story 2 and Wall-E rank the second and the third respectively. The rest of my top five are The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Up, despite using two ordinary human beings as the main characters, lets me DOWN.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

My expectation was so high and I had been waiting for those good things coming to me throughout the whole movie, then found out there was nothing, no excitement nor surprise in this movie at all! Right now, I cannot recall a single thing which I think is special in this movie. A very so-so movie with a very typical Hollywood ending. There should be better story tellers out there. There should be a better movie deserves such high rating. Even my 7-year old daughter thought this movie was just OK. Very disappointed!",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up,"Pixar at its finest. A rare and unlikely duo forming what is arguably the most emotionally powerful protagonist to this day.

Pixar does it yet again.,"Yet ANOTHER incredible entry to the Pixar saga. It's just so good (as it always was for Pixar from 1995-2010). The first 15 minutes of this movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. Nobody can tell me otherwise. I think literally every single time my mom has watched it she has cried. I don't cry during movies, but there are a couple things that definitely get me close... and the first 15 mins is one of them. The rest of the movie is a super fun adventure and is one of the funniest Pixar films to date. The kid, the bird, the dogs, all great. The message the film implies is also very important and sadly true for all. Watched this so much as a kid, and can't wait to show it to my kids.

Falls,"Pixar has its first truly Disney project.It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to ""read"" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual. I think that may have also to do with Disney strategies for dealing with technology threats.The child here is Asian. That's also a market driven decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The feature that should have been a short.,"I can see the managers at Pixar sitting around a table in the war room arguing about this film, ""Listen! We need a feature, dammit, not another stinkin' short!"" At which point somebody else chimes in, ""Well, we might be able to... er... um... *expand* on that 'Up' project a bit..."" ...and so we get a movie with a good beginning and ending--both of which tug at the heartstrings--and a long, completely unflattering middle that casts a shadow over what might have made an excellent short. The characters we meet during this middle section are so over-the-top, and their motives so bizarre, that there's just no identifying with them. We quickly lose sight of the plot line that got us started on our adventure (or stop caring about it) only to be surprised when we rejoin it shortly before the credits roll.Anyway: See it once, but don't expect to feel any attachment.

When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives.""Up"" is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. The first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder Carl after losing his beloved Ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like ""Wall-e"" or ""The Incredibles"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Up – Altas Aventuras"" (""Up – High Adventures"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar's gone crazy....,"...is the first thing I thought when reading the synopsis for Up. An old man borrowed with life attaches hundreds of weather balloons to his house to fly to South America. Along the way he meets up with a young boy scout, a giant colorful bird and a talking dog.Seriously if I hadn't heard this movie wasn't being done Pixar I would have brushed off the movie completely, thinking it nothing more then a stupid, childish animated movie with one too many fart jokes. Even after hearing that Pixar was attached to this film, I still thought the movie would failed.....oh boy was I wrong.Up is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's takes a crazy premise and makes it deep, confronting and oddly relatable. Makes otherwise annoying and one dimensional characters deep. And makes the audience look on in awe one minute, laugh out loud the next and then cry their eyes out finally.There certainly is something to be said about a movie which can make you blubber like a little girl 10mins in only to do it again in the last 20mins.

An 'Adult' Pixar film.,"I just want to say that although I thoroughly enjoyed this film in many respects, it is not for children. It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.I would categorize this movie as a romantic comedy/action thriller for adults had it NOT been an animated film. As you may have heard it is nothing from what you would expect in the commercial previews. However, it is pleasantly unexpected. Had I known a thorough synopsis through the commercials, as some films seem to give everything away in a 30 second preview, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much.The movie touched my heart and as one reviewer said ""I began crying in within the first five minutes of the movie, and I'm not much of a crier."" Well, I certainly concur.This is a great movie for lovers, perhaps those going through a tough time in a relationship, or newlyweds. For children, however, they will most likely utter the words that my niece did, ""It's not funny."" If you have children that are easily entertained, patient, and can sit still through nearly any movie, take them along to watch with your significant other, if you can. Otherwise go with your partner, a close friend, or even yourself.

"Good, but not Pixar good","What I like about Pixar: they generally cover each of these levels: 1) the setting 2) the story, 3) the characters, 4) drama, 5) humor, 6) visuals. In the case of Up, the humor was not at all on par with previous Pixar releases. But the biggest problem was with the setting of the story, i.e. the world they create. In Monsters, Inc they could invent anything, because it was a fictitious world. In Toy Story, the toys could do anything, but the humans were generally bound to the same physical laws as the rest of us. That's where Up makes a gigantic misstep. The main character is rendered very realistically, visually, but does the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn (running pulling a house... excuse me?). Where did the talking dog collars come from? The villain is portrayed as a realistic human, but it makes no sense that he might (living in the rain forest, alone) invent a talking dog collar. He's an explorer, not an engineer. This was clearly just something Pixar pulled out of their ""funny ideas to stick in a movie someday"" jar.

"Solid Pixar movie, but not there with the greats","Toy Story. Finding Nemo. Wall-E. Based on its pedigree, it is not unreasonable to go into a Pixar movie with high expectations. However, Pixar's newest film is a disappointment compared with its past efforts. That being said, a less-than-expected Pixar movie would not be construed to mean that UP is a bad film. It's good, but not great.Carl Fredrickson (Edward Asner) is a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). His friend and future wife Ellie, is also a fan. Together, they plan to go to Paradise Falls, just like their hero. However, circumstances prevent them from doing so, and after Ellie's death (and the inevitable future of a nursing home), Carl gets his chance. However, he has an unexpected stowaway: a Wilderness Explorer (think Boy Scouts) named Russell (Jordan Nagai).The film works, I guess, but it's plagued by a number of problems. FIrst and foremost, it has some logical deficiencies. The premise of ""Up,"" a senior citizen traveling to South America in his house lifted into the sky via thousands of helium balloons (the size of balloons that one would get at the zoo), requires a sizable suspension of disbelief. I had no problem with that, or with any unbelievable acts associated with it (such as a senior citizen and a boy who couldn't be more than 10 pulling the house by themselves). I did think about them, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt. However, I was not able to ignore the film's handling of the villain. I couldn't understand why he did anything that he did in the film (I'm treading carefully to avoid giving away anything). The villain acted in ways to service the story. This severely hurts the film because it runs with the idea that didn't work in the first place.More importantly, it fails to really connect with the viewer. Pixar films like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" worked because they established a connection between the viewer and the characters. ""Up"" tries, but ultimately fails to do so. The film is all about adventure, but except for one scene, the film failed to get that energy flowing through me.At least the voices are good. Edward Asner makes a good Carl Fredrickson. He acts exactly like a cantankerous old man, complete with the cane and arthritis. However, he does grow a heart. Newcomer Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell. Russell is an energetic young kid, but he has a tendency to talk nonstop. Carl finds him irritating, and the dialogue is hilarious. Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Charles Muntz, the famed adventurer, and that's all I'll say. The best vocal work goes to Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog. He's hysterical. If a dog could talk, I'm positive it would sound exactly like Dug.I won't stop you from going to see ""Up."" It's fun, but don't expect another ""Wall-E.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Squirrel!,"Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.Ed Asner voices the character of Carl Friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. He also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer Charles Muntz. All this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewer's backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. Threatened with eviction to an old people's home, Carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 helium-filled balloons and drift away to Paradise Falls in South America, which was the dream destination of his late wife. Things don't go quite to plan when Carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of Russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his 'Help the Elderly' badge to become a senior wildlife ranger.Beneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that it's OK to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself (Not quite sure I'm inclined to agree when I'm stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the A428 or washing the dishes, but I'll let that one go). As Russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, it's the small stuff you miss when it's no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars.The film looks incredible, almost to the point that you're drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guy's chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered Muntz's guard. It isn't really intended to be an out-and-out comedy – it certainly isn't simply out to get as many laughs as it can – but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite it's essentially emotive subject matter. Definitely worth an hour-and-a-half of anybody's time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Even trailer made me cry when he goes up mountain alone,"Even trailer made me cry when he goes up mountain alone. For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Let's stop congratulating Pixar,"'Up's' plot-line plays with the Pixar films' cross-generational appeal by having an oldster and a kid as its main characters. It's a buddy picture about the voyage of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a 78-year-old widower, and Russell (Jordan Ngai), a chubby eight-year-old Asian ""Wilderness Explorer"" who wants to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge. The movie ""teaches"" us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment. His wife Ellie (Elie Docter) was a childhood playmate who dreamed of emulating an explorer named Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has found a prehistoric bird in South America's Paradise Falls plateau. They never go very far. Ellie, alas, can't have children. One day when they're both in their senior years she falls down and shortly thereafter dies. Fredrickson has had a career as a balloon salesman.The film sketches in the couple's life as sweetness and smiles, yet hints at a world of disappointment symbolized by Ellie's ""adventure"" scrapbook, which was never filled. Poor old Fredericksen won't move to a retirement home even though his little house is now surrounded by a vast loud construction zone. The demeaning practicalities of aging are depicted as something to escape from -- magically. When Fredericksen strikes an agent of the contractors and gets branded as a public menace he's somehow legally mandated to the old folks' home: this is the moment when he flies away, taking his house with him, with Russell a stowaway.There's no doubt about the exhilaration of an aerial escape, or the charm of the bond that develops between the old man and his dutiful, plucky little sidekick. But Up gets into deep trouble wit the arrival of the dogs, dozens of them, with electronic flashing collars that enable them to talk in squeaky (or sometimes deep) voices, in various languages according to what button you push. Forgive me, but I didn't buy it, and I just didn't see the need. Mr. Fredericksen is sold to us initially as a pretty feeble old man and so the strength and vigor he develops in South America is hard to accept. There's something to be said for a story that ends with the awarding of an explorer scout patch for assisting the elderly. All Russell really wanted to do was help the old man across the street, -- or even just across his lawn.I want to love Pixar films. Their animated features have moved from strength to strength. 'The Incredibles' was energetic and smart, 'Ratatouille' was witty and sophisticated, and 'WALL·E' wastranscendent and moving. Alas, Up does not live up to that standard.The house of Pixar has been declared triumphant in the field. Denby of The New Yorker heralds Pixar animations as examples of ""moral fable"" and damns the old Disney ones as mere ""psychological fables"" marked by ""cloyingness"" and ""malevolent overtones."" Well, Up is full of cloyingness and weirdness, and the latter part of its adventure has its fair share of malevolence. Up is a hugely overblown fantasy whose point is lost in endless violations of the laws of biology and physics. Pixar has its ups and downs, features different writers and directors, and to typecast them is dubious. What they have in common is a technology and a look. The look is mainstream, as is the sensibility. If you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous, you'll go to French animations like 'Persepolis' or 'Fantastic Planet' or F'ear(s) of the Dark;' 'The Triplets of Bellville' blows away the similarly dark American film 'Coraline.' Eastern European animations have a fresher look. The world of Japanese anime is rich, fantastic, and frequently very adult or sexual; it seems to capture the original, fantasmagoric world of comic books better than American comic-based films like the Batman franchise. Likewise graphic novel films like 'Frank Miller's Sin City' go far beyond the tame confines of Pixar or Disney. An adult animation like 'Waltz with Bashir' is in another league.It's a bad start for 'Up' and not a step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you're forced, as you may be, to watch 'Up' in 3-D. The glasses, on top of your own, weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed images with the planar levels they create are as flat and fake-looking as your grandmother's stereopticon slides. This Fifties movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic specs is unconvincingly heralded as the great new technology. It didn't do much for the creepy 'Coraline,' the fascistic 'U2/3D,' still less for the slipshod 'Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,' and it only detracted from Zemeckis' watchable 'Beowulf.' 3-D is supposed to look incredibly real, but even granting this dubious claim, why use it for 'Up,' which flaunts its unreality? Its digital figures are like painted toys. Its Paradise Falls looks unabashedly like paper-mâché rocks and fake foam. The Pixar images pop out at you without the effect of 3-D imaging, the colors are brighter, and the experience is more absorbing. Why not let us use our own imaginations?There's some thrill of adventure in this movie, and certainly the titillation of swooping flights and dives through space, as well as the time-honored animation scare of teetering on a precipice, and going into free fall only to be magically saved. But this, compared to the best Pixar films, gets lost in its gimmicks at the cost of a meaningful tale. Of course a travel yarn is just one thing after another anyway, and there's' no harm in an adventure with the moral of a good deed attacked to it. But that's just what it is, though: attached. And how much richer were the worlds of 'WALL·E,' 'Ratatouille,' and 'The Incredibles'! 'Up' has less to offer to adults than they did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent graphics wasted on a mediocre plot line,"UP is not what I expected, and that is not good. The production values were excellent and the characters even seem to be well developed. However, when the film was about 2/3 finished I totally lost interest. So did my grandson who I took along to see it! (I allow for the fact that the film was not aimed at retired old men!) Others have pointed out the plot holes and nonsensical features (dogs talking through electronic collars? Why not just give them voices? After all, it is a cartoon!) But I think the thing that lost me was the total absence of purpose. One reviewer philosophized that the movie teaches the importance of dedication to a task, even if it takes your whole life. Well, I suppose it suggests that, but the same point could have been presented with a much more interesting plot. I had thought my 5 year old grandson, at least, would enjoy another PIXAR popcorn-ball of fluff. Instead, I think he really only enjoyed the popcorn I bought for him.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Up,"The five brains of Docter, Stanton, Lasseter, Peterson & McCarthy, put out yet another heartfelt and moving, family-fun adventure film! They incorporated a lot of emotional notes, with some great laughs! The first act is the best first act Pixar has ever put out! It gets the audience connected and invested so fast, by using detailed flashbacks to set up a sentimental montage; making us truly care for our main protagonist, Carl Fredrickson.Carl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner, had the most pronounced character arch, being a character you truly cared about the whole time, despite his negative attitude half of the time. He brings a lot of mature wit to the film, dishing out the harsh truth at times. Russell, voiced by Jordan Nasgai is a loud, yet optimistic & charming character, that had great merit. He may have gotten to be a tad annoying as the film proceeds, but he is a fantastic addition to Carl. Charles F. Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer, is our main antagonist. He really wasn't anything special, or unpredictable; he just served his purpose at a surface level. Dug, voiced by Bob Peterson was nothing but a fury enjoyment at first, but ended up having great character development, and a respectable place in the film. Kevin is just one of those animals, Pixar continues to throw into films, that they try to make important. Kevin was better than most animal additions, but I didn't truly care for his reason, or his character at all.The cinematography and animation created this very vibrant and colorful film. The animations were beautifully detailed, along side the breathtaking backdrops and scenery.Although Up has a lot of entertaining moments, it doesn't come without a few bumps in the road. Even though the opening act is one of the best we've seen from Pixar, it's really hard to keep that pace up for the whole run time. Up does it's best to do just that, but does slack in some areas. With Pixar, they create these mental obstacles that you need to be able to overlook, and in Up's case, it has a few easy nitpicks. I had no problems overlooking some obstacles, but they incorporated a lot of stretched out abilities, with the leeway they were already granted. Another strange thing they did was create a few counteracting tones, trying to be poignant at some points, but silly throughout most of the film.Overall, Up is one of Pixar's finest, and belongs in the top ten!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Come Fly With Me,"As a kid Peter Docter fantasized about being able to drift far away when he found himself in difficult, social situations. The future director often hoped that his childhood home would somehow lift off the ground and fly him to a happier place.An idea Peter Docter then turned into a movie. ""Up"" follows cranky widower Carl Fredricksen, who uses helium balloons to transform his house into a homemade airship. However, just as a violent storm carries the airborne building to South America, Carl discovers that he's got an unexpected stowaway.Unfortunately, not everyone at the film company was happy about Peter Docter's idea. Many worried that people would have a hard time accepting a grumpy old man in the lead role. It took the director weeks to convince his bosses that the audience would probably perceive Carl Fredricksen as a nice old relative instead.And he was right.

It showed the devotion of a man fulfilling a dream of his deceased wife and revealed growing friendships among an irritable old man, a rambunctious child, and a talking dog. The story line was very original, filled with both humor and sadness, from the hilarious talking dog to the heart wrenching story of the widowed cranky old man.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good but not great (A little surprised by all the superlatives used on this film ),"Up was definitely a good, quality movie. The visuals and landscapes were very bright, defined, and full of wonderful detail and description. Easily the best aspect of this movie, story-wise, was the early montage showing Carl moving through life from a young child, to marriage, older adulthood, up through the death of his wife. Though you didn't know this character too well at this point, you felt for him rather deeply by seeing his life progress, start to end. This flow of life from childhood to old age is an immediately identifiable aspect of the movie. Anyone with a depth of personality and a reflective side, can identify with this. It is Film-making at it's best. We all know the feeling. The vibe and feel one gets when at weddings, graduations, funerals and any place at which one can be witness to the fast flowing nature of life and the reflection that naturally comes with such moments.Unfortuntaley the rest of the film did not live up to the emotional weight that this scene created. The movie took turns for the inane and silly, without enough in place to ""ground"" it to the worthy beginning. The bird Kevin was sort of random and odd, as was the talking pack of dogs. These 2 plot creations would seem to be mainly geared towards the child audiences that any animated film is sure to garner. The weight and meaning from the beginning was lost in these campy moments.Carl's hero, Mintz, as an aged, obsessed, evil, egomaniac seemed to be out of nowhere as well. It appeared to be like something out of a week-day cartoon. The movie again lost its direction and focus during these parts, particularly as Carl was attempting to get his house over to the falls. Once you make it within eye sight of the falls, you're there! As the film ended, some emotional, weighty moments did occur, culminating in Carl's friendship with Russell and the pictures shown during the end credits. There were not enough of these moments and too many moments that went for the ""silly"", specifically scenes with the dogs, the birds, and, Mintz.I definitely understand the affinity for this film, yet I do not feel, when taking into consideration the loss of focus and random/silly moments in the film, the drive to describe this movie as one of the best Pixar movies of all time. Ratatouille, Wall-E, The Incredibles, for starters, were all more complete and quality films with more of a consistent flow, from cover to cover.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Adventure is out there,"Young Carl idolised explorer Charles Muntz (who somehow looks a lot like Kirk Douglas) and his discovery of Paradise Falls somewhere in South America.

Now Ellie has passed and Carl is a grumpy old man living alone, hounded by property developers who are bull dozing the neighbourhood and want to see him in a retirement home.Carl has tied his house with loads of helium balloons to float to Paradise Falls. He manages to take with him, an unwitting boy scout Russell who was just helping out an elderly person for a badge.Both find adventures including a rare bird, talking dogs and a fallen hero. More importantly Carl finds a yearning for life as he hangs out with young Russell who himself is freindless.I ended up viewing this film as my wife took our kids to the cinema to watch this and upon her return she told me that I would end being like Carl went I am older. I guess it is a roundabout way of telling me that I am a grouch!The film starts with a segment of Carl and Ellie from childhood to old age. It is the junior Carl who is shy, slightly awkward, a pace or two behind the frenetic and energetic Ellie. As life goes on, they could not have children and it is Ellie who slows down as they get older and she passes on, leaving Carl on his own.It is all about Carl rediscovering that zest for life and having that adventure he and Ellie dreamt about all those years ago.

Up 2009 Review,"""That might sound boring ... but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.""
Up has to be the most over hyped Pixar movie.First off let me say, the main theme for this film is so good it practically became Pixar's own theme, it's so beautiful.The first 10 minutes are the peak of the film. Lovely, emotional, and surprisingly mature. After those 10 minutes I don't really care for it anymore as it descends into goofiness.I found Russell to be an extremely annoying and unlikeable character, (ironic that I used one of his quotes), but I do also really like where his character ends up.Then we have the dogs, I pretty much despise everything to do with the dogs (Dug especially). I found them used mostly for comedic relief that wasn't needed in the first place, and they serve no larger purpose to the story other than henchmen for the villain.The villain never clicked with me either, his character seemed overly aggressive and evil for no rhyme or reason.And then we have Kevin, who singlehandedly saved this film. Her design and personality was just what this film needed. They should've just used Kevin as the comedic relief instead of the dogs in my opinion.Up very much conflicts me. There are parts in this film that are super beautiful and touching, then we have parts that are overly goofy and unneeded.Up does have a really nice story, (though mostly forgettable), an iconic score, and of course great animation, it's honestly a good movie, but I feel like the stuff I didn't like heavily outweighed the stuff I did like.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A lovely dose of Pixar magic!,"What makes Up so great is that it is rooted in such grounded and relatable human emotions. This wanderlust in all of us. This desire to experience things, see the world, live life to the fullest, and to do it with someone we love. All of this makes Carl a very relatable character and one that we can connect to almost instantly. Russell is a bit annoying at times and is there to appeal to the younger audience, but I grew to love him over the course of the film.The central idea is just pure Pixar genius and so full of magic and joy. I defy anyone not to crack a huge smile when that house starts to float. The plot is pretty standard Pixar, following the usual formula and with similar themes. It's very enjoyable, with a great pace to it and a terrific arc for our protagonist.As ever with a Pixar film, the voice performances could not be better. The animation is just breath taking. Some of the cloud animation could have been real, it is just so well done. The use of colour and sound in Up are also magnificent. It's just such a joy to look at.I do think this film is *slightly* over hyped, but maybe that's just because I was over 10 years late to the party watching it.Yet another Pixar gem!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Believe the Hype,"Going into this review, we've all heard about the first ten minutes of this movie and how no one will escape them with a dry eye. Some of us might have heard that this is Pixar's crowning achievement, surpassing the likes of ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"". Regardless of the buzz surrounding ""Up"", the film remains, quite simply, one of the finest animated movies of recent history, if not of all time. Yes, the first ten minutes are extremely compelling, and I have never seen a movie achieve its exposition so well in such a subtle way; it's something beyond remarkable. The life of Carl Fredrickson is played out to show the love he shared with his wife, Ellie, and how they had some big dreams that never quite came true. The rest of the movie is a beautiful testament to how love and the spirit of ambition take new forms as life goes on, as Carl befriends Russel, an enthusiastic young scout, Dug, a talking dog, and ""Kevin"", an inappropriately named tropical bird. The way this film tackles heavy issues like loss and grieving is so profound and yet simple enough for any audience member to understand. There's enough laughs to keep the kids interested, enough touching moments for adults, and an amazing sense of adventure for the kid in all of us. I can't really name a favorite movie, but if someone held a gun to my head and forced me to decide, this would certainly be one of the first to cross my mind. Absolutely essential viewing.

'Up' is another example of how Pixar digitally manages to build stories and characters full of humanity and sweetness,"Co-written by directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson from a story created by them alongside Thomas McCarthy, Up begins with an absolutely moving sequence that, in just a few minutes, depicts the beautiful love story between Carl Fredricksen and Ellie, from childhood to old age. With an extremely elegant narrative economy, this introduction portrays, almost without any dialogue, the routine of a couple who, dreaming of a trip to South America and a house full of babies, is forced to adapt to reality as they the difficulties and disappointments of everyday life get in the way - and when this sequence comes to an end, not only has the film already won and moved the audience, but it has also established, in an incredibly efficient way, the motivations and personality of the interesting protagonist.Pixar's brilliance, by the way, can already be seen in the confident and intelligent way the narrative is conducted: aware that the intro would likely immerse the audience in a melancholy atmosphere, the filmmakers immediately break the mood with a small visual gag, when Carl , getting out of bed, cracks his spine while trying to stretch his body - and the contrast between this brief moment of humor and the sad scene that came immediately before already establishes Up as a film capable of oscillating with talent between pain and joy.And the drama of ""Up"" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other.With a technical refinement typical of Pixar productions, Up represents the studio's first foray into 3D technology - and it is not for nothing that the film already begins with a metalinguistic joke by displaying ""archive"" images that, through the retreat of the camera, become reveal as scenes projected on a cinema screen, establishing a link between that audience's plunge and our own on our respective big screens. That said, directors never use 3D as an end in itself, using the resource only as a complement to the action - and so instead of relying on objects that seem to jump towards the viewer, Docter and Peterson prefer to deposit their energies in the beautiful production design, as when conceiving an airship whose conventional exterior ends up surprising by housing an internal environment whose narrow corridors end up opening up to impossibly wide spaces. Likewise, the look of the characters is an attraction in itself, from Carl's square face, which contrasts with his impeccably round nose, to the villain Charles Muntz (Plummer's) physiognomy, clearly inspired by Kirk's unmistakable face. Douglas. (Also, notice how the protagonist's beard starts to emerge over time, in a careful detail that serves as a typical example of what separates Pixar from other computer animation companies.)Each character in Up is a class in character building. Carl and Russel are, respectively, the maximum characterization of the grumpy old man and the electric child. Even though these ""reductions"" are clichés, in the skillful hands of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson they become the springboard for two lives separated by many years of experience that gradually converge into a ballet of dialogues and small revelations that he is capable of. Soften the most rigid hearts. Before Scout Russell's arrival, Carl symbolized castration. Carl's old age, at the beginning of the film, is represented by a negative look, of disability and decadence. Carl is grumpy, stubborn, no longer has as much physical independence and does not want to interact socially. The cane and the heavy glasses he carries are symbols of old age and growing physical frailty. In addition to losing his physical and mental vigor, Carl also finds himself facing the loss of autonomy to choose where he wants to live, since he is practically expelled from his own house. The difficult interaction between you and the boy turns out to be permeated with a lot of learning. It is the daily life with Russell that makes Carl change his way of looking at the world and allows him to get the bonds of the past to be able to experience the adventures of the present.An explorer, the boy has the strength and energy that Carl no longer has. He is, in a way, the opposite of him, and reminds Carl of the feelings he had as a child. If Carl symbolizes decay, Russell is the potential, the growth. In an original way, it is Russell, at the height of his childhood, who helps Carl to find his place in the world. The film raises the question of the relationship between the exchange of knowledge between the generations that are at both ends of life. The interactions between Carl and Russell allow both characters to mature. This exchange of experiences promotes an enormous identification with the public and awakens the viewer's memory for the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren or the elderly and children in general.We also have other very pertinent criticisms. The expropriation of Carl's house, made unwillingly by the huge construction company, criticizes the contemporary, capitalist world, which prioritizes profits and sees in the widower's house only a space to increase the building he intends to build. When looking at the space and seeing only good ground for the work, the businessman denies the entire life story of Carl and Ellie, the way they rehabilitated the place and transformed the abandoned building into the family residence for decades. Residence is, therefore, a synthesis of life together.The house has a very strong symbology in the plot: the walls of the house witnessed the whole relationship, from the first day of the meeting - when the two played together with aviators - until the wife's last days. The imagination here is what ends up saving Carl, who uses the skills of the profession he had - he was a balloon salesman -, to literally make his own home take off. The rise of the house by the balloons represents a double solution: on the one hand Carl manages to protect the house as it is, protecting it from the interest of those who wanted to demolish it, and on the other hand, it manages, from within its comfort and space, also fulfill your dream. The house also represents Carl's love for Ellie, which did not end with his wife's death. Taking the house to South America also means, in a way, transporting Ellie to visit the longed-for place of her dreams and to honor her. The character's entry into the new phase of his life can be summed up by the moment when he manages to detach himself from the house, throwing away furniture and other memories that proved his resistance to the past. The new, here, is only possible after Carl learns to deal with the memory of what was left behind.And the drama of ""Up"" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars' characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other. But not everything is perfect. What bothers me the most about ""Up"", is really the forced use of talking dogs, with them flying planes or sitting playing cards. But it also needs to be playful and it is a movie for children too, so I understand the purpose of such scenes and in the general balance it does not harm the drama or detract from the merits of the adventure.We also have other obvious problems, which is a pity - and the most disappointing of these concerns the unimaginative way in which the directors conceive the ""locations"" of the film: if we could initially assume that the Paradise dreamed by Carl and Ellie would prove to be a breathtaking place, so we are forced to realize that it is nothing more than a rocky and lifeless environment, wasting the chance that the feature film would have to dazzle us visually (and, in this respect, Up is one of Pixar's most bureaucratic jobs ). As if that wasn't enough, the relationship between Carl and Russell sounds schematic, made even more artificial given the confusing and clichéd way the script portrays the problems the boy faces with his father. And what can I say about the fate of the evil Muntz, who follows the same beaten path as so many other Disney villains?In fact, despite all the atmosphere of adventure and fiction present in the narrative, above all ""Up"" is a story about moving forward and building simple moments with important people. We often seek the grand, but the simple can be the essential that is often not valued, or invested. Up maintains Pixar's tradition of using its light stories to address surprisingly adult themes - and here perhaps the studio attacks one of the most difficult of them: the expectation of the human being in the face of their own dreams and loss. In trying to fulfill what he had promised Ellie, Carl is obviously seeking to recover the closeness he had with his wife, as if reaching the Paradise Falls (meaningful name, this) could bring some kind of comfort to his loss - and by stating that his loneliness and his pain remain unchanged, the protagonist has no choice but to continue living.Joining The Tomb of Fireflies and The Lion King on the list of animations capable of bringing adults to endless tears, Up - is another example of how Pixar digitally manages to build what most filmmakers contemporaries fail to create with real actors: stories and characters full of humanity and sweetness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""I have just met you and I love you!""","When Carl was a little boy, he was fascinated with the daring exploits of Charles Muntz, the famous explorer. Then he met Ellie, and she shared Carl's passion for adventure. They had a long and happy life together, but now that Carl is alone, he doesn't want to do anything but be a grump. One day he meets a young scout named Russell and his life changes; maybe Carl has one more adventure in him, after all.I'd heard this animated film was touching, and sure enough, ten minutes into it, I was reaching for a tissue and sobbing. The movie deals with love and loss, and adults who have experienced this may well get more out of the film than children will. It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would. Christopher Plummer is the villain who's not really very menacing at all. The little boy, Russell, is a bit annoying in his helplessness and naiveté, but Dug, the dog is so adorable that I would see the movie again just for him.While not quite as memorable as Pixar's ""Wall-E,"" this movie will leave you with a smile on your face and a lump in your throat.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but not great","I don't know, Up is very, very good, but I don't think it's quite great. Of all the Pixar movies up to and including Toy Story 3, I'd say the only movies I like less than Up are A Bug's Life and Cars (the latter of which is easily the worst). But the third worst movie of Pixar's first 15 years is still a very good movie, which I think really speaks to how great their initial run of movies was.I think what holds it back a little for me is that I don't find it as emotional or moving as most people. I can appreciate the opening is sad, but it's never really moved me or made me personally sad, which is strange, because the tearjerker Pixar scenes usually get to me (like the Jessie flashback in Toy Story 2, the opening of Finding Nemo, and all the stuff intended to be sad in Inside Out). Other minor flaws? I think the villain is a bit weak. He has little to no redeeming or understandable qualities, beyond ""he's crazy because he's been stuck in the jungle for 60 years."" The way he comes across as okay and then reveals himself to be villainous like three minutes later just feels so awkward to me. Also, while I appreciate the music and the way that main theme changes throughout, I don't really like the theme to start with. I find it kind of grating, even if it technically and thematically works.Where this movie does shine is in the animation, the humour, and the bond that forms between the two main characters. All the stuff with the dogs is great, too- I know that's the part of the movie that's most obviously aimed at the kids in the audience, but it's still the part of the movie I love the most.The story is told well, and the voice acting is all good too. I just don't find it as moving as most Pixar films, I think the villain is a bit weak, and I think it has one of my least favourite music scores of any Pixar movie. But it's still good- it's solid and entertaining, just not quite great, in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It was too sad,"I guess, there will not be too many people who'd agree with me. But that is what I really think. In general, I was really upset. I'll even say that I waisted my money and time, because I payed to get sad, while there is enough of terrible things in this world. I was going to see an adventure and comedy but I saw a blue story about unfulfilled dreams. If you remember a movie 'What dreams may come?', I have the same feelings after this one: this world is unfair. I'd say that this movie is good for kids - it will teach them some generally good characteristics. And movie wasn't funny...it was cute and nice...and heartbreaking . Someone can say, that it is a sign of a good quality movie, when it touches your heart. I agree with that, and sometimes it can be too much of touching. If it had less sad parts but with the same story it would be better.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Delightful,"The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.The last time I went to see an ""3D"" film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.Within the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those ""Cross your heart"" promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.My wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.And all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.The audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the ""too young to even enjoy Dr Suess"" generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Families should ""Catch Up"".","For starters, I would like to apologize for the summary description I gave this film (I couldn't resist the chance to use a pun). Now that I've said that, lets cut to the chase; Up is your average Pixar movie...and if you're not familiar enough with Pixar then you should be informed that the average Pixar movie has 1) excellent voice acting. 2)cutting edge animation. 3)great story and script. and 4) heart.In other words, Up is slam dunk of a family movie. The plot is about the misadventures and adventures of an old man named Carl Fredriechson and a tag along boy scout. But there's more! If you want to know the rest, then go see the movie.Like all Pixar movies, the voice cast is spot on. All of Up's characters are brought to life with well read lines, vocally emotional undertones, and an assortment of talents. Pixar's trademark CGI animation also breathes life into the characters, all of them are given convincing facial animations and gestures which could match any Hollywood A-lister's.All of the CGI (which is everything seen in the movie) is done beautifully. The scenery is breathtaking and the jungle sets sometimes look as if they were ripped from an issue of National Geographic. Pixar's signature animation is always cartoonish, yet photo-realistic and of course, ahead of their competition.What's also impressive about Pixar is that they never underestimate the power of story. Up's story is original enough (talking dogs and a house held afloat by balloons aren't even the half of it) but it isn't just about the physical conflict and events. It is really the story of an old man trying to find redemption in the twilight of his life by fulfilling an unrealized dream. Pixar has mastered the art of throwing tragedy and warmth into the same basket without becoming too heavy handed, and you can feel it in this movie.Up is also exciting and fun. The sense of adventure is palpable and the humor is charming. The script is also nicely written and clever. This movie is also very, very family friendly, despite its PG rating.The bottom line is that Up is beautiful, touching, humorous, charming and kid and parent friendly. It is just another grade A Pixar movie. Which means that unless your inner child is completely dead you should see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A movie about old age and young hearts,"Walt Disney once said that he wanted to make movies for audiences, not just kids. His goal was to produce animated film equal to live action features, movies that were seen and appreciated just like any other movies. One can certainly discuss how well the Disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been Pixar. Step by step, movie by movie, the people at Pixar have kept outdoing themselves. To me, Wall-E was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. That wasn't just a family adventure and it wasn't a kids movie. It was about two machines and the entire human race - a movie for audiences, don't you think?Up is a companion piece on the same level. It's not about the entire human race, but it's about the entire life of a human being - this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. In the beginning of the movie we meet Carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. Coming home from a Newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. Thus, he meets Ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. Now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. But what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist - it's Carl alright, but now he's Mr. Fredricksen, a cranky old man. The movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! Hey little Charlie, this is your life Mr. Fredricksen. It's dangerously brilliant.Our cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. While there's still time, and while there's certainly nothing better to do, Carl figure it's time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward South America, the land of his dreams. His only baggage is Russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to ""relate"" to. Carl finds him obnoxious and even though Russell is your average modern eight year old, I guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. Back in the days, all Carl and Ellie knew about South America was that it was ""America, only south"". Russell takes GPS for granted and says ""You're going to South America? You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff."" Russell doesn't seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and he's certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate.What follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. There's something very classical about the whole fair; an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. In a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies - it's part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. Carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, it's all just a nuisance. He is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. ""Can we keep it?"" Russell says. ""No"" Carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. ""But it's a talking dog!!"" Russell finally exclaims.Up also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. It feels as if it's taken inspiration both from the films of Miyazaki, and from that elegant French style of animation that borders to realism. The adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time it's all very close to heart. Carl Fredricksen is as believable as Walter Matthau or Jack Lemmon were in Grumpy Old Men. Up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post- war dream weaving. It also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. Another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you're at the end of your days, we are all children at heart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display.,"In the years since Toy Story burst onto our screens,i have grown a little weary of the cute digimations that have flooded our screens. More than most seemed to feature some sarcastic little animal,voiced by an irritating overpaid recognisable actor picking up and easy paycheck. So, with trepidation i inserted Up in to my DVD machine and after 10minutes i realised i was watching something as imaginative as it was visually impressive. I never gave a second thought to who was voicing who.To my delight, i just let myself be carried away with the film and at the end i found myself having choked back the tears at least 5 times. Wow. I never thought a digimation could do that to me but it did. My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display in Pixars Up.

Hits the heart early and follows up with a tremendously engaging and entertaining adventure,"I keep waiting for Pixar to let me down by delivering a good film that only disappoints by virtue of it not quite being up to the high standards set by previous films and, while Up is not quite as strong in some regards as some of their previous films, it is definitely a very good film that sits easily amongst their impressive catalogue. Up opens with a montage that spans about 70 years but yet succeeds in making you understand the main character and also feel for him and it makes it look like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Without any pat sentimentality or exploitative tricks or cues, the film is quite moving from the very start and it means that the viewer is right there from the very start.It doesn't quite keep this up though because, although it does still have an emotional heart (thanks to the good work in the opening 10 minutes), the film is much more about the adventure. This does work really well even if it does all get a little bit silly as it goes along and adds talking dogs on top of flying houses etc, however the key thing is that you go with it , mainly because of how well it hooks you into the scenario from the very start. It also helps that on top of being exciting and engaging, it is also very funny indeed. Full of amusing aspects as well as specific funny jokes, the film doesn't separate some jokes for the kids and some for the adults but rather has good clean material with strong timing and delivery that makes it easily appreciable by the largest range of ages. The talking dog was my personal favourite but generally every character moved things along in regards action, drama and comedy.Needless to say the animation is brilliant. I did not see this in 3D but it is still gorgeous to behold, with the small personal effects being just as well done as the broad sweep of the fantasy scenario. The animation of the characters is great because it manages to convey such information in the tiny reactions or gestures of the characters – hard to imagine how one would do that in terms of capturing this performance detail not to mention the technical aspects. Asner does great voice work in the lead role, while Nagai does well to avoid being no more than an irritating ""cute kid"" but is actually a good presence. Peterson's timing as Doug is great while Plummer is suitably threatening and of course Ratzenberger gets a slot as normal.Up is a great film, probably my favourite of the year by some distance. The film hits the heart early with an impacting opening 15 minutes that sucks the viewer in and makes it look easy at the same time, then follows up with a solid slice of family-friendly adventure that is as thrilling as it is funny. Another in a succession of incredibly good films from Pixar.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but not as good as the hype says","First it must be said that Up is a good movie. It doesn't fade next to Ratatouille, Wall-E or any other of Pixars greatest. It is fun for kids as well as adults, it makes you care about the characters, the animation is flawless and the plot keeps your attention every second. Still, Up is one of the strongest arguments for closing the vote until the hype has passed (Maybe until the movie has been released on DVD?) Along with movies like The Dark Knight, Star Trek and the other Pixar Wall-E it makes me more and more certain that this is the solution. Don't get me wrong, I loved both Wall-E and the Dark Knight, but there still is no way that they're as great as the ratings say. Besides, Star Trek was plain awful. Slumdog Millionaire is probably the only hyped movie I can think of that has landed on an appropriate rating in the end. Anyway, I recommend Up, it is a good movie you and your kids probably will want to see again and again if you are a Pixar fan, and if you're not I recommend it all the same. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Appeals to all ages!,"I was fortunate enough to attend a preview in Denver. It is yet another Pixar that appeals to all. I attended with my 5 year old daughter, 8 year old son and two friends. We all really enjoyed this movie. The storyline was probably a bit over my daughter's head but she was drawn to the characters Dug the dog and Kevin the bird so it didn't make much difference. She was giggling through out the movie over their antics. My 8 year old son was drawn to the idea of a flying house and the adventurousness of the story as well as the characters. Certain parts of the story had my girlfriends and I getting choked up and teary eyed but that aspect of the story was over their head. There are a couple take aways from this movie depending on how old you are and not wanting to spoil it I will leave it at that. I highly recommend this movie! See it as a family if you can.

No milestone in movie history.,"I was exited to see this movie, as it had rapidly climbed to 26th place on IMDb's Top 250 before it was released here in Germany. Maybe those expectations ruined it for me, as expectations often do, but I really don't think this movie deserves a spot this high. Okay, it's funny. But so are Monsters Inc., Wall-E, Finding Nemo and countless others. The story is imaginative and entertaining, but no magic. The plot tries to push us through a wide range of emotions, but the movie's sugar-coated, candy-like look and slapstick nature kept me from identifying too much with its fairly shallow characters. A while ago, I saw ""Spirited Away"", a movie that touches the soul, takes you into a land beyond your wildest imaginations and leaves you with magical, dreamlike images you won't forget for a long time. Compared to movies like that, ""Up"" seems like your typical ""let's all have a good time"" - Disney family entertainment flick. Which is perfectly all right, and I will gladly give it a 7 out of 10, but this movie is definitely no milestone in movie history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not bad, but not great","This, at least for me, was one of those movies where it gets really hyped up, but winds up not living up to the high standard I was told to expect. that being said: it is a cute movie, one that kids will enjoy, and has some excellent animation.The plot could have been better developed, and really, with the exception of Carl, all the characters are extremely static, the worst of all being the villain who gets all his development within the first five minutes of the movie. The time line of the movie is not even remotely realistic (yes, I know it's a cartoon, but a day to get to South America then three to walk 2 miles?)As of this writing: this movie is rated as being within the top 20 of all time, a honor it doesn't even come close to deserving.

Taking Animation to New Heights...,"I went into this film amazingly enough knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it was Pixar's newest release, that it was 3D, and of course that it was called UP. I have to say Pixar tops itself again. As a fan of traditional 2D animation, 3D animated films have always been a rough pill to swallow. Even if I really like them I still have a twinge of despair that they are in the 3D medium. I don't want to say that I am completely transformed and now love 3D, but Pixar always does a great job in lessening that pain.I found Up to be a very heartwarming film. We got a glimpse of Pixar trying to play with the heartstrings in Wall-E, but they definitely have some far more emotional moments in Up. But with the great laughs and story included. I found it to be a fantastic ride that will have you almost in tears one minute and then laughing out loud the next. Great story. Great voice actor. And great Animation.

Absolutely wonderful!,"Pixar, who never seems to make a wrong step, steps right again! And this film shows no sign of a studio exhausted for ideas. This is one of their best films in fact. What I love about Pixar is their attention to detail, story, and treating their characters with respect. They make complex stories feel simple and effortless by the mastery with which they tell them. And on top of that, they dazzle the eyes and are just plain fun as all get out. When listening to how they developed the story for UP from the director's commentary on the DVD, I felt as if I as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for. They took great pains to bring something to life that would touch my soul and enchant me. Yes, UP has a few dark moments, but the undercurrent is sweet and hopeful, making the experience delightful through teary eyes. It is a must see.One note of caution: because of the maturity of some of the subject matter, I would not recommend it for little little kids. Perhaps 5 and above would be a good start. I feel the ""married life"" scene while easily the best moment of the film would be too emotionally hard for them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Looks fantastic. Slight plot niggles!,"This is the first time I've been to the cinema in about 18 months. That's having small children for you. So, it's my birthday. 42, since you didn't ask. It's half term, and the cinema is heaving with children; our own son is too small yet for the film, so it's just us adults. We're a little late, and the auditorium is a strange sight as everyone is wearing dark glasses. My first 3D film! Keep up. This is going to be relevant.I'll try and keep the spoilers to a minimum, but anyone who's even half awake will know that Pixar's latest animated feature follows the adventures of an old man and a small boy who fly a house to South America using balloon power. Up is a beautiful movie. Every scene is lovingly rendered with a fantastic attention to detail- to take one example, the way the use of colour alters during the course of the film as the mood changes.The film contains early in its running time a scene destined to become a classic of cinema, a wordless montage sequence explaining our hero Carl's life from a child to an old man. One shot alone contains more pathos and humanity than many films this year will manage in total. At the end of this sequence, it would be a hard heart indeed that was not moved.Once Carl finds his young stowaway, the pace shifts up a gear as the two get involved in an adventure in the mythic location of Paradise Falls where Carl has always longed to go.On one level, this is a fantastic film, surely one of the best of the year; moving, funny, heart-warming (with a soupçon of the environmental message seemingly mandatory in all such features). All kinds of lessons are learnt. Following one's dreams; living in the moment; the dangers of obsession. Carl's house becomes a very large extended metaphor, taking him soaring away from his old life, but then tying him down when he needs to be free.And yet, and yet, and yet.What this most definitely is not is a children's film, especially not younger ones. Fairly early on, a small voice whispered behind me, ""I thought this was supposed to be funny."" Yes, it contains its share of slapstick humour and chase sequences that will thrill smaller kids, but its main themes will go straight over their heads.For adults, meanwhile, the plot fails on several levels. Yes, I know this is nitpicking, but movies have to follow their own logic. I am fully prepared to accept within the world of the film that a house can be floated by balloons and steered across continents. However, how does an old man who walks stiffly with a cane suddenly start taking part in action sequences? I can accept that someone has invented a device for translating dogs' thoughts into speech- but how do they prepare dinner (or fly planes)? Ultimately, these concerns will fade. My lasting impression will be the beauty of the pictures and the tear rolling down my cheek at the end of the truly amazing montage near the start of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A different feel from other Pixar films; but still good,"A friend warned me that I would feel disappointed by ""Up"". He said it just wasn't as clever and complex as Ratatouille or Wall-E or other past Pixar offerings.But another friend saw it, and recommended it, so I behooved myself to check it out.I agree with my first friend that ""Up"" is a narratively relatively modest undertaking. But I also feel that what it does achieve is notable.It's taken a while for certain aspects to come to the fore in my mind. However, I did immediately notice one honest and useful moral: For all his exertions, Fredricksen doesn't get to really have an adventure until he lets go of a frozen, romanticized version of ""adventure"" that got stuck in his character makeup at an early age. I thought it was great how the story sets this up and creates the situation where he has this breakthrough. Very nicely done.And then there were other interesting things the film achieves. The pacing of the story is odd. In a way, it's hard to say whether this reflects daring or ineptitude on the parts of the folks responsible for the shepherding the narrative. But, in the end, I have to say there was something grand about the way the story rolls along slowly and yet also with a lot of strength. It's as though it aspires to be operatic; with an emotional depth that tries to match the breadth of the spaces and times involved. Sort of like ""Waiting for Godot"" meets ""Dennis the Menace""! I should mention that, about halfway through the film, the pace gets picked up, and stays ""up"" for a long time; a bit ""too much"", in my book, and quite likely a nod to the kid customers in the audience.And then there's that whole side story of Fredricksen's deceased wife (no spoiler there; you see this coming from a mile off). Very nicely done.With the proviso that, indeed, you will see something a bit different from prior Pixel work--no harm in variety!--I can recommend this movie.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
not quite as good as i had hoped,"this was a fairly enjoyable animated film from Disney/Pixar.there's some funny moments here and there.it's touching without being too maudlin or sentimental.there certainly is a fair amount of action as well.the story is also good.there a few scenes of minor peril which might be a bit too much for younger children,and the movie fleetingly touches upon a sad topic.for the most part,i enjoyed the movie.i did think however,there were a few scenes that were probably intended to be funny,but came across flat and pointless in my mind.all in all,pretty good effort,just not as good as i hoped or thought it would be.for me,Up is 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Way overrated,"The first 10 minutes are great and heartfelt, but the rest of the movie is just standard kiddie-animated-action-movie fare, but without any really funny gags or interesting or quirky characters. It seems for a lot of people the central premise/moral of the story touches a nerve, but that one idea alone isn't enough to lift the movie above an average rating.The animation is very good, as one has come to expect from Pixar, but sorry, the bar has been raised - in 2009 this level of quality has become the norm, i.e. average.The character development is good for Carl Fredricksen, but lacks depth for Russell and also for Charles Munts. Carl is really the only person in the movie who you kind of get attached to, but again, mainly due to the first 10 minutes montage of his life.The movie doesn't contain a lot of humour - the one it does have seems forced and silly (dog voice collars, the bird swallowing Carl's walking stick, etc. - yawn). This movie is nowhere near the league of Pixar greats ranging from Toy Story to Wall-E. For other studios this might be considered good, but for Pixar I would consider it average at best.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A lovely addition to Pixar's franchise,"When I saw the first clip of this movie on the WALL-E DVD, my first impression was, this is crazy, seeing a house rising into the sky by a lot of balloons! I liked the idea of using an old man as the main character, from the moment he said ""afternoon"" in the clip, it felt heart warming. When I first heard about the plot, everything fell into place, and the message behind the house was beautiful. I did have another reservation with the relationship between the old man Carl and the wilderness explorer, Russell, but when I went to see it, nearly everything worked.The beginning is definitely one of the best parts of the film, the montage we see on Carl and Ellie's time together was a joy to watch, right through to the end, and it was the first time a film brought a tear to my eye at so early a stage of the plot. As I've already said the message of freedom and being able to do the thing you always want to do in your whole life, was beautifully shown through the flying house. What I was concerned about before hand was the relationship between Carl and Russell. From seeing later clips of the film, I was worried that the film was going to be hampered down by ""the main character and his sidekick"" gags, especially when you add in a bird that won't go away, and a witless dog. Yet the film doesn't fall into that trap, yes there are still sidekick gags, but the creators don't overdo it. What's more, in a way the characters, Russell, Kevin and Dug, are not like the usual dumb sidekicks you get in any short TV cartoons, they're natural sidekicks. Russell for instance is the kind of kid with curiosity and the idea that everything is a game, which would lead to trouble. There are action sequences in this film that takes you on a helter-skelter of a ride, and when I left the cinema I felt I had a great time. To anyone, this film would seem to be defying the laws of science, and it's not just because of a flying house. Yet, I didn't care about this because this is a children's film! The gags were great, yet there was one on the dogs voices which, though it was hilarious, I felt was a bit camp for Pixar's standards.The Mis-en-scene was beautiful. Obviously the two contrasting settings in this film are the city and the paradise falls. Paradise Falls is of course the main attraction and we see a ray of colours from the natural setting, compared to the grey and organised city. The music meanwhile was charming.From other reviews, I heard that the 3D graphics didn't show anything amazing. For me I didn't think it was bad. It definitely didn't pop out of the screen, but I thought it was better than Coraline. I found that the airborne objects, like the house, seemed to stand out more and I enjoyed it There were however a few problems I had with this film. Firstly, there is the matter of the self-improvement in this film. In many of their other films, Pixar has used more than one self-improvement. In WALL-E for example, as well as the robots want for love, there was the human's self-improvement to find their humanity and return to earth, which fitted in nicely. In this film, it was clear that Russell had a self – improvement to progress in life, namely to become a senior in the wilderness explorers. However, once we got to Paradise falls, the creators seemed to let this self – improvement sit, and although there were moments, such as the time when we hear Russell talk about his relationship with his father with Carl, there weren't many signs of development. Once you add up the sidekick gags and the helter-skelter action sequences, they seemed to take over the whole plot. We only return to the self-improvement near the end, and at that stage, Russell had improved by then. I enjoyed watching Carl improve, yet it didn't balance with Russell's improvement, along with the many things that was going on. Also, there weren't many twists to the plot. The villain was defeated (so no nod to ""Ratatouille""), and it was predictable what the dilemma in the second half was going to be (so no nod to ""WALL-E""). In the end the plot was just the usual plot line you get in any normal film. Also, after seeing the last three films, I was looking forward to a song in the ending credits, and was disappointed when that didn't happen Despite these, the ending for Carl was lovely, and in essence, the things that make Pixar's films great are there. The film didn't bowl me over like ""WALL-E"", but I found it to be a charming film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A sense of history,"A lot of people have written about the humour, excitement, sweetness, depiction of love etc. etc. of this film, and with most of that I'd concur; I want to write about the element I haven't seen mentioned much, and which I perhaps enjoyed and was impressed by the most -- Pixar's homage to the spirit of the past, right down to the authentic style of the vocals in the 'period' song that plays at the end of the credits. (Not just a bit of distort and crackle to make it sound old -- if anything, that's overdone -- but the singing technique and orchestration are spot-on for a pre-war popular record. Wish I could say the same for the rhymes, but 'adventure' clearly isn't the easiest couplet to complete..!)By having Carl as the principal character and his adventures triggered by his childhood fantasies, Pixar have very cleverly contrived to have their cake and eat it: to produce what is basically a 'Boys' Own' adventure full of lost jungles, unknown species, biplanes and giant airships, mad scientific gadgets and a reclusive genius -- something out of the ""Eagle"" magazine, right down to its action climax -- and yet to set it in what is supposedly the modern world of its juvenile audience. The 1931 newsreel with which the film opens is wonderful pastiche (and was that a visual reference to ""King Kong"", as adventurer Muntz prepares to reveal his latest discovery?), the two children and their games bring the period to life as the real existence of people just like us without feeling in any way anachronistic, and then the segment that follows demonstrates Pixar's effective use and command of an even earlier idiom -- the fluent story-telling of the *silent* film era.Too much has been written already on the impact and poignancy of this wordless love-story for me to be able to add anything to its praise. I would agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is very rare for films of any kind to depict the married love of adults, let alone to do it in animation so sweetly as this.But actually, the moment when tears came to my eyes was not during this segment at all, but the moment when the house takes off and Carl makes his defiant adventure/escape... (Shades of the Crimson Permanent Assurance!)I found most of this film very enjoyable indeed, especially the retro adventure feel and the dog psychology. What actually undermined it for me was not the surrogate-family-bonding scenario, which would normally have been anathema to me but is handled convincingly here, but the handling of the villain. Interestingly, reading comments on the IMDb boards suggests not only that I am not alone in this, but that the film's creators themselves weren't very sure right up to a late stage in production what to do with him -- the result is that the character, who could have been intriguing, is simply dropped into one-dimensional mode and wasted.I would have preferred a treatment more like the ending of ""Ratatouille"" (and would have preferred a beginning to ""Ratatouille"" more like this!; and for this idiosyncratic reason alone, which did significantly affect my enjoyment, I have rated it down one mark from the level of 9 (for ""deeply moving and exciting"") that it would otherwise have scored on my personal scale. Both films still score by my standards very highly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
UP Soars to New Heights!,"Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.Saying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichéd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.The rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that ""Up"" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Sometimes I think Pixar is more for adults than kids,"I saw Up today and I've been waiting for it to come out. But sadly I thought I would enjoy it more than I really did. It started out great. I agree with most of the critics that the montage showing the two lovers growing together and the loss of the wife was really something akin to the ""When she loved me"" scene in Toy Story 2. And the end of the movie was very touching but in between it was predictable and I have to say very boring.Needless to say the animation was, well PIXAR, can't say anything bad about it. The colors were brilliant and the characters lifelike as usual. But the last two movies made by PIXAR were more for adults than kids. My grandson was bored with this movie and WALL-E especially after all of the popcorn was gone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Does It Again!!!,"When I first saw the trailers for Up, I was skeptical. How interesting can it be to watch an old, cranky man and an impossibly optimistic, chubby kid float around in a house held in the air by balloons? As it turns out, it can be very interesting. The latest film from Pixar, the tenth in their roughly decade-and-a-half history of success, is, in parts, a comedy, an adventure, a buddy movie and a romance. Each genre is blended with the others to create a funny, entertaining and emotional story.One of the first things that helps make Up so compelling is the pitch-perfect voice casting, particularly of the two leads. As the movie's protagonist, Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner is delightfully gloomy and cantankerous, delivering his lines with just the right balance of sarcasm and sincerity to make the audience genuinely care and root for a character that would be otherwise extremely unlikable. Newcomer Jordan Nagai provides his character, Russell, whose peppiness could easily have been irritating, with energy, enthusiasm and enough feeling to prevent Russell from becoming a caricature. Of course, a brief cameo by Pixar regular and ""lucky charm"" John Ratzenberger, who is the only person to have been part of the cast of all ten Pixar feature films, as a construction worker doesn't hurt. Though he usually has minor parts, it would be very odd to see a Pixar film without him and his very distinctive voice.Even if it had not been available in 3-D, the visuals in Up would still be stunning. Vistas of a jungle and waterfalls act as an almost jaw-dropping backdrop without detracting from the story or characters. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even though by now, computer-animation is considered the standard, one cannot help but be amazed at how realistic the film looks. Perhaps even more impressive is how Up uses 3-D technology to its advantage but never allows it to overwhelm the plot, relying on it to immerse the audience in the film instead of cheesy, pop-off-the-screen gags. The color palette, alternately bright and more neutral, really adds life to the film. In fact, the animation and visuals are so well-done that it seems as though Up would be just as entertaining if there was no sound at all, only images.But, of course, as great as the technology utilized in Up is, it's the story and characters that really engage the audience in a tender, emotional experience. What has distinguished Pixar movies from other animated films in the past is the way that it focuses on getting across a story worth telling instead of using the story as a vehicle to tell the jokes. Also, from Toy Story to Wall-E and Up, Pixar movies have appealed to both kids and adults. This appears to be the one of the only studios that realizes that animation is just another medium and that it can be used to tell grown-up stories with mature themes as well as tales that please kids. Though it has its share of laughs and jokes that will make people of any age crack up, the themes and messages that Up explores are decidedly serious. Unlike many recent animated films whose messages usually consist of ""Just be yourself"" or some variation on that, Up focuses on death, loss and, ultimately, the importance of moving on and not letting grief keep you from realizing your dreams. In a world of cynicism and restlessness, its plea for people to recognize life as an adventure, that you don't have to travel to far-off places to experience excitement or grandeur, is especially relevant and crucial. Up is about ordinary people that do extraordinary things in equally extraordinary places before realizing that it is often the simple, boring things in life that bring the most joy.The only major flaw is the presence of a villain. Voiced by Christopher Plummer, Charles Muntz has little role to play than to provide an excuse for lengthy (albeit admittedly thrilling) action sequences. He feels unnecessary and in fact hurts the movie by forcing it into the typical villain-trying-to-kill-hero-for-no-real-reason formula. Though Muntz's canine sidekicks are colorful characters and sources of humor throughout, it seems as though the movie would have been better off without a central antagonist and instead used the relationship between the two protagonists as the main conflict. Knowing Pixar, they could have made Up just as entertaining and more innovative if the formula was ditched in favor of a more character-driven story about self-discovery.However, despite that flaw, Up was a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with surprisingly likable characters. It had, not surprisingly, incredible animation that was used in support of a simple yet profound story and helped convey timeless messages of letting go and enjoying the ordinary and complex journey that is life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Top-tier Animated Film for Everyone,"Up follows Carl Fredrickson, an old man who sets out to fulfill a promise he made to his wife as his world is being taken away from him.

It's tearjerking moments are balanced out with colorful characters that relieve the viewer with clever humor, but even they have genuingly touching moments themselves. What Carl's journey represents is his way of dealing with grief and with grief, obsession is something that can easily slip into it and makes you forget what is truly important in life.

The story begins on a touching note, with beautiful short-cut vignettes that demonstrate the passing of time and the developing of a relationship. After that, the film bogs down to a routine action/adventure, rendered more fantastic, perhaps, than the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" series only because of the lack of constraints that the medium of animation allows. For me, the unhinging of the imagination afforded the creative team was wasted on extravagant but silly, over-the-top, plotting.

High marks,"Another enjoyable Pixar production right here, this time doing for the elderly what ""Toy Story"" did for infants. It does fall a bit too obviously into the formulaic last half hour big chase with the bad guy, which in this particular feature I think was going along perfectly well as it was. Maybe that's just the adult in me, so I'll chalk up the first half of the film for me and the second half for the kiddies.I particularly liked the prologue in which we get the potted life story of Carl and Ellie, the film subtly making the point that life goes on even when you're old and widowed. I might argue that the feisty Ellie character actually seemed to have more going for her than her more passive husband and that I missed her in the second half. I also didn't appreciate the fact that it was their childhood hero and inspiration who turned out to be the baddie and of course cuteness must have its place in any Disney feature and here we get a double dose with Doug the dog and Kevin the err...big bird.However the crotchety old Carl Fredricksen is a fine creation and even more so his keen-as-mustard adventure scout assistant, Russell, the film also reminding us that the generation gap needn't be so wide.While there are fun moments and good laughs to be had, I was most taken with the marvellous animation, as so often is the case with Pixar. In particular the scene of the first ascent of the house with its multicoloured balloons sending it skywards is a visual treat (it's a pity they give this away in the promotional material) as are the first, rainbow-tinged views of Adventure Falls. The vocal characterisations are excellent, with Ed Asner as frosty old coot Carl and young Jordan Nagai as young whippersnapper Russell while the background music is likewise enjoyable and apt.In summary then, another Pixar treat, although like I said from a purely selfish point of view, I do wish they would abandon the routine mini-Indiana Jones big finish, no matter how flashy and superficially thrilling it might be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A perfect 10 except for just two things...,"Up was I think a slight expansion for Pixar. Right Up in my mind. Their movies in the past hit home well with a wide range of audiences. But this one does even more so. A slightly younger crowd, as well as a slightly older one are easily captivated. This makes for an experience that is just simply amazing, across the board. A tear jerker of an animation, and one hell of a movie. But the expansion of audiences also invites some bad into their otherwise perfect work. I don't wanna give away too much but a high pitched annoying voice and some unexpected plane pilots caused an entire point off for this movie. Nearly two. This may please the younger crowd, but for the older I am afraid it hurt it. It hurt it bad. Besides breaking up the smoothness like a scratching record with this overplayed low-end television trick, it just gives you that gut wrenching feeling in your stomach: They obviously did not preview this movie enough. Now I'm no film critic, but my refrigerator could have caught that one. I mean come on.

"Great film, but some of the more mature themes might fly over kids heads (in a balloon house nonetheless)","One day, Pixar might make a film that will just fail to be decent. Fortunately, Up is not that picture. While the story is a little fragmented, this still remains a marvel of animated storytelling that continues the Pixar legacy of releasing solid 3D animated films.The story begins with Carl as a child and we quickly watch his relationship with Ellie, through its various phases, through its untimely end. And then we pick up again as Carl decides to make his late wife's dreams come true. He launches his house into the sky via a ton of balloons, but manages to pick up a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell and then his goal gets derailed from there. Along the way, we meet a few other kooky characters, hilarity ensues and we end on a nice note. First of all, I think Up contains some of the most mature themes and story elements of all of their films so far, especially as we watch Carl and Ellie's life together in fast forward. I don't know how much children will fully comprehend what was going on, but despite the brevity, I still found some of the moments to be borderline tearjerkers. One downside to the story is that it's essentially fragmented and requires that ""life with Ellie"" at the beginning, but overall, the ""quest averted"" concept works very well to help bring out Carl's character. Russell does cross into the land of affably annoying and at times it's difficult to retain sympathy for him due to all the trouble he causes, despite his innocence.The art is pretty classic Pixar, clean with lots of attention to detail and the animators definitely display their considerable skill in getting the characters to display various degrees of emotions. Voice actors do a great job with their characters, even the rather simple characters. Music is used well, even if it's not hyper-memorable.Ultimately, Up falls into line as a good Pixar film, just under the tier of great Pixar film. Of course, a good Pixar film tends to mean a great film otherwise and I won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One fantastic movie,"This is, in my opinion, definitely the best Pixar film. This is more than a fantastic project with an excellent story. The way the story is told, so beautifully realized with very entertaining characters, rich, extremely comical and appealing dialogues, and in the end, what is definitely the most important, a great range of emotions. The movie actually has a lot of material that will keep younger audience more than satisfied, ""Up"" will very much appeal to older viewers. This project is very dynamic, and has really a lot going on in it, but at no time does it lose control or dynamic. The movie was fantastically organized and designed, and definitely everything happens in proper timing. What I think is also very good feature of this project, and directly responsible for its success is that it focuses on a small number of characters. Today is a very hard to get your work characterized as original, but ""Up"" made it happen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A great opening with a good adventure,I would be lying if I said that the best scene in up wasn't the beginning but nevertheless it is still A really wild ride after as well. I will first start off by saying the amount of work put into drawing all those balloons in just mindblowing and visually stunning . Also well I may have a bit of a bias Because I have been a scout. I love russell and find him very funny. If there is one problem I have with the movie it's that you will know the villain as soon as you see him. Also the final act of the movie can be a bit ridiculous. But to be fair we are talking about a movie where balloons can lift a whole house. Other than that it is a really fun adventure of a film.,9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Creative, unique, engrossing...and somewhat disappointing","While I didn't find this nearly as impressive as Ratatouille or Wall-E, Up was still a quality Pixar product, and a creative, if slightly pandering animated film. The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences. Even so, Pixar's heart is always in the right place.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Magical Movie Experience,"Magical. That is the first word that comes to mind when describing this movie.The movie has so many life lessons put into one, but none of them feel forced or are repeated so you start to feel sick. It has the perfect balance of action, everything just melts together and fits together. The mood and the storytelling, how it IS a animation, so over the top things works brilliant, the art direction supports this. I teared up several times during the film, already after few min, and I think you will to.The pacing is brilliant, big concluding finale, nothing really overstays it's welcome. It has a lot of funny, clever jokes. It just puts a big smile onto your face, while also touching you in deep places, and with stuff we all think off. We want to do this, we want to do that. I know I do, forget to live in the now. Get over the past, it only does one thing, and that is hold you down, which this movie literally shows time again. Each time he makes bad decisions because of the past, the house gets lower and lower and harder to carry.It's just a fantastic movie, I've seen more movies then I can count, and I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything blends together perfectly, I couldn't find a bad thing, even if I tried very hard.Thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed the movie just as much as I did. And have a great day!Just some notes I wrote down quickly when watching it, ill just put them here in the end, if anyone would be interested.Important moment. Instead of trying to save what is already living ""Kevin"" A new partner/friend, he is still to bound by his past, his old love.Whenever he makes bad calls he stumbles, and drags, everything is a chore(I don't care about my writings being perfectly written, I do no corrections etc. I hope you can live with that, I myself prefer the raw stuff. When everything is too sterile, it's just boring to read. Errors is what gives personality to you, and to your writing.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Plenty of Air in the Balloon.,"A cantankerous widower refuses to give up his house which is right square in the middle of major skyscrapers being built everywhere around his old neighborhood. Eventually he tires of everything and decides to literally lift his house to South America with the help of thousands of balloons and complete a childhood dream he once shared with his late wife. His adventure is interrupted by a young boy scout who just happened to be on the porch when liftoff occurred and thus the duo head to a new continent together. Excellent achievement in every way imaginable as Pixar once again outdoes itself with a wondrous cinematic technological achievement. The story is outstanding early and then stays strong in spite of its second act (which prominently includes a paper thin villain who has exiled himself since the 1940s because he is trying to catch a rare animal with a pack of dogs who wear collars which allow their barks to be translated to English) which wavers a bit, but still comes through by the finale. Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer are the most noteworthy voices found within. Another computer-generated gem of outstanding film-making. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Nothing ultra-special,"Why is this movie so popular? I find it a merely average animation. Nothing particularly stands out or really attracts. Sometimes the characters just annoy us It isn't bad, but it is'nt amazing. It's rather common, on both the entertainment and artistic parameters. It doesn't compare to classics like Fantasia or The Lion King. It is suitable for small children, kinda family movie to watch with the grandchildren. The characters are either uninteresting or immemorial. And the story's pace definitely doesn't go well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The most emotional Pixar film ever!!!,"Not only is this the second greatest Pixar film aside from Toy Story, but its the most emotional. I was in tears on so many scenes that I had so much crust in my eye the next day. The music score is irresistible, the animation is unbelievably smooth, and the characters are hilarious. The plot itself is also quite clever. Carl Fredrickson is a 78-year-old man who sets out on a quest with an annoying little boy scout named Russell to Paradise Falls in South America, the place of he and his deceased wife's dreams, until they encounter a giant but extremely rare animal hunted down by a famous hunter, which causes problems. Although plot may seem to be falling at times, it kicks itself right back up, with clever scenes, following the ridiculous occurrences. It all fits well as can be. Similar to other Pixars, with more emotionality. Absolutely fantastic! The perfect film for kids and adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
what i thought of the film,This is a really good family friendly film which the whole family can watch with out getting tired as the films shows what friendship and courage can do and also that you are never too old for a adventure and that also you can always rely on your friends and even animals that accompany you along the way. the film shows:excitementadventureand thrillthat will keep you and the whole family going right until the end of the film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's Pixar,"Pixar's UP is about a widower who decides to fly his house to a falls in Venezuela in memory of his late wife. To do this, he ties helium-filled balloons to the house, and off he goes. Joining him on his crazy adventure is a neighborhood kid, and along the way they pick up a talking dog and a rare jungle bird being hunted by a crazed explorer who gets around in a dirigible. This is some nutty plot, but it works. The animation is superb, the story line quite touching. Ed Asner plays the widower and Chris Plummer is the bad guy.

Up and Away,"The movie ""Up"" which was created 2009, is about the power of love. Love is a powerful thing, it can create war or peace. In the movie a journey is made; it teaches us to follow our dreams and teaches us to respect our elders. In addition, ""Up"" has excellent animation.Furthermore, ""Up"" has excellent animation. Presumably created by Pixar,it is one of their movies. This movie was rated PG and is appropriate for all ages. Nevertheless, some may say that it might be a little nerve racking at sometimes. ""Up"" made about $68,108,790 in the first weekend and has won 2 Oscars. Additionally, the producer of ""Up"" has also created many more famous movies such as ""Toy Story"". Henceforth, ""Up"" has many credentials and you can see that it will be a great movie.Respecting your elders is a key point in this movie; one of the main characters Russel meets an old man Carl Fredrickson. Eventually, Russel must learn to work with the old man and help him pursue his dreams. Russel soon finds that the old man is very wise and begins to work with him. To demonstrate the actor who played Carl; Ed Naser did such an outstanding job giving the character life with his voice. A good theme in this movie is respecting your elders.On the other hand, this movie could have created a sequel to explain what happens after Russel and Carl get back from their epic journey. ""Up"" also demonstrates that kids can go and annoy elders. Russel did this in ""Up"", but good things turned out to happen of this. In conclusion, there was nothing I would like to change about this movie.Finally, the last theme in this movie is the power of love. Carl, the older man had a plan to go on a trip with his wife. Sadly, a tragic incident happened and he wasn't able to go. Eventually, Carl was to old to go on his own. Nevertheless, his love for his wife still kept him going and he sailed away to Venezaula with Russel. Russel also was influenced by love from Carl, to be inspired to make new friendships. Love is such a powerful theme in this movie and influenced the plot greatly.Ultimately, ""Up"" is a great movie to go see with your family. Have you ever wanted to be inspired by love? or follow your dreams? if so, this is the right movie for you. Evidently with great animation and created by the best animation studio in the world. ""Up"" is an outstanding, tears in your eyes, and inspiring movie for everyone to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This movie made me cry,"Up is truly a masterpiece that beautifully captures the essence of adventure, love, and loss. From the very beginning, the film pulls at your heartstrings with a moving montage that tells the story of Carl and Ellie's life together. It's a rare feat for an animated movie to evoke such deep emotions, and Up does it effortlessly.The animation is stunning, filled with vibrant colors and imaginative landscapes that make you feel like you're part of the journey. The characters are wonderfully developed; Carl's grumpy exterior hides a heart of gold, and Russell, the eager young scout, brings a sense of innocence and joy that is infectious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A somber,wistful heart at the center of another buoyant PIXAR film","Widower Carl Fredrickson(voice of Ed Asner)feels like his time left could best be spent fulfilling the dream that he and his wife shared:namely,to fly off and explore the wilds of South America. A balloon salesman for a good part of his adult life,he decides to use his inventory to lift and carry away the old home that he shared with her for the forty some years they were together. And why not? The house is surrounded by a massive re-urbanizing development and there's considerable pressure on him to sell his beloved home. Rather than do that,he's set on taking his dreams in tact with him to do the things that he lived a lifetime putting off.The plans seem great. One hitch:a chubby,overly chatty World Explorer Scout named Russell,who is doggedly intent on helping Carl to finish his badge accumulation.The rest of the story is the main motor of this latest offering by the revolutionary studio. A struggle to navigate to the mythic falls point of the region(they miss the target,landing on the far other side of the plateau),as they are joined by a mythic wild bird and a voice-collar speaking hunting dog,defending against the hunting wishes of a lost explorer(voice of Christopher Plummer),whose singular vision to chase HIS aspirations have turned him into something g far less noble than he once was or appeared.This is a nice,sometimes inspired,sometimes funny,somewhat maudlin story that has nothing really wrong with it(save a suspension of disbelief over,among other things,the physics of a balloon-carried old-style home being carried,in tact,over thousands of miles). Director Pete Docter and co-writer,co-director Bob Petersen(who voices many of the dogs in the story,particularly Dug,the afore-mentioned dog that greets the intrepid travelers initially)supply a perfectly smart,engaging and entertaining film. I,personally,couldn't quite warm up to it as wholly as past PIXAR adventures(Toy Story,Buig's Life,Finding Nemo and WALL-E come to mind),but I still found this easily very entertaining and reasonably endearing(the dogs with talking collars particularly tickled me). Some rather depressing,adult themes and a longer-than-expected opening might test the patience of some,but this film largely is able to,like its title,stay buoyant throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Underwhelming,"I had high hopes for ""Up"". I don't think it let me down. Maybe I let it down. I don't know.I think the secret to Pixar's success is that they knew before anyone else that a great children's movie is a great movie, full stop. You don't have to transparently attempt to please both children and adults: this was what was wrong with a lot of terrible family movies, like ""North"". Adult humour seems stunningly out of place in a movie best enjoyed by children, and the truisms children might be hearing for the first time are often ones that adults can do with being reminded of.At least, that's what I always thought. ""Up"" starts very well, with an opening montage that makes everybody's list of saddest movie scenes. When the central premise of the flying house suspended by balloons is established, we realise the movie is off to a great start, but where it goes from there just isn't as interesting, and it lost me repeatedly.Maybe I'll watch it again later, now that I know what to expect, and hopefully I'll be able to replace this review with a more positive one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

This run-of-the-mill Disney/Hollywood action is only interrupted towards the end when the film remembers that it has an idea and that it needs to convey a message.

Great idea and lazy work,"I admit, i had high expectations from this movie. The sad part is that the movie could have been great if only the producers hadn't been that lazy. The movie has a great idea at the foundations. The beginning is very pleasant and develops perfectly this idea. It arouses great emotions. If it was a short, 20 min movie, I would rate it 9/10 easily. But afterwards, the movie starts to be a lazy work with scenes seemed to be there only to fill the time or clearly contradictory between each other. The second, short part of the movie, is just terrible. Without spoilers, it involves a problem and a solution which happens out of screen and a completely contradictory development. Afterwards it becomes a cartoon as many others, with the same timer effect and save the weak theme as always. 6 or 6.5 out of ten is the right mark for this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"I found the film ""Up"" to be funny and chalked full of excitement .  It was a great movie to watch with my children.","The movie ""Up"" is a 2009 Walt Disney film about a retired balloon salesman, Carl Fredrickson who is in his 70's living his deceased wife Ellie's childhood dream of adventure to South America. Carl is a funny little man who adored his life with his wife Ellie who he met as a child. After Ellie's death and the court's decision to send Carl to a retirement home, he decides to fulfill Ellie's dream of living on Paradise Falls in South America. Carl fills thousands of balloons with helium and ties them to his house in order to take the house to Paradise Falls. Along the way he realizes that he has another passenger, an eight year old wilderness explorer named Russell. This unlikely duo get off to a rocky start but through meeting new friends like Kevin the bird and Dug the dog they become like father and son. The theme of this film is about life, love, and adventure. In the beginning we see Carl and Ellie's life together up until her death when they are old. We also see the love that they shared. Throughout the rest of the film we see the adventure that Carl takes to live the adventure that Ellie had wanted herself. Towards the end of the film when Carl sits down and looks through the adventure book one last time he realized that Ellie had lived an adventure of her own and was happy with their life together. The film as a whole focused on an old man's dream of fulfilling an adventurous past. Each scene of the film offered a bit of imagination and suspense. When Carl finally reaches Paradise Falls with his house he quickly realizes that his adventure is just beginning. After coming in contact with Kevin the bright colored unusual bird and the talking dog dug the pace of the movie picks up to an action based plot. Carl is torn between saving his house and saving Kevin from his childhood hero. The film was bright in its color format and used very deep but brilliant lighting to enhance the characters themselves. The camera gave different angle shots on specific scenes to keep you in suspense. For example, the scene where the dogs were chasing what appeared to be a very large bird. I found this film to be very mature and more of a young adult type than of a children's style of film.

Animation film that involves interesting physics,"It is a very beautiful animation film where an exciting adventure is set in the sky. The old Mr. Fredricksen has his house floating by hanging from hundreds of balloons and set off to South America after depressed by the loss of his wife.The first sequence that shows his earlier life is moving. From the first meeting with the neighbor tomboy to the marriage life in the house to the time when she is getting weak, we see his entire life with his wife and get totally in his shoes.The main location is the jungle in South America where his wife had dreamed to visit. He happens to have three companions, a boy, a dog, and a snipe. The house also soon ceases to be accommodation and becomes a big floating companion itself, which he calls by his wife's name. The house's colorful balloons are very beautiful as if they show the house's emotion.The mountainous geography is fully exploited for the 3-dimensional cliff-hanger action, which involves physics where they and the house pull each other by a rope. They have to deal with the balance between the buoyancy from the house and their weight. Characters' movement is briskly and comically choreographed. The materials are realistic, one of the best is the dogs' hair.Honestly, I am not really into the story. Mr. Fredricksen's purpose is vague. And I'm not sure if the film really needs that evil villain. But at least I like the companion characters. Among them, the boy Russell has a soft and round body like a rubber ball.

Something unreal,"""Up"" is what you always expect from the cinema, and yet you very rarely get it, and even less do you believe that such a thing is possible. This is not just an hour and a half of pleasure, of the most diverse and strong feelings, from the beginning, which plunges into a real shock, to the optimistic end (not a sugary happy ending, but some kind of right end, when you realize that otherwise it is impossible, impossible). This is a feeling of lightness, as if a million balloons are not carrying Carl and Ellie's house, but you personally, and this feeling does not go away for a very long time.This is, without any doubt, a living classic. Whatever you find fault with in this cartoon (and what can you find fault with in it, to be honest?), such strength of feelings, such thoughtfulness and at the same time the naturalness of every moment, every little thing, make ""Up"" a genuine masterpiece.

One of the most moving Pixar films,"The beginning of the movie is about how Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, and Ellie Fredricksen, voiced by Elizabeth Docter, developed their relationship. They met when they were young kids and discovered that they shared a common admiration of Charles Muntz, who was a famous explorer. They shared plans of visiting a place in South America called Paradise Falls, where Charles had discovered an exotic creature that was difficult to capture. Carl and Ellie fell in love and grew up together. The movie showed a montage of their relationship that included their marriage, infertility issues, and their attempts to save up money to fulfill their dream of going to Paradise Falls. However, they experience many obstacles that prevent them from saving up the necessary amount of money to go. One day, a young boy named Russell, voiced by Jordan Nagai, visited Carl's house on his journey to earn his last merit badge to become a Senior Wilderness Explorer. Eventually, they decide to embark on the journey to Paradise Falls together. Shortly after arriving there, they discover that Charles Muntz is there and that they have something that he wants.The theme of the movie can be seen in the beginning and near the end of the movie, which is the spirit of adventure. Even after experiencing some difficult challenges, Carl was motivated to continue his journey. It's similar to the Disney Pixar movie Onward, where the characters also go on an adventure to fulfill a mission that is filled with obstacles and discoveries. The film was developed in widescreen, which was appropriate for the theme of the movie. Most of the scenes were filled with action or landscape, so the widescreen was necessary and beneficial for the audience's viewing. The film also used music as a transitional sound. The audience can feel the emotions of the scenes by listening to the music. For example, the transition of a happy upbeat song into a slow song that was played during the montage of Carl and Ellie. There was also slow and intense songs that played when Carl and Russell were experiencing tough times on their adventure to Paradise Falls. The friendship that Carl and Russell built throughout the movie demonstrated the importance of friendship, maintaining your childhood, and the spirit of adventure. Russell's young age and enthusiasm reminded Carl how he used to be as a young boy and inspired him to continue to keep his dreams alive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Yeah, Pixar has done it again, a few notch higher with its latest film, UP.It is wonderfully crafted, nicely executed, and a thoroughly mesmerizing film, one which left imprints in your head long after you have watched it.I like the main character, the cute and cuddly Boy Scout Russell, the beautiful humongous goose (?), the loyal dog, and the balloons.But what I like most wasn't that.What I like most of it is the way the film tries to be different from the other movies in its genre. The idea of flying your house to somewhere in the opposite part of the world, and meeting with many bizarre adventures, are absolutely amazing.I mean, who could have thought about that? It takes a genius to think of it, and a group of super talented crew to put ideas into something this good.The most intense fight in the genre for the best animation for the year, what's with other wonderfully made animations made in this year, i.e Wall*E. Well, I like both Wall*E and UP, but it just happens that I like UP a little bit more :)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Good!

This movie offers nice and clean entertainment for the whole family but on the downside it's very predictable.This movie will appeal more to children but it also has something for the mature audience. Especially, the relationship between ""Carl"" and ""Ellie"".

"Up, Up, and still Pixar goes Up...","I'm an avid Pixar fan and ever since it's first movie, Toy Story, I await eagerly for Pixar movies every year. I don't worry about what kind of movie it is going to be, but if it is Pixar then it's definitely going to watch-movie-for-sure list. Just look the improvements from the first to the latest. It's all refreshing. Simple stories. So simple, yet powerful. They create memories... no... they become a part of our memories as we experience them. The animation, the dialogs, the plot twists, the texture and the special effects brings life into each character and reality to the background portrayed.And, as I watched Up, I can imagine the hard-work, dedication and love put into this masterpiece. The movies before Up I keep them under the categories of comedies. But, Up is an exception. First, this movie is a drama, then it is a comedy. Yes, my friends. It is a drama first. Though, Wall-E is cute and moving, Up is emotional. The movie is true to its very soul. This movie actually brought tears. At times it lit up a smile on our faces in a way that is very understandable. Add a bit of action, adventure and humor to this drama and the resultant movie is a true masterpiece. Pixar always manages to surprise and amaze us in a way no animation movie ever could.As you can see that I am not mentioning even one scene from movie, it's because it is not a movie to be explained nor said, but truly a movie to be watched and experienced.Pixar has done it again.

Pixar Lifts You 'Up' on the Waves of Visual Bedazzlement!,"Up begins with a poignant montage of our protagonist Carl Fredricksen (the unmistakable voice of Ed Asner) and his partner Ellie as they meet as fledgling broods, only to fall in love. Thrown together by a shared spirit of adventure, particularly the escapades of a spirited explorer Charles Muntz who dazzled the world with his discovery of Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie are forced to shelve their plans to move to this ""exotic lost land"" as life, as always, gets in the way. We watch the couple deal with the ups and downs, joys and tragedies of life; and gradually we watch them grow into old age, Ellie's 'My Adventures' scrapbook still unfilled, even as her time on Earth ends. This wordless, eloquent, effortlessly heart- breaking sequence is sure to melt even the iciest of hearts.With Ellie gone, Carl becomes a crusty codger, faced with moving to retirement home for the rest of his days. But he has another idea, one involving the inflatable leftovers of his previous career as a sidewalk balloon vendor. He decides to honor the promise he made to his dearly departed adventure-loving wife and take one last shot at adventure! Carl hitches thousands of helium balloons to his rickety old house, rigs a steering system and 'Up' he goes. But he is not alone. There's a pint-size accidental stowaway aboard: Russell (an endearing Jordan Nagai as Carl's comic foil), an eight-year-old Wilderness Explorer scout set on earning a badge for assisting the elderly, who happens to be on Carl's porch right when the house takes off. Together they embark on an eventful journey that brings them face to face with unlikely travel companions - both friends and foes in the form of talking dogs, an enormous squawking bird and the reclusive Muntz himself - as they arrive in Paradise Falls. By the end of their escapade, they not only become thick friends, but also learn an invaluable lesson about what really matters most in life; a lesson that imbues Up with a strongly beating heart.Pixar once again outdoes itself with Up, a vibrantly bubbly exploration of how life's great adventures can stem from death's gloomy depths. From a distance, Up may seem to be an old-fashioned adventure story, but filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson utilize the off-the-wall premise to consistently enthralling effect. The chemistry between Carl and Russell plays a pivotal role here, with the pair's various misadventures heightened by the flamboyant supporting characters and breathtaking visuals. Never has the sight of a thousand balloons looked as glorious as it does here, while the mountains, canyons, and dense forests of its South America bristles with life.Up is so human and relatable that it feels like it's more than just a mere animation - it has more heart and soul in its tiniest pixel than most live-action movies can boast in their entirety. No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser world-view of an adult, the bright, buoyant 'Up' brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you won't fail to be lifted!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Up, Up and Away","After last year's slightly disappointing trip to outer space, this heartwarming modern fairy tale shows the PIXAR team back in top form.The visuals are as gorgeous and scrupulously detailed as ever, but the real winner is the clever, funny, bittersweet and highly entertaining screenplay which is both action-packed and touching without resorting to the preachy tone so often found in animated movies nowadays.Yes, the story loses some momentum in the middle section, but otherwise the balance between colorful kiddie adventure and a more mature personal drama of lost and readjusted aims in life is brilliantly realized.8 out of 10 talking dogs",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story or Finding Nemo this is not. But worth seeing at the cinema in superb 3D this is.,"The word on the street was that Pixar's latest finally showcased the true potential 3D has in the movie market. Now we aren't talking about the gimmicky extra dimension you find at studio theme parks in the U.S. or in those schlocky horror movies like My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination - whose sole purpose are to make you duck and weave as things are swiped and hurtled at you - the third dimension here would add depth to each and every frame like never before seen. The word on the street was right. There is nothing cheap or sore on the eyes here, just subtle 3D that supports, not replaces, a worthy tale. If this is the direction that 3D is heading in, then I am very excited indeed.Pixar (now owned by Disney) aren't the leading company in animated movies just because of the visual benchmark they continually set. They understand that the story comes first and without it the breathtaking imagery will mean next to nothing. With Up we have an endearing yarn about following your dreams before it is too late, which is genuinely moving for the most part, but it seems to steer into adult territory a little too often. Don't misunderstand, this is a truly wonderful story and it is nice to find a 'kids' movie that isn't afraid to make the audience, both young and old, think, however it could have used a lighter touch to get across the same message. An extra laugh here and there would've been welcomed too.We have seen and loved a toy cowboy and spaceman, the last robot on earth, a clownfish and an ugly green ogre yet Carl is one of the most unlikely protagonists to feature in an animated family movie yet: a grumpy old man. However it is a breath of fresh air to see this square-jawed, button-nosed man in his seventies lead the way in a world that inhabits talking dogs and a female exotic bird named Kevin. His offsider, the loveably pudgy Russell, almost steals the show though. His bumbling voice and priceless facial expressions pave the way to majority of the laughs and subsequently ensure his escapades are the most enjoyable to watch.Toy Story or Finding Nemo this is not.

Dreams Up in the Air,"After watching the movie Up, by Pixar, the viewer is instantly connected emotionally. The love between Carl and Ellie is adorable. The viewer watches them grow old together from a young age. Whether it is working at their day job together or laying at the park staring at clouds together, any person would be envious of the love they have for each other. They always had adventure within them, from a young age they formed an adventure club and filled the pages of Ellie's adventure book with the dream to go to Paradise Falls together. They created a jar to put spare change in that would go towards funding their dream. Carl and Ellie face a lot of bumps on the road towards their dream, Paradise Falls. Some of them include Carl breaking his leg, getting a flat tire, and a tree falling on their house during a storm. This causes them to use the Paradise Falls fund which delays their trip. After these delays, they become content with their love for one another and soon forget about their dream from a young age. Carl remembers about their dream too late and Ellie suddenly passes away early on in the movie. Ellie passes without fulling her and Carl's dream and the viewer is overcome with sadness. However, Carl decides that he wants to make the dream happen for his wife after he is given her adventure book in the hospital in the days before her death. So he works towards being able to go there himself, for the both of them. This captivates the viewer to feel for Carl and wish for his success. In Pixar's movie, ""Up"", determination and loyalty is portrayed in the main character Carl despite the hardships he faces before and after the passing of the love of his life.After Ellie's passing, Carl soon begins working towards his and Ellie's dream. However he soon runs into a problem with construction workers working outside of his house. As the construction goes on, they accidentally smash Carl'a mailbox in his front yard. The mailbox means a lot to Carl because he and Ellie designed it together when they were young. Thus when he sees his mailbox smashed, he is angered. Arguing with the construction workers leads to a court case where Carl is ordered to move into a retirement home forever. By moving in, Carl knows that he would not be able to fulfill his and Ellie's dream of going to Paradise Falls. So Carl thinks of a solution to tie thousands of balloons to his house and make it fly. Carl is willing to do anything and everything to give him a chance at fulfilling his and Ellie's dream.He had succeeded in getting his entire house into the air, an enormous feat in itself, but it is not long after he gets his house floating that Carl hears a knock at his front door only to find that it is Russel. The day before Russel showed up at Carl's house asking if he needed any assistance as he was trying to get his last badge for helping the elderly. Carl grew annoyed with him and finds a way to send him away. However when Russel surprises Carl by appearing on his porch, Carl decides to let him in. Russel causes more problems for Carl that he does not need. For instance, Russel accidentally throws the GPS out of the window making it more difficult for Carl to navigate. Carl must now try to navigate his house to Paradise Falls on his own.Even after lifting his home into the air and dealing with the badgering of Russel, he continues to face adversity. While in the air, they run into a thunderstorm. The thunderstorm shakes the whole house. This causes Carl needing to quickly gather all of his valuables such as pictures of Ellie hanging on the wall so that they do not fall and crack. Carl ends up in a jungle where he comes across a big colorful bird named Kevin. Russel falls in love with the bird, however Carl finds the bird annoying like Russel. Carl soon finds out from dogs in search of Kevin that Kevin is wanted by Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz currently has a skeleton of a real bird like Kevin, but nobody believes him that it is real. Thus he wants it to prove to people that he is still a great explorer. However Carl realizes Kevin is the last specie of the bird, so he pities Kevin and tries to protect him.Carl does not forget about his dream. After the hardships of being forced into a retirement house, getting his house in the air, finding Russel on his doorstep, running into a thunderstorm, finding Kevin and trying to protect him, Carl continues to work towards his dream. These hardships do not stop Carl. Carl's determination to reach his goal is shown as he does not give up regardless of what obstacles he faces. He is also loyal towards Ellie, as he wants to fulfill their dream. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing motivation. The movie ""Up"" captures the picture of determination perfectly, it truly is an emotionally captivating and well made movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up there with the rest of the Pixar masterpieces,"There's a difference between Pixar and most of today's movie studios that makes it stick out like a rose in a sea of sore thumbs. The difference is that the first thing they do their best to get right is the story and the first thing they do to get that right is to find the story's heart. There are a lot of clever movies, scary movies, exciting movies, silly movies and just plain bad movies out there released year after year, but Pixar goes for the heart every time and there's just no replacement for movies that want to speak to people's hearts.The opening sequence in this movie is a series of images that another film-maker might have done as a series of flashbacks. It's a simple story of two people who have found that they must be near one another to be happy - true love. Where is true love in the other stories pumped out like mortar shells from the industry's product-connection and tie-in merchandise addled belly? It's rare these days. Sex, sure, flirtation, mawkish sentimentality, but love? 100 million stars for that sequence alone.The rest of it had me howling with laughter, as usual they just don't seem to be able to put a foot wrong.

Sentimental fairy tale,"Technically this is a wondrously perfected piece of animation. Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased. It's a lovely piece of work - but don't go with a child who has recently lost a grand parent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A real movie,"'Up', the latest delightful animated film from Pixar, combines whimsicality, beautiful graphics and a lot of laughs. It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good,"Is very good movie , i like it p is a 2009 American 3D computer-animated comedy-adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Pete Docter, the film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner) and an earnest young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai). By tying thousands of balloons to his home, 78-year- old Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of South America and to complete a promise made to his late lifelong love. The film was co- directed by Bob Peterson, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.Docter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.[3]Up was released on May 29, 2009 and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3D film to do so.[4] The film became a great financial success, accumulating over $731 million in its theatrical release. Up received critical acclaim, with most reviewers commending the humor and heart of the film. Edward Asner was praised for his portrayal of Carl, and a montage of Carl and his wife Ellie aging together was widely lauded. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and Pixar's first Best Picture nomination), following Beauty and the Beast (1991)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"I Have Just Met You, and I Love You!","Rarely does a film studio continue to produce such amazing films, and with the exception of Cars and A Bug's Life, Pixar has done just that. Year after year, Pixar has crafted masterpiece, after masterpiece. Certainly Up is no exception. My love affair with Pixar started with their first film, Toy Story. Pixar has never made a bad film and despite A Bug's Life and Cars not being amazing, they were still entertaining and being called the worst Pixar, is certainly no insult. Up is a masterclass in animation, it's a perfect film and definitely a big candidate for the best of the year. I would be hard pressed to see this leaving my top 5, let alone top 2. I can only see one film topping it, and it's going to take Thirst being another Park masterpiece to overcome Up.There's a very beautiful sequence at the beginning, it shows Carl, our hero of the story, growing up. I won't reveal any of the story, but at times it got me choked up. It's the kind of storytelling, and human emotions that a lot of filmmakers can't create. We next meet up with Carl, when he is much older. He goes about his morning routine, and there's a construction crew creating apartments outside his house. Carl returns to his home, after getting the mail. Soon after he settles down in his favourite chair, a little boy named Russell knocks at his door. Russell is a lovable character. He is very adorable, and newcomer Jordan Nagai does a wonderful job voicing him. Anyways, the next day, Carl unleashes his balloons and he leaves the city in hopes of traveling to South America, a childhood dream. Russell unexpectedly turns up on Carl's doorstep. When they arrive in South America, they meet Dug, the dog. Dug can talk because of the collar that his master built for him. Dug is amazing, he's probably one of the best characters Pixar has ever created. I still can't believe how much I laughed and fell in love with Dug, he was certainly a pleasant surprise.The film is a visual treat, the backgrounds are so full of detail. The film is just so colourful and so vivid. Though this comes expected of Pixar, and they certainly don't let down. The screenplay is brilliant, there are so many instances of bizarre humour, and there are so many different emotions. The film has it's share of depressing moments, but you before you become completely depressed, another moment lifts you up, and evokes a lot of joy in you. The voice work is excellent, Ed Asner is just as perfect as I thought he would be. There's just so much emotion in his voice alone, and the character design of Carl, fits Asner's voice perfectly. New comer Jordan Nagai is, as I said before, tremendous. He adds such a charm to Russell, an big adorable element if you will. Bob Peterson's voice work as both Dug and Alpha, had me side splitting laughing. He was perfect in every stretch of the imagination. With Monster's Inc and now Up under his belt, Pete Docter is one of the best Pixar directors. It's hard to decide between the big three, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird and Pete Docter. They are all equally amazing, and Pixar is a better studio for just having them on staff.Up is amazing, it's a movie I would see over and over again. Go see it now if you haven't, and if you have, see it again. It's the first masterpiece of 2009. A perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect movie, have I mentioned it's perfect? It would be easy to say the Oscars should take a break from Pixar, that is if Pixar would just stop producing so many masterpieces.10/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A fantastic adventure that shows the power of the imagination,"At the beginning of the film, it uses unrestrained creativity to catch the audience's eye - tens of thousands of balloons tied to the old house, dragging it out of the gravity and into the sky, this picture breaks the shackles of reality, so that the heart's desire for freedom and the unknown is instantly ignited.In this adventure, ""do not forget the original"" is the warm vein throughout. With a promise to his wife, Carl heads for Wonderland Falls. This dedication to the original heart has given fantasy adventures a deep emotional foundation. In the film, whether it is a colorful flying house or a talking dog, it is very imaginative, and it is also closely related to the plot.The film's plot hides deep insights into social phenomena, from the modern society's impact on traditional life to the fast-paced neglect of companionship, all of which are presented in a gentle and powerful way.This film deeply reveals the connotation of animated films: it is not only a form of building a fantasy world, but also a mirror reflecting reality and inspiring the soul.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Overrated and a Disgrace to Pixar,"I came into the movie with an open mind to the story and movie in general. I expected great things because Pixar has made some of the best animated movies ever. The only thing I actually enjoyed about this movie was the plot setup, as the first five minutes of the movie were very sentimental. However, this great setup was quickly turned over by countless ideas that were not appealing at all. I may have laughed only once in the entire movie as the humor could only be funny to small children. It saddens me that this movie could have been great but I was clearly the wrong target audience.I do not recommend this movie to anyone over 10 years old, anyone with a good taste of humor, or anyone who wants to keep their opinion of Pixar in tact.

Charming adventure fantasy,"Although I love animated movies, I somehow did not enjoy 'Up' as much the first time I watched it. Years later, I decided to watch it again. I admit to enjoying it more the second time around, but I still have mixed feelings about this one.The film begins (and ends, as it turns out) with such a sweet, yet sad story. We all have dreams when we're young and carefree, but when reality steps in, some of these dreams are brushed off as fantasies and we loose the enthusiasm to pursue our dreams. 'Up' depicts this to perfection, and I can certainly relate.The film then becomes a charming little fantasy adventure. I enjoyed the difference of opinion between the 78-year old hero, Carl, and the adventurer kid, who - as it turns out - was not quite as adventurous as he believed he was. The adventure element is exciting, although not in the least remotely realistic. Then again, this is a fantasy. They meet a lot of interesting characters along the way and despite numerous obstacles, Carl's determination is never doused.There's a lot to admire here, and I believe the film sends out a strong message. Maybe I'll watch it again after a few years, and who knows, might enjoy it even more then...",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Decent movie carried by its well-crafted opening.,"Even with its brilliant opening sequence, Up is kind of whatever. It has potential to be amazing, but the final product turned out to be a decent adventure movie, and I'm okay with that but, it could've been better. Script's fine, but it has some glimmers of really good writing. The character development with the main character is great and touching, especially that scene when Fredricksen opens the book near the end, finally being able to move on from the burden grief of his wife's death. The chemistry between the unlikely duo Russell and Fredricksen along with the funny sidekicks are wholesome to watch, visuals and score are amazing as always, one of the Giacchino's best for sure. The villain is just fine though, he's good enough but a forgettable one, and I'm on second viewing right now, but I still didn't get why this movie ranked among the best Pixar movie in the catalog.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

If not for those irritating dogs...,"I loved ""Up"": it is a great movie with some touching moments and a fantastic score. In particular the most impressive thing is the narration of the love story between Mr. Fredricksen and Ellie that is powerful even without a word because of the music and of the inspired images. The general idea of the movie is very original and the plot does a great job in entertaining the viewer. The characters are relatable and well characterised. It would have been truly an amazing movie if not for those dogs. They are so frustrating because they are so childish in a bad way. Being for children is not a problem and indeed I love animated movies but these dogs were terrible and they are used like the random NPCs you have to fight against in every videogame. And this is very bad because the messages that the movie tries to convey are important and mature and the dogs are really out of place.

An amusing and unusual group of adventurers,"In the beginning of the animated film, Up, we are introduced to two young, enthusiastic and very different children who share a passion for traveling and their hero, renowned traveler and explorer Charles Muntz. This connection leads Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, and Ellie to become best friends as well as husband and wife. Their passion for travel never abates and they spend their life saving money to travel to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately, as it often does, life gets in the way and their dream is never reached.Fast forward many years and we find an old, stubborn, grouchy Carl as the world has changed rapidly and left him disgruntled and refusing to change with it, reminiscent of Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon in Grumpier Old Men. Refusing to sell his house he mistakenly causes harm to someone, which gets him in trouble with the law and he is forced to live in a retirement community. Refusing to let this get in his way, he manages to inflate thousands of balloons tied to his house, which causes his how to rise up and float away. His destination: Paradise Falls. It's at this point that the theme of the movie really begins to pick up: no matter what happens, life goes on and you should enjoy every minute of it because you don't know what will happen next.While flying to Paradise Falls, he hears a knock on his door, and unbeknownst to him, a local member of the ""Wilderness Explorers"", Russell has accidentally been brought along. Having no choice but to bring Russell along, he navigates them safely through a massive thunderstorm and almost arrived at his destination. Many balloons were lost in the storm and although still floating, it is not able to fly at high altitudes so Carl and Russell must drag the house to its final location.On the trek across the mountainous terrain Carl and Russell encounter an exotic bird and a talking dog that is trying to capture the bird and return it to his master. During this trip the exotic bird runs away because they encounter many other talking dogs and they are escorted to a remote cave where Carl is united with his idol, Charles Muntz, who has spent the better part of his life searching for the elusive exotic bird that has befriend the group. Upon learning this Carl finally shows some emotion and spends the remainder of the film trying to prevent Charles from harming the bird.This film used amazing computer graphics and enhanced colors to bring a mesmerizing setting to the viewer's eye. The focal point of this movie was the balloons that Carl used to float his house away and you can tell special attention was given to the creation and design to create an impressive display on the screen. The vividness they used also translated into Carl and his grumpy face and the transformation he goes through and without this superior artwork, they would have been unable to truly capture the essence of Up and the central theme of the film of how life goes on and to not waste a minute of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up,"PIXAR has done it again! A wonderful, clean, family fun film for all ages to see. PIXAR have gone down the more emotional route which is interesting as it will widen the target audience as it is slightly more mature but it really helps with our understanding the character of grumpy Carl. We understand what he has been through and truly empathise with him. There is great character development and PIXAR have managed to create substantial, likable and funny characters. Such as Russel the cute, chubby, quirky kid who tags along with Carl for the adventure of a lifetime. There is Kevin the bird who simply steals the show, Kevin is really funny and very likable (Kevin is so cool) Doug the dog is genius, PIXAR managed to capture the characteristics of a dog in his voice and Carl goes on a character journey along with the audience.

Pixar At Its Peak,"One of those very special movies that can hit you in your feelings just the right way. From the very start you become attached to the characters very quickly and feel invested in their story. The beauty of this movie is that everyone can understand its messages and while it can make you want to tear up at times it is also so sweet that it ends up making you smile just as much. The bonds that form between the characters are unique and while the movie itself isn't long you feel an understanding and connection to each persons story.The only complaint I have about it was that the dogs that are the villains can become a bit annoying and maybe get too much airtime for what they offer. On the other hand, I'm sure a 5 year old would laugh every time a dog said ""squirrel"" and got scared. The movie of course is meant for children and this would definitely provide comedic relief for them. However, with that being said , despite my love for this movie, I haven't felt the need to watch any of the Doug spinoffs movies/shorts.All in all it is simply one of the greatest animated films made in my view .

correcting the over-inflated praise,"""Up"" is merely fine. There is little to like or dislike. The story isn't particularly engaging, and everything is fairly predictable. The jokes are bland and good for little more than a smirk. But the cartoon wasn't preachy, as animated movies seem to have become in recent years. I saw the 3-D version, and I wasn't particularly impressed. Although the 3-D provides added depth, the effect was very subtle. I was hoping for something that popped out of the screen more. I see no need for understatement in a 3-D cartoon, especially one that leans so heavily on the fantastic and implausible. In short, I'm confused by all the praise this movie has gotten, and I think the 3-D version is a waste of time and money. And to put this within the top 20 movies of all time on IMDb (its current ranking) is absurd.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up and away by my beautiful balloons,"Just watching this film on the box some while after it was originally screened, I had heard of it but not even seen as much as a trailer.I thoroughly enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to everybody to watch.Enjoy and take off with Charles and Russell on their rollicking adventures.Seeing Charles Fredricksen on the movie's posters and possibly, on the trailer one may mistake him for a crusty old fart.Had I seen this film when I was much younger, I may well have made that mistake n error of judgement.But seeing it now at my advanced years of 72, I get a different perspective on it altogether.I may not be Charles age yet, but I am nearer to it than I am to Russell's.This has to be seen from the start the opening portion is essential, to be able to fully appreciate exactly who Charles Fredricksen is.We can then see his tale with his entire rationale the life he has with his soul mate Ellie, from their childhood friendship to old age.Anyone who has travelled that road can appreciate his life and loss, when she has finally gone from his world leaving only an existence.He may well have settled like so many others like him for a 'Retirement Village' but what a misnomer that phrase actually is.They are really nothing of the kind but actually one step away, from an old foggies mausoleum.Representing what so often occurs when you cross that portal, a gradual process of ossification.Charles Fredricksen is saved from that fate worst than death by nothing short of serendipity, but is it by the narrowest of margins.Who at any age especially at mine wouldn't wish to simply cast off the moorings, of your earthbound existence and float off to pastures new?",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Up (2009),"If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film.

While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest. Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor.

Up = maybe a little over inflated.,"Up in my opinion is probably the weakest film in the Pixar collection. There was never the ""magic"" moment for me which is always created in the other films. Don't get me wrong Up is a very enjoyable film but didn't quite push the right buttons.The plot confuses me a lot as it starts off very sombre (i had a tear in my eye at one point) and then transforms into something mainly for the kids, so it doesn't blend the 2 together as we are used to. So the kids will hate the first half, and adults will find the second half maybe a little silly.There are lots of funny jokes in here that serve both sets of viewers. And the voice acting is superb and spot on. You just got to love the Doberman ;)The characters, animation and general design are all out of the top drawer as normal for Pixar but i made the mistake of seeing this in 3D.....if you are charged extra to see it in 3D don't! The movie has no scenes of ""3Dness"" of the likes found in Ice Age 3, and Aliens Vs Monsters to name a couple. Even Valentines day Masacre made a better use of 3D, and for me seemed to just be thrown in ""cos 3D films are doing well this year"".Overall good film...........but.................even now i cant explain why it isn't as good as the others.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A great movie - very funny.,"Pixar brings us another blockbuster and, as always, their quality is UP.The movie is preceded by the typical Pixar short, this one called ""Partly Cloudy"" which is one of the best ever. Oscar stuff! As for the movie, it is not only funny but also quite heavy on emotions. It deals with life as a hole and many small children will make some hard questions to their parents after watching this.However, these subjects are dealt with gracefully and those question would need answers eventually. Pixar's just doing you a favor! I found two flaws in it that take the perfect 10 away (like WALLE deserved):1 - Not Pixar's fault, but the Portuguese distributor decided that the 3D version would be in Portuguese only. Most ""grown-ups"" I know wanted to see the subbed one with the English voices (as we usually see movies in Portugal) but instead we had to miss out on the original voice work to get 3D. VERY disappointing.2 - The movie is a little unbalanced. The first 15 minutes of the movie brought the hole theater close to tears (it's that good! - lots of grown man crying). The rest of the movie could never recapture the emotional weight of those first few minutes... loads of laughs though! Definitely worth viewing independently of your age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A masterful tale with meaning to boot!,"Up manages to bridge that gap between a simple story and a meaningful concept behind the veil of magical effects and imagery which (from the onset) captures your imagination and makes you believe this story all the more.The presence of such perfected 'animated' cinematography (beautiful surroundings, landscapes etc.) brings to mind only one outstanding feature of this film.The intelligence behind donating an entire scene which captures a lifetime of partnership without the use of a single word is pure genius. Not to mention excellently executed. This is what stood out most for me.The tale of partnership, family difficulties, lifelong promises, hopes, dreams and what's most important to ones self is told in a way that makes you shed a tear in joy for the beauty that is this film.This is a TRUE FAMILY MOVIE! one that will keep the children entertained with a few laughs along the way and one that will surely give adults pause for thought.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Worst high-budget film I've ever seen,"I (a 16 YO female)was personally really disappointed with ""Up"", as was my mom who saw it with me.

Well, turns out our time would have been better spent elsewhere.I thought it was cute, but all the jokes were the ones where I would turn to my mom and tell her the punchline before the joke was halfway said, and about 40 minutes from the end told her what would happen, and she agreed.In terms of ""Best Disney/Pixar Movie Ever Made"", I'm still waiting for something to top ""Finding Nemo.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Up, Up in the Air with My Beautiful Balloon","As they did in ""Wall-E,"" the Pixar team creates an opening twenty minutes or so of movie in ""Up"" that in itself is a small masterpiece of streamlined narrative film-making, and if it doesn't leave you reduced to a puddle of dribbly tears by the time it's over, you have a heart of stone. However, also as in ""Wall-E"" but even more so here, the first part of the movie is so skillfully crafted that it leaves the rest of it somewhat lacking.I feel like the Pixar filmmakers are trying too hard to satisfy two different audiences with the same movie. ""Up"" is about very adult issues -- dealing with the loss of a life partner, the obsolescence of old age -- crammed around a not-all-that-interesting adventure comedy story designed to delight the kiddies. ""Wall-E"" suffered from the same syndrome slightly; but the theme of environmental awareness in that film was universal enough, and integrated wholly enough into the action sequences, that the schizophrenia of it all was easy to overlook. In ""Up,"" I would have preferred to just continue the story that's set up in the opening moments without the kid movie tangent, and that's what ultimately made ""Up"" a much less memorable viewing experience for me than other recent Pixar films.I wonder how long it will be before Pixar forms a unit that makes animated films strictly for adults, as they seem to want to.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Sky pilots, how high can you fly?","Now here's an unusual movie. Pete Docter's ""Up"" portrays elderly Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) attaching balloons to his house and sailing it to a South American waterfall and finding even more than he bargained for. I've never been a fan of Disney, but this one had some out-of-the-ordinary stuff (for a Disney movie, that is), namely when Carl scornfully calls someone a hippie. As far as I can tell, the major theme is the completion of long-standing promises - Carl's deceased wife had long dreamed of going to the waterfall - and Carl's return from the brink of total senility.All in all, ""Up"" is not my favorite movie, but worth seeing.

A colorful delight.,"My favorite Pixar movies are the ones who have (in my opinion) the very best characters. Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, etc. My least favorites are the few that have the most uninteresting characters, like Cars. Not to say that Cars is a bad movie, but it didn't leave a memorable impression on me like those other movies did. Up fits somewhere in-between those two categories. It has some great characters, they just don't happen to be the main ones.I'll just come out and admit it - I thought Russell was an annoying little brat. Carl was a likable enough protagonist, but Russell really hurt the movie, for me. Kevin and Dug, on the other hand, are a big part of why I still ended up liking the movie a good bit. They're some of the most flat-out hilarious characters that Pixar has ever made. Most of the comedy in Up involves one of those two animals, in some way.This is a beautiful movie, no one can deny that. It's so bright, vivid and colorful, that anyone who's watching it on DVD or an SDTV is really missing out. Up is basically a commercial for running out to get a shiny new HDTV and a Blu-Ray player.

At least Toy Story had a semi-credible story line and Finding Nemo made sense from beginning to end. We wasted $9 apiece for this piece of dreck!

UP!-emotional take on friendships,"UP! Is a Disney Pixar movie released in 2009 with Pete Docter as the director. The movie was based on an old man named Carl Fredricksen who was a balloon salesman. His dream was to tie a bunch of balloons to his house and fly away to the wilderness. However, as he begins to fulfill this dream he stumbles upon a boy, Russell. Throughout the movie they live out an adventure, and learn to value the true meaning of the individuals around us. Learning how we sometimes lose sight of how important the people around us are until they are gone.A few of the main stars in this movie were like stated above Pete Docter as the director, Edward Asner as Carl, and Jordan Nagai as Russell. One big theme of this movie is relationships. It can be easy to lose sight of those around us, and easy to take those relationships for granted. However, Relationships are a huge part of the adventures that are taken throughout life. Friendship is shown throughout the movie, and is established well through the scenes.Another aspect of friendship that is shown is friendship through age. The story of Carl and Ellie is depicted in the movie. This friendship grew with age, starting off with them being young and moving forward with their relationship into their senior years. This friendship in particular gave us a sense of emotion throughout the movie. Another film that is similar to UP! Id Luca. Luca is a newer film that explores the theme of friendship, and how they can inspire us.Two techniques that were obvious throughout the film were camera angle and lighting. Camera angle in this movie was important due to all the different views needed. Oftentimes Carl and Russell were in the air, and with that the camera angle needed to be different than when they were on the ground. With Carl and Russell being in the wilderness at times and in the air the lighting needed to be adjusted. The director did a great job of using the lighting technique when in those different scenes.To conclude, the theme of friendship is important for individuals of all ages to learn. It helps younger individuals to learn about the importance. For older individuals it is a good reminder to cherish the friendships we have made along the way. With that being said, UP! Is a great watch for individuals of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

However, as a serious movie, it attempts to incorporate childlike fantasy elements and sometimes the rigors of logical and reasonable cause and effect go out the window which would be no problem in a traditional animated movie directed towards young people. But ""Up"" in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
inspirational film......should watch it.....,one of the best animated films I have seen until now......when I started to watch this movie the first few minutes make me feel hopeless about life......it just the director want the audience to see the cruel reality of life......it may seem to an audience that he can predict the end of this movie by seeing the first 15 to 25 minutes......but what happens after that time will amuse anyone.....the work of the animation was good......the script was better....and the expression of voice of all characters was perfect.....in one word this movie is full of adventure and thrill.....thanks to director Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for making such good film...though I consider this as an inspirational film......,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Warm and moving.,"At the beginning of the film, the review of the life of the old couple is undoubtedly the biggest tear point. They lived a very good and happy life. When they are old, they still love each other deeply.

Up is not my favorite,"Up is not my favorite Pixar movie, but I welcome its arrival. I'd rather see dozens of movies like this than one more ugly sequel to Shrek or Madagascar or Ice Age. Pixar views their films as creative and artistic endeavors; Dreamworks and Fox see theirs as products. With Pixar, it's about the movie. With most other animated features, it's about the marketing. There are some great moments in Up, and it may be the funniest thing Pixar has done in a long time, but even the aspects of Up that lack greatness are not bad, and that's worth applaudingUp falls under the umbrella of a tried-and-true formula: the old man/young kid ""buddy film."" This may be, however, the first time this Hollywood staple has been translated effectively into an animated format. As with most movies of this sort, the old guy - 78-year old Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Asner) - is a grumpy sort: set in his ways and not welcoming of strangers. The young guy - cub scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) - is full of innocence and wide-eyed optimism. During the course of the film, the two bond and learn from one another although, as is often the case, Carl's schooling strikes a little deeper. The boy who is a nuisance at the beginning has become a valued companion by the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The spirit of adventure,"I was surprised to find that this film goes beyond animation in its design execution and even its visuals.We see Carl Frederickson (voice of Edward Asner) spending his life planning a great adventure. His boyhood girlfriend Ellie shares his dream, they grow old together, and many local adventures drain the big adventure funds of money and time. Soon Carl finds he is alone in an alien world and makes an effort to fulfill his and his late wife's dream.The story gets a little more complicated as he finds an unexpected stowaway and new friends. Soon he is forced to realize what is important in life and finds that he has already fulfilled, Ellie's new adventures by living life together.There is so much depth of thought and dimension of the story that you could forget it is animated.I only saw the Blu-ray version and there are more than enough extras and adjustments you can make.

Pixar takes forced sentimentality to new heights,"As with Wall-E, I couldn't help but feel less than enthusiastic while viewing UP. It's a well put together package, of course, but rarely have I felt that the emotional responses the film makers were going for were so forced. Many of the bits were amusing, and many came off as trite and trying way too hard to inject some humor or cuteness into the proceedings. For a viewer such as me, simply parading cute looking characters on the screen is not enough to warrant the masterpiece status that Pixar seems to get with each film. That being said, the film was beautiful to look at, no argument here. It had some moments that truly clicked, such as the opening montage. In fact, as predictable as the movie's story arc was, the first third of UP was enjoyable.The one thing that really did bother me during my viewing was that I consistently had to say to myself ""it's only a kids movie."" Which is fine and all, but should a movie with such mainstream and critical acceptance really need this sort of free pass to be considered great? It seemed a scene couldn't go by without a major continuity error (by the way, WHY ARE THERE CONTINUITY ERRRORS IN AN ANIMATED MOVIE) or some new level of ridiculousness that betrayed the previous set rules of the film's universe. It was as if I was playing a kids game where the rules keep changing. I expected the overbearing sentimental themes seen in the beginning and end, but between the physics involved in an old man pulling a hose along by a garden hose and the whole ridiculous talking dog storyline it eventually came to a breaking point. There are ways to show sentimentality in a way that doesn't obviously manipulate the viewer, and pointing this out doesn't mean I don't enjoy an emotional story arc. Give me Finding Nemo or Monsters Inc any day over a film like this, which seemingly exists for those that need inspiration to be beat over their head repeatedly for 90 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Simply amazing...,"""Up"" is an Animation - Drama movie in which we follow Carl Fredricksen, an elderly widower, who embarks on a thrilling journey to fulfill a promise to his late wife, Ellie. Along the way, Carl unintentionally brings a young boy, Russell, into his adventure as they travel to South America in a house lifted by balloons.I enjoyed this movie very much because it was visually stunning, with vibrant animation that brought the world to life, from the lush landscapes to the whimsical flying house. The movie contained and combined both emotionally powerful moments and comic moments. It's an adventure filled with laughs, tears, and unforgettable moments. Lastly, I have to say that ""Up"" is an amazing movie with beautiful, emotional moments and an important life lesson. It also presents many themes like love, loss, and the importance of embracing life's unexpected adventures so, I highly recommend it to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An animated masterpiece,"This is probably my favourite Pixar movie to date. I loved 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles' but 'Up' is in another league - quite simply outstanding. It's an emotional roller-coaster of a film, which is a remarkable achievement in itself for an animated feature, but Pixar rarely fails to deliver.The story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh. It is also visually stunning and I would love to see it again in 3D one day.This is as close to perfection as an animated movie has come and it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all.

A complete Pixar film that broadcasts a positive message for the surrogate family,"Our colorful adventure is a combination of Virginia Lee Burtons' famous childhood book, ""The Little House"", where the house is a character and introduced as such immediately. Another part is a crass take on the Karate Kid without the wisdom. A loner kid of divorce is taken in by a senior citizen who blah, blah, blah (they fix/complete each other). Yet another part is the children's typical movie where kids stop the poachers and sing ""Kumbayah"". And we start off fast.In less than 12 minutes our idealistic and naive 8 year old boy meets his future wife, we watch their generational dreams go through life's twists and turns, and we're left with a grumpy 78 year old man who is a cab ride from being placed in a retirement home. Brutal. Kids have a hard time with this drama. ""Nowhere To Go But Up"" may have been a more meaningful title.Then comes the boy and then the adventure. The story is a modern family testament, where who ever can fill a family role is considered family. The void itself is predicated as victim hood which being connected to others helps fill.

"Heart-breaking, heart-warming visually stunning masterstroke from Pixar","""Up"" is a Pixar movie, directed by Pete Doctor and Bob Peterson, which they both wrote with Tom McCarthy too. It has a run time of 96 minutes and was released in the UK in 2009 with a U rating. Featuring the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, and Jordan Nagai this is an absolutely charming movie that is suitable for both a younger audience looking for fun, and a more sentimental older audience that still has a sense of adventure too.Bespectacled Carl Fredricksen idolizes the famous explorer and adventurer Charles Muntz. He learns that Muntz was discredited after it was proved that he faked the skeleton of his recent find, but this does not dampen young Carl's spirits too much as one day he'd like to follow in his hero's footsteps. Muntz was last seen boarding his blimp to go in search of the real bird to salvage his reputation and career. Carl bumps into Ellie, a young girl who shares his passion for Muntz and they soon make a promise to one day follow in his footsteps and head out to Paradise Falls in South America. Carl and Ellie fall in love, they get married, they get jobs as Balloons salesman and a zookeeper respectively, and they grow old together blissfully albeit with some hiccups along the way. Realising that they have not fulfilled their ambition of moving to Paradise Falls Carl buys tickets and plans to surprise Ellie with them. Unfortunately, Ellie's declining health puts her in hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl heartbroken and alone. Carl shuts himself away from the world and becomes a sour recluse - as an example, one day a boy scout called Russell comes calling, suggesting that he helps Carl out around the house so he can work towards his 'help the elderly' badge, but Carl tricks him with some silly task to get rid of him. The city which grew around Carl wants his house gone and eventually a court order wants to force him into a retirement home. Before he can be bundled away though the crafty old ex-Balloon puts a plan into motion which allows him to escape with his house - he uses as many balloons as he can get and floats the house away. Unfortunately, though, Carl is not alone, an accidental stowaway is with him - Russell, who was under the porch. They end up in South America where they meet a bird which Russell calls Kevin, they meet a talking dog called Dug, and they also meet Muntz. All of which, the bird, the dog, and Muntz are linked. If the adventure was not started when the house floated away, then it's definitely a-foot with Muntz back in the game.This film is beautifully created, the animation and colour palette is vibrant and gorgeous. The attention to, and presentation of detail is absolutely first class. The imaginative story is a fun adventure combining fantasy, comedy, suspense, and emotions. While it is fun for children to watch the floating house and the talking dog, this film is multi-layered too, and definitely one for adults too. I am not ashamed to admit it, but this film is an absolute tear-jerker at the beginning. I must be getting soft in my middle age, and perhaps too many horror films have broken me, but this film genuinely made me shed a tear. The voice acting in this is brilliant and really helps to compliment and bring to life the beautifully stunning imagery. In Carl, Edward Asner presents a grumpy but sweet and sincere old character who feels familiar to me. Jordan Nagai as the voice of Russell is enthusiastic and passionate and really drives life into old Carl again.Unless you don't have a heart of stone expect a roller coaster of emotions; you will laugh, you will cry, and by the end of the movie you will have experienced one of the best Pixar movies in my opinion. As well as being a box-office hit which easily recouped its budget (and then some!) this film has become a bit of a cult movie due to its heart breaking and then heart-warming ability. I am glad I got to watch this film and it has cemented a place in my movie collection for its content and its beauty. I am happy to recommend this to people of all ages, and I am happy to give this a solid 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very Emotional,The first few moments really capture what this movie is going to be about. I feel like there is lost of times in the movie were it shows life changes Carl has to go through. The movie does even try to have a less emotional based story near the end.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotions Before Story,"Up is a bit of an anomaly in the sense that it's got emotional potential, but the primary scene in which most viewers report breaking down in tears (the first 10 minutes) provoked absolutely no emotion in me. Truth be told, there wasn't enough context and interaction between the characters to develop any kind of emotional resonance with them, and therefore when you watch the lives of Carl and Ellie unfold, there's really nothing more there for me than a series of events strung together in a mini anthology. And so, going into this film, I was of the impression that the only thing the film had going for itself was in those first ten minutes.
However, that's not the case. This movie gets its emotion in ways that are a lot more subtle, and the tears don't flow for me until nearer the conclusion, as is the case with a lot of Pixar films. It's not a ""sob for the last half-hour"" kind of film like, for instance, Coco was, but the emotional moments are genuinely sweet, and the tears are certainly warranted.
The story is quite weak. Coming from the production company that managed to make a cowboy doll coming to life feel like a character we know and love, the fact that this story crosses the line is borderline hysterical. It's not the story itself that drags the movie down; it's more in the execution and I couldn't help but wonder if, from any other studio, this film might've been a complete flop. The plot (particularly the final act) feels underdeveloped; it could've used another handful of meetings to brainstorm better ideas. When it comes to defeating the antagonist, everything happens relatively suddenly and feels dissatisfying.
The voice acting is okay, but...
SQUIRREL!
...it gets annoying at times, particularly Russell. The kid is nothing short of insufferable and, although you're only with him for about an hour, you just want to see Carl throw him off the deck of the house at every possible instance.
In conclusion, Up is an okay film, but it's bordering on average. It doesn't mean it's one you should skip, but from a studio with the track record of Pixar, this is definitely more of a miss than their previous work. Beautifully animated and scored, the plot is thin and lacking enough substance to truly leave any sort of lasting impact despite the sickly-sweet emotional segments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Beautiful Movie,Up is a Great Movie about Showing a Lifetime of a Couple & how's they Grew. Anyway Up is one of Pixar's most Beautiful Movies.

Heartfelt and very imaginative.,"Pixar's Up is a heartfelt and very imaginative animated film, where 78 year-old Carl Fredricksen makes a promise to his carefree wife Elle that he will travel to Paradise Falls in South America. Faced with being sent to a retirement home, Carl seeks to fulfill his promise to Elle and journeys to South America up in his house, pulled by tons of balloons, with a wilderness scout stowaway in tow.The animation is bright and brilliant and the story will tug at your heart strings, especially during the first part of the movie where we see Carl and Elle's love and bond for each other, and then years later when we see an aged Carl facing loneliness and moping about in his house. It makes you feel for the elderly and makes you think of your own family.The second half of the movie is more adventure and action oriented, with overly imaginative elements like talking dogs with beeping collars. While I know this is a fantasy movie, the talking dogs do overshadow the heartfelt element and slows down the story quite a bit. I felt that it turned into just another animated movie about animals at times.But, what's also wonderful about the movie is the relationship between Carl and the scout stowaway, Russell. He's the all-around innocent and inquisitive kid who wants to help Carl to earn his helping-the-elderly badge. But, their interaction with each other grows into friendship throughout the movie and is heartfelt.Overall, it's a movie that will have you reminiscing and missing the ""good ol' days"" but will also cheer you on in search of new adventures.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"A movie that makes you cry, laugh and everything in between.","""Up,"" the 2009 animated film from Pixar, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. With its heartwarming storytelling, dazzling animation, and profound emotional depth, it's a film that deserves nothing less than a perfect 10/10 rating.At its core, ""Up"" is a story about love, adventure, and the journey of life itself. We follow the endearing character of Carl Fredricksen, a widowed elderly man, who embarks on an extraordinary journey to fulfill a lifelong dream. His unlikely companion, a young wilderness explorer named Russell, adds an element of humor and heart to the story that is both heartwarming and relatable.The film's emotional resonance is its crowning achievement. In the first 10 minutes, ""Up"" manages to tell a poignant love story that tugs at your heartstrings and sets the emotional tone for the entire film. This opening sequence alone is a testament to the storytelling prowess of Pixar and the emotional depth that animated films can achieve.Visually, ""Up"" is a feast for the eyes. The attention to detail in the animation is remarkable, from the lifelike textures of the characters to the breathtaking landscapes of Paradise Falls. The vibrant color palette and attention to visual storytelling enhance the overall experience.Michael Giacchino's musical score is a perfect complement to the film, elevating its emotional impact and underscoring the sense of wonder and adventure that permeates the story.""Up"" is a film that appeals to all ages. It delivers a powerful message about the importance of pursuing our dreams, cherishing our loved ones, and finding adventure in unexpected places. It reminds us that it's never too late to go on a grand adventure or to make a connection that changes our lives.In conclusion, ""Up"" is not just an animated film; it's a work of art that resonates with audiences on a deep emotional level. It combines humor, adventure, and heartfelt storytelling to create a truly magical cinematic experience. ""Up"" earns a well-deserved 10/10 rating and stands as a timeless classic in the world of animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Something for everyone,"This is a charming movie, agree with most of the other posted comments. As a former resident of Venezuela, it was also great to see the tepuis (flat-topped mountains) of the Gran Sabana to the south of the country represented in the movie. Paradise Falls, are of course Angel Falls, the tallest on earth, falling off Ayuntepui mountain, and Charles Muntz, the villain of the story, has his resonance in Professor Challenger of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous book ""The Lost World"". In the book published in 1912, Challenger also finds a rare animal, in this case a prehistoric flying reptile, on a journey to South America. He reports his discovery back in London but is ridiculed, and returns to capture the beast and bring it back to prove his skeptics wrong. Conan Doyle is widely believed to have taken the tepuis of Venezuela as his inspiration for the book, specifically the huge mountain of Roraima whose summit has exactly the same rain and wind shaped rock formations that appear in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"After three lesser entries, well deserved","Pixar has, in my opinion, delivered the finest computer animated films to date. However, Pixar's three entries before this film (""Cars,"" ""Ratatoille,"" and ""Wall-E"", though most people will disagree with me on the last one) were, I feel, lesser entries. The last three did not have the overall appeal value that the previous films (""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" etc) had. ""Up"" is a pleasant surprise in nearly every way. What a fantastic concept this film has, featuring a house floated away by a massive amount of small helium-filled balloons (I mean, who doesn't think it would be neat to have their house fly?) Of course, a great concept deserves an equally well-written plot and screenplay, and this film pulls off both of those. The film involves Carl, an old man trying to keep his late wife's dream alive by going to Paradise Falls to prove that their childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz, was not lying when he said he had traveled there. Along the way, he picks up a young boy scout and a few animals to continue the journey together. This film features who is probably the all-time greatest movie dog character, Dug, a dog who says just what he thinks due to his automated voice collar. What a brilliant concept, rather than the overused one involving animals talking with moving lips. There's too much to share about this film in one review, but the most important thing to say is that I recommend it. It's visually stunning and full of laughs, excitement, and real emotion, with characters we learn to care about. If you're one of the few people who hasn't seen it yet, now's the time, while it's still in theaters.***1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Flawed Film from the Pixar Assembly Line,"When ""Tin Toy"" and other animated shorts first appeared from Pixar, it was like a breath of fresh air in the world of CGI. Instead of more robots, they boldly took on the challenge of rendering natural subjects, including human beings. The slightly drunken-looking wobbling of some characters (maybe, again, to avoid the precise, laws-of-physics appearance of most other computer animations of that time) was a bit distracting, but the images of flexible objects (like babies) were break-through accomplishments.Now, almost thirty years later, the technology has advanced considerably (close-ups in ""Up"" of fabric, fur, and hair, are stunning). But, it looks as though Pixar has hired one set of CGI characters and now has them all fulfilling their multi-movie contracts. If you saw ""The Incredibles,"" you will feel as though you've seen these characters before (perhaps, if you've also seen ""Toy Story,"" the same way you felt you'd seen those characters before when you saw ""The Incredibles""). In a way, even ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"" look like they all came from the same factory as this film. Well, they did, but... why should they? The exaggerated features, cartoonish proportions, and overstated gaits (a kind of bunny-hop if the character is young, a Frankenstein's-monster sort of lumber, if elderly) are starting to look very familiar. (Although, inexplicably, given how far the technology has come, the designers feel compelled to include elements, such as Mr. Frederick's slightly polygonal ears, that appear to be concessions to the computer's historical role in films of this kind.)The story itself is flawed, alas. No spoilers here, but it did seem that the main character's emotional responses to events around him were inconsistent, as were his physical abilities. He chooses sides in the (dramatically necessary) conflict, but not the one it seemed that he would have, at least not at first. Also, while the idea that he can fly his house via thousands of helium balloons is well within the accepted tropes of the cartoon genre, it lingers on way too long and becomes an intrusively absurd aspect of the whole film, with scene after scene making it harder and harder not to say, ""Oh, come on now!"" In fairness, there are a couple of moments that will bring tears to adult eyes, proving that this medium really can deliver emotional content. If only there were more of that, and less of the outright nonsense, I'd have scored this film much higher.Pixar broke the mold, decades ago. But now they've replaced it with a new one. What once seemed so daring and new, has become ho-hum and commonplace. A cynic, just maybe, would say, ""Hey, they know what sells."" A shame, given that an animator--using a computer or not--is, in the end, not limited by the laws of physics, but only by our willingness to suspend our disbelief.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Up, up. Then sideways a bit, then down with a bump.","I'm giving it a five because I thought the film was visually stunning and that Pixar were brave to make it so bittersweet. However the film for me failed on every level. If it was for kids then my seven year old was asking how long to go after ten minutes (If it is any good we generally get to thirty). My four year old was in tears when we had to explain that the brilliant goofy exploreress had grown old and died. She then proceeded to ask questions about her all through the film. If there was supposed to be something for adults then the ones in my party left the cinema feeling depressed and not just because they had wasted two hours of their lives and their hard earned cash.It is alright to willingly suspend your disbelief if a context is created whereby you happily do so, however this film doesn't create that context. We watch a decrepit, frustrated old man on the point of being taken to the old people's home spend the next hour or so dragging a floating house around the Andes. I won't go into the stupid bird, the immortal zeppelin adventurer who turns out to be an electronics whizz/dog breeder/dog trainer and the pointless and contrived action sequences because I'll just end up punching a mirror. I thought the golden rule in cinema was Less is More.Unfortunately Up is more or less.Reading the other comments on these boards I become profoundly suspicious, because it seems to me there are innumerable highly intelligent individuals making acute and incisive observations as to how extraordinarily brilliant a lot of extraordinarily mediocre films are. Their observations are generally so profound that i am left agape how anybody of such obvious intelligence would award any film ten out ten, least of all dross like this.

people confuse up with the first 10 minutes of up,Not gonna lie this movie is a great movie with awesome music but the first 10 minutes of the movie made me cry but the rest didn't do it as great as the first 10 mins the humor is funny and sharp the animation is Super duper gorgeous the characterisation is great from the furr on the dogs to the characters faces the villain is not as good as the villain in ratatouille or in monsters inc. also the characters are great and it being nominated for best picture is a bit of an overeating it's not that great it is awesome but not best picture level of awesome its not as good as parasite or thr godfather or even goodfellas but it's a must watch family movie with a few problems it is a solid 8 out of 10,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Good Story,"I can't believe that I'm reviewing a cartoon; but what the hell, maybe my second childhood is near. Carl Fredricksen(Ed Asner) was a lonely little boy who worships an explorer named Charles Muntz, a man who was disgraced for faking the discovery of a big bird in Venezuela. He meets Ellie, a neighbor who shares his passion for nature. When they grow up they marry, but are unable to have children. He sells balloons and she works at a zoo. They have always intended to travel to South America to verify Muntz's claims to clear his name. The best laid plans of mice and men prevent it and Elle dies, leaving Carl alone. His house is surrounded by a new development, but he refuses to leave. He injures a construction worker in a dispute, and receives an eviction notice.He comes up with the idea to attach thousands of helium balloons to lift the house into the air and fly it to Venezuela and fulfill his dream of finding Muntz's bird. He takes off with a stowaway, Russell, who is trying to earn a merit badge by helping the elderly. They meet a non flying bird and a talking dog along the way. They make it to their destination and find Muntz living in a zeppelin. They end up in a fight over the bird and, not to worry, this is a children's story, so all's well that ends well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Up: Just Fine,"Pixar's newest and arguably most well received film, Up swept the world with its mix of comedic and dramatic elements. Positively received by critics and crowds alike, it comes with a daunting reputation.Carl Fredricksen is a curmudgeonly pensioner, living alone in an increasingly urbanised environment following the death of his wife. When construction work damages his DIY mailbox, Carl strikes out, and is condemned to a retirement home as a result. Unwilling to leave his home, he uses thousands of balloons to lift the house away and fly to South America, as he once planned with his wife.The first ten to fifteen minutes of Up have become amongst the most famous scenes in recent cinematic history. Conveying a life of love and loss without words in such a short and simple scene, Pixar may well have accomplished their best work here. It is endearing, emotional, and engaging, immediately allowing us to forgive Carl's gruff exterior and meanness. After the involving start, however, things begin to follow a standard formula, with wicked villain, threatening henchmen, catchphrases and general conventions of children's films. This may be appropriate, given that the film is just that, but the potential purveyed in the opener unfortunately goes largely untapped. The remainder of Up, following its strong start, simply fails to live up to what it might have been. Jokes are mildly amusing, plot is insufficiently entertaining, characters are less than enduring. Though it functions just fine as a children's movie, it leaves a sense of disappointment behind it.With a strong start, Up promises much but fails to deliver the best. Entertaining despite this, it works as a way to pass the time and entertain the kids. Its beginning taken as a short might have made Pixar's best film, but as a whole it keeps the audience happy, if not thrilled.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Professional, and unique","The story is interesting and immersing; the directing is really good, there's no propaganda, and the animations are great. 'Didn't care alot for the ending, it was too childish. One of the best animated movies I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Technically beautiful, great concept, great beginning...then question marks","This film is a marvelous technical achievement. The digital animation is outstanding, possibly the best ever achieved. And with a film budget exceeding $170 million, you would expect nothing less.The basic plot is great and rich with pathos. The beginning of the film is wonderfully done, as we see a ""highlight reel"" of Carl's life journey with his lifelong love Ellie. It's an ordinary life, like so many, with ups and downs (mostly ups) and one great dream unfulfilled.The adventure phase of the film then begins, and at first it's great. The characters are presented, the stage is set, the journey ""up and away"" begins.Once Carl and Russell set sail and leave the city behind though, the story unravels. The pace, development and story arcs are problematic and, frankly, peculiar. I realize this is a children's tale with all the developmental liberties and assumptions that provides, but some of the gaps and story decisions are outlandish and just don't make sense, and leave you asking, ""what"" and ""how"" more than a few times.A few examples:In the span of an old man's exhausted nap, the two travel (at a drifting balloon pace) from somewhere in North America to directly above southern Venezuela. Huh? Even kids in the theater were asking their parents, what happened? How much time went by? Is the giant waterfall close to the house? I thought it was far away, but it must be really close, right?Talking dogs? Advanced ""canine interpretive technology"" emerging from a remote landscape with no civilization or human presence? Wow. Where did that come from?And the strangest decision of all, one that had kids (and adults) in the theater thoroughly puzzled --- the heroic adventurer is alive and well, with the agility and stamina of a 25 year old, and the advanced scientific capabilities of engineering genius? If Carl is pushing 80 years old (do the math, watch the beginning of the film, time it out), then the heroic adventurer has to be at least 100, and probably 110 years old or more.The story arcs have to explain or justify these things. It can be done with just a few transitional scenes, fantastic as it may seem. But you can't just go from A to B to C with big gaps and unexplained progressions. That's basic. Any professional in this industry should understand this. When 8 year olds in the audience are scratching their heads and trying to understand the plausibility of the story, you have a problem.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Keep your kids away,"Remarkable first 20 minutes or so.Very interesting characters.But then, as other reviewers put it, the makers didn't know how to advance the story.So they threw in blood-thirsty dogs and such, turning a movie for children (and adults with hearts) into a horror show, or whatever.Keep away. Most importantly, keep your children away.Post-modern (read: post-any-values) world indeed. Compare the beauty of the Disney animated movies of 1930s, 40s, 50s (Bambi, Snow White, Jungle Book, and so on) with what today's children have to put up with.Indeed, a sick mind sickens others.

One of the best animated films of all time. Two thumbs UP!,"My Rating : 9/10A wonderfully-done animated film, as most Pixar films are. Edward Asner provides the voice behind Carl, a widowed elderly man who is being forced to leave his home for a retirement home. Instead of accepting his fate he floats his home away to try and get to Paradise Falls: a destination he wanted to go to with his wife. The montage of Carl and Ellie's relationship is both lovely and sad. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, yet their love remains strong, even after Ellie's death Carl is dedicated to her. The brilliant script and animation are as always with Pixar films backed by an impeccable score. One of the best animated films of all time and more than worthy of joining Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 as the only animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

good,"The 2001 PIixar production Monsters, Inc. Director Pete Docterin, whom we know from ""UPi, is actually a production that shows various differences compared to classic Disney/Pixar productions. Ba$ the screenwriters who chose Carl Fredericks, who resembles Spencer Tracy in appearance as a character, have fed a fact that has not been put into practice much in animation, such as death, into the key point of the film. UP, which offers a silent movie-like section on friendship-marriage in the first half, just like Wall* in the first half, from the second half onwards, it gradually loses its serious mood, especially in the parts of Paradise, and gets stuck in clichés, but it takes its place in history as one of the sweet-enjoyable Pixar movies that should not be missed. Although I don't look very warmly at the issue of Turkish dubbing applied to animated films in our country, I can say that it is one of the most popular films that leaves the original behind with dubbing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's wild streak continues,"After 2 insanely well done films {Ratatouille, WALL-E} Pixar continues it's streak with Up.

The film could've started without it and still be fine but this first 10 minutes enhances the overall quality so much. It's so emotionally powerful, fun, and great. Even though I didn't love the rest of the film to the same degree as it, I still enjoyed the film a lotFirst of all, have you ever seen a concept of a flying house assisted by balloons? I really liked Doug and Kevin, even if it's sort of a children's movie cliche but its executed well so it makes it enjoyable for me.It has some pacing issues but it wasn't annoying in any way so it can be forgiven since the climax is exciting!

Looking Up,"I don't know how many cute animated movies I watched with my girlfriend. Of course, I wanted to watch this because of the cuts we all saw on social media and the love edits we saw. I had watched it very little before and I didn't know exactly, but the movie's plot in general wasn't like that anyway.I think the story of the movie is cute. But I didn't like it very much because it was a little lacking in the main idea. One of my favorite things is the stories where the main story starts with the character who seems like the main character but then the story takes a different direction. I think it is cute when there is a little misleading. The example that comes to my mind right now is ""Madonna in a Fur Coat"" by Ali, but there could be more examples like this. It's actually like that in this movie too. We have a scout character, he needs to get a badge for helping the elderly, but he couldn't get it. He meets a man who sees is house as the only memeory he has of his deceased wife and who never sells his house and builds a residence in its place because he values his wife very much. This man is a very static and less-spoken man. He is serious. However, his girlfriend is lively and talkative. There are basically common gender roles, but of course it is not very valuable to emphasize here. It is important to be a little modern, of course, but let's not talk about it. Afterwards, this man wants to go to a place that his girlfriend has always dreamed of, but he wants to go with her house while doing this. So he will go with his girlfriend. No matter what happens to hpuse, he protects and loves the objects that remind him of her more than his own life. After these two people set off, they encounter the legendary adventurer who disappeaared here a long time ago and has not been heard from since, but he does ntot turn out to be a man as they expected, and then this friend finds an animal of the kind that he hunts and wants to probe to all humanity that he is real, but this animal already become a friend with our friends. Ant they run away from them. That's basically all the story. Now, first of all, the most important subject here is a man who lost his wife. There could also be a woman here, I think this is a very difficult subject to handel. And I think they handled it well in this story. Although there is a possibility of having a second life with someone else after your wife dies, you will still be married to your wife even if she dies. I think it is the most natural and right option to fall in love with her even if she is not around. The movie also gives this idea well. There is a poem called ""Do not stand at my grave and weep"" that I definitely recommend you to read. In fact, for someone who is trying to cope with the death of their spouse, I can also recommend the series ""Afterlife"" which is another successful media. Although this movie does not seem to be the main theme. At the end of the day, it is the story of a man who loves his wife very much and clings to everyhting that belongs to her like crazy even after her death.The story is of course the most striking point and the animations are classic animation. In other words, personally, it should be at the extreme to say this is good and this is bad, and I think the animations of this series were good. That's all. Now let's get to the music. We all know the song called Married Life. Other than that, there is no significant thematic music unfortunately. Married Life and its derivatives are great, of course. It is a romantic music and it is nice. When I watch it with my lover, when the music comes on, I automatically want to watch it. Also, this Giacchino guy is so great. If I watch a series, this guy is like that, if I watch a movie, this guy is like that. He is a really great composer, like Rogue One, Batman, Up, Call of Duty, etc. Regards. I have seen his name so many times that I will never forget it. In fact, in my previous article, Fringe, there were also compositions in the first season. The best music was in the first season.I listened to the voice-overs in Turkish and I say again that our people do this job very well. Those who know know that theater is a business of exaggeration. If it is not something very realistic or something, especially in the comedy genre, the more exaggeration, the better. The voice-overs give these exaggerations to the characters very well. They take them away from reality, and these movies have a fairy-tale-like structure anyway. Let's say kudos to their voices. The voice-overs were very good.Up is a very good movie. It is not at the level of Wall-E or Inside Out, but it is still different and beautiful with its structure that appeals to men a little more. I personally enjoyed watching it. However, the main point of the movie is not romance, it is not a very good choice to watch with your lover. Personally, if God forbid something happens to my wife, it may be one of the damn movies that I will watch countless times, especially with that song.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Guess I'm in the Minority,"Reading other comments, it seems that this film was hugely popular with others. I don't think of myself as generally being contrary to the popular opinion, but this movie didn't do it for me.I'm not saying I hated it - The story was okay, it had some funny parts and the animation was fantastic. However, I just didn't seem to get into it that much. After the movie I asked my oldest daughter what she thought of it (I'm married with 2 girls - 5 & 7). Her first reaction was that she didn't like it, then she came around a little and said it was okay. I don't believe that I biased her by letting on what my feelings of the movie were. My wife felt the same (my youngest didn't like it at all, but she was a little scared by some scenes).Compared to Monsters vs Aliens - For my family at least - This fell well short of the mark.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar at its best.,"An entertaining animated film, it's not all fun, it's bittersweet for the most part.

But Murphy's law starts coming, when after an embarrassing incident, is forced to move out of his house and into a retirement home. But Carl does want to kick it in just yet.

Hit and miss home run,"In Up, we follow Carl Fredricksen, a widower and retired balloon salesman, who doesn't want his home to be destroyed by the development of commercial buildings, so attaches hundreds of balloons to it and flies it to Paradise Falls, him and his wife's dream destination.Up is great. It's a fun, family film. The story is interesting and very engaging. However, the movie falls into two very obvious sections for me and I will review them as such.The first section is the development of the story, right up to the point they reach Paradise Falls. This section is brilliant. Really great viewing. The beginning flashback sequence with Ellie is absolute perfection. It harkens back to the WALL-E and Ratatouille-esque silent story telling technique. It evokes a real sense of emotion while watching.The second section is where Up loses steam for me. I think the humour becomes overly slapstick and for me, was hit and miss at times. Doug the dog provides comic relief and the ""point"" joke I found funny. However, I felt Russell became very silly. He is obviously an intelligent boy, but some of what he says and does doesn't reflect this.However, in saying all of this, I think Up ends strongly. I really appreciate what how it wraps up and it redeemed some of my earlier grievances.Overall, Up is brilliant. I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip it, but I still think it is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
UP lives UP to the Pixar hype!,"Pixar always makes amazing films, like Wall-e, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles. The ones that aren't amazing are usually pretty decent, like Cars or A Bugs Life. Finding Nemo has always been my favorite because of how great the story was, the beauty presented in the movie, and the variety of characters it had. Up has two of the three things Finding Nemo has – Beautiful scenery and a wonderful story. Up's story isn't as smart or complex as Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it's still entertaining and fun. Up doesn't have that many characters, but it is Pixar's most emotional movie to date.The first ten minutes of Up will make you want to cry. It sure made me want to give up my god-like manliness. Those that don't give in to Up's emotional beginning don't have a heart. I like how the story isn't all about Carl (the old guy) and his sad story. The movie sheds some light on the other lead's (the little kid, Russel, who accompanies Carl. He also happens to be Asian!!) background. Carl is mourning his wife, while the film briefly explains Russel's issues with his father.Although there wasn't a variety of characters in the movie, there was still a whole bunch of dogs, a colorful bird, and another old dude, who happens to be the villain. The dog, if you've seen the trailer, is Dug. Dug is a very cute, playful, and loyal dog, who appears to be a Lab. Kevin is a beautiful female prehistoric bird that the other old guy, Charles, is searching for. The movie is fun because it offers so many laughs from the four characters of Carl, Russel, Kevin, and Dug. Charles, however, is a different story.Charles Muntz is Carl's childhood hero. He's a famous explorer that, about 70 years ago, discovered the bones of some kind of bird that no one has every seen before (we, the audience, know that it's Kevin's race). Scientists claim that Charles made up everything, so Charles swore that he would find a living specimen. This is where Kevin comes in. Charles spent the rest of his life trying to capture Kevin, and when Russel and Carl grow fond of Kevin, the two parties are at an opposition. Now, Carl finds his childhood hero trying to kill him.I respected Charles and his character in the movie, but I soon grew intolerant of him. I understand that he spent his life trying to capture Kevin, and it's his passion. However, Charles becomes an asshole to the other characters when they get in his way. Charles even endangers a little 7-year-old boy, Russel, just to get what he wants. By the end of the movie, I felt that Charles got what he deserved.Up is the best film I have seen all year, and is the only movie so far of 2009 that I've given a 10 out of 10. I can't think of any animated movie, or live-action, that has been as emotional, sad, funny, and charming as Up has been. I also loved the animated short film that appeared before Up, called Partly Cloudy. I liked how the short film kind of has a similar setting as Up, and I think that Partly Cloudy has a story that Pixar could actually make into a feature film. One think that disappointed me at the theater, though, was the fact that the trailer for Toy Story 3 wasn't shown. Every Pixar movie has a teaser trailer of the next movie that's going to be released, so I kind of felt cheated. Even though I saw the trailer for it already, I still would have liked to see it on the big screen, and also for everyone else in the theater to know about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Not such a fun movie,"Pixar animated movies like ""Toy Story"" & ""A Bug's Life"" were fun, creative and amusing. Up is strangely ""adult"" in nature and it's appeal to the very young maybe minimal. The best line in the entire film ""I finally get to meet my childhood hero, and now he wants to kill me"". Seriously, this should have been a PG-13 movie. Pixar films were more upbeat before they teamed with Disney. Now with Disney, their films have an added drama to them. Disney is great at musical animation storytelling, but I wish they had left Pixar alone.The story isn't that great, although the love story between Carl & Ellie is admirable, ultimately it's about the widowed Carl and an obese stowaway but determined boy scout, Russell. Their encounters with a strange bird and a talking dog lead them to the villain in the movie, who probably should have had more screen time. There was no explanation of why he needed all those talking dogs.I thought the animation was superb but the scenarios when the main characters were put in peril, were a little too unbelievable. It seemed with all those bright colored balloons it would be a fun movie, but ""Up"" can be a downer sometimes and I'd only recommend it to fans of animated films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Am I the only one that found this depressing and boring.,"I have loved every single other Pixar movie and look forward to their release. While I found the animation to be as amazing as always, the plot was depressing and downright boring for much of it. I didn't care about the characters at all (except maybe Dug) and the talking dogs were about the only decent laugh I found in the whole thing. I am completely baffled at this high of a rating (it was 8.5 at the time of this post with over 50,000 votes). Maybe I'm in a off mood but I don't think so. Anyway, maybe I have gotten to the point that i expect much more from Pixar. Doing a little looking into it this has a higher rating than Toy Story (8.1), Incredibles (8.2), and Finding Nemo (8.3).

Pixar Does It Again,"I don't know how Pixar does it, but their tenth movie is as good (or better?) than anything else they have released. I liked ""Up"" better than ""WALL-E"" as the latter seemed a little preachy, and I could not relate well to a beat-up robot, no matter how cute. With ""Up"" you had a widower/curmudgeon (I can relate to the latter!) surrounded by change when all he wants is to go back in time to the way things were. Events force him to make an unusual escape, hence the house flying by power of helium balloons.I won't give away spoilers, but I will say that Pixar's success is due to their ability to portray relationships and their animation skills. Unlike other filmmakers, they will take out of the ordinary relationships and draw you in where you end up caring about what happens to them. It doesn't matter if it's toys, cars, fish, rats or even robots, the folks at Pixar excel at developing a story built around relationships.I found myself getting misty-eyed (well, maybe a little more than that) at the first 12 or so minutes, not for the obvious part but simply for the beauty of how the story of Carl unfolded without words, just images. I knew the tragedy was coming, and perhaps that affected my view. The other part that hit me hard is when they found they could not have children, as my wife and I went through a similar thing. We decided to go the adoption route, something Carl takes his time on. ;) The special element to ""Up"" is the talking dog angle. It's what my wife and kids (all animal lovers) talked about walking back to the car. Pixar did not overdo it but integrated this masterfully. The Talking Dug stuffed animal should be a hot seller leading into the holidays, along with the DVD. I might even pay full price for this DVD.Finally, the story centers on great adventures, the Spirit of Adventure. You'll find yourself wondering if and when you'll start your own adventure after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The animation of the movie was very odd, I didn't like it so much, the emotions and the areas around them didn't look good animated, and they could really make it better. The story feeled generic and the house with balloon scene wasn't so impressive as I thought it would be. The good sides was the characters. Great introduced and explained. Great moral and value in this movie, about family and friendship. My favorite character was Doug, that was a dog and one of the main characters. He was funny and really spice up the story a little.

"#""We're no strangers to love...""#","Usually a feature has to invest a long time in characters and narrative to be tear-jerking but this somehow manages it near enough right out the door.It's hard to dislike the wish fulfilment narrative they're telling, rich in contextual symbolism, so much so that I had lecturers use it as an example of how to use symbolism (though they sort of abuse it).It just about does its prologue justice but I find that car counting thing a little awkward.There isn't really that much more to say. Perhaps my memory of the movie is somewhat biased by the first part. After the old man, I think the bird might be the best character.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I'm a little confused and disappointed,"After watching the movie, after hearing all the critical hosannas it received, I was quite a bit disappointed by the movie itself. The animation was gorgeous as usual and the images of the floating house were really memorable. What struck me was that none of the beauty of the film had gone into the creation of the story. It was frankly lazy and uninspired. WALL-E was an example of a film in which the plot and the characters were every bit as absorbing as the animation. The best part of this movie was the small, dialogue-free montage of Carl and Ellie's marriage. Very touching. But those few minutes could not compensate for an entire film that chose the easiest story options at every single opportunity. You could see every plot development coming from a mile away. Previous Pixar films did a great job in making even the most sappy, sentimental moments feel special. This movie failed to do that for me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best Animation of All Time,"While I don't regularly leave any comments or reviews for any movies in any kind of forum, this is one I could not resist to leave behind. While watching the trailers, I knew this movie would be big - but based on these trailers, I had no idea that the movie would entail so much drama and comedy. This movie was by far, the best animation I have ever seen. While I had always preferred to see non-human characters in animations, this is one that made an animated human figure more human than motion picture characters. And thus, it is perhaps one of the only movies that I could not resist keeping my tears from dripping. And this happened about 3 times in the movie - and even the short clip that played right before the actual movie!I don't know if children would enjoy this as much as adults. Perhaps the whole story about the love life and dreams of an old man comes to me in a more realistic sense than would a 10 year old boy. But then again, it really makes me rethink about my dreams and love life, and I must say, this is something that I would recommend everyone to go watch right now in the theaters. If you are guy, don't watch it with your guy friends... If you are female, watch it with a guy so you can humiliate him when he tears up every now and then during the movie...Pixar is just amazing..........",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of My Favorite Films of All Time!,"Okay so listen ... I went into this film with lower expectations than I do most Pixar films. I had heard the rumblings of reviewers that it was a fantastic film, but speaking honestly the previews did nothing for me. I couldn't figure out who I was supposed to root for! The kid looked annoying, the old man looked like a grump, and for some bizarre reason his house was floating on a bunch of balloons! On top of that, I thought Wall-E just totally SUCKED and, while I thought Ratatouille was a little bit better than that, I didn't really like that one much either. So to me, Pixar was on a slide and the previews for Up did nothing to disabuse me of the notion that the slide was continuing.Wow, was I wrong! Pixar has produced an absolute MASTERPIECE of an animated feature. Up has not only become my favorite Pixar film, but also one of my favorite films of any genre, animated or live action.Anyone who can walk out of that theater and claim not to have been touched by Carl and Ellie's story is either lying or dead inside. And for me, a guy who's about to turn 40, the underlying theme of life being what happens while you're busy doing other things just resonated with me tremendously. I could all-too-easily envision myself as Carl one day and it touched me deeply.Prior to this film, I could count on one hand the number of films that had made me cry ... and all of them were typical ""guy cries"" ... Field of Dreams, Brian's Song, Saving Private Ryan.Well after Up, I've had to engage a 2nd hand. Not only did I cry, but I cried multiple times! Pixar does an AMAZING job of making you truly care about Carl. How they can inspire those emotions in people with nothing more than a bunch of dots moving on a screen I have no clue, but they do it and they do it in spades.Run ... don't walk ... to see this film. See it two, three, or four times. But do yourself a favor ... skip the 3D. It takes away from the true beauty of this film, which is not the visuals, but the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Movie Made for 3D Animation- Great Fantasy Film Overall,"I'll be honest. I was prepared to be disappointed when I went in to see this film. As I said in my review for ""Wall-E"" last year (which is at this link if you want to read it: ""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/usercomments-293""), Pixar is the only 3D animation studio that has not made a bad or even mediocre film yet. I was a bit skeptical about ""Up"" not because of the recent news that Disney is worrying about its commercial appeal, not because of the unrealistic plot elements (and there are some), but because after nine great movies, a misfire could be on the horizon. Fortunately, ""Up"" is far from a misfire. Like the other Pixar movies, it takes an intriguing, original plot line and creates a masterpiece of a story with humor and heart.The main character of this story is someone who has the least potential to be made into an action figure, which is probably what is making Disney stockholders nervous as of the date this review is being written. Carl Frederickson is reminiscent of Peter ""Ralphie"" Billingsley (from ""A Christmas Story"" [1983]) as a child, and a cross between James Whitmore and Mr. Magoo as an elderly man. Although his image won't send kids flocking to toy stores, it doesn't really matter. Some great movies have been made with senior citizens as the main characters (""Cocoon"" [1985] and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" [2002] come particularly to mind), and it's about time Disney make one.The most appealing thing about Carl Frederickson is his character. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences immediately get a sense of his happy times and times of loneliness through a clever series of montages in the beginning. There were probably many old men in Hollywood who could have supplied his voice, but Ed Asner was perhaps the best choice. Asner gives Frederickson a voice that is curmudgeonly without being too off-putting, similar to his Lou Grant character from 1970's TV.In the first 20 minutes of the movie, you grow such an attachment to Mr. Frederickson that you can't help but feel like cheering when his house takes off with the help of balloons he spent all night blowing up. Therein lies the point of the movie where you really have to suspend disbelief. Of course this number of balloons can't pick up an entire house, let alone be blown up in one night without really careful planning. And if you spend too much time wondering how the floor of the house didn't stay on the ground, along with the pictures and other breakable assets in the dwelling, you will miss the point of the movie, not to mention the fun of it. The house is really a symbol of seeking new adventures while hanging on to where you came from all along, at least at first.The basic premise expands with the addition of Wilderness Explorer (or Boy Scout, minus the legal ramifications) Russell, arguably the Donkey to Mr. Frederickson's Shrek (sorry, Disney, but it's true). Russell is a very funny character, and doesn't miss a beat from the moment he comes on screen reading his Explorer book verbatim. The two main characters played off each other very well with witty dialogue and precise comic timing. Take away the comic relief of the talking dogs, and the down-to-the-hair strand awesome CGI animation, and you'd still have a great film with these two characters alone. The Russell character simultaneously adds a lot of well-needed heart to the film, actually making even me feel bad for the potential extinction of the otherwise annoying bird companion Kevin.In an emerging subplot, Kevin the bird is hunted down by a Charles Lindbergh/Howard Hughes-inspired adventurer named Charles Muntz, voiced with the right touch of menace by Christopher Plummer. The Muntz character is perhaps the first Disney villain who you don't want to be a villain, especially after seeing the faux newsreel clips in the beginning of the movie. He's a self-made man who's spent his life chasing a dream, sort of like Mr. Frederickson is by dragging his house to South America. He's also killing a bird that many, including Frederickson, finds annoying. However, if it hadn't been for the perfect moral balance between him and Russell, it would have been very hard to root for Mr. Frederickson until the end.The movie, on the whole, is probably more over-the-top than any other Pixar film made to date. You know many kids in America have a toy collection as diverse as the ones Andy has in ""Toy Story"", and that humans could create a smart robot like ""Wall-E"" someday. But anyone who spends their time wondering how Mr. Frederickson planned to survive after moving his house to the South American clip, or how the hose he's pulling doesn't break off the house, is missing a great fantasy adventure with many awe-inspiring takes on life. To paraphrase the theme song to ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"": ""If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts, repeat to yourself 'It's just a show, and I should really just relax'."" On a personal note, having just lost a grandparent who, in the last years of her life, refused to go to a nursing home because she loved the house she had lived in for nearly 40 years, I'm sure the setup of the story will strike familiar tones with many older audience members. I know it did with me, which is why the film was so touching and heartfelt from beginning to end. Hey, I may even be in that situation one day where I love a house so much I would even consider flying it away. If I actually considered doing it, I would hope that 50 years from now they would have more advanced flying equipment to do it with.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
sweet and heart warming,"I watched up a few months ago and i really liked it. it was a sweet and heartwarming story plot with funny and cute characters. I liked how the story was built up and how we really got to know the characters. The only bad thing about this movie was that i had a hard time watching this movie the second time, (yes I'm one of those people who like to watch movies again and again). i was a little bored to be honest watching it again even though i really liked it the first time but thats just my opinion. this movie had all the things an animated movie needed or any movie as a matter of fact: Story plot, good character description and personalities, tear- jerker moments, a little action and a bad guy. which is what i personally look for in animated movies. but what i think is its really up to you whether you want to watch this movie or not.

Pixar delivers yet again. They must be cheating or somet---Squirrel!,"However they do it, whether it is by steroids, stem cell, Egyptian secrets, Babylonian water, or selling their soul to some monster, Pixar has been providing hit after hit, success story after success story since 1995. Surely they don't profit as much as their rival Dreamworks, but Pixar's films have lasting appeal that can and will span decades and generations to come. I severely doubt a century from now we'll remember Shrek or Madagascar the same way. Pixar's strategy has always been top provide tugs at the heartstrings for every time they deliver a laugh. This mix of comedy and drama has served them well in the past, with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films being the absolute best examples. Up on the other hand, has overwhelmingly more drama and sad moments than laughs. If you can survive this little shift of film-making from Pixar, then you are in for a treat. Up is yet another grand film from the company that seems to do no wrong and it has great appeal for moviegoers of all-ages.Up is about Carl Fredrickson, a retired bitter old man whom is still reeling from the loss of his wife. Since children, they had a dream about going to Paradise Falls, a secluded location in South America. In her honor, Carl heads out on a quest to South America using his house, and thousands of balloons. Accidentally accompanying him is Russell, a trusty boy scout. Along the way, they'll meet all sorts of characters and more adventure than they could have ever imagined. Written by Bob Peterson (Responsible for Finding Nemo, need I say more?), the film explores themes of loneliness, letting go, life and friendship. The script excels with plenty of adventure, funny moments, and sentimental moments that will make you sniffle a bit.Forget 3-D. It's a stupid trend that will soon go away. The movie looks absolutely beautiful in 2-D and does not need any special effects for it to be appreciated. The people and animals themselves are composed of different shapes, representing their personality. Unlike in other non-Pixar efforts, realism (in terms of people) wasn't attempted, instead focus was on detail. The movie is amazingly detailed, but the production didn't demand as much complicated animation like in Wall-E and Ratatouille. Nonetheless, the film looks great, and yet again proves that Pixar is on top of the animation heap.The main strength of Up lies in the action and its characters. The film has plenty of exciting and perilous moments that keep you guessing how it's going to end. And then, there are the hilarious characters. Carl himself is likable, but doesn't provide as many laughs as Russell, and the eventual animals that are involved in their quest (especially the hilarious dog Dug with the special collar). Up falls more into the category of The Incredibles rather than Wall-E or Ratatouille because of its immense amount of peril. There's nothing wrong with that, just telling you it's not the Pixar fare you've seen in recent years.Like previously stated though, Up is a very tough pill to swallow in terms of its dramedy. The first ten minutes of Up are among the most heart-wrenching in recent memory, and towards the climax we have another moment in which you can't help but feel that lump in your throat. This sort of heavy sentiment has not been present in any non-Pixar animated film this decade, not even Shrek. It is hard to make a cranky selfish old man likable or sympathetic, but like in Finding Nemo with Marlin, knowing the past definitely clears all confusion and answers all the questions we would ask about their challenging personality.Bottom Line: Pixar strikes gold yet again, and in the form of a very creative story about an old man searching for adventure. All the elements that worked in all the Pixar films of the past are present here, and associated with a superb musical score by Michael Giacchino. The only reason you wouldn't like this film is if you don't like Pixar at all---in which afterwards it will be followed by questions concerning your taste in film. Ranking this film, I'd place it somewhere between The Incredibles and the original Toy Story as one of the 5 best they've ever released. How do they do it? It has to be steroids, there's no other explanation.When you're with Pixar, the quality of film has nowhere to go but Up.Highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Oh, Pixar!","You've ruined the way I look at movies!I mean, after 2001 I found it impossible to watch any animated feature and not compare it to the the breathtakingly beautiful visuals, flawless storytelling & inspired creativity of ""Monsters Inc"". Even Dreamworks' best entries into the animated feature category, great movies like ""Over The Hedge"" and ""Shrek"", could never quite reach the bar that you selfishly set so high.Damn you Pixar!If that wasn't bad enough, within the last few weeks I saw ""Wall-E"" for the first time, AND was able to see ""UP"" the day it came to theaters.Well, not only can I not watch an animated movie without comparing it to everything you've put out, I now can't watch ANY MOVIES without comparing them to your work.STOP IT!! You're setting the bar WAY too high!How in God's name are filmmakers supposed to compete with something as perfect as ""Wall-E""? And then follow it up with something that's just as good, but totally fresh and different as ""Up"" is? It's just not fair!OK, I got a little carried away. But Pixar is definitely due it's praise. ""Up"" is, much like ""Wall-E"", a complete movie in every sense of the word. There's really nothing missing. Within the first 15 or 20 minutes, you've already laughed, cried and everything in between. THIS is what going to the movies is all about.The story that unfolds in ""Up"" is engaging and as far from boring as possible. The plot is always moving forward at just the right pace, telling it's story in such a creative way that you almost have to pause and think ""How the heck did they think of that?!"" It does deal with some pretty heavy subject matter and could have potentially crossed over into territory a little too dark for a ""family"" movie. But it's handled with such care and sensitivity that it never feels inappropriate. The montage in the opening moments, detailing the relationship between the main character and the love of his life, is so moving that it could crack even the most stone-hearted viewer.The characters here are what really stand out to me. They are presented with as much depth and detail as any flesh and blood actor can convey. Pixar has never shied away from creating characters with layered personalities, complete with shortcomings and flaws. It's this ""real"" approach to character development that makes you forget you're watching an animated movie. While you may not have experienced the exact situation that confronts Mr. Fredrickson, the film's elderly protagonist masterfully voiced by Ed Asner, the emotions that he expresses are immediately and profoundly relatable. Even in moments that find him doing his best ""Grumpy Old Man"" routine, you never question his intentions or stop rooting for him. The other central characters, Russell (An eager wilderness scout looking to earn his final badge by helping Mr. Fredrickson) and Dug (A canine that has been given the ability to articulate his thoughts into clear, albeit goofy English) both provide well-placed comic relief and end up fitting perfectly into Fredrickson's world. Both are have their own minor subplots, that give depth and credibility to each. I found the one dealing with Dug's conflict between allegiance to his original ""master"" or doing what is clearly the ""right thing"" to do, particularly effective. Kevin, a flightless female (No, that's not a typo!) bird who is the mother to a few little fledglings, is brilliantly brought to life without ever speaking a word and adds some emotionally gripping moments. She also happens to be one of the most hilarious characters I've ever seen.The bottom line is this: ""Up"" is just really fun to watch. It's equal parts moving, funny and exciting. It's pure fantasy that feels real. It picks you up out of your chair, strips away that part of your adult self that blinds you from the true wonders of life and for an hour and a half it allows you to see the world as a kid again. It's more than just a movie.After I left the theater, I couldn't help but be reminded of how I would feel after experiencing Spielberg's early work when I was a kid. When I saw ""E.T."" for the first time at 5 years old, it was all I could think about for the next few weeks! I would replay it in my mind over and over again, reliving every moment of excitement, heartbreak and sheer joy. As I sit here, a month from turning 30, I have to admit that unfortunately that type of experience has become all too rare. But for the second time in as many years, Pixar has managed to relight that passion in me. I am forever grateful for that.Thank you Pixar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I'm not going into any further detail about the plot, wouldn't want to ruin it for anybody.The animation is flawless, the amount of detail that they go into is unbelievable, it is incredible how now you can actually almost feel textures. A perfect example of this is when you see Carl's stubby two day beard. Amazing!This movie is for big and little kids as well, I went to see it with a buddy of mine from work and we laughed through the entire film, and we're both in our 30's.This film is, without a doubt, one of PIXAR's best yet!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up,"Widowed ""Carl"" (anyone else thinks he looks like Henry Kissinger?) gets himself involved in an altercation with a construction worker that sees him court-ordered to the ""Shady Oak"" retirement home. He's having none of that, and on the day of his deportation releases thousands of balloons from his chimney. They manage to uproot his house and using some rudimentary sails he sets off in search of ""Paradise Falls"". Deep in South America lie these idyllic waters where he and his late wife dreamt of visiting. En route, and a few hundred feet up, he hears a knock at the door. It's ""Russell"".

Continuing their search, they stumble upon an adventurer who is warm and welcoming, but is he all that he seems - especially when he learns of ""Kevin""? The animation is lively and vibrant and it's quite good fun this adventure, with loads of sarcastic attitude from the curmudgeonly old git, a breezy and not too annoying child in ""Russell"" and a last ten minutes, or so, that are fairly action packed and enjoyable to watch.

Furthermore, did you even look to see that it was indeed rated PG? Now about the movie, I found it to be quite good.

A humane story amid a color riot,"It is difficult to get the image of that flying house suspended by countless colorful balloons off your head, once you see Up. I guess, it would stay with me for the rest of my life.Up easily climbs up to claim a place amongst the finest animation films ever. Not surprisingly, it comes from Pixar, the team that gave us Wall-E, Ratatouille and Finding Nemo. Also, after a quite a long time, its about 'people' as against a garbage-crusher, a rat and fishes respectively earlier. Up is as colorful as an animation film ever was. What a color riot! Some frames just stay with you, the mastery of their composition impossible to miss.The choice of characters itself breaks clichés. A grumpy old man as the hero and an amiable obese kid as his ally completely contrast against what one would have thought would be the choice for characters who are supposed to be on an adventure trip to South America. Both characters endear themselves to us as the story moves along.Two things that stood out for me - (a) The initial sequence that chronicles the life of Fredrickson and Ellie together is a master-stroke. As it ends, it leaves the eyes moist - and all that without a word spoken. (b) The closing shot with the house perched besides the paradise falls - it is one for the textbooks; probably one of the best closing shots ever.Not to be missed at any cost.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Hit!,"I saw this with my boys (6 and 9) and we all loved it. I won't say any more about the movie itself as it's pretty well covered, but I do want to say how surprised I was at the quality of the 3-D version. As with other reviewers, I have until now avoided 3-D releases as I always find them disappointing. I was blown away by the new digital 3-D in this movie as well as the trailers which were also presented in 3-D. The new glasses were comfortable, if a little large for my 6 year old (they need 2 sizes) and I didn't experience any eye strain, nor did I have to take them off during the movie. I also didn't have that irritating headache that I always get after viewing the ""old"" 3-D format. If you haven't tried it yet, you should.

"Tragic, Mesmerizing and Utterly Hilarious, One of Pixar's Finest","Pixar has never disappointed (so long as we block Cars from our memory). After Wall-E, the bar was set higher than ever. Wall-E was a beautiful haunting picture, made not for children but more for people willing to absorb the imagery without needing to be guided by dialogue. Despite the success of Wall-E, I think Pixar realized how it may have alienated children to some extent with its long first act, and has included more colour and dialogue in their next picture, Up. However, even if a slightly less mature picture at times than its predecessor, Up ranks among the best Pixar films to date and may actually be its most haunting.Up is the story of 78-year old widower Carl Frederickson. After the death of his wife, he finally decides to do what they always dreamed of doing and having a house on Paradise Falls. However, when his houseship has an unexpected passenger in young boy scout (sorry, ""Wilderness Explorer"") Russell, his journey becomes something else entirely.Carl is probably the most tragic character Pixar has ever made, possibly even including Wall-E. The opening montage of his life is probably the single most tragic thing I've ever seen in an animated feature. Even Russell, the requisite annoying-yet-noble child, has his share of tragedy surrounding him, also dealing with themes much more mature than the standard studio. It's a tale of a man trying to live his life in its twilight, and its done wonderfully.Of course, no kids want to see a tragedy, so importantly, Up is very funny. There's a man with an army of talking dogs, from which much humour ensues (particularly from Dug, the ""SQUIRREL!"" dog from the trailer, as well as Alpha, a Rottweiler with a malfunctioning collar). Then there's the large-bird-thing Kevin, also producing some very funny material. Despite the tragedy of the whole story, you really can't help but be entertained, and certainly this is a very funny movie.I do have my complaints, however. The climax seems too stereotypical, a pitfall of all kids movies. It works, however, even if it doesn't blow away. Also, as a physics major, I have some issues to settle with the mechanics of walking around dragging a flying house, but its a pure fantasy movie, and eventually i coerced my brain into shutting up in that respect.One final note: the 3D aspect. I did see it in 3D, and was very impressed. Unlike most 3D movies, there was not a single ""OMG 3D"" moment in Up (forgive the expression). The use was subtle, yet did add a degree of immersion to the film. It also made the dogs that much more frightening at times. The movie definitely is very good in 2D, but the 3D gives it an extra layer, even if not necessary. If the idea does make you queasy, go for the 2D, because the 3D does not drive the soul of the film.Overall, Up is a triumph. Pixar seems more focused than ever with these last few films, and I'm absolutely loving it. If this implies that Toy Story 3 will be the best yet, bring it on.NOTE: There's a 3D Toy Story 3 trailer attached. That makes it worth admission alone.NOTE: The short film before the movie (as standard with Pixar) is not their best, but its very cute and works its magic to warm you up for the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar Takes Crap, Turns To Gold","Pixar is truly an amazing animation studio. Over the years it has produced classic films with great lessons for all (not just the wee ones) in Toy Story, The Incredibles, WALL-E, and now Up. With the success of their latest film, Up, I am convinced that the big wigs over at Pixar Animations could take a dump and literally fashion it into gold (which is apparently safer to own than the dollar these days).Frequently Pixar seems to amaze the masses, even those pesky critics, with their beautiful animations and relevant story lines that touch the heart of every individual. I myself, a 22 year old male, had to recruit every ounce of testosterone in my body to not blubber like a baby during the sad introduction of Up. These days it seems like the ""kid"" movies that Pixar puts out are far more relevant and important than what Hollywood traditional puts out. Frankly, I'm sick of all the movies showing me a post-apocalyptic future where every day we get a day closer to a real-life episode of ""Life After People."" Hollywood needs to take a lesson from Pixar and start making some films that go beyond the trials and tribulations of a man battling robots in the future. Sure, blow 'em up movies and fart movies serve their purpose, but Pixar seems to be the only studio putting out films that contain touching drama, hilarious comedy and stories that are relevant to our everyday lives. They were able to get me to care about a freakin' robot in WALL-E, for crying out loud! Whereas if I were to go see Terminator Salvation (which I won't), I'm sure I could give a flying hoo-hah about John Connor.What amazes me the most about Pixar is how creative the films are. I am dumb-founded as to how they take an idea that would probably get laughed at (not in the good way) initially, and turning it into something we as people can relate to. Imagine how the pitch meeting probably went.Writer: So I have this movie idea where an old guy fills his house with a bunch of helium filled balloons and floats to an unexplored paradise.Pixar: That sounds like crap...

Amazing animation,"""Up"" is an absolute gem of a short film that tugs at your heartstrings and takes you on a heartfelt adventure. Its strength lies in the emotional depth of its storytelling, capturing the essence of love, loss, and the beauty of life's journey. The animation is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and attention to detail that bring the story to life. The music perfectly complements the narrative, evoking a range of emotions. However, one weakness of the film is its brevity, as it leaves some character development feeling rushed.

Is Anyone Really Surprised That This Film Is Good?,"After living in his home for most of his life, Carl is suddenly surrounded by skyscrapers and construction. They want to buy his house so they can tear it down and build a retirement home. He will have none of this and decides to use thousands of balloons to literally lift his house 'up' and soar to a place he's been dreaming of going since a kid.There's a bit more to the plot, but I don't want to divulge that information. Going into the film not knowing about it might have a stronger impact on you. Up, which is yet another fascinating film from the geniuses at Pixar is vibrant with colour, full of laughs, tugs on the heart strings and is an adventure for both kids and adults. I never thought a film that had to really old characters in the lead roles would appeal to the young ones, but Up surprised me. In fact, it really surprised me, hearing about the concept I thought that Pixar finally had a dud on their hands. Nope, not this time.Up is one of my favourite Pixar films, up their with last years Wall-E and The Incredibles. The film is unique and inspiring. I doubt you'll find such quality film making from any other animated film, Pixar has set the bar time and time again. Up, while not visually stunning or powerful as last years Wall-E takes a different route and uses vibrant colours to draw attention to itself. The characters are cartoonish and the story itself could never be based on any reality and for a film about an old guy in a house with balloons, it's mighty adventurous.Every Pixar film has a message that their cleverly slip into the excitement and Up is no different. We go on this journey with Carl and the young boy scout Russell, Carl at first does not like Russell, nor does he want him around. These two characters are at opposite ends of each other, one old and quite, the other young and talkative. Of course by the end of the flick they bond. Also along for the ride are two side characters, Kevin the colourful native bird of Paradise Falls (they place Carl wants to finally see) and Dug, a dog who can mysteriously talk. Dug is not the only dog who can talk though, the place is full of them, all trained to open doors and fly planes. They all heel to their master Charles Muntz, who has spent his life trying to capture Kevin.Up is not only funny, fun and exciting, it packs a few emotional scenes too. Some people might want to bring some tissues, while it's not a sob story it is one of the few Pixar films that have moved me. What happens to Carl happens to everyone, so you can relate to him. You are immediately grabbed by him and his story and the film has more emotional punch in ten minutes of dialogue free montage then most dramas or romance films today can say for themselves.There are a lot of words to describe Up: Delightful, endearing and whimsical are a few, but one I will choose to employ is heart. Along with Wall-E, Up has the most heart out of every other Pixar film I've seen. The film has a PG rating though, only other Pixar film to have this is The Incredibles. The Russell kid is shot at and people die, at times I was thinking would kids be scared of this? I don't think so, nothing horrible ever happens that could traumatize a young one in my opinion.I did not bother to see this film in 3-D, I've heard it doesn't give enough 'pop' to warrant the additional money on the ticket. Seeing it at a regular theatre will not hinder your viewing at all. All the voice acting is top-notch and perfect casting with Plummer and Asner. See Up in theatres while you can, it is one of the year's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's Up let me DOWN,"Finally watched UP. But it let me DOWN.Nothing what I expected. It was well below than other Pixar films. not even in the same league as Ice Age.I was confused int he first few minutes of the film. Then there was tragedy :( I don't think anyone expect a sad tragedy film in a animated movie. :S The first part of the movie is very sad and I was wondering why am i watching this. Cos when I sat for the movie, I was expecting humor as Ice age .The Only part I liked was when that giant Birdy came to the action :D It was so hilarious and I got a bit what I expected, humor and comedy.The last part of the movie was Sci-fi plus Adventure... Which neither like Incredibles nor Spider Man.I guess this film was only aimed at the very young crowed (kids) cos, I think an adult cant enjoy this film much as he/she would have enjoyed Ice Age or Incredibles.But, I was surprised when I saw that this film was rated PG for some ""peril and action"". :oSo who the hell is the targeted audience? anyway, I should say this is not merely up to the Pixar standards :(",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Why does everyone think this is so great? It's par with Pixar.,"Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but I know I'm not the only one who thinks that this movie wasn't so great. It was just OK. It had funny lines, -all of which were already shown in the previews-, and a pretty good plot, and great animation. But I just don't see why so many people think this is such an ""awesome"" movie. There was no adult humor at all, so maybe all the ratings are from parents or children, I don't know. I think the 3d version must be a whole different movie than the one I saw, because I walked out thinking it was just mediocre. Heres some advise, do Not watch it if it's not in 3D, you'll probably be disappointed as well.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar keep on going Up,"Carl Fredricksen (Asner) sets out to Paradise Falls to fulfil his life long dream by tying thousands of balloons to his house, but is unaware of Russell (Nagai) on his porch.The only way is up for Pixar. We say it year after year but there is simply no stopping the mighty animators from producing yet another masterful picture.Last year Wall-E brought about their biggest ever gamble by reducing the dialogue to a minimum and telling the story through physical humour and scene settings with enough semiotics to appreciate the earth's decline.And now there is Up. The first 3D picture to open Cannes film festival went down a treat with critiques and fans alike and now in cinemas across the world smashing records once more, they really have soared.I must confess, seeing the trailer I was slightly apprehensive and concluded this was it, this was where Pixar would go down. Carl seemed grouchy, the puns used appeared ordinary and the plot seemed exceptionally thin. I hold my head down in shame for judging this on its trailer.What we have here is yet another wondrous ambition of life that will break the heart, make the kids laugh and make you feel ultimately rewarded.The opening sequence of Carl in the cinema as a young lad watching his hero on screen sets the tone for the film's central dream concept as Carl meets a fellow youth and the pair share the same adventurous spirit. After an hilarious fall and a sweet how you doing moment the film dives into a silent montage of their life together and when Carl hits a stopping point his life falls apart and until he has no choice, does the house start to fly and the adventure well and truly begins.When watching a Pixar or a Disney picture you have to bear in mind the realism of situations. The unlikeliest is high but this is meant for entertainment and it certainly delivers it. The physical science of whether the house can fly based on helium balloons is open to the guys in the labs but this is an imaginative attempt to portray childhood ambition and it succeeds through this.From talking dogs to an undiscovered bird this has adventure written all over and the fun never stops once the house is up. Russell provides that childhood innocence and ambition to give Carl food for thought and with flying dogs, an explorer with a deadly secret and charming dialogue this spells happiness for the entire family.As more and more animations are now made with 3D in mind this picture was evidently more focused on the plot. Impressive but there are exceptionally few moments with actions coming out at you, like in Coraline or Monsters vs Aliens.Irrelevant in my opinion as we have here the best animated picture this year with a charming plot with humorous characters and marvellous ambition.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Complete Masterpiece!,"Up {dir. Pete Docter, 2009}****/****Pixar's Up is the best film of the year so far, by far. In telling a simple adventure story, they cover ground that they had yet to cover before. Both the humor and heartbreak of the film seem completely more mature than any of Pixar's previous works. The film is perfectly paced and structured in a very careful way to allow each moment to have a satisfying and slightly surprising. Pixar continues to amaze not only with their technical bravado, but with their thematic courage. Up is definitely in the uppermost echelon of their work, a hilarious, and in turns heartbreaking, work of great magnitude and power. Visually the film is rich and thrilling and emotionally it is satisfying. I cannot wait to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Delightful, sweet and charming : another Pixar classic","Pixar does it again. I've watched almost every Pixar movie and it seems that despite the potentially least interesting, least commercial subject (an old guy flying away in his balloon-covered house), they just can't go wrong. It's another great film, exquisitely animated and downright beautiful to behold. What makes Pixar films, and ""Up"" in particular, so special? My theory is that beyond the amazing 3d computer graphics, it boils down to likable characterizations and heartwarming humanistic moralistic stories that don't consider their audiences stupid with a dash of good humor and a pinch of wonder added for good measure. Basically, Pixar films like ""Up"" usually have ""heart"" without feeling forced or fake. The life story of the old guy presented at the start was a wondrous touching piece of work accompanied only by beautiful evocative music. Actually the music in ""Up"" is noteworthy for its emotional effectiveness throughout. The story might appear a bit simple in hindsight but it works beautifully and touches on several universal themes and values such as grief, friendship and acceptance. It has its sad dramatic moments but overall it's quite fun, funny and dare I say uplifting. This coming from a guy who's usually allergic to ""feel good"" movies. It even has an underlying romantic background that makes everything more special.Why is it that Pixar movies, ""Up"" being the latest case, often have better acting than most live-action films? Is it because of slightly-exaggerated animated emotions, the top-notch voice-acting or the incredible facial expressions and body language? I do wonder how ""Up"" would keep the interest for younger children. The pace is sometimes intentionally slow (old guy being a bit slower) and it does have quieter introspective moments. Some places might be up over their head but I think the lovable enthusiastic bumbling boy scout and dog would certainly help keep their interest and it's likely they will be fascinated by the graphics and grumpy old guy. I think ""Up"" can appeal equally to adults and children alike and if the high praise from every corner hasn't convinced you yet, it's definitely worth watching and owning eventually. I certainly want to see it again. Grandparents in particular should see this with their grand kids, or even alone if they don't have any, as they might find it inspiring. My only exception to my high recommendation would be for those few who have disliked Pixar movies in the past. ""Up"" probably won't change their mind but then again why not give it a try anyway?

Pixar does it again!,"Thinking about it brings tears to my eyes again. I took my 5 year old daughter and her friend. From children's perspective, it was very entertaining. They were laughing and talking about dogs for long time. Some fighting scenes scared them a tiny bit, but not much. From adult's perspective, it was really deep, unpredictable, and touching. The best thing for me, personally, was that I dreamed of going to Guiana highlands all my childhood. From the trailer, I had no idea that's what this was about. It was really exciting for me that someone from Pixar (the studio I respect more than anything else! and my dream place to work!) also had a similar feelings for Guiana Highlands.I never thought Pixar can top the heights of Wall-E, but apparently, they can do it again and again.I strongly recommend it to everyone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar... why haven't you gotten a Best Picture nod yet?,"This is officially my second favorite film of the year so far (behind Drag Me to Hell). I saw it in 3D and it, like all Pixar movies do (except Cars), blew me away. It falls just short of becoming one of my favorites, but it comes pretty damn close.The animation is amazing, not so much in the detailed or ""It-looks-so-real-"" department, but just by the amount of stuff that's going on on screen. When the balloons first pop up from behind Carl Fredrickson's house, it's an amazing sight. The physics, the color, reflections, everything animation-wise in this movie is PERFECT!!! The voice acting in this movie is also incredible. Now while every single critic has given special recognition to Ed Asner, I want to give it to Bob Peterson who created my favorite character of the year (surpassing Insectosaurus), Dug the Dog. Peterson's speech patterns, dialogue and personality create an adorable and memorable character that I consider Pixar's next Dory (formally Pixar's most quotable character).If anything, my only complaint is that the villain felt rushed into the film, and his motives weren't really clear to me. But that was probably because I didn't take my medication that helps me focus.Up is amazing, just plain and simple.FULL PRICE",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Adventure is out there.,"'Up (2009)' is mostly remembered for featuring one of the best montages in cinematic history and catching every parent off guard by straight-up making them cry. There's a lot more to it than that, though. For its majority, it's a fun adventure featuring a grumpy old curmudgeon and a naïve little boy. It also features fictional birds, talking dogs and a balloon-tied house that floats all the way to South America. In some ways, it's strange that these outlandish elements exist alongside some very realistic - even sobering - moments and an incredibly affecting central theme; it's almost like there are two movies in competition with one another. Yet, the picture has an excellent handle on its tone and it never feels close to incohesive. It's entertaining and engaging even at its silliest, with well-rounded characters and a tightly paced plot. The relationship between its leads evolves naturally and the piece's payoff is incredibly satisfying. It's an enjoyable experience right the way through. It'll put a tear in your eye and a smile on your face. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
not just cute.....,"*SERIOUS SPOILERS*I'm amazed at how many Hollywood movies today explicitly acknowledge the power of cinema to shape minds and lives. Since this is now a trend, how can Pixar be far behind ? This film opens with a film within, the documentary on exploration which is seen by our hero as a very young child. The notions of mystery and adventure, conflated with the larger-than-life celebrity figure of Charles Muntz, burn themselves into the child's consciousness. They virtually define his life and existence. Along the way, he meets a girl who is similarly besotted with Muntz and the fantasy he represents. They get married, and their mutual love is founded on the film they both saw and fell in love with. Soon they get swept in the grind of everyday life, but they keep their dream alive. When she dies, leaving him an abandoned old man, he attempts to transform their dream into reality.So the movie begins, but the rest of it is more or less generic animated fare. And its oddly more Disney than Pixar. Sure, the animation has the usual high level and the color palette is much wider, but the comedy and action sequences are rather tame by modern standards. I actually think that 'Kung Fu Panda' (which is quite lowbrow) is more effective as an action comedy, and has a far more rousing third act. I'm surprised they didn't try to make this deeper, or extend the self-reference to the entire film. Too bad. But that opening was very nice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just an Amazing Movie!,"This was overall just an excellent movie. There is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie so I will just jump into a few of the things that I really liked about it. First, Doug and Kevin where so charming. Well, to be frank the entire movie is amazing charming in its own way, but Doug and Kevin especially. The movements of the bird are just amazing, and the things that the dogs say and do are exactly what you would expect a dog to do, they captured it perfectly. They were quirky and funny and lovable all at the same time, something that the guys over at Pixar are really good at.The beginning of the movie was a bit more dark than I was expecting it be, but it set up the rest of the story so well. I felt like this was an animated movie, but really had a lot of meaning to just about anyone who watched it. There were some really hard-hitting moments, most in the early part of the movie, that really got the viewer emotionally attached to the characters. And I think that is important for the movie to work.The only negative is that some of the events that occurred once they landed were a bit predictable. But it was still a fun ride the whole way through. None of this movie felt like filler or boring for even a second from the opening to the credits. The whole adventure feeling of the movie was exciting and engaging. And the progression of Mr. Fredricksen throughout the movie was heart-warming and satisfying.Overall, this is just an amazing movie, and unquestionably my favorite animated movie I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The first CGI film that truly has something for everyone, and it's all brilliant","After tackling rats with chef skills and voiceless robots on journeys of self-discovery, leave it to Pixar to make the star of its latest film an elderly man and continue to defy Hollywood's long-held belief that animated films have to zero in on children and concepts that can be marketed into hats and toys and backpacks. Heck, in ""Up"" even animals talking are explained rather than simply taken for granted. But what sets it apart from other Pixar gems is that it's the animation studio's most inclusive for-the-whole family adventure to date.It's no surprise to anyone anymore that Pixar leads field in terms of computer-generated animation and while ""Up"" continues this tradition, that's not its specialty. ""WALL*E"" is still more of a spectacle and innovator. ""Up"" is Pixar's proof that they can combine beautiful, heart-filled storytelling with laughs for every age group and adventure and action to boot and *still* make a killing at the box office.On premise, most analysts wouldn't predict a film about 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen ballooning his house to South America to honor a promise to his late wife to be even close to a box office success in the genre of animated family films, but attach the name Pixar and anything is possible. Dogs with collars that turn their thoughts in words and the dynamic between a young boy scout named Russell who accidentally was on Fredricksen's porch when the house took off and an old man prove to be more than enough for great comedy and entertainment.Sure, the plot itself once they get to South America leaves something to be desired, and the feasibility of an old man who can't walk down his stairs being able to hold onto a dangling rope with a boy, a dog and a large bird on the other end will fail to suspend many adults' disbelief, but there is never a moment devoid of something clever or meaningful in the entire film. The fresh and humorous concept proves quite forgiving as does the touching motivation in the story of Carl doing this for his dead wife. The montage through their years together is incredibly powerful for happening so early in the film. Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do an excellent job, though obviously Pixar's constant success must be credited to John Lasseter.Next to ""WALL*E"" whose innovation, imagination and genius themes might never be repeated in animated film, ""Up"" is Pixar's best to date. There is honestly something for everyone: the elderly will relate to Carl's struggles with aging, loss and unfulfillment; children will find plenty of physical humor to enjoy between the hysterical dogs and Russell's slight lack of smarts; and the ages in between will find the story touching and the concepts and their execution nothing short of genius. And for once, Disney is even politically correct/inclusive in the diversity of characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A WiseGuy's Review: Talking Dogs steal the show in a movie anyone with a heart will love,"25yr Male from Detroit, MI Up is a hugely entertaining, hilarious, and touching family movie that adults and kids can thoroughly enjoy. I was a big fan of the Toy Story movies growing up so was intrigued to see Pixar's first 3D outing. The movie far exceeded my expectations. Great animation, characters and story that almost reminded me of James and the Giant Peach in a way. I was a bit disappointed in the 3D effects, they certainly did not stretch the limits as far as things jumping out at you, etc. The movie was just kind of ""in 3D"". As far as the story, I am a big time dog lover so especially loved the canine aspect of the movie. Talking dogs were much more prominent in the storyline than I expected which was very entertaining to see. The ""adult"" themes some people are complaining about are incredibly subtle and bordering on non-existent. The whole theater was laughing and enjoying this movie from start to finish and it joins Night At The Museum 2 as two terrific family movies to check out right now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What's Uuuuuuuuuppp? This movie is!,"Upsy daisy! It's time for you to wake up and read my quirky pun-induced film review of Disney Pixar's ""Up"". Not up for it? Come on, it will lift your spirits up! OK, enough uppers already! Do not want it to be a downer for you guys. ""Up"" is yet another creative Pixar tale about a lonely geriatric widower named Carl Frederickson who fixates on fulfilling his deceased wife Ellie's wishes of flying their house to a paradisiacal land in South America. This idea might not fly with many, but grumpy Carl just wants to be happy by his lonesome in his own isolated South America Paradiso. However, Carl did not expect a junior wilderness explorer to come along for the ride. What's up with that? Russell is the aforementioned boy scout who accidentally gets stuck in the house during Carl's upward liftoff. Nevertheless, Frederickson was in no mood to be ""bringing down the house"" even with Russell on board. Frederickson and Russell end up landing in the paradise land (house and all), and there they befriend a talking dog named Dug and an eccentric female bird who Russell names Kevin. Their nemesis comes in the form of the devious explorer Charles Muntz who masters a pack of menacing talking dogs. So therefore, Frederickson and Russell are confronted with plenty of ""ups"" and ""downs"" during their adventurous experience. There are many humanistic elements in ""Up"" such as aging, loneliness, acceptance, and detachment that many kids might not be up for; but provides invaluable life lessons on character education to our future generation. ""Up"" does play with your heartstrings plenty, so bring a hanky! The former Mr. Grant, Ed Asner, was granted a perfect role to voice as Frederickson; that impressed me Ed Asner! (Only ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" fans got that pun upper). Bob Peterson's tender & uplifting screenplay was superb while Pete Docter doctored a successful directorial uperation of ""Up"". Big Thumbs Up for ""Up""! ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Delightful Entertainment,"Up is a story of a forced friendship between Carl, and old grumpy retired salesman, and Russell, a lonely overweight Asian-American boy, and their adventure together.The animation is not as impressive as in other Pixar films, but the script is very charming, and you'll get hooked right away. I missed the story being a little more original and inventive, and having less stereotypes and predictability. Still, is a moving and funny story that will delight adults and children. Among my favorite characters are Kevin, the rare species of bird, (hilarious! which reminded me of the WB's Roadrunner!), the talking nasty dogs, and Carl's dog.The first 10-15 minutes of the film, in which we see the story of Carl from his childhood to the death of his wife, are superb. as they create a real emotional life-long biography of the character. That's, no doubt, the best part of the film with a difference.The short film that precedes the movie, as always happens with Pixar's shorts, is pure delight and humorous creativity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Way too negative and sad,"I am so disappointed with this movie!! I was so excited to see it and I left the theater disappointed and sad. I know that most movies like this have obstacles characters need to overcome, but practically the entire movie was one negative and sad/bad situation after another. Way more trials and tribulations than funny moments. I went with the expectation the movie would have an overall positive and fun theme but it did not at all. It was a big downer.

Buoyed dreams,"Typical of Pixar's adeptness in conveying stories, the first few minutes of ""Up"" pack more wallop than a whole two-hour tearjerker could, as it charts Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) and childhood friend Ellie through the decades, from their role-playing days as intrepid travelers to their marriage, and eventually, Ellie's death. Pete Docter's animated tale is an elegant combination of humor and pathos that perfectly captures the rush brought about by adventure, the uplifting quality of friendship, and -- at once a reminder of Disney's ""Bambi"" and Pixar's refusal to compromise its narratives -- the pain of losing someone. It's a profundity that's both delicate and penetrating.78-year old Carl and his wife Ellie had kept a scrapbook of their planned adventures and always dreamed of going to the fictional Paradise Falls in Venezuela, where their childhood hero, the adventurer Muntz (Christopher Plummer), has famously traveled. For some reasons, the expedition doesn't materialize and Ellie soon dies, leaving Carl alone in the house, with the latter about to go to predatory land developers. Inadvertently bringing along the pudgy Wilderness Scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), Carl decides to fulfill Ellie's wish as he ties thousands of balloons to his house and floats to South America.Advertised as Pixar's first foray into 3D, ""Up""'s candy-colored palette and graceful portraits of Carl's house floating in the sky benefit from the additional visual depth, though the increasingly silly travails of Carl and his slapdash tour is filled with buoyant energy that keeps it from resting entirely on the technology's novelty. Centering on the theme of one's continual search for purpose, Carl learns of how holding to the past keeps him from reaching his destination and from setting off to new adventures, a moral that Docter fortunately doesn't overplay, but rather is represented in splendid visual metaphors. It may be too easy to call it an elevation to animation but there's no escaping the fact that, for all its jaunty adventures and affectionate regard to relationship, ""Up"" -- pardon the obvious description -- doesn't let down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
IncredibleMrD review: Up,"Up is without a doubt another Pixar masterpiece! Pixar has made ten out of ten fantastic movies and this is definitely up there with the greatest and perhaps funniest of them all! The characters are all immediately lovable and the stunning 3-D visuals are amazing! The opening scenes are beautiful and many people in my showing were crying at the touching beginning. The story is so original and the talking dogs are so cleverly done that it hardly seem far-fetched at all. Alpha, the lead dog was hilarious with his high pitched voice, and it was awesome how much the dogs still acted like dogs. Kevin the bird gave a great deal of laughs as did Russel the Wilderness Explorer.This is pixars first attempt at making a movie with realistic humans as the main characters (Incredibles doesn't count since they were superheroes) and it is above and beyond successful. It is amazing how the studio can create a grumpy old man that the audience will easily connect with and find charming.

Amazing Pixar film,"I've been a pixar film since 10 years old ever since I first saw toy story and fell in love with those characters. Ever since then I've become a bigger and greater film fan and pixar I feel has kept up with that. With Incredibles they did one of the best superhero movies and with wall-e I felt they had made a sincerely great entry into the scifi genre. Up is an action/adventure movie on par with the early Indian jones movies, except for the exception that the main character is about as old as the latest Indian jones movie. This is honestly one of pixar's sadder films. I am tempted to say darker but the film is honestly a light hearted adventure once it get going. The first 20 minutes are sheer sadness though. Not since the Lion King have I felt such empathy for an animated character. From the first scenes you know that it's headed toward eventual tragedy, but this is where the story of Up picks up from. It begins with a tragedy then moves into an action adventure, unlike any film I've ever seen before. I love the characters I love the setting, I just genuinely love this movie. It's got a true blue heart but it's not afraid to make you laugh, cry, and feel the intensity that the characters feel. Additionally the Disney 3-d is amazing, this isn't the type of movie where I felt that they went out of there way to make it 3-d (i.e. Beowulf My Bloody Valentine) but the effect is quite riveting. On top of a fantastic film you get a 3-d preview of Toy Story 3, which honestly had me giddy with joy. Especially after seeing how great Up looked in it. I feel like Pixar keeps getting more ambitious with their films, Wall-e contained a blatant political message, while this film is significantly heavier than any animated film I've seen. It's about remorse and lost time, and is a reminder of why we should live our lives to fullest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Up really takes Pixar Up,"I thought Pixar had lost me since the movie Cars. I saw Wall-e and I didn't like it. I thought that Pixar had gone down and will never redeem themselves. But I was wrong. Up is such success and pure Disney Pixar Magic. The adventures of these characters is so original and so well made out. The plot and sequences really amazed me. This masterpiece will go into the Pixar legends. A great story for boy and girls young and old. Up is an Oscar worthy film.

Emotionally Breathtaking Adventure in 3D,"Ever since I had my mind completely blown away after seeing ""Toy Story"" for the first time as a kid, Pixar has never let me down. ""Up"" is no exception.However ""Up"" is something more different than it's predecessors. Right after a emotionally tear-dripping 15min long introduction, you'll notice that Pixar has shifted to a different gear regarding their storytelling. Following the non-dialogue approach from ""Wall-E"", ""Up"" is all about emotions. – This is not to say that ""Up"" lacks dialogues (Russell will keep you more than occupied on that front) ""Up"" is simply more focused on to give rise to multitudes of emotions throughout the story, many of them sub-consciously and again without the need of any unnecessary dialogue. It leaves the emotions completely to the audience.As for my experience of seeing ""Up"" in 3D for the first time, Pixar blew my mind again after all these years. Seeing the incredible depths of ravines, feeling the wide panorama of Paradise Falls tropical landscape and nearly ducking for Carl's house flying past only inches over your head is a experience that kept my heart-rate way over average pulse. (I must confess that I actually tried to touch Dug's tufty fur for a moment. Good thing that it's really dark at the cinema so that your neighbour won't give you a strange look as you're fumbling with your hands in thin air).Even though the 3D-glasses diminishes the colorfulness of movie only slightly, this didn't stop me at all from grasping for air when experiencing clear-blue sky, lively green vegetation and characters sparkling with colors, especially Kevin.""Up"" is definitely my new favourite Pixar-movie as the story certainly has ""grown up"" since ""Toy Story""'s often screaming and attention-seeking dialogues and humour.... So, should you pay a extra buck to wear a pair of 3D-glasses when watching ""Up"" at the cinema? –Hell, even I (who's wearing glasses normally) put on the 3D-glasses atop of my regular glasses with a big smile on my face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Beautiful,"Surprise! The curmudgeon is in the mainstream for a change: I loved this film. Much more than I expected to. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it, everybody else has already done that. A fun adventure, some good comedy, and a surprising amount of heart. Never in a million years did I expect to be as moved by an animated fun movie like this as I was. Yes, there were a few nits I could pick on, mostly involving the villain, but they are easily overlooked given all that I liked about the movie.The problem with writing review for films I love (which I don't do very often) is that I never want to say too much, lest I give anything away. Better to just go see it yourself. But be warned: it's not all sunshine and light, there's some definite sadness in there as well.Out of curiosity, I read some of the ""Hated It"" reviews to see what people there would have to say. Very interesting. The main complaint seemed to be from parents who found it too heavy for their kids. Perhaps that's a valid complaint, I don't know, I'm not a parent. But it raises the interesting thesis that perhaps I, as an adult, responded to the movie so strongly precisely because it is a more adult film than your typical children's-fare animated movie. But I don't think that's a bad thing at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Ah, Pixar. What I wait for all year long.","And they don't disappoint at all with this outing. It's probably not their best work. That's Wall-E. It's not as tightly plotted as other Pixar flicks, and the villain, in particular, could have used more work. But so what? Really, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since, well, Wall-E. The prologue of this film, especially its second sequence, a completely silent (except for score) exploration of a long, beautiful marriage that gives us a novel's worth of information in a mere 8 minutes, is so remarkable that I could not hold back tears. In a way, that's a minor flaw as well. The film never quite tops those first 10 or 15 minutes. But the remaining 70 or 80 minutes are a ton of fun, and touching in their own way. Pixar shows Disney that cute animal sidekicks can be completely charming and hilarious. Dug the dog who talks with his special collar is constantly hilarious, as is the goofy bird, nicknamed Kevin. Like I said already, the villain is weak and could have been more thoroughly characterized. But it's not too bad - that's made up for with his more villainous talking dogs. Villainous they certainly are, but the way they talk, still thinking like dogs, is always worth some big laughs. And there's also a cute kid who is in no way annoying. Pixar proves once again that it has more imagination, wit and charm than anyone else working in the medium today. And that medium is not animated features, but cinema itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Two Thumbs Way Up for Up!,"I originally did not plan to see ""Up"" fearing that it would not be any good. Then again, Pixar has done well the last two years with ""Ratatouille"" and ""Walle"". For the heck with it, along with some friends, I went to see it last night. The theater was packed, specifically with parents and their little ones. From start to finish, there was hardly any noise in the theater, except for the constant laughter. What I'm saying is, is that ""Up"" delivers.What's nice about ""Up"" is that it is not only great for kids, but also for adults. I've been noticing lately that Pixar has been incorporating mature themes in their films. Without giving too much away about the plot, ""Up"" deals with things that every person encounters, the loss of a loved one, and the sense of helplessness it brings. Heavy subject matter, but it doesn't make the film too mature nor does it make it syrupy.The message the film delivers, the ability to go fulfill a childhood dream and go on an adventure, if even you think you've outgrown it is brilliant. Watching this movie made me feel like a little kid again. Well done.The voice talent is wonderful. I did not recognize many of the cast members' voices, which I think is a good thing, because a big celebrity like Eddie Murphy or Mike Myers can divert from the intended story. The animation isn't corny nor is it over the top like in ""Happy Feet."" Michael Giacchino's score adds a whole new level to the film. It helps propel the story. When the movie hits a sad moment, the music makes you want to cry. When it hits a suspenseful moment, it makes you want to grab onto the edge of your seat.Rarely do I give a perfect, but ""Up"" deserves one from me. Two Thumbs Way Up for Up! It makes you feel sad. Makes you feel exhilarated. Makes the time fly by. It makes you laugha lot.My rating: **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Love this movie!,"I didn't think there would be more good movies after Nemo because I thought that all the new movies would suck. But this movie UP, is really really good! It can make you laugh and cry in the next second. I love all the characters and the story. It's like a movie that tells you too appreciate life and enjoy every second of it. I had moments in the movie when I was about to cry but I didn't, although I had tears in my eyes. I had many moments when I laughed really hard. And moments when I didn't know what would happen. You can see how much technology have developed because it sometimes looks like reality in the movie. I love all the colors and everything!There are also two other small movies that's extra and they're really cute and funny.

A Truly Transcendent Animated Film,"As an avid fan of all Pixar movies, I had very high hopes for the release of Up, a movie which I believed would continue the Pixar tradition of presenting a message for all age groups within a medium that appealed to younger viewers. What I received surpassed that expectation and so much more, soaring to a new level of film within the animated realm and proving, I believe, that animated films such as this can compete with any potential best picture release.Up is based in adventure, yet the depth of the characters and the emotional texture that is woven throughout its presentation exceeds any sort of single genre. I laughed, I sighed, I even cried at the range of human emotion which this remarkable film manages to elicit from viewers. See this movie with a friend, child, girlfriend, or wife, just see the movie and I promise you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent!!,"Took my 7 year old daughter to see Up(3D) this afternoon. What can I say: visually-excellent; stylistically-excellent; story line-simple but beautifully done; score-wonderful; characters-superb/interesting ... as the story unfolds I felt a full range of emotions (some, I felt deeply -and I'm a 42 year old man's man). Actually, I could relate to this story on so many levels (e.g. experiencing great loss; deferred dreams; deep regrets; the struggle between holding onto the past versus moving forward in life; spirit of adventure and letting go of self imposed obstacles to finally reach for my dreams; something that at first seems an imposition but turns out to be of great value; and much more) . Who could ask for more in an animated film. ""Up"" is a must see - one of the best animated films ever in my opinion.

When the old man is hanging down, they still love each other deeply, even if you are no longer there, you must take them a common dream takes a risk in the end of life, just like children's curiosity that does not a hindrance to life and dreams, no matter how old they are.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Nutshell Review: Up,"Much has been said about the opening montage, and I fully agree that it's an extremely touching sequence in itself, bringing out and establishing the lonely character of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a man living out his twilight years, finally deciding to take the plunge and fulfill a lifelong dream and a promise made. If the first few minutes doesn't make you cry, then you must have a heart of stone, or never loved before.What transpires in the film is more or less captured in the trailers already, with Fredricksen lifting up his home with thousands of helium filled balloons, off for his adventure of a lifetime, only to find a stowaway, little wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) scared stiff on his front porch. While the boy offers to become Carl's sidekick for that final badge of honour to be promoted to senior explorer, little did he know that he too is up for a crazy adventure in South America, joined by a talking dog Dug (Bob Peterson) and an endangered bird, to Carl's dismay as they detract him from his mission.While seemingly implausible in many ways (for instance having the flimsy contraption the size of a house with perishable balloons survive a mean thunderstorm), in order for the narrative and plot elements to work, you have to accept what's going on with a pinch of salt. Pixar has so far never disappointed me with its films, and Up continues the company's successful box office juggernaut by reminding everyone that it's all about the story first, the strong characters next, and animation just going about getting the job done.It's a moving tale about loss and the prospect of letting go. Essentially it's a Carl Fredericksen story, where through the interaction with his new found friends, as opposed to fiends such as contractors and developers eyeing his property, discover new meaning to life, and a second chance for that sense of adventure that's been buried by life's unfortunate ups and downs. While a chapter has been closed in his earlier life of companionship, herein lies another opportunity to live out a new adventure, no point sitting around and mope in self pity. It's quite uplifting in that it's full of hope, yet dishes out enough nostalgic reminiscence that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.There were two moments that I particularly enjoyed, outside of the opening montage. The first was that parallel with The Fountain, where one is tasked to complete a beautiful experience by making new ones, on one hand never to forget, but on the other never to make a crutch of an excuse out of it, and to move on. The second was how life as depicted unfolds itself in phases, where the unexpected can crop up and derail even the best of intentions and plans. But so long as you have someone to share the spoils with, good and bad, then perhaps everything else is tolerable.If there's a complaint about the quality of the 3D here, then I must say that amongst all the 3D live action and animated ones shown here to date, Up is unfortunately most disappointing of the lot because there wasn't much sequences that maxed out its 3-dimensional ability. You might just be better off with the 2D version, to save some cash for films that are truly designed to envelope your senses, rather than just to provide some depth of field.Up is utterly moving, a romance story if you'd like in its inner core, filled with plenty of lovely moments that never lose you, and punctuated with adequate and well timed comedic. The short film that preceded Up, called Partly Cloudy, also served as a great appetizer to the feature, and reinforces the notion that a simple tale about a stork and a cloud that addresses the perennial children's question on where do babies come from, and without dialogue at that, can still move you if told in a way that's sincere and full of heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Outstanding Film Lifted By Disney,"This is a truly spectacular film by Disney for everyone to watch and really enjoy. The storyline may have been simple but it is fun and terrific.

"With their run of success maintained by their latest feature, Pixar is one balloon that definitely hasn't burst.","How can you tell a feature length story about a man who tows his house around for the duration of the film? Furthermore, how can you have said feature length story's central character be an elderly male who may not be youthful enough to appeal to children, and who also may not be marketable enough to sustain a production line of tie-in merchandise? The answer; ask Pixar.Early promotional material from plot summaries to teaser trailers did not interest me in Up as much as the studio's previous endeavours; I personally prefer animated films about inanimate objects or animals as opposed to human beings (an example being The Incredibles; highly enjoyable and well-made but my least favourite Pixar film simply for the fact that there were no talking toys, monsters, bugs, fish or cars). Having not seen Up in cinemas early following its release, I finally made my way to a viewing, glad to be extremely surprised by what the film had in store for for a Pixar fan wondering if this was possibly going to be their first release which did not garner my full enthusiasm. Taking off my 3D glasses following the film, I could have hung my head in shame.When Carl Fredricksen, an elderly man living alone in the house where he grew up with his deceased wife, is threatened with being placed in a retirement home, he escapes by attaching a myriad of colourful helium balloons to his fireplace. Floating away from the city, he discovers Russell, a young wilderness explorer, has become an inadvertent stowaway on his front porch. Following a dangerous storm they land in South America and become caught up in a hunter's search for an elusive wild bird. Though the characters may not immediately strike you as likable, they soon gain your appreciation and before long you're backing them as they take on the enemy and his pack of hunting dogs (who communicate in the most novel, entertaining and laugh-out-loud manner you may have ever seen in a film about talking dogs).The outstanding technical achievements of the film aside, Up is a complete marvel in terms of storytelling. Whether it be within the script or shown with equal clarity in a visual manner, the journey of Carl Fredricksen as he sets out to fulfill the wishes of his dead wife is conveyed as hilarious and heartfelt in equal measure. That audiences are shedding tears at the BEGINNING of the film is a testimony to the sheer depth of character development, achieved not through complex dialogue but by means of a montage of images detailing the protagonist's life with his partner. Such emotion resonates throughout the entire film; Pixar have not grown complacent despite their success and must be applauded for continuing to take daring risks not only with their productions themselves, but also with the conflict and trials that their characters face within them. At times I found myself wondering if Pixar were really going to let certain events play out with such potentially devastating outcomes.By far my favourite artistic aspect of the film was the house; tethered to Carl and Russel as they trek towards their destination, it illustrates how Pixar see a potential roadblock and overcome it with such creative ease. Not once does the floating house become a burden to the film throughout its entire runtime; not once was I concerned that it was becoming tedious. This, coupled with the home signifying a great deal of Carl's life-long relationship, ensures that what could have been a weight on Pixar's shoulders is something carried through the events of the movie well and with relevance.Pixar clearly understand the elements that make a film a classic. Toy Story is arguably their only film to date to have achieved classic status (and it's about time, nearly fifteen years after its release), however in my opinion the majority of the Pixar canon is only waiting for time to be able to honour its legacy. Up rightfully earns its place in this majority.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another masterpiece from Pixar,"Looking back, I can't help but to immediately notice a very interesting pattern in my past movie reviews. This is the third Pixar movie I have written a review for, and this will also be the third consecutive time that I will open the review with the following sentence: Pixar have done it again. Once again, they have proved that no animation studio – and no live action studio either, for that matter – can come anywhere near the sheer and utter quality of their entertainment, purely and simply put. Pixar have proved once again that they can take a concept and premise that doesn't sound particularly attractive at first, and turn it into a masterwork of cinema. They have proved that unlike their animation studio contemporaries, Pixar don't need celebrity voices and characters specifically designed to be packaged and ready for delivery to toy store shelves, and they certainly don't feel the need to patronize their young audience members by injecting into their films jokes that only parents can understand. And they have proved once again that unlike most live-action studio output, it is still possible to create compelling, dramatic and irresistibly entertaining cinema from original screenplays without falling into formulas, clichés or any other kind of compromise for the sake of the audience. In short, Pixar have once again proved that they are the best film studio working today, period.So what makes a Pixar movie tick? What makes this studio's output so consistently better than that of pretty much all the other film studios today, animated or otherwise? I think the answer can be summed up in one simple but crucial word: characters. For Pixar, as for all the great screenwriters both past and present, a film begins and ends with its characters; create compelling and identifiable characters and you can pretty safely bet that an equally compelling story will come along with them. Within the first ten minutes of this film, you know you're in for something different as you see Doctor portray in a completely dialogue-less montage an entire life-long relationship, from the shy childhood beginnings of our protagonist Carl and his soon-to-be-wife Ellie and through their ups and downs, hardships living a complete life together, and finally her eventual death, all the while their childhood dream hovering above them but never quite coming to fruition. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful and poignant sequence, probably the best ten-minute block Pixar have ever created, and while the film does take a slightly different direction from there, it doesn't cease from still bringing up very poignant topics throughout, including hardships of old age, unhealthy obsession, divorce, a child's rejection by his father, and other such resonant, real-life experiences that one wouldn't expect to see in a children's film. Here within lies Pixar's secret, which is additionally exemplified in the story and the humor in their films as well: they don't patronize their young audience members by providing two planes of existence in the film – jokes and plot points for the kids and another set for the adults – but rather, Pixar manage to find the subjects, plot points, visual gags and jokes that both children AND their parents can relate to. For example, I'm nowhere near being a parent yet, but I can imagine this film serving as a very good starting-off point for important parent-child discussions, such as divorce, deteriorating old age of grandparents, and where babies come from.The bottom line is that there is simply no studio quite like Pixar. Only they could represent more genuine human emotion and feelings in a silent, 6-minute short film than any major Hollywood production of the past 10 years (the short preceding the film, ""Partly Cloudy"", is one of Pixar's all-time best in my opinion, in terms of hilarity but also in terms of poignant emotional resonance). Only they could take a premise of a man tying helium balloons to his house and flying it to South America and turn it into one of the most dramatic, compelling and irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. Only they could take a film whose protagonists are a grumpy, sour 80-year-old widower and a chubby, 8-year-old obnoxious Asian child and turn it into one of the most massive box office successes of the year. And for that, they deserve all the praise in the world, and them some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar's most emotionally involving  film.  Best flick so far of 2009!,"Early reviews of Disney/Pixar's Up made some statements that I myself could not believe. The main charge in almost all the reviews was that the audience was crying within the first ten minutes. This seemed impossible to me, that an audience of people could become so emotionally involved in a film within ten minutes as to start crying...I was wrong. The opening to this film is heartbreaking, and possibly one of the saddest scenes to be featured in a film. And they pepper these little scenes throughout. This movie is very emotionally involving, and that's a good thing.Carl Fredrickson (In his old age, voiced by Ed Asner) at one time was a kid with dreams of being an adventurer, visiting strange and exotic lands. As a child, he met Ellie, the girl of his dreams, and he got married to her. They had a life together, tried to have a baby, and as life went on, the explorer dreams went farther and farther away. After Ellie's death, Carl has become a bitter old man. Now 78, all that Carl has left is his house, which construction workers want down. After an accident where Carl injures a man, Carl is forced into an old folks home, but he isn't going. Being a retired balloon salesman, Carl has plenty of balloons left, so he ties his house up and takes off for South America where he and his wife dreamed of going. Unfortunately for him, boy scout wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) came along for the ride. Adventure and chaos ensues while trying to get his house to the exact spot in South America.This really is an excellent, if not almost perfect picture. The characters have such depth, as is true with most Pixar main characters. Carl is a mean old man, but he is definitely likable, and it's easy to see the motivation behind his anger and bitterness. Russell is another deep character, written to be the comic foil, and to be a cute little kid, and to be the child from a broken home who has problems. These characters contrast so perfectly and have excellent chemistry, and are just well written in themselves.In many ways this is a touching film. Lot's of character development is featured, mainly from Carl, but from others too. Carl is such a tragic hero, and all he wants to do is set his house down where he and his wife dreamed. Carl's wants and needs should click with anybody who has nostalgia and just wants to live their past. He's a broken man, trying to redeem himself, for himself and for the memory of his deceased wife. It's really a sad tale in itself, but with the normal Pixar magic, it's also an uplifting, funny, entertaining film that will definitely be remembered as a classic.Pixar has yet again raised their bar even higher. Up is a beautiful adventure film filled with rich characters, great animation and very real emotion. Possibly Pixar's best picture yet, and that's including the amazing Wall-E. Best picture thus far of 2009!My rating: **** out of ****. 99 mins. PG for some tragic scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar soars to new heights,"Up is everything you could ask for in a animation film and more. This is Disney/Pixar's first film in 3D. I have been a bit wary about the use of this technology, but I can't deny that it looks breathtaking here. There are no cheap effects and it is only used to make the film look better, giving it more depth and character. It's not just eye candy and it doesn't take away from the story.The story follows Carl Frederickson, an elderly man who has had a dream for most of his life to fly to South America to see Paradise Falls, the place where his favorite explorer, Charles Muntz, last visited. When life pushes him to the limit, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Being a Balloon salesman, he transforms his house into an air ship, tying on hundreds if not thousands of balloons to life him above the landscape and off to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately for him but fortunately for us, he has a tag along. Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer (like a Boy Scout) who happens upon his house just as he lifts off. The two are stuck together until they reach the falls.Along the way we encounter a strange bird of paradise Russell calls Kevin as well as a dog named Dug who has a collar that allows him to talk. All distractions and annoyances for Carl but friends to Russell.This is a wonderful story that makes you truly happy when it's all over. I thought WALL-E had some deep and profound messages like staying ""green"" and the dangers of obesity, but Up talks about fertility, life and death, companionship, fatherhood, as well as the generic loyalty, the importance of friendship, and having fun.Like all Pixar films (especially lately), there is always one aspect of the animation that is constantly being tested and glorified. In Finding Nemo we see how the water effects the objects in it as well as the light. Ratatouille showed how fog and shadows can create mood. Monster's Inc. focused a lot of attention on texture and interacting with the environment (like Sully's fur). In Up we get a lot of depth perception and panoramic views thanks to the 3D technology. There are times when I caught myself practically drooling over how beautiful a shot was. They really do a fantastic job in animating.Another big aspect of the production that has great importance is the voice acting. I think Ellen DeGeneres's voice acting for Dory in Finding Nemo is one of the greatest on screen performances of all time. The voices in Up capture the feelings of the characters perfect. Ed Asner voices Carl. He is grumpy, determined, but there is a lot going on under the surface that slowly rises up as the film progresses. Jordan Nagai voices Russell and gives exactly what we could possibly ask from a child actor: to be himself. Even the co-director and writer Bob Peterson does a great job as the voice of the dog Dug (also the voice of Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo). Other talents like Christopher Plummer, Delroy Lindo, and John Ratzenberger, the only actor to have an appearance in all 10 of the Disney/Pixar feature films.Like most Pixar films, so much relies on the music. My least favorite of the 10 films is Cars, a film that have a heavy modern soundtrack. I like it when they stick to their creative guns and fire off something new and fantastic. They were much better about it with WALL-E, mixing in original with with existing tunes like the Hello, Dolly! soundtrack. A very nice touch. Here with Up we have a brand new score that is inspirational and fitting to the story. There is a sort of waltz like we are floating across a dance floor. It fits quite nicely.Where Up falters is...nowhere. I have seen the film twice already and both times I left completely satisfied. The animation is some of their best and the story is tight and perfect. It stays the course and carries you the entire way. It's beautiful, poetic, and uplifting. Expect to be dazzled and wowed by this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

He met her when he was a goofy little boy, and she was a spunky little girl, and together they shared a lust for adventure inspired by the great explorer Charles Muntz. The history of Carl and his wife Ellie is told through one of the most moving opening sequences in recent memory. Translation: I may have shed a tear or two.Lucky for us, Russell, an enthusiastic Junior Wilderness Scout, comes around to mend our broken heartstrings in hilarious fashion, as his youthful innocence is quickly countered by Carl's old indifference, and vice versa. What they do share, however, is determination. Russell will do anything to assist the elderly and become a Senior Wilderness Scout, and Carl will do anything to find Paradise Falls and finish his late wife's Adventure Book. Their interaction is classic, a relationship that both child and adult are likely to enjoy.As always, Pixar does a fine job of suspending our disbelief in a way that is strangely acceptable. The flying house, for example, is a simple network of balloons sprouting out of the chimney, with the strings tightly fastened to the fireplace. To steer the flying vessel, shower curtains serve as the sails and a crank tied to the weather vain is the helm, while a garden hose works as the anchor. The idea is incredible, but works wonderfully in the reality of the story, as Carl in his youth often had trouble preventing his balloon cart from floating off the ground.While the movie is obviously fantasy, it touches on issues and emotions that are very real and very dark. ""Up"" serves as a reminder that adventure is out there, even in the boring stuff we take for granted in everyday life, and therein lies the real answer to overcoming our darkest times.""Up"" is original, funny, inspirational, beautifully animated, and full of surprises, as all Pixar films tend to be. Even an old bit like talking dogs is used in a way that is different and really entertaining. Fortunately for me, I only watched ""Up"" in 2D, and have an excuse to come back and enjoy once again, the magical adventure of Carl Fredrickson and the little flying house that could. Adventure is out there! And on my list of cinematic adventures, ""Up"" is way up there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Direct Hit on the Target Audience,"The Incredibles is one of my favorite movies of all time and I really enjoyed most of the other Pixar movies. However, I am one of the roughly 3 people in the world who didn't like Wall-E. And I was not all that impressed with Ratatouille. After being let down by those two recent offerings I went into Up a little skeptical. My faith is renewed. Walking out of Up I felt the same joy that I did walking out of Finding Nemo or Toy Story with one distinct difference: I felt like the target audience was different for Up than for all other Pixar movies. All previous Pixar films left me with the impression that they were created for kids, but not just for kids. They could, and were, appreciated by all generations despite having kids as the target audience because they were so finely crafted. For me, Up has the same characteristic of being enjoyable to all ages, but I really felt like it was targeted to adults. The themes and issues, while appealing to kids, will resonate more strongly with adults. The format and content were definitely kid-friendly, but I hope the animated style doesn't dissuade adults from going to see it regardless of whether or not they have kids with them. It is truly a poignant and fun movie for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
UP Carries You Away,"Pixar has found a home with Disney and, with apologies to Dreamworks and other animation studios, no one has come close in recent years to their fresh, inventive, and importantly, timeless spirit in computer animation. In UP, a tale of loneliness and friendship is told in a simple, heartfelt way. This is one of the best films of the year and puts live action films to shame.Carl begins as an adventure-loving boy whose childhood friendship with a girl, Ellie, grows into a marriage as adults and a dream to visit their ideal destination, Paradise Falls in South America. Later widowed, Carl becomes a crusty, elderly man who longs for escape. In time, his neighborhood is transformed into an urban development, and one fateful day with the threat of being committed to a retirement community, he takes his house on a bold, unlikely trip by balloons through the skies to South America. Unfortunately, he discovers an accidental passenger in the form of a Boy Scout named Russell who is looking to get his final merit badge by helping a senior citizen. Carl must make a momentous decision that changes his life and affects Russell. Their joint flight arrives somewhere in the vicinity of Paradise Falls. Along the way they encounter an unusual, giant bird dubbed Kevin and a dog named Dug whose thoughts are vocalized through his special electronic collar. This motley group encounters a mysterious, dangerous presence that threatens them and jeopardizes Carl's journey to his final destination.Pete Docter (Wall-E, Toy Story) and Bob Peterson (Finding Nemo) bring their story and screenplay talents to the fore as co-directors. It's really a story about unfulfilled, broken dreams and things left undone, and the spirit and drive to recapture those feelings. The film begins with a subplot involving the friendship and growing romance of a young Carl and Ellie who share a passion for life and adventure. The imaginative vignettes tell a complete love story in an opening montage that ends as our film is only beginning-wow! What makes this film head and shoulders above most animations is its poignant confrontation of life's ups and downs. It's about life and death told in terms that are not disingenuous. In the grand tradition of Disney classics as Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, movies about finding a safe place from danger are at the core of children's animation, and this film plays on that tradition. The novelty here is that the lead character is elderly. There is a sense of The Wizard of Oz in its otherworldly journey of discovery and camaraderie, and even the climax smacks of Saturday morning cliffhangers. A nice change of pace is the lack of contemporary, inside jokes or puns based on pop culture that are staples of such Dreamworks hits as the Shrek films. The situations here are organically amusing from natural conflicts and plot.Carl (voiced to perfection by Edward Asner) is a mean, bitter soul who rediscovers his innocence and humanity through Russell, who in turn discovers the safety of a nuclear family with Carl and some unlikely companions. Kevin is cute, emanating amusing sound effects and body movements without uttering a single line of dialogue. Dug is a riot as the misfit dog whose heart of gold is matched by his incessant habit of having his 'talking' interrupted at any moment by a sudden spasm of posturing and shouting, ""point"" or ""squirrel""! It's a hoot. Christopher Plummer is effectively sinister as a blast from the past. The only criticism of the movie is minor at the end when we are not quite sure about Russell's parents and how much they are part of his life. John Ratzenberger's (Cheers) streak of doing a voice in every major Pixar release is intact.The computer animation is so good, that anything not human looks like a picturesque postcard. When Carl's balloons sprout above his house, we admire their stunning, vibrant colors. Interesting uses of cinematography are employed as if this were a live action feature. The final image is ironic as it is iconic, a fitting end to a fairy tale.This one ranks highly alongside Pixar favorites like Finding Nemo and Wall-E. Quite possibly, adults may find as much (if not more) to enjoy in this story. It's amazing that a modest story featuring a kid and old man told with conviction and skill is one of the best films of 2009.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Animation is no longer an airless timekiller and whoever still calls it one hasn't been paying attention,"The first fifteen minutes of Pixar's Up play like a full-length movie, featuring a reserved amount of dialog and a beautiful collection of clips that show a childhood friendship that amounted into a healthy, lasting relationship that ended in sadness. The relationship was between Carl, a shy young boy who idolizes the explorer Charles F. Muntz, and Ellie, an eclectic young girl who turns an old, rundown home into a headquarters for her club. The two meet out of nowhere one day, spark an immediate, offbeat friendship predicated on their love for exploring new places, get married, and endure decades of happiness before nature takes its course and Ellie passes away. Up details this in a beautiful, unforgettable fifteen minutes, leading to one of the most impacting scenes of animated emotion I have ever seen.Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) is now elderly, living in the aforementioned rundown house that acts as an island in the center of construction in the big city. Suits try to get Carl to sell his home, but he refuses, until seemingly admitting defeat after an incident with one of the workers turns violent. Carl manages to strap thousands of balloons to his home and, utilizing a complex steering system pioneered by his wife for fun when they were kids, manages to lift the house from the ground and sail through the vast, open blue skies. His destination is Paradise Falls, located in Venezuela, an exotic land where him and his wife always believed they'd reside.However, unwanted company accidentally hitches a ride in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a totally harmless little boy scout anxious to obtain his ""helping the elderly badge."" Before taking off in house, Carl instructed Russell out of kindness to capture a beast that has been tearing up his yard, and Russell returns on Carl's front porch to state his success when he is unwillingly taken up, up, and away along with Carl's entire home. The two wind up sticking together on this trip, both getting more than they bargained for when a nearly extinct bird and an unconventional talking dog turn up in their path as well.If there was ever a film to prove even the most hard-hearted that animation can be a wondrous medium that is capable of showing deep emotion, Up is the one. Writers Bob Peterson and Pete Docter (the Monsters, Inc. franchise) have successfully crafted Pixar's most adult script in terms of theme, focusing on the ideas of death, tribute, and closure, but capturing it in such a way that will not bore or miss the mark with young children. It wouldn't be far-fetched in my eyes to call Docter ""John Lasseter Jr.,"" since he possesses ambition akin to Lasseter's early animation days.If anything, this is thanks to the Docter, who utilizes both his directorial efforts with Pixar to create some of their biggest films in terms of visual scope and range. Monsters, Inc. featured an unprecedented amount of visual flair and colorful content. Consider the scene that took place inside the factory of many doors the monsters could use to enter a young child's bedroom. In one shot, when Mike and Sully are desperately holding on to one door, hundreds, if not thousands of doors are shown in just one shot. In several shots in Up, hundreds, if not thousands of multi-colored balloons are shown, which I'm sure posed and animating nightmare for the production team. The film had such a lengthy production history, a list of ""production babies"" - babies born during the making of the film - reaches about thirty or so children.The plot of Up works as a piece of escapism because it seems to be everyone's fantasy at one point or another - the fantasy being the ability to escape life's current issues by abandoning them entirely and having to answer to no one. In an essence, the film is a staple of what all animated film should include: lovable characters, a beautiful sense of adventure, the right amount of emotion leverage, extraordinary action sequences, and adult themes tackled in a digestible (but not condescending) way for young children. The revolutionary aspect of Up comes while watching this, realizing that animation is not just a timekiller for children, but an unbelievable art-form that will no hopefully no longer go shortchanged in discussions concerning cinema.Voiced by: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and Christopher Plummer.

"It's a ""guy movie"" (says my wife)","My wife and I saw Up in 3D last night. Just us 2 adults, no kids. We have seen most of the animated features in recent years and liked most of them. I thought Up was decent, not great, but OK. My wife HATED it!I agree with pretty much everything *negative* that has been said on this board about the movie, but I haven't seen mentioned the thing that bothered my wife the most: there are NO female characters past the first few minutes! The only female (human) even in the movie is Elie, very briefly as a tomboyish child in the very beginning, then as an adult in a short, silent montage. So by 5 minutes in, it's all guys. I guess the bird was female, but that fact is so far from obvious that she gets named ""Kevin"" by the little boy. (Maybe some of the dogs were female too, but you couldn't tell.) I didn't even notice the lack of female energy until my wife pointed it out but it's true, and I think it contributes an overall imbalanced feel of the movie.As for the 3D, I thought the scenery was very nicely done, but the overall use of 3D was more subtle than many other 3D movies. I don't remember any ""coming out at you"" shots at all; most of the 3D images were at or behind the screen rather than in front of it. I think this may be why many have commented that they didn't even notice the 3D. Also there were too many ""flat"" scenes that might as well have not been in 3D, such as long closeups of items in a scrapbook and long segments of black and white old newsreel style footage on a TV screen.So I'll average my 7 opinion with my wife's 1 and say 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Powerful almost Faith-Based Them to this movie.....,"Powerful almost Faith-Based Them to this movie.....The opening shows the life of Carl, growing from an young boy, meeting his adventuring-loving girlfriend, their marriage and her death just before their adventure starts - it's an incredibly emotional 5-minute intro that's light on dialog and heavy on visuals, and didn't leave a dry eye in the theater. This sequence in particular was reminiscent of the dialog-free sections of Wall-E which deliver their plot punches without exposition or the need for endless sequences that would take twice as long in live action. But this approach doesn't leave the younger audience behind either, and for such a dark start, all I could see in the audience were kids and adults alike glued to the screen. I won't give away any more plot details since the film doesn't open for another three weeks, but every scene and character trait is meticulously plotted so that nothing seems too ridiculous or contrived, even for such a fantastic journey. The graphic stylization is also fresh, in the same way that The Incredibles had a very distinct and authentic look. All of this serves to heighten the humor and there are some extremely funny scenes, helped by the way the characters are quickly and believably established (even the talking dogs, but you'll see what I mean).This is the second time I've been to Pixar to see a pre-release of a movie and I felt a little scared before seeing this one, wondering if their run of first-class work may have hit a plateau. On the surface, I didn't really think a story about a senior in a flying house could live up to Wall-E, yet although the films are as different as they can be, Up is as gripping and entertaining as any Pixar film. Their ability to blends styles and take the audience from laughter to tears in minutes showcases their deep understanding of story, and it's a shame that more films aren't crafted the same way.

Amazement,"All the technical and cinematographic details of the movie have already been reviewed, so there is little that I can add on that side. There is only one personal comment that i can add and that I think that many people probably shares with me: I never thought that I would be able to weep and laugh with the same movie, and this is what Up is all about: emotion!And the best part is that some cartoons did it! If you think about it when you see this movie, the plot itself is not that relevant, but all the personal situations and the feelings you can almost read on each character makes this piece so sensitive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up is one of Pixar's best yet...,"Pixar is on a roll, plain and simple. Up is the best film of the year so far and in the top tier of Pixar's best. We'll have another contender on our hands for a possible Best Picture nomination but the early release date is a damper on it. It'll definitely be the frontrunner for the Animated Category and screenplay.The colors are exquisite, the storyline is marvelous, and the characters are well thought out and charming.

"A bit too sporadic for my tastes, but still a really good film","For me, Pixar has always been at their best when they don't try to tell you anything, they simply allow the animation to tell its own story. Likewise with this film. The early silent montage of Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) and Ellie (Elie Docter) getting married and just growing old together is... it's unbelievable. Beautiful, touching, heart-breaking, it's one of the most potent scenes I've seen in a long time. Had the rest of the film been equally as good, this film would be in my Top Five.Alas, for me this film's downfall are its characters. I honestly really like Carl alone. He has this wonderful curmudgeon thing down pat, yet he's still extremely likable and you feel for the guy. Especially because you've just seen a few minutes ago what a great guy and husband he was, and now he has to struggle with both the loss of his wife and the loss of his dreams. Great, great character.The rest... are okay, for the most part. I never formed any connection with them like I've done with many other Pixar characters. Russell (Jordan Nagai) strays between being annoying and being sympathetic, Charles Muntz's (Christopher Plummer) presence in the film is just bawling, the bird just elicited a bored ""huh"" out of me and the dogs... well, the dogs were actually okay in a good way. They got a few laughs out of me and they were both cute and menacing as the story demanded.I have nothing bad to say about the story, which is a sweet and interesting romp through various situations, all of which look great and keep up your interest. But even a great story is built on top of its characters and if you don't feel for those characters, the story is really nothing more than a series of scenes, locations and actions strung together.I feel like I'm being too negative here. This is a good film. It's great for kids and adults alike, it has one great character in it and the rest are up to the task as well, it looks amazing and has some wonderfully imaginative scenes in it. For some reason I personally don't care too much for it, but that's just me and pretty much everyone else I know loves this film.

"UP, Up, and it's okay.","Up is not Pixars best film. It's still good, but it lacks the adult comedy throughout the picture. Up has a good story with terrific characters and a fantastic concept, but at times takes itself way too seriously. Except towards the end of the picture, the film doesn't take itself serious at all. A little too silly in fact. And the antagonist had a small part. I like the bad guy in films. I also like it when the good guy gets the bad guy at the end. My least favorite Pixar film was Monster INC. Up is my second least favorite. I'm really looking forward to next years Toy Story 3. The short film before Up was fantastic.

Another fine film by Pixar,"This was the first feature film that I have seen in 3d. Before discussing the merits of 3d let's discuss the film.Pixar must be the most critically/commercially successful production company of recent times. They have no duds in their back catalogue and a number of classic movies. Up is another fine film and just fails to make classic status although I am sure many people will rank it alongside Wall E and Toy Story. Personally I found it a little bit too sweet although that's a fine line that most of the Pixar movies tread.The film follows the dreams and ambitions of a couple of kids looking for adventure, Carl and Ellie. We see a quick clip of them ageing and putting off that trip they'd always planned to South America. Before we know it, it's too late ... or is it? The great thing about the movie is that you care about the characters. It always seems a bit strange to me that for some reason it is easier to feel empathy for animated characters than real actors. I've put it down to good script writers in the past, but I'm starting to wonder if there's something else going on. Anyway I'm sure most people will love Up and that it will be many peoples favourite film of the year.As mentioned earlier, this was the first film that I have seen in 3d. I can't say it really added to my enjoyment of the film and I can't help feeling that it's a bit of a gimmick designed to increase cinema takings. I've been to several 3d presentations at theme parks, but I think that's where the technology belongs. Maybe there will be a killer app that really showcases the technology, but I don't believe 3d will add much to most films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It is a lovely story but why the animation?,"Now there are things that couldn't be done with live actors but CGI has changed that and it left me wondering why this very lovely story was produced as an animation. For the first half of the story there seemed no earthly reason why, and even in the second half I was still wondering.Perhaps it was in the marketing as a 3D production that we are treated to camera angles and shots that would be quite difficult to achieve in live action and that is a pity because the story stands up on its own and is overplayed in many of the animation sequences. Fortunately it doesn't spoil the entertainment value but I am left thinking it reduces what could have been a great film into a good one.Yes the spectacle is, in places, a visual treat, but there is something missing in the personalities that the film doesn't quite make up for. And so I am awarding it seven out of ten for entertainment value, with three out of ten deducted for trying to divvy up reasons for three dimensional viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Stands on its own as the animated film with all the individual high profile accolades; and Up is a pleasant piece, blending a number of fun ideas and affecting content.","One wonders if 2009's animated feature 'Up' will be the mark of change in certain areas. Here's a film of an animated ilk that not only opened the 2009 Cannes film festival, but became the first since 1991's Beauty and the Beast, and only the second ever, to receive a best picture academy award nomination. The heavy spate of films throughout the whole of the last decade, those of a kind that saw them animated but rendered by way of computers, have enchanted and engrossed children and adults alike; but one wonders if, amidst the higher-ups that are entrenched within the nether regions of The Academy and premiere occasions across the European film festival circuit, those in charge have ever seen any of them as anything more than just a bunch of cartoons produced in order to merely satisfy and entertain. Up's recognition at Europe's best known, but not necessarily best loved, film festival gathering plus domestic acknowledgement at The Oscars, even if it was never going to win, might mark Up down as more significant over time than the creators first had in mind.Up's an enjoyable experience; a blending of physical comedy with a brutally simple, but certainly heartfelt, premise combined with a necessary amount of substance rolled into a package which suffices to a degree. No, the physical comedy does not peak at the levels 2001's Monsters Inc. attained, a film with a similar arc to Up in its cut and thrust idea of two hapless individuals (one little, one large) in possession of something they really ought not be as a wiry, spindly antagonist goes to extreme lengths to trip them up. Nor does it quite hit the heights of the previous year's Wall*E; a film that also had a somewhat lonely lead inhabiting a world that has significantly changed over the decades before deciding to branch out into yonder as all sorts of adventures and mishaps unfold. I imagine Up was pitched relatively simply, certainly if doubts were ever raised as to whether it would make its money back: it has a flying house; slapstick infused chasing; an oddball buddy teaming of an old man and a young boy; plus, it features a talking dog.The film starts with a young boy by the name of Carl Fredricksen (Asner) having his gaze captured as looks at a cinema screen, displaying one of those reels of news footage you got prior to a film screening way back when, are captured. The cinema screen looms over the watching crowd, an establishment of power is apparent as this young boy observes in absolute awe explorer Charles Muntz (Plummer) take to the skies in his airship on a mission to seek out the animal whose bones he has brought back from South America, but have subsequently been deemed fake. The innocence of youth, and that latching onto either a brand name or an omnipresent media story is captured; the reasons for which become clear later on when another young boy sixty or so years later, carrying an obsessive fixation this time with the great outdoors, enable Carl to suffer an epiphany when all is truthfully revealed and the true nature of what was so striking and fascinating is all but a letdown.Carl's ascent into old age is put across by way of a three or so minute montage, a life of which seemed to consist of home-building, balloons and a wife named Ellie. Following her death, the void that is that they never got to journey to South America together, despite Ellie's equal fascination in Muntz and his travels, has steps dutifully undertaken so that it may be filled by Carl in flying off to the continent by way of a lot of balloons and a lot of helium. It additionally allows Carl to avoid the wrath of some thinly drawn businessmen whom want his house and land for construction purposes, and whose appearance is made more unearthly in their wearing of shades thus giving them an odd insectile look. In the process of filling that particular void, he will gradually undertake filling another in the taking care of young junior scout Russell (Nagai), the son he never had while in time, Carl will come to represent the father Russell doesn't seem to have. Russell additionally has one of the more perplexing lines of the film; when he expresses his distinct shock at the discovery of a talking dog in Dug (Peterson), despite having just flown to Venezuela from The U.S.A. by way of a house and then encountering a bird that sort of resembles the long since extinct Dodo.Up's idea is clear-cut, in that Carl's there for adults wanting to will on the guy trying to pay respect to his dead wife, while Russell's shenanigans and often amusing antics will entertain those of his respective age range. But Up's heart is in the right place, and its instances such as Carl's emotionally charged reaction to Russell's innocent ""cross your heart?"" plea as well as some basic mother-bird-in-peril/chicks-rendered-defenceless are effective without overly demanding we react. Like most of these films from recent times, the chase inspired finale in which physical comedy and all the natural surrounding elements combine to create a set piece is present. It's equally dramatic as it is funny, an idea for a finale coined from the removal truck chase sequence at the end of Toy Story. It's not of the creative nor humorous level that Monsters Inc. hit, what with its extravagant ideas and genuinely funny moments spawned by a number of doors opening up and acting as portals into our world as a warehouse full of all kinds of devices and tricks acted as the setting. Nonetheless, Up works; with a blending of heartfelt and comedic material which sit well with chase-come-thriller ingredients that crops up towards the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

About dealing with the past,"First of all, the silent opening of this film is one of the finest pieces of cinema I've ever seen. The initial meeting between Carl and Ellie, their life together and the loss at the end, is a story in and on itself. Pixar is often at its finest when there's no dialogue. And this is the crowning achievement in that. Sure, there is some dialogue at the initial meeting, but after that it's pure visual storytelling. And it is glorious!If only the rest of the film could have been as good. And yes, I'm taking the mickey out of you. Kinda. It's still a really good film, suitable for all ages, while still retaining that core of values, depth and wisdom that marks all great Disney/Pixar films.That being said, I'm not a huge fan of the storyline. Going to South America is fine and the fact that it is achieved with balloon is just one of those precious things that just works despite its innate insanity. Put then we get introduced to the dogs. And the birds. And Christopher Plummer's character. Which all put together leave me with mixed feelings. They're good on their own. The dogs are fun, especially Alpha and Dug. Plummer's character can be both charismatic as well as menacing. The bird is... well okay, the bird is just silly, frankly speaking. Put it's the mix of them that has the hiccups. This movie could have been this great pulp adventure. Especially if you just kept the Plummer character and got rid of the rest. Put it's not. It's simply... silly.Not to say that the silliness doesn't work. It also helps a lot that both Carl and his junior woodchuck partner in crime Russell are both fantastic characters. Carl especially is one of my favourite Pixar characters of all time. Perfectly curmudgeon, but still extremely likable and sympathetic.I honestly think that I might like this movie better as a whole if it didn't have that opening narration. But it has and it is so good that the rest of the film pales in comparison. Still, very much worth a watch and one of Pixar's better ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Carl Fredricksen is another inspirational character in the Pixar collection. The other characters were also touching, including Russell and the adorable talking dog known as Doug. Overall, the film had many clever stunts even including Fredricksen's floating house. It also had good music, beautiful landscape views of a made-up location, and of course a great story.

Trouble is, a little kid named Russell (Jordan Nagai) is also along for the ride, which doesn’t quite play out the way Carl intends it to. This Disney/Pixar instaclassic is a lot of fun, especially in 3D, with charming, realistic characters, sweeping vistas, and a straight-arrow message that’s neither muddled nor heavyhanded.Now, you gotta know this upfront: I love 3D animated films. It’s not like the old days, where the makers would try so hard to make the 3D exciting and amazing that they forgot to make a movie behind the effects. What happens nowadays is that the creators write an awesome, fun movie and then toss dollops of 3D effects to accentuate the story, rather than distract from it. (Or, as sometimes would happen, detract from it.) So maybe I was an easy mark, but I thought Up was outstanding. Ed Asner, as the cranky old man who’s lost his zest for life, turns in a pitch-perfect performance that’s both endearing and curmudgeonly. Of course, the animation is so detailed that you can count the hairs on Carl’s chin as the days progress, but the Pixar gang did a great job in showing the various expressions on the faces of the human characters here, something I think they’ve been slow to develop well. (The toys in Toy Story, for example, looked great, but Sid the neighbor kid did not appear to be fully formed.) The story itself is an adventure on the order of Indiana Jones, if Indy were a septuagenarian with the physical prowess of an eggplant. The unlikely duo winds up in South America, all right, but they encounter more than just trees and rocks. Every animated film needs a villain, and here we get the luminous Christopher Plummer as a thought-dead old-time explorer who’s been holed up at the very spot Carl wishes to visit. Plummer does evil pretty well, I think, especially for a Canadian. (They’re kindly, peaceful folk, you see.) Compared with recent 3D movies, I’d put Up a little higher up than Monsters versus Aliens, but not much. The sweet ending, although expected, packs just as strong an emotional punch as it would if you couldn’t see it coming. And certainly the intended audience for this movie won’t care about nuances; the kids in the theater where I saw this raved about it, keeping in awed silence for much of the film - except when Big Fun Wonderful Things were happening, when they erupted with raucous jubilation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotional and exhilarating,"The opening sequence is the most powerfully emotional image in a long time; for any genre of movie, let alone an animated family film. It does bring a tear to the eye, and may be too sad and intense for children to take. Taken at its intent to show a once happy man's loneliness as a foundation for the story line that follows or taken as too strong a message will probably determine if you like this movie or not.I did. The central character, Carl, is a very likable guy, and can be sympathized with immediately. The boy scout kid represents what Carl feels he has lost, and the adventure is his effort to reclaim it. There's a great feeling of freedom and escape when the house zooms out to the sky, and an eagerness to see things along with this good man as he embarks on his journey.It's a great ride, both literally and figuratively. The visions of the animators of what the world looks like from this unlikely dirigible is authentic, beautiful, and inspiring. Colors are used vigorously and with astonishing precision. The overall look of the film is simply wonderful. The enormous Grand Canyon like precipices in Carl's South American Shangri La type destination almost appear as a dream scape. One example of the creative imagination in the movie is when the hero carries a giant object along, strapped to his chest--I hope I get to do that one day.As for characters, most are fun although not always essential. The dogs and their human-like gifting is the stuff of great humor. The mythical creature was a nice touch. My only criticism of the movie would be the choice of villain. Someone who should have been a fast friend for Carl since they think the same way is depicted as vengeful, bitter, and vicious. It was too pessimistic a choice; a longer look would have provided a more logical bad guy.In summary, some visions are very strong emotionally, but the final product is another fun and exhilarating triumph for Pixar.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's Up,Pixar's Up is a visual treat for both the kids and the adults. But other than that the movie fails to convince me that it is the best out there. there is a very common thread that is running through both Wall-E and Up...Loneliness. The main character in both the films are undergoing severe loneliness and it is heart-breaking to watch it. My heart went out for Ed at times. But after sometime I got depressed and that is when I thought about Wall-E. It was the same thing I felt in that movie. There is a limit to how much Isolation I can handle :). Other than that the movie was a visual breeze. The animation was far too good and I felt as if I was in heaven while watching some scenes. The bird in the movie was fantastic. I just hope for the next Pixar movie there will be no isolation themes.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Up takes you soaring. High.,"Unless you have been living under a rock the past decade, you probably know what Pixar is. You know. That animation company owned by Disney that makes an awe inspiring new animated flick every single year. Yeah. Them. Well its near summer 2009, so that means it it time for a new Pixar movie. And hear it is. Up. Up is a great new movie about a 78 year old man who's wife died not too long ago, but their lifelong journey to explore South America and move their home to Paradise Falls is still incomplete. Carl's wife is dead, but he raises his house up using thousands of balloons he has in his old days of selling them at the Zoo. He then goes Up! (Hence the title) and then the movie starts to get interesting. He meets his buddy Russell, a young Asian-American Stowaway. They meet a bird, lots of dogs. And of course, another old man, the bad guy, Charles Muntz. Thats pretty much it. It might not sound like much, this is a contender for the best Pixar film of all time, and it surely does mostly everything right, with a great script and very well executed story, and great environments and characters, Up is amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good Not Great,"Introduction:Up is considered by many to be in the top five of the best Pixar films. However, Up for me, doesn't make my top 10. Don't get me wrong, Up is a good movie. I just don't think it's a masterpiece.Thoughts:The first ten minutes of Up are simply amazing, absolutely perfect, and can work as it's own short film. However, it's not a short film. It's a 90 minute movie. And the other 80 minutes is really just okay to me.My biggest problem with the film is really the villain. For a company that has made such great villains, I can't even remember this guy's name. And the kid character is also a little dull. I think Carl is still a great character, and he's one of my favorite Pixar protagonists. The movie has a nice creativity to it, and it's very entertaining.I like the animation of the film. The CGI backgrounds are very nice. The character models are cartoonish, and fit in this world very well. With bright colors to go along with it, the animation is great Pixar CGI.I just think people blow out proportion, because of the first ten minutes. The first ten minutes is amazing, but the other 80 minutes is good, but not amazing.Conclusion:I like the movie. I don't think it's amazing, but I like it. I think the first ten minutes is a little too blown out of proportion.But the rest of the movie is still good. Up is in fact, a good movie, not one my favorites from Pixar, but still a great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A fantastic family film experience,"There is nothing not to love about this movie. It is just so good. There is a scene in this film that is so powerful, and didn't even have any dialogue. The jokes are very funny. You'll be smiling when the credits are rolling. The score is so good. It is one of the best scores I have heard in a while. It adds so much emotion to the moment and makes the film even better. The animation is very good. The voice actors are fantastic. Everyone in the film delivers a great performance. Up is just a beautifully made film that would warm the heart of a snowman. This is one of Pixar's finest films and I had a great time watching it. Up is great.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
