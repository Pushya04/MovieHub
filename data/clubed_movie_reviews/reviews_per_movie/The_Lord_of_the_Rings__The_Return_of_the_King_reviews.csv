A Timeless Classic,"This movie, and trilogy in general, is a cinematic (and literary) masterpiece, and simply refuses to get old.

15 years on... Still the greatest,"I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created.

All Good Things come to an End!,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Still the greatest movie ever made,"Nothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters
are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great,"Wonderful on every level. Love the characters and special effects. One of the biggest, most massive battle scenes ever put on the silver screen. A great end to a monumental epic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Pretty much outstanding,"I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
They saved the best for last,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best Picture of the Year? Give me a break..,"Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the ""Russell Crowe-syndrome"", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
They read a different book...,"There was so much love and hate from me and my friends for the first two movies: Nearly perfect visualization, but some really bad interpretation of the main characters. Watching The Return of the King was unbearable and I left the cinema when I saw Gandalf and Frodo giggling after the fall of the ring and making themselves ridiculous.I guess Return of the King totally missed the spirit of the book. All the highlights of the third book went wrong in the movie: The fight of Eowyn against the Lord of the Nazgul; Aragorns and his way of the death; the relationship between Gandalf and Denethor; when Gandalf saved Faramir of the Nazgul; the relationship between Pippin and Denethor; the meeting between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgul; Aragorn healing the people of Minas Tirith after the battle; ...But mostly I was disappointed about the behaviour and attitude of some of the main characters: I think that Gandalf, Legolas, Eowyn, Pippin, Merry and Denethor don't match with the characters in the book.

I lived to see them all!,"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Not only the best of the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, but sets a new standard of epic filmmaking.","Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I doubt there will ever be a film made of this quality again.,"Frodo and Sam continue their desperate journey to destroy the ring, Gollum has his eyes very much on the prize, knowing they cannot possibly get past Sauron's army, Aragorn creates a diversion.Surely this is a contender for the greatest film of all time, I can think of nothing negative to say, it's everything you want in a movie and more. Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.This film truly is one of the best ever made.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

But this one is the Achievement of being the closest to the perfect for me.This movie is the best movie of the all time for me, clearly. I just gained my Cinema love with this movie. And I watched more than a thousand movies. I watched so many directors from so many countries. My cinema taste changed too much since my first watch of this movie.

A Brilliant Conclusion,"As a movie watcher, I tend to become bored with the constant, overdone, overdrawn, underplayed, overdramatized performance and production quality of most Hollywood films. It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What can you say?,"I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Entertaining, but not as half as good as the book","First of all: I liked this movie, and i could watch it an awful lot of times. But that is mostly due to the great special effects .The point i rated this movie a 7 is because of the stupid story mistakes Peter putted in his movie. Especially the ghost army is a huge, huge mistake. Everybody who readed the book knows the ghost army does not take part in the huge fight, but only conquers the pirate's fleet, so Aragorn and his men can sail to the battle. The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield?These are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Part 3:  It's Not Really the Thought that Counts,"Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Brilliant.  Simply brilliant,"Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film.

A monumental film,"Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

My objective and unhyped view? Stunning. Simply stunning.,"Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum.  Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Five out of five decapitated orcs,"This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie.

This is why there are fast forward buttons,"So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off.Here again only half the movie is interesting.  The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day.It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Shocked by disappointment,"I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened. When the film was over, I was stunned by the depth of disappointment I was feeling. In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced. The fault must have been mine, I thought; I'd been too wound up to really take it in. With a cooler head, I'd be able to enjoy it and the magic would work again, as it had with the previous two movies. Alas, no. The movie was just as bad as I'd thought, and it somehow managed to posthumously poison my pleasure in the other two movies as well. I've never been able to enjoy any of them since.I came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the ""making of"" interviews on the dvds. I believe he is an undisciplined, self-indulgent egomaniac, and these characteristics progressively took over as the film series continued. Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble. Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success. LOTR was a notoriously difficult book to adapt, and many worried that it couldn't be done. In that atmosphere, Jackson and his co-writers were at their most deferential to the original Tolkien text, and almost humble in their approach to such a daunting task.After FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK. By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius. ROTK could not contain both Tolkien's story and Jackson's ego, and guess which won in the end? The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor. That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn. When Jackson finally had to tear himself away from this romantic Viking paradise and turn to Gondor, he revenged himself on the story by turning Gondor into a sterile, dead cement city, full of cowards and idiots.Worst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale. For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him. However, the brain can quite clearly calculate that the scale of the balcony in relation to the bodies of both characters is wrong - in FOTR, Jackson would have built a larger-scale model of the balcony for Pippin, to keep up the illusion that he was a smaller figure in a setting made for people of Gandalf's size. This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.That was amply demonstrated with the stupid green goblins, the endless battle scenes, the noise, the shaking camera, and the labored ""humour"" in every Gimli scene. What annoyed me the most, however, was that Jackson seemed to have no grasp of what Tolkien thought was important. In the movie, only the ""stars"" are able to act (and yes, that includes the Hobbits), whereas Tolkien showed that nobility, courage and heroism are EVERYONE's business. In the books, the individual soldiers of Gondor had personalities, felt connected to the greater cause, and debated how best they could do their duty. In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly. This is why his removal of the Scouring of the Shire was both execrable and inevitable. Jackson can't recognize any drama in ordinary people in ordinary settings facing crisis and either failing or rising to the occasion - to him, the Shire is just dumb peasants who were too stupid not to leave home for adventure, and there's nothing more to be expected of them. Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Quite Literally the Greatest Trilogy Ever Made,"I'm not sure what could be said about LOTR that hasn't already been said, other than that I personally think it's best trilogy ever put to screen, and I really can't think of anything close. Peter Jackson took on the most demanding project imaginable and created a series that will be remembered forever. He respected Tolkien's literature and stuck so incredibly close to the source material and translated it so effortlessly in such grand fashion. I highly recommend the extended editions, as they devote more time to building Middle Earth and developing their incredible characters ever further. 20 years later and the series still looks incredible, especially in 4K. What Jackson did here could never be replicated; he created the best trilogy ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely Awesome!,"It's difficult to process something like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King: Its very nature defies comparison.There has never been a cinematic endeavour based on a more daunting...or more beloved...literary work. There have never been motion pictures of the magnitude undertaken by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and his production team. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will endure forever as one of the most bold and audacious enterprises in the history of cinema. It is, quite simply, a seminal event. Other projects (for example, a movie filmed in space) are already being considered and may someday be attempted. They may challenge LOTR's logistical complexities (or, at the very least, present a comparable set of obstacles), but it is unlikely the numbers of people involved or the sheer duration of the creative process will ever equal this effort.Jackson & Company have made believers out of millions of readers who doubted the works would ever enjoy respectable translation into a more ""mainstream"" media. They have changed the way production models are approached for large-scale projects. They have forged what may well be the premiere visual effects house in the business (WETA Digital). They have raised the bar for all filmmakers to follow, and reminded millions of jaded moviegoers of one simple truth: Love, attention, and genuine dedication to (and appreciation of) one's material can overcome inconceivable obstacles, and always...always shows on-screen.And now it's over.With the longest running time of any film in the cycle (early indications suggest next year's extended DVD cut will clock in at over 4 hours long), RotK is an all-out assault on the senses. There are times when it is simply impossible to take it all in: Armies of hundreds of thousands clash beneath towering war beasts as deadly, dragon-like bird-things strafe hapless victims on the ground. Mountainsides erupt with pyroclastic fury as lava flows labour to engulf our heroes. This film is off the hook, gloriously so.In tone and ""feel"", RotK rests comfortably between Fellowship of the Ring's penchant for character-centric drama, and The Two Towers' colder, more mechanical ""war movie"" approach. What we end up with, is, in essence, an emotionally charged war movie sprawling in scale yet intimate in heart, its effects are frequently overpowering.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Good, but less enjoyable than its predecessors","First, let me say that I did like ""Return of the King."" It's a special effects masterpiece that is destined to become a classic, along with the first two installments in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga.But, to me, it was far less enjoyable than the first two films, the second of which was the best of the three.""King"" was far too long for what it had to say. And the ending (or should I say endings) really disappointed me. I kept waiting for the film to end, but it just kept going on and on. There were at least four times that I thought the film was over, but then the next scene would fade in. It would have been a much better ending if the film had finished with the resolution of the final battle, and then showed the denouement as a montage next to the closing credits. It would have removed about 20 minutes from the overly-lengthy film and would have made the ending less of a ""cut-and-paste"" style.So I'll give it a solid 7. But to me, it has been seriously over-rated by both fans and critics. I'm surprised that more of the critics, at least, haven't picked up on the weak ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The problem with imagination,"Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed ""genius."" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic ""niggling"" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
LOTR ROTK Review,"After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The journey and the destination are both well worth the investment of time,"I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The great film saga of our time.,"The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know, maybe he used one of Gandalf's enchantments! Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment, every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing, to the production crew, to the acting, to the scenery,to the music (oh god I love the music)and just everybody's determination to pull this near impossible feat off, even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune, (Viggo Mortensens' last minute replacement says it all), it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie, I won't be reviewing just 'The Return of the King'.I saw the first film 'The Fellowhip of the Ring' when I was 12, and I'm 21 now and I still haven't been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think 'Fellowship' is my favourite of the three, it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog, it is exhilarating, involving and most of all - emotional.'The Two Towers' has the hardest task of being the middle film, but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesn't hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film, culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary, through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real.'The Return of the King' delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing, not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars, it more than deserved it, I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well.Any gripes I have for the trilogy, would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron, and considering that Sauron is the centre of 'The Lord of the Rings' this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are, are so vague and surreal? Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form? This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film, where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material, and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy, especially during the climax of 'Return of the King' where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse! The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films, and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame.As you can tell from what I have said, I love 'The Lord of the Rings', and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear, to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else playing the characters, it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson (just watch the extras), and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors weren't working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo, I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing, but of course there are countless others to mention but I don't have time. Howard Shore's score is possibly the best movie score ever, and the films would be nothing without it.Ultimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films, you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens' greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films, first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially 'The Return of the King' which had many vital scenes cut aka. Saruman's last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you, and New Zealand!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Epic Conclusion,"Note: this is a review of the extended edition of the film.Peter Jackson's trilogy concludes with a terrific finale that makes the near 12 hour long journey we take as viewers one of the most worthwhile cinematic experiences in history. I like to think of the entire trilogy as one long movie-filmed simultaneously but obviously having had to be released over three parts to be profitable at the box office. Much like Tolkien's novel itself, having to be split in three volumes.The quality of production and post-production all maintains its standards across the trilogy. I would like to say that although ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" remains my personal favorite of the three, ""The Return of the King"" being the one that finally brought home the clean sweep at the Oscars is very fitting and deserved.The reincorporated scenes from the extended editions of all of these movies really helps a lot in fleshing out the world of Middle Earth. I can't imagine going back now to the theatrical cuts. A few scenes here and there do slow down the pacing just a bit, but in a movie as grand and epic as this, it's all for the better to extend our time in this unforgettable fantasy world that Tolkien so vividly described and that Jackson so faithfully brought to life on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I needed to say that.,"OK. First of all, this movie cannot be considered the best movie of all time because of many things. I've read almost every comments on this site about this movie (and i dont exaggerate at all) and all i saw was "" Best movie of all time"", "" The way movies should be done today"", etc, and i thought wait a minute, there's something wrong here. Before anyone becomes insulted by what im saying i have to say that i've read all the books and i loved them. The best trilogy in books history!! But here, what im arguing against is not the story nor the way Jackson adapted it( by the way, it couldn't be much perfect for a lotr movie). I'm just outraged by the ignorance of all the people that are stating that this is the best movie of all time!!! I certainly do not say these people are stupid or something like that, its just that this is not a work of art, a masterpiece. It is just another commercial movie that looks like the others and this movie happens to be based on the most popular books of all time ( i do not know anybody who havent red the books). All the battles have already been done th same way (See every movie categorized as peplum in the 50, 60s and 70s and you'll understand), the close shots of thes characters faces are nothing new and the narrative form is as simple as ""The Beauty and the Beast"" story. If you want to watch movies that are made by real artists and not by a lucky director of B-Series movies, check out Leos Karax, Jean-Luc Godard, Gus Van Sant, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Fritz Lang, Milos Forman, Francois Truffaut, Orson Welles, etc. Watch out, i do not say that everybody would like every one of these but i surely think that in the directors i've named, you'll find one that made a movie that'll make you cry, smile or feel fear better than a ordinary epic commercial movie as the Return of the King. In the end, i would also like to say that i liked the first two movies (as they amused me for three hours each) but i thought that the third one was a pale copy of the FOTR and TTT.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Can I just say 'ouch'?,"I have been an avid LOTR fan for almost ten years now. I love love love love the books, but I really hated this movie.What Jackson did (and I'm surprised Phillipa or Christopher didn't call him out on it) was cut all the really important ending bits for sake of having disgustingly overblown battle sequences that made me want to kill myself. An hour is too long to be in battle, in a movie, I'm sorry. The CGI was amazing, and the deaths were good and all, but it didn't really help the story along. All it did was sit there. And we aren't even going to get into how much I hate Orlando Bloom.The fact that the scenes in the houses of healing were cut just pisses me off. Faramire and Eowyn deserved more than a glance during Aragorn's OMG SPIFFY coronation. They were the the link between Gondor and Rohan. They were actually quite major characters, and they were totally glossed over for the sake of some Oliphants falling over. Butchery? Yes, yes it is.And the endings. The endings weren't long enough. I know what you're thinking, ""but... the ending dragged on and on with no sign of an end in sight until it actually ended"", but seriously folks, don't give me that BS unless you've read the books as many times as I have (if you have, then by all means, give me that BS many people have read them more times then I have, but those people would agree with me) when Peter Jackson decided to use his ""artistic"" license to completely forget about half of the stuff in the books, he cheated people out of some seriously amazing story telling. The scouring of the Shire is what the whole trilogy is supposed to be about. It's about how Frodo leaves hating how much the hobbits take for granted in life, and then coming back, and helping to save them from something they have never before had the displeasure of meeting, and that is slavery. And then when they won their freedom back, they loved their heroes, and they celebrated them, and they were happy again, and they (hopefully) wouldn't take so much for granted again in the future.Okay, I'm getting myself upset, and I'll shut up. But seriously, all this movie is for is watching people run around and stab things. Not interesting to me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
WHY IS THIS ONLY 9.0???,"I don't think I have to.repeat this sentence. This movie is perfect. And when I say perfect, I mean PERFECT! The word masterpiece is an understatement for this work of art. Although the Battle of Helm's Deep still is the best battle to ever exist in a movie in my opinion, this is BY FAR my favourite movie. This should be an 11/10 and should be at least at 9.2, so go help this piece of art to get what it deserves, a better rating!The End (and I mean every end) is wonderful, the fact alone that there are several endings inside the ending is mindblowing.

The conclusion of 'epic',"It's hard to imagine that anyone would join 'The Lord of the Rings' saga so late in its on-screen life, so if you've never heard of this tale (there must be at least one of you!) then I suggest you begin with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and take it from there. However, if, like the rest of us, you've been closely following the story of 'Middle Earth' where two innocent hobbits are carrying an evil ring of power to its destruction, then you'll be desperate to see how it ends. Although, based on what most people seem to think about the trilogy overall, 'The Return of the King' appears to be most people's favourite (worth noting that mine is 'The Two Towers!').Maybe it's because the source material (J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy of novels) has already been written that the concluding chapter is so good. Many stories start out with much promise and tend to die off (see the last series of 'Game of Thrones!'). Luckily, this doesn't happen here. Everything and everyone that made the saga great comes together and gives the audience the perfect ending that they deserve.Yes, purists of the book may argue about the odd creative liberty here and there which has been taken when transferring it to the big screen, but, more often than not, everything lands where it should. Re-watching the trilogy today (nearly twenty years after its release) I noticed that some of the special effects in the first film ('Fellowship') didn't look quite so good as they did at the time (i.e. more green screen-ish), yet this final chapter seems as perfect as it was in its day.There are so many fine performances in 'Return of the King' that it's hard to pick a favourite. In the first two movies I always preferred the human characters, such as Gandalf and Aragorn (and, of course, the computer-generated Gollum in 'The Two Towers'). Yet now, I really felt more of a connection to the two hobbits - Frodo and Sam. Following their journey I really did get a sense of how much they'd suffered here - a rare feat nowadays when so many on-screen heroes seem to be able to absorb inhuman amounts of punishment with barely a ruffled head of hair (and don't get me started on Disney's 'Star Wars' trilogy).As I said before, you really need to watch the first film to know if you'll truly enjoy its conclusion and, if you do, then 'Return of the King' will certainly not disappoint. It has everything from great character-acting, to excellent special effects and a perfect setting and direction. Not since the ORIGINAL 'Star Wars' trilogy has a set of films come together so spectacularly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An epic ending,"""The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes, sets, scenery, models, CGI effects and Howard Shore's epic score to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth.Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the character's best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together.This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkien's work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films, I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting, but they didn't add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
There are no words to describe...,"How superb 'The Return of the King' is. It is the ultimate fantasy film and a sure bet for all the film awards this year. Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible, to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good, the actors (Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly) are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed, representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson, on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now, although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that, I don't think others would have been! So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so we'll just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. It's, arguably and in my own opinion, the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. It's got action, romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. Go and see it now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
one movie to rule them all,"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Greatest Film Trilogy of All Time,"Every tale embarks us on a new journey, every journey eventually comes to its inevitable end. As for The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring turned out to be a genre-defining classic. The Two Towers somehow raised the bar to an even higher level. And although it did seem near- impossible for The Return of the King to triumph over such towering expectations but against all odds, this final journey of Middle-Earth delivers everything to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary saga to an epic & magnificent conclusion.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the culmination of the wonderful journey we embarked on with The Fellowship of the Ring & picks up the story right from where it was left off in The Two Towers. The story finds Frodo & Sam continuing their quest towards Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring while the rest of the fellowship prepares for their final battle as the dark lord Sauron turns his eye on Gondor. But in the end, it all comes down to Frodo & the One Ring to decide the final fate of Middle- Earth.Directed by Peter Jackson, this remains his finest directional achievement & The Lord of the Rings as a whole is certainly his magnum opus. Making all films in a trilogy succeed on every scale is no mere achievement but to make the next instalment work better than its predecessor two times in a row is even rarer. And yet, Jackson manages to accomplish exactly that with his sweeping cinematic vision, stunning eye for detail & in-depth knowledge of balancing emotional storytelling with large-scale action entertainment.The screenplay is cleverly adapted from the source material as many right choices were made in the decision of what to include & what to leave out from the final script. Fran Walsh also tries her hand at direction as the opening prologue is her creation. Being the final film in the trilogy, there's a sense of urgency in this chapter but it still ties up all the loose ends appropriately, gives proper farewells to its characters & delivers a high-quality entertainment of such epic proportions that fans couldn't have asked for a better finale.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design adds even more amazing & meticulously detailed sets to its story, the dazzling cinematography further magnifies the visual presentation to make the cinematic experience even more magical and Howard Shore's epic score is filled with tracks that are truly imposing, beautiful & further expand the domain of its predecessors as the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings remains the greatest work of his illustrious career.VFX is once again its most groundbreaking feat, however, this time it isn't a slight advancement but a pretty huge leap. Everything that made its brief appearance in the first two chapters is fully explored in this finale plus the length, scope & magnitude of battle sequences it offers is second to none. Also, with better rendering of its CGI characters & stunning level of craftsmanship in costumes, make-up & sound, The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for visuals in cinema that remains unequaled, as of today, in the scope of how much it contributed to the film's art while elevating the whole story.Despite running at 201 minutes, there were many things which got omitted from the theatrical cut & that's why the extended edition is more recommended. Also, many happen to criticize the last 45 minutes it takes to finally end but if you ever watch The Lord of the Rings in one sitting, then it'll make perfect sense to you because not only is it a reasonably enough time to recover the audience from what is an emotionally draining experience but also provides proper farewells that each one of its characters deserved.Coming to the performances, The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers introduced almost all characters we needed to be acquainted with & The Return of the King simply brings their arcs to completion. Unlike the previous two films in which Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) & Gollum (Andy Serkis) turned out to be the most impressive characters, respectively, there is no single dominating performance in this chapter as its entire cast puts up a more mature on-screen portrayal of their respective characters & never really leaves anything major to complain about.J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is unanimously hailed by critics & readers alike as the greatest fantasy novel ever written & a milestone in the works of literature. And it's amazing that its film adaptation follows the same route in the world of cinema. It did catapult Peter Jackson into the big leagues of Hollywood while also setting up Weta Digital as one of the foremost VFX studios on the planet but where it made its biggest impact is on cinema itself for it changed everything there ever was about epic & fantasy filmmaking, is one of the most important films of the modern era & a landmark moment in the annals of cinema.On an overall scale, The Return of the King is more than just a fitting conclusion to The Lord of the Rings. It triumphs as one of the greatest sequels ever made but along with The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers, it also makes up for cinema's greatest motion picture trilogy that will not soon, if ever, find its equal. An unprecedented achievement in the world of filmmaking that's epic in every sense of the word, The Lord of the Rings, in some ways, is to cinema what its source material was to literature & it is destined to remain a standard by which all future film trilogies will be measured for decades to come.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Sometimes more is LESS!,"One has to admire this film (and the others in the trilogy) for its technical achievement and the scale of the undertaking, but that doesn't mean it is due any special respect beyond that. Of course opinions will vary wildly (and probably mostly contrary to mine), but for me this was just not sufficiently entertaining to justify its length. Well, the story is familiar, and that probably undermines the film for me (and I am not in awe of Tolkein's work anyhow), but just because Tolkein went over the top there was no need for Peter Jackson to follow. I would have probably liked the film better if it were not so long and repetitive (how many battle scenes can one watch before tiring of them).

"Sweet dreams, everyone.","Well, it's finally over:  Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with  *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance.  How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears?  how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles?  how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf?  how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield?  how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors  (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)?  how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense??  (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win?  that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the  ""Extended Edition"", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone.  (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.)  Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for  ""special editions""  of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater:  what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see.  ""Extended-edition DVD's""  don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb.  I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, ""But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!""  But that's precisely my point.  *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book:  it's too long; it's too unwieldy.  As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*:  the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues.  Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix*  or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the  ""action-adventure""  genre.  But to say so is not to say much.  The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly.  It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake.  In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by:  but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire.  It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels.  Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin:  what, was  *Ulysses* chopped liver?  What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's  *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it.  I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor.  Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line.  While others may say, ""Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,""  I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into:  in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower.  Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp,  but it's still a pretty lame villain.  Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material.  In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity.  Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain.  But don't fret:  Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition.  In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Perhaps the greatest film ever made.,"It is difficult to argue that many films should sit on top of the mountain of the greatest movies ever made, but one of those is The Return of the King. Technical, writing, and production aspects are all the best you can have in a film.The most impressive thing about ROTK is that it is the series ' third entry and that it is so good. Most trilogies that exist have the problem of the third being the weakest in the bunch. Not with this trilogy, though, this film is incredible on all levels.This film's drama and overall epicness is something I have simply not seen since its release. Not many films can so effortlessly blend fantasy and serious dramatic plot elements that sell the film's overall message.Not to forget the amazing display of acting that the whole cast put together. This is one aspect of the movie that does not appear to be getting enough credit. EVERYONE sells every scene and contributes to the film's immersion.The Return of the King holds the record, in a tie, for the most academy awards ever won and I cannot think of another film more deserving of this honor.

"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) - My Precious, This is a Masterful Final Chapter!","Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, ""The Lord of the Rings"" series finally comes to a close, with ""The Return of the King"". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where ""The Two Towers"" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003.

I would visit her every Saturday, and I brought the first two movies over on DVD and we watched them. She was hooked. Peter Jackson did such a good job bringing the books to life. Surely there was a lot left out, he would have needed six movies to fit in everything from these novels. I am happy to say that I brought my grandmother to the theater to see this when it came out, and for the entire run, she did not move an inch. To me that says all there can be said about this movie. To see a woman well in her 80, so transfixed was such a treat. This movie is sad and happy all at the same time and is wonderfully done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Return of the King is an epic finish to the LOTR.,"The Return of the King is the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings saga. Peter Jackson's portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. ROTK is an epic tale of sacrifice, courage, and friendship. Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. Elijah Woods once again portrays Frodo wonderfully as well as Sean Astin. The rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes, especially Viggo Mortenson and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. This has been a long journey of film starting with the Fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
More of the same,"I loved it! No doubt about it, spectaculair effects, battles etc. But, and there's a big but, the movie doesn't add anything new to the trilogy. In the first part we could marvel at the wonderfull world of Tolkien that Peter Jackson so brilliantly captured on the big screen. In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects.But what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book.....",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The end of an era,A Blu-ray extended version for almost four and a half hours. The scene of the war is still magnificent. It is Frodo's luck to have a good friend like Sam.

"A film ahead of its time, Lord of The Rings The Return Of the King is the best thing I have ever seen...","Even after the second installment's grand success, I was still afraid that it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved wrong!This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it.You really get that feeling of ""The Return"". Unlike the first two, this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold, the score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important.For me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it (Only if you have seen the first two movies)10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I cry buckets every time,"I'm writing this review as I watch Fellowship again right now. I was 12 when Fellowship first released in the cinema, and LOTR defined my life ever since for many years, and the trilogy has remained my favourite movies, with no others that come close. They made me cry in the cinema, and in every viewing since. I can put on even a brief portion of the films, and the feelings come rushing back. Everything about these three movies is perfect, in my opinion, especially the amazing music that is so perfectly crafted that I can't think of a better movie soundtrack. The only OST that matches it is the Halo game soundtrack. Both the Halo and LOTR franchise began in the same year (2001), and were the two major pillars of my life since childhood.It's crazy to think that this trilogy began almost 20 years ago. I wonder if anything will ever touch LOTR. I suspect it will remain the all-time pinnacle of cinema, at least for the sheer love of them it has inspired in its vast fanbase.I think that the extended editions are indispensable and feel much more complete than the original cinematic releases. They are definitely worth watching in one sitting, back-to-back, which will take from wake til sleep, with breaks in between for second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, supper.Although I think Return of the King is the greatest possible ending to the greatest trilogy ever made, I still feel Fellowship of the Ring, where it all began, is the most rewatchable and comfy of the three. It has an air of enticing, dark and foreboding mystery that always captivates me. And that ending... what a cliff-hanger. I still remember the excitement it first created in me for the story's continuation, and the year-long wait for The Two Towers to release in the cinema. I would pay good money to see them all in a large and full theatre again.And the video games... I played most of them I think. I still play Battle for Middle Earth, i.e. the Edain mod.I can't imagine what my life would have been like if the LOTR films had never been created as they were, as they have been that important to me for well over half of my time alive at this point. They played a part in inspiring me to travel, to pursue filmmaking, and most importantly to get me interested in Tolkien's works.I am so thankful to everyone who were a part of creating them, as they are easily the greatest treasure of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

best film of the decade,"as you see in the title, you can see it was a great film. i have only had the DVD for 2 weeks and i got a 2 disc DVD for £2.99. wow you might think.well back to the film, and this is a film whose without its amazing and stunning fights/wars, would be a OK film but wouldn't be a classic. when the battles begin, you can't stop watching- even if your mum asks you to tidy up. the scenes with the horses and their warriors galloping is breath taking and makes you want to re enact it as i'm a 13 year old boy, this was a film which you want to re enact and talk about.it fills you with thrill which is a very special thing to do. when people saw this, people were like, ""wow what an amazing film!"" and ""it's so good, i want to see it again and again!""i think this film was done by the right people and acted by the right people you couldn't image anyone for the roles. Such as aragon's character, Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film, i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role, i regard him as a brilliant actor.another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him, this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken (sorry for the spelling mistake), his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras, his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well, that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten, i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A legitimately great movie,"An adventure movie to match the great ones of the past, and the one to beat for the future. The culmination of this ambitious trilogy is more than fitting; it surpasses the first two films by quite a distance. Almost nothing disappointed or bothered me. All parts of the story were equally interesting. It was sweeping, it was involving, it was beautiful. One of the few thing I would complain about is the villain. Sauron is boring and more or less unseen. He does not feel very threatening. And his army of orcs has been dull since the first film. They're just not very interesting creatures. Fortunately, The Return of the King really makes up for these monsters with a gallery of better ones. Some of them have been present in the other two films, trolls and those flying dragons that the ring wraiths ride on. They're more present here, however. Even better, though, those gigantic elephants, ten times the size of a normal one. Oh, man, those are cool. Star Wars fans might grumble that they were too much like the AT-AT walkers from Empire, and they are. One scene where Legolas, the elf, triumphs over one of them feels like a sped up version of Luke Skywalker's attack. But the very best thing is a giant spider. Everyone knows that there was originally a giant spider on skull island in King Kong, cut from the film because it really disturbed a test audience. Seeing the spider in Return of the King is like having that famous piece of lost footage restored. When all three films are finally out on their special edition DVDs, I'm going to spend a month combing through them to see whether or not the entire series of films isn't just as good as this one, or perhaps as good as many of my younger friends have sworn they were.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Return of the King,"I will keep it short, because what needs to be said has already been.

It has the msot fight scenes out of any Lord of the Rings tale, and they are all very well written. The first big war that takes place is one of the best scenes in the saga and the ending of the movie is great. I could not fault the previous two, and it's the same for this one.Of course it is a 10/10.

Somewhat Lacking,"The third installment of the Lord of the Rings was a good movie, however, I had many problems with the character development and acting in the movie. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, (the only two exceptions,) played the roles of Frodo and Samwise admirably.  Even with some of the adaptations from Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, the story is still intriguing. However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased.  And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed.  All in all, it was a good movie.  Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Can you say ""Overkill?""","There's nothing deep or important going on here, so  a critique of this film is almost unnecessary. What passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced, loud, stunning ""Imax"" experiment in eye-candy that masks, once again, a slowly moving, thin story line. Obviously, the members of SAG have dispensed with background checks on film editors. There's enough slow-motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice. Many people will be amazed by the neverending, in-your-face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also, you'd better search elsewhere. It's like trying to read the Latin version of ""War And Peace"" while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender. And if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasn't enough, just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine-glazed, overlit endings. And there are at least 5 of them. For a while, I was expectin Obi Wan Kenobi's ghost to show up and smile goodbye. And Cate Blanchett never looked so vapid. It's brass, tacky, loud, long, obvious schlock and thus hugely popular. Beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example.

The Greatest Fantasy Trilogy of All Time,"I've lost count of how many times I've watched this gorgeous trilogy, every time I rewatch it I find something new.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""Songs for great halls""","Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time – such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin – are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says ""So passes Denethor"" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A true masterpiece,"To justify the title, I can count many merits of the movie. The background score is grand and powerful, the story is handled very well, and the CGI is balanced and beautiful. But, in the third act of the movie, there are 3 major scenes, each of which brought me to complete tears. One of them is the greatest single moment I've ever seen in movies, period. Throughout the movie, it's very evident that it was made by people who clearly adored the source and a great attention to detail can be found throughout.I've seen complaints that at some points the movie diverges from the source material too much or that it's longer and doesn't pack as much substance. I feel the first point can be validated by artistic liberties, while the second ultimately boils down to personal preferences. Speaking personally, the movie did not feel long. The screenplay justifies the runtime, and makes the movie cohesive. It's the grand finale to the greatest trilogy of all time, and completely cements its legacy for years to come.NOTE: This review is based off of the special extended editions, and not the theatrical cut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A perfect end to my personal favorite trilogy,"What isn't great about this. This characters are developed wonderfully, the acting is brilliant, the epic effects blow me away, the score is perfect. This is my personal favorite of the three but mind you, it is an extremely hard choice",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An epic masterpiece made even better in its extended form,"In 2003, Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony, and set a new record for box-office receipts, one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale, surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version, it's even better than before.The reason why Return of the King, is so great is threefold. First, it's based on one of the twentieth century's greatest works of literature. Secondly, director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material, leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly, this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director, to the extremely large cast, to the effects wizards at WETA, everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back, no expense spared, and no detail overlooked, and the result is pure awesomeness.One of Tolkien's greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct, interesting characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all, and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn (Vigo Mortenson) we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. He's also the embodiment of true courage, being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron, ""Here I am, come and get me.""In Frodo (Elijah Wood) the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things, but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee, who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty, sharing every hardship, remaining ever vigilant against Gollum's treachery and the ring's corruption, and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend, even after he had turned on him.Even the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. They're just a couple of goof-offs, the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done, both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to one's people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli, though largely relegated to sidekick duty, still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges.But the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally, and with a severe case of split personality, he hates his very existence, and he hates the Ring for what it's done to him, but he desires to possess it even more. He's like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. It's amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. He's murderous, he's repulsive, he's pitiful, and he's one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature.Of course this isn't all internal struggles and character development; it's an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind, but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is! The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare, of pounding clubs and maces, bodies impaled with spears and arrows, or crushed beneath catapult stones (Within the bounds of PG-13). Yet there's also is the precision, even beauty, of Aragorn's swordsmanship, and Legelos's skill with the bow, their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow.And then there's the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed, with dozens of siege engines, more than two-hundred thousand orcs, and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge, but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole, or even heretical, but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson.I'm also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest I've seen, and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons, orc masks, and suits of armor, all beautifully – or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealand's Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic.Now obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see, especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. There's more humor, exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest, and more character development, especially with Faramir and Denathor. And there's lots more action, including Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King, a longer fight scene with Gollum, and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee's death scene near the beginning.Bottom line, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is one of the grandest, most exciting, and most inspiring movies you'll ever witness. Try as I might, I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially in its new and improved state.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Why did THIS one win the Oscar?,"Fellowship of the Ring was far and away the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies, and the Academy snubbed it.  The Two Towers was far less impressive, but that was understandable since the book of the Two Towers is the weakest of the original trilogy, and Jackson saved one of its best episodes, the confrontation between the hobbits and Shelob, for the third film.  The third film rebounds, as it ought to have given that the third book is the best, but it does not reach the level reached by the first movie, much less by the book.  Overall, Jackson did a good job, none of the movies is bad, and he deserves recognition for his work and the risks he took.  It's just hard not to feel disappointed, given the huge promise of the first movie, to find that the trilogy as a whole is quite good but nowhere near great.Certainly Jackson achieved a very impressive feat in constructing battle scenes that are even more exciting and terrifying than the excellent ones in the previous two movies.  The assault of Grond on the gate of Minas Tirith, the wild charge of the Rohirrim, the confrontation between Eowyn and the Lord of the Nazgul, and the desperate clash with the Oliphaunts are probably the finest fantasy warfare sequences ever filmed, managing to be intimate and detailed while also giving a sense of the overall strategic picture of the battle.  Kurosawa would have been hard put to do better.Too, Jackson pulled a major coup by constructing a version of the climactic scene at Mount Doom that will surprise the readers of the original book without disappointing them  and it would have been very easy to go wrong at this point.  And, Jackson manages a few times to do what he did with astonishing regularity in The Fellowship of the Ring: spot the dramatic moments and give them even more impact on film than they have on the printed page.  His version of the scenes in the Paths of the Dead and the lighting of the beacons of Gondor are masterful.But, Jackson has lost his eye for character; indeed, he has lost it so disastrously that I have to wonder whether his master portraits of Boromir and Gandalf in the first film were anything more than luck.  This is clearest in his revolting representation of Denethor.  Jackson's Denethor is a cretin: weak, craven, stupid, self-pitying, insensitive, spiteful, utterly devoid of redeeming features.  No man cut from this cloth could have lasted a month as Steward of Gondor, much less raised two of the boldest warriors of Minas Tirith or pitted his will against the Dark Lord Sauron for control of a Palantir.  The true story of Denethor, which Jackson misunderstood completely, is not of the crumbling of a coward, but what is infinitely more tragic, the crumbling of a brave man.Meanwhile, Gandalf has receded into Old Testament prophet mode, and seems to have no emotions of his own whatsoever.  Granted, even in the books Gandalf seems more distant and unapproachable after his reappearance, but he still had the old irritability and humor underneath.  Arwen, after being used so well in the first movie, again becomes an annoying hindrance to the plot. Gimli, at least, has improved somewhat since The Two Towers; he is still being used as comic relief, but the humor is now more of a deliberately self-deprecating kind than the humiliating pratfall jokes he had to suffer through last time.Also, I have to complain about some of the things that Jackson left out.  I will concede that he was right to omit two of my favorite parts: the meeting with Ghan-buri-Ghan and the Scouring of the Shire; time was limited, and something had to be cut.  (he could have omitted the Paths of the Dead too, if he'd had to, although that would have been a shame considering how well he did that sequence).  But the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar at the ruins of the Gate could have been done in thirty seconds, and the parley with the Mouth of Sauron would have required less than one minute to deliver one of the dramatic high points of the whole book.That Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and the Grey Havens are magnificently done almost goes without saying.  Art direction has been the one consistent strong point throughout this whole trilogy.In all, The Return of the King is a good movie.  Certainly far worse ones have won Oscars.  I just hope that the award doesn't lead to people imagining that this is the best movie of the trilogy.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation:  Go see it on a big screen.

"""We Cannot Linger!"" (-Legolas/Peter Jackson when wrighting the script)","The expectations that were built up by the first film, and the second (allthough slowed down), really plunged down into the lava of Mnt Doom with this one. It really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film (I'm not talking about the extended version, that one is a lot better - but still far from perfect) and how everything could have been.Where should I start?...... It's overly sentimental. I mean really. And I like that s*** usually - I'm a sentimental guy. But here it's really out of proportion, and out of timing. Oh, it's really sad when Faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning, while Pippin is singing som silly song like he's castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that. Bu-hu, this is a mythological-style heroic fantasy-tale, not... Titanic! Everybody are so overly emotional. And I don't even wanna talk about Sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in, with the hand on the chest, looking out over the horizon, with the orchestra at full volume (the only thing missing is the American flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him), and Frodo and his constant twisting-your-head-like-a-puppy-and-looking-with-big-eyes-and-a-""OH-I-love-you-so-much""-smile at Sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going... OK I'm getting carried away....I liked Braveheart for example, even though it has some major flaws. And people think THAT one is overly sentimental.

RotK is up in the sky, almost gone out to space, like (I thought I'd never say this, but), it seems they (producers, crew and actors) really take the film TOO serious. Really. It's a Saga! Not true. It's a 20th-century, made up mythology-history about an IMAGINARY land. It's NOT a record of the Holocaust for Christ's sake!...I understand how they needed to cut some scenes, to save up time. but, well... First of all, they didn't succeed enough with that, the films are 2-3h long and still it feels you're rushing from one place to the next, like you're on a Middleearth-8hour-safari or... cinematic tourbus. Maybe they should've cut it even more, so we could at least get the feel of BEING someplace and not just passing by? But what's really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that don't even belong in the story! Completely made up-scenes, for no logical reason!*The ugly made-up bull/rhinoceros-beasts pulling orc-wagons (whatta F--- is up with that? I don't even know if George Lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the Star Wars universe!)... *The really AWFUL orc liutenant/chief-guy, who's by the way made up out of thin air, who doesn't even look like an orc but more like the aliens from Peter Jackson's early lowbudget cult-films (Mr. Jackson, this is NOT the time and place to have cameos, or draw funny parallells to your Bad Taste-films, that's really... bad taste... disrespectful to the Tolkien-fans)... *The Mûmaks are really cool, but really too big, I mean, they're not dinosaurs-beasts - hey're just big elephants! *All the small details, costumes and armour etc. are really beautiful, really more than you could ever ask for. But the White Dwarf-miniature-esthetics of Minas Tirith is really bad, cause it gives a whole synthetic-comic-book/computer-game-look to Middleearth. Where are the beautiful, classical and authentic designs of Edoras and Rivendell? And no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses! That too is just corny and childish like in computergames. All this, and the excessive use and naive belief in CGI-technology, turns the Battle of Pelenoor Fields, which should be the total culmination and action-peak of the film into a foney uninteresting StarWars/Warhammer40000-mess, it's nothing compared to the battle of helm's deep - and that's not right.And this CGI-trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film-business. It's really sad, these films will be outdated in 10 years. But maybe that's a good thing?RotK isn't the worst of the three, technically. But with the expectations you have from the first two, the books (if you know what's gonna happen), the demands should be pretty high; and, in my opinion too, especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill (just like the matrix), this is the film that disappoints the most. RotK is the greatest and heaviest of the films, the first two would completely crumble under it's weight if it didn't hold, but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it could've, and that is what it should have. Anything else is unacceptable to me, and this is also why I hate it. Cause it really doesn't live up to it's potential, it doesn't even outdo the 2towers and it doesn't live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film.I can't understand how a New Zeelander, who used to make underground films could turn this old British tale into shimmering Hollywood-cheese. It's too pretty, too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust.It's like food, add too many ingredients and spices and they'll take out each other and the dish'll just taste bland... It's just too much of everything, and the whole film falls flat. It's still stunning, but rather tasteless, and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing.I still wanna congratulate P.Jackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home. Thank him, even if he's made me more irritated than delighted, cuz I'm still glad that I'm able to watch these films. He didn't deserve all those Oscars, but he definitely deserved a few, maybe not for directing, but for Best Film - for the production. But this film should NOT be ranked as the best fantasy-film of all time! /Sebastian",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best Trilogy Ever,"Best movie series in the form of trilogy ever personally for me.I watch this movie very frequently.Loved the way this story was told. Loved every single character in this movie, especially Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen and Arwen played by Liv Tyler.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very good end to a very good set of movies.,"This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me.  This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.  All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch.  I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic is an understatement,These films are glorious and they finished off this marvellous trilogy with a bang. Unlimited action and emotional plot twist and character arcs.

The End Of The Epic Journey,"In terms of the individual installments of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings epic trilogy, Return of the King may actually be my least favorite (if only by a hair). The character-building isn't needed, like in Fellowship, and the battles are no better than those in Two Towers. The film's length (even the 3.5 hour theatrical cut) borders on prohibitive. Yet, it remains a slam-dunk 10/10 effort. The reason? The emotional payoffs to all the threads set up in those previous two installments.For a very basic overview, Return of the King sees the two primary plots of the trilogy reach their apex:-Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), & Gollum/Smeagle (Andy Serkis) finally reach Mordor--but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at the journey's end.-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again are feisty dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) the marksman Elf, and hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.The overall hallmark of this concluding chapter is the way in which it pays off all the threads set up in the previous two. This one doesn't have to break new ground, and largely doesn't. It just needs to put an amen to perhaps the most incredible book-to-film adaptation of all-time, which it accomplishes with aplomb. What Jackson really understands is how much of a journey the audience has taken alongside the famous fantasy characters (especially true if experienced during the three-year theatrical run). The end of their journey is also the end of ""ours"", in other words.Specifically notable here is the last half hour or so of runtime, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some of the most emotionally rousing scenes of the whole trilogy. I have yet to behold these moments without a tear being shed.Overall, then, Return of the King is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful vision. It may not break much cinematic new ground, but it doesn't have too. It simply does its job: pay off all the previously-established action, adventure, drama, humor, and (most of all) heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Conclusion of an Adventure in the Same Level of the Other Two Parts of a Splendid Story,"The conclusion of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made is in the same level of the other two parts of this splendid story.

The eleven Oscars, the IMDB User rating of 9,0 with 62,820 votes and the 2,219 reviews are sufficient. I just want to record my enthusiasm with such a film. Unfortunately the same did not happen with the sequence of Matrix, where the first film was excellent, but the sequences were very disappointing.

"A newbie's perspective on ""The Return of the King""","I haven't read the J.R.R. Tolkien books or seen the first two movies in this series, so I won't waste your time with a formal review. Here are some miscellaneous thoughts from the perspective of a Middle Earth neophyte:If you're wondering if you can understand this movie without having seen the first two, you can. I didn't realize I was watching the third installment until the end when I saw there couldn't possibly be any more story. I had a little trouble here and there, but the movie never really lost me.Roger Ebert complained that characterization in these movies is given short shrift. Maybe so, but I thought Mr. Frodo and Sam – and the love they had for each other – were very moving. For me, they were the heart of this movie. I was roused into anger when Gollum framed Sam and temporarily split the two men – are Hobbits men? – apart.Everyone says it, and everyone's right. Gollum is a great villain; it's a great performance by Andy Serkis and the CGI craftsmen who jointly created him. I loved to hate Gollum.Is that woman who chafes at not being able to fight alongside the men a character from Tolkien's books? She's such a tedious action movie cliché – or would be if the actress playing her weren't so convincing and charming. She even ends up a genuine threat to a character who cannot die by any man, because of a technicality: she's not a man. That reminded me of the dreary moment in ""Jurassic Park"" when Helen Hunt cracks on Jeff Goldblum for talking about Man as if the term somehow excluded women. (Genesis: ""And God created Man, male and female."")I was very impressed with the special effects. Yes, they were awesome in themselves. But it's also impressive that they existed to tell the story – a rare feat these days when the story usually exists to service the effects. Still, the effects – while never overwhelming the story – sometimes overwhelmed themselves. Ebert gave special praise to the giant spider, but by the time it arrived I was already so sated with CGI monsters that this one didn't seem inordinately frightening. (Incidentally, Ebert says the spider scenes marked the best movie battle between giant insect and man, but these scenes – good as they are – don't replace the much lower-tech ""Them!"")I'm not in love with Peter Jackson's directing style. His camera is always sweeping around the scenery, which is almost invariably SFX-laden, as if to say, ""Nothing up my sleeve!""Viggo Mortensen is supposed to be a major star of this series, but he makes little impression on someone watching just this entry. Elijah Wood – with his enormous eyes and beguiling presence – feels like the protagonist. Orlando Bloom also has little to do, but unlike Mortensen he makes a bad impression. When we see him in closeup the only thought that seems to be roaming his mind is: ""Aren't I pretty?""What is it about some of these great old men of the theater – men like Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris – and here, Ian McKellan? One of them can just stand on screen for five seconds and even if you've never seen him before, you think, ""Wow, what a great actor.""Someone made a terrific comment on the message board for this movie, and it deserves to be read:""When anything becomes a 'craze' it tends to annoy those of us who enjoyed the material quietly and non-fanatically before it was a fad. When I was a young teen I actually had kind of a love-hate thing with George Lucas because when 'Star Wars' became popular it was suddenly 'cool' to like science fiction, and those of us who had liked it all along were assumed to be part of that herd.""I first read 'The Lord of the Rings' in my freshman year of high school (25 years ago now) and I have liked it ever since. I was glad to see the movies done, enjoyed them well, and plan to watch them again throughout the years. And though I suppose the advertising hype was necessary so the producers' gamble could pay off, I am glad it's over. Now the fad-of-the-month club people can move on to something else, and let me enjoy something I like in peace.""She was deriding both the people who obsessively love and abuse the movie. If the craze really is over, this might be a good time for a newbie to visit these movies. I saw this one, and despite my minor complaints, I loved it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
IMDb's Number FIVE?,"Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The conclusion to the wonderful epic The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.,"This wonderful conclusion to Peter Jackson's adaptation of .J.R.R. Tolkien's most popular written work should definetly win a few awards to say the least. The first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, inspired me to read the trilogy.  As I was only twelve at the time, these were the first books I actually finished reading. I decided first off that no matter how much the film makers changed the story, as long as the general plot line and points that Tokien was trying to make were made in a fashion that Tolkien would have liked, I would accept these movies. These are three spectacular films, or rather, one large movie version, created by crazy Tolkien fans, of the tale of how evil came into being and how it was destroyed.For those of you who have not seen this movie, and are wondering whether or not to go and see it, by now you know clearly what I think.  This movie is the conclusion to the first two movies, or rather the conclusion to one long continuing story. If you haven't seen the first two, go and see them before you come and see this one: There's nothing worse then hearing the end of a great tale before you even get a chance to begin it. Once you start this trilogy, you will not want to be left behind. It is about how the Hobbits, Frodo(an aristocrat) and Sam (his loyal gardener and best companion), struggle on to a land called Mordor to destroy a ring that corrupts the minds of even the strongest warriors, and about how their friends try to guide and help them in their quest to save all life, even if it takes their own lives to destroy the ring. The movie is full of tales of how Middle Earth and its people are making their last and final attempts to fight the evil, and save not only their homes, wives and children, but their own humanity and souls as well. It is a tale of how life almost disappeared but when darkness almost completely covered all earth, some courageos people, whether from the sanity of their minds or rightness of their hearts gave their last shot to save life because they valued it.  They gave their last hope, said their last prayers, and were able to destroy this evil. Nothing that I can say would be good enough to put these people and their world into the right words so that you could imagine it: Just watch the movie so you can start experiencing it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us.

The end of the Journey,"The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life.I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The ""That still only counts as one"" line to Legolas was very funny though.Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The perfect example why should a trilogy filmed all together,I can't stop thinking how Lotr:TTT and Lotr:Rotk would be if were not filmed together with the first film.Maybe Peter Jackson would thought that he should change some elements of the two last films in order to improve them resulting in many complains by the audience because The Two Towers and The Return Of The King lack the atmosphere of the first one.On the other hand maybe he could actually make them even better(History made me doubt this perspective).No one really knows .what we already know is that Jackson had some excellent material into his hands and made some wise decisions about how he would use them.Way to go Mr Jackson!Now give us Silmarilion on screen too...,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Take this chance while you can.,"The Lord of the Rings novel is one of the best English novels of all time, certainly in the top five.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy by New Line Cinema will long have similar standings in the realm of movies.When I was younger, every once in awhile I would sit down on the couch and watch the Star Wars trilogy.  Six-and-one-half hours later I would be done and think, `Wow!' Now, after having attended the marathon showing of all three movies of LOTR, I didn't finish the night by thinking, `Wow!'  I finished it so overwhelmed I didn't know what to think.  It wasn't until the next morning that I could comprehend what I had just experienced the day before. history being made.Each of these movies is acclaimed for nearly every element of their being. People who were never fantasy fans found themselves in a new world.  Those of us who have long been fans still found ourselves in a new world.  I have read many of the comments others have made, and I would like to address one issue in particular.No movie will ever be exactly like the book it is based on (nor should it). That's why movies often begin with `Based on the novel.' or `Inspired by.' Screenwriters must take certain liberties in adapting a novel for the screen.  Very often parts must be rewritten or entirely left out.  Peter Jackson's LOTR is his vision of the novels.  And it is a glorious vision.I am a fan of the books and of the movies.  They are two different entities. The Return of the King is my second favorite.  I love the Fellowship most and the Two Towers least.  If I gave these movies grades they would be 98 for Fellowship, 97 for Return of the King, and 95 for Two Towers.  They aren't perfect, but my idea of perfection is not Peter Jackson's or anyone else's.There is something in this movie for almost everyone; love, friendship, huge conflicts, anger, despair, fear, and hope.  If you never see this movie while it is the theatre you are missing out on an experience of a lifetime. I have pledged to myself to see it at least once a week while it is in the theatres here.  If the first two movies were still out I would see them as well.  In all likelihood we will never have this chance again. take it while you can.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The least satisfying of the series, but still good","I am less enamored with this one then I was with the previous two films (particularly Two Towers, which is my favorite), though I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that had I seen this film on it's own without the previous prequels, I may have given it a higher rating.No doubt about it, these films are revolutionary and the pinnacle of fantasy film making, but I just found this one a little tiring. You more or less generally know how it's going to turn out anyway (good guys will get their butts kicked a few times, but will prevail after many long, tedious battles later), so I guess I can't blame the film for delivering exactly what I expected in a final chapter, but I guess I found the journey to get there (first two movies) far more interesting than the end result. After a while, all the eye candy of CGI-created battles gets a bit tiring to look at.So I'll give it a 10 for craftsmanship and artistry, but a 7 for holding my interest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

In the end it just gets tiring.I really will not be watching the extended version, which may well stretch to five hours. Why couldn't they just do a Kill Bill on it?Oh well, I don't want to try to put you off, at 7/10 it is still well worth a watch, just don't try to watch the whole trilogy at once.

"Minor flaws aside, LOTR proves itself one of the most successful trilogies in modern film","In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end.  The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole.  Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up.  In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it.  It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place.

FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King',"The Return of the King is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one is the best.Aragorn takes the lead role this time, as he faces his destiny to become the king of Gondor. Gollum (motion-captured Andy Serkis) is becoming a big problem for Sam (Sean Astin), as Frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than Sam himself.And Pippin (Billy Boyd) pledges his allegiance to Denethor (John Noble), the crabby and evil stand-in leader of Gondor. Denethor doesn't have the best attitude in the world, such as when he tries to burn his own son alive.The ending is very long, but it isn't bad. The entire movie is riveting, magical cinema, and I ate up every minute of it.

A Brilliant and Magnificent Masterpiece,"As a movie virtuoso, I have seen nearly over hundreds of movies dating back as far as the mid 70's. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a movie out there that is worthy of anyone's 95 minutes of their day. With all the nonsense, exaggerated, repetitive, and culturally degrading pieces of work out in the movies today, I can come to agree with that. However, as many titles that may leave your eyes bleeding, there are some that leave not only your eyes, but your ears begging for more.In Summer 2003, I was already impressed by the opening trailers to the icing of the ingenuity cake. I had no idea how much better the presentation really was until I walked into the theaters that Winter, only to be overwhelmed by the beautiful opening music as the title was being presented. 'The Return Of The King', focuses on many life ordeals at the same time keeping it's creative fantasy structure into perspective. Troubles such as betrayal, deception, disloyalty, greed, and malice are all shown in this work, showing how our lives can relate to a world so very different than reality.Not only did the flowing dialogue allow viewers to validate the setting similar to the medieval ages, but that the soundtrack used in this masterpiece was not only original, but absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The instrumentals along with the vocals throughout numerous scenes in the film, made it so much worth watching. It had almost been as if someone had made a visualization of an epic poem and combined it with an exciting and interest-grabbing plot.My recommendation to this film is pretty strong. This film has definitely earned it's 11 academy awards as well as it's box office high. I can clearly say this film, inspired by Tolkien's brilliant novels, is one of the most exquisite and most beautiful pieces of literature turned into a pure illustrated masterpiece.Bravo, Peter Jackson, bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Phenomenal...,"The 2003 conclusion to the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a tour de force. This is by all accounts the best movie in the entire trilogy.Why? Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".There is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.Needless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.The performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.For me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.My rating for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a solid eight out of ten stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An Epic long end to one of the greatest trilogies ever,"So I have now made my way through The Lord Of The Rings trilogy and that culminates with The Return Of The King, one of the biggest films ever made and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the forces of Gondor & Rohan fight to protect Middle Earth from the forces of Mordor while Frodo, Sam & Gollum get closer to Mount Doom and their endgame.Main Character
Elijah Wood is back as Frodo and I think he does a great job in selling just how tough the journey has been on Frodo compared to the other characters. The ring is just weighing him down and this film in particular he is really struggling with it and finding his mind on the brink. I mean Frodo isn't the most likeable character for parts of this film but I thought Wood did a great job in portraying the anxiety and torment that Frodo has gone through in this trilogy. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and talking about his character is pretty funny, I mean the title of the film spoils his whole character arc but he is still great here and does well in his role and just does a great job as a protagonist.Supporting Characters
Sean Astin does a really good job in the first two films but this is the film where he really stands out and for me gives the best performance in the film. There is a line in The Two Towers where Frodo says he wouldn't get far without Sam and you really see it in this film, as Frodo struggles Sam gets stronger and Astin does a fantastic job in this film as the moral centre. Sir Ian McKellen is given more to do here as Gandalf The White and he is great, he gets to see more of the action and nails every moment he is on screen and just adds so much to the film. Andy Serkis is also back as Gollum and the effects are even better here, Gollum looks fantastic and the character is fleshed out here and it even better, Serkis truly deserves credit for his role here and Gollum is also a real highlight of the film. The rest of the cast also do great jobs, Miranda Otto as Eowyn gets more to do here, Bernard Hill as Theoden gets more to do, Merry and Pippin have more to do and they are all fantastic and have really good character arcs, the whole cast really do a great job in the film.Story
The story is epic on all levels, more of the characters have interesting character arcs and more time to shine. The story is in three plots really, Frodo, Sam & Gollum, Gandalf & Pippin and the rest of the characters at Rohan, and all of it is really interesting. The film uses its extra runtime to flesh out more characters and makes the story be more epic and have more depth to it then the previous films. It ends the trilogy pretty much perfectly and does it really well with these characters that you will have grown to love over the 9 hours that you have watched.Script
The script is great, the dialogue and ways the characters are written takes these larger then life personalities and makes you care about them which is no mean feat. This film knows when to focus on the drama and it knows when to have a laugh, it balances the plot arcs very well and makes the film interesting from start to end.Style
This film is epic on scale, I mean it could be argued that in terms of scale this is the largest film ever, the battle scenes are huge in scale and raises the scale which was necessary for a final instalment of this epic franchise. The film has over 3 hours to tell its story and I think it does a good job of it and keeps the pacing high for pretty much the entire film which is a difficult thing to do.Overall
Overall, I mean this is The Return Of The King so of course it is amazing, this whole trilogy is one of the greatest of all time and if people haven't watched it then they just need to get on it, especially while we are in lockdown.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The hype kills it. The best of the series, but not a great movie, and not in the league with the likes of ""The Godfather"" -- how cliched a statement is that? It's true.","Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" All eight of them found it ""good"" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (""I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!"" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the ""best film of all time,"" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than ""The Godfather"" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from ""Rings"" fans claiming that ""The Godfather"" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" those who claim they are superior to ""The Godfather,"" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? ""Citizen Kane""? ""Casablanca""? ""Taxi Driver""? ""Sweet Smell of Success""? ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? ""Chinatown""? ""Apocalypse Now""? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of ""Star Wars"" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought ""The Two Towers"" was dark, but ""The Return of the King"" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, ""The Ring is mine,"" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. ""Wasn't that good?"" I heard someone say. ""No,"" was the reply. ""The Return of the King"" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, ""Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway."" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype.I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My brief review of the film,"The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Greatest Story ever Written,"This review is about the entire trilogyI have long thought whether, and if so, how to begin a review about ""The Lord of the Rings"". Because there is probably no story that means more to me and where it is so difficult for me to be objective.
I actually came across the story quite late, in 2012. I saw ""The Hobbit"" and even though, in retrospect, ""An Unexpected Journey"" doesn't come close to ""The Lord of the Rings"" in any way, the world still captivated me so much that I really wanted to see more. That very same day I bought the Trilogy-Bluray-Box and, what can I say, watched it in one go. Those almost twelve hours were a revelation. One day later I got the book and read it within a day.
Today, eight years later, I like to boast that I have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of middle earth. Above my couch hangs Anduril- Flame of the West, my forearm is adorned with a Tolkien tattoo, every now and then I say a few sentences in Elvish and all my savings go into my next visit to New Zealand.
I find it hard to describe what fascinates me about this story. Among other things, for me it is the pure embodiment of the magic of cinema. It is a sensitive commodity and the more the global event cinema takes hold, the more it seems to disappear. But the magic in this case is by no means based solely on the infamous budget of 300 million dollar. Among other things, it is the realistic and consistent depiction on Tolkiens world, almost like an alternative historiography. Peter Jacksons belief in a higher task and his awareness that he must not disappoint millions of Tolkien fans made this mammoth project possible in the first place. And the result is known: the fans would have rather missed Christmas than the new ""Lord of the Rings"" movie.
With each film the panoramas became more splendid, the details more loving, the battles more impressive, the moments more intense; Peter Jackson brought Tolkiens unique world truly to life. The New York Times summed it up perfectly:
""Never before has anyone seen a film whose director pays such a high level of respect to the literary source. Jackson puts all his skills at the service of this reference- and he succeeds in creating the extremely rare, one might say, perfect connection between filmmaker and source material.""
Although the effects alone are not the only reason for the magic of the films, ""The Lord of the Rings"" would be unthinkable without them. Only the solely digital Gollum, which steals the show in the second part, and the fighting armies in epic battles ensure the impressive physique. But it is the mixture of the special effects and the impressive props and sets that gives the series its unique aesthetic. This multifaceted world is held together by a skilful editing and excellent camera work. The clever cliffhanger structure ensures that the viewer follows the scattered companions spellbound, repeatedly interrupted by picturesque landscapes. In the end, it seems as if one has absorbed all the splendor of Middle Earth. And here is a significant difference to other sagas like Star Wars, Harry Potter or Marvel's Infinity Saga: Tolkiens World cannot be expanded at will.
The great cast should of course not go unmentioned. How many actors became icons of pop culture through their roles in the trilogy, still today. And of course, Howard Shore made a decisive contribution with his unsurpassed score. Whenever I listen to ""Concerning Hobbits"", it feels like home.
However, for all the points mentioned, the heart of this film series is the story. The peaceful world of the hobbits is in many ways like my own home. And the threat posed by the all-powerful Sauron is always tangible. ""The Lord of the Rings"" tells the essential story of the fight of good against evil, the smallest must defeat the biggest. It is a story of probation. Ever new experiences and losses make the heroes wiser, and also sadder. At first glance, ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems to be an extremely dark story, but it is also full of hope. Aragorn and Arwen have shown me the essence of love; Frodo and Sam, what true friendship means; Gandalf, that there is no need to fear death. With all the seemingly overpowering evil, belief in good is always preserved; the faith that ultimately helps the heroes to victory. The fateful importance of the individual becomes a topic, as does the importance of social cohesion in difficult times.
The mythical structure, with its alternation between epic and intimate moments, seems like a modern ""Iliad"", for some even like a modern Bible- like for me. Under Peter Jacksons direction, three of the best films of all time were made, and for that he and the entire team will forever have my gratitude and the gratitude of many other fans.""Sam: I know, by rights we shouldn't even be here. Just hold on. It's like in the great stories Mr Frodo, the ones that really matter. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes, you don't even want to know the ending, because how can the end be happy? How can the world go back to the way it was when so much BAD had happened? But in the end, it's just a passing thing, this darkness, and even darkness must pass. And a new day will come, and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those are the stroies that really matter, that mean something, even if you were to small to understand why. But I think Mr Frodo, I know now. Folk in those stories, they had lots of chances to turn back, only they didn't. They kept going, because they were holding on to something.
Frodo: What are we holding on to Sam?
Sam: There's some good in this world, Mr Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
As good as it gets!,"Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. It is almost perfect, if not perfect. Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen, but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time, the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasn't a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time.Im not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it.

"Better than Two Towers, not as good as Fellowship","Well, the trilogy has ended, and it's time for some conclusions. First of all, Return of the King is, IMO, not as good as Fellowship of the Ring. On the other hand, it's definitely better than The Two Towers, which I think is by far the weakest of the three films.All in all Return of the King is certainly a good film, but it's too long, the battle scenes somewhat lack intensity and when it's all over you're left with this lingering ""was that it?"". Don't get me wrong, I like the film, but it does feel as something of an anti-climax. Perhaps it's simply not possible to transfer the enormity and intensity of what's meant to take place to film. The battle scenes are a bit dull, they lack intensity and realism, which is too bad because the battle scenes are in many ways the most important part of the film. To make it all worse (at least as I see it), they try to make up for it with slapstick, kill count and silly comments from Gimli, who is again reduced to comic relief, as well as a tendency to focus on the ""really big stuff"" (TM); oliphants, various trolls and the big siege weapons, instead of really following the battle. Also, I find the constant switching between Frodo and Sam and the battles annoying because it breaks up the battle scenes, jerking you out of the action just as it's starting to pull you in. RotK simply doesn't do a good enough job of making you ""feel"" the intensity of battle. Some movies can almost make you smell the blood, RotK doesn't achieve that, in fact there's hardly any blood at all and often just a lot of CGI (I guess the PG13 rating didn't help in that department). CGI has come far, but battle scenes are still vastly better with real people.Anyway, most of the movie is pretty good, but it never quite achieves ""lift off"" before it touches down on the ground again. As with the Matrix trilogy, the sequels just don't quite live up to the first, although I will say again that I think RotK is a good, although not brilliant, movie, and definitely better than Two Towers. There's no reason not to watch this film and I'm almost certain it won't be as good on DVD as it is on the big screen (mostly because the CGI and FX are so important), so go see it in a cinema while you have the chance.

"This ""greatest movie/trilogy"" will fade into oblivion in time..","I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games.  In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion.I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making.  There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning.  Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to.  But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better.  Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised.  This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture.  These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Breath-taking... Awesome... ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!!,"WHAT A MOVIE!!! THE SETS!!! THE MUSIC!!! THE VISUALS!!! THE ACTION!!!An amazing achievement in every sense of the word. The lack of action and slow pace of the The Two Towers is made up for here. The fight with Shelob, the rescue from Cirith Ungol, the Siege of Minas Tirith, the crossing of the plains of Mordor, and the destruction of the RING. ALL HERE!!! All amazing!There can be said nothing negative of this film. I was absolutely blown away in the theater. The Siege was done so well and is one of the best action scenes ever. Also, the end was amazing. The book dragged on a bit with the Shire and Saruman, but none of that is here. The destruction of the Ring destroys all evil, like it should! And the sequence when the Army of Gondor is at the Black Gate and Frodo, with Sam and Smeagol, are in Mount Doom is absolutely jaw dropping. The music, Aragorn's speech (almost like Henry V), and the action are a terrific culmination and serve as a truly breath-taking climax.However the film amazingly well done overall and easily the best out of the trilogy. The crew behind this film worked their butts of as there is no sign of sloppiness. It is all very well done, from beginning to end and it provides an awesome end to a great trilogy. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Watched the series for the first time on its 20th anniversary!,"The other night I had watched the first movie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and then woke up to find out it was exactly the 20th anniversary of its release!The best thing was that, unlike most other movie franchises, it got better with every sequel. Though it might get a bit hokey at times, the hearty friendship between Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee was superb and heartwarming. You just don't see grown friends crying in each other's arms anymore! The sharp distinction of good and evil, which doesn't exist in today's movies anymore, was writ large. I also liked the portrayal of the evil Lord Sauron and his hideous Orcs cutting down forests and making weapons in their macabre caverns as a metaphor for the industrial destruction of our modern world.But good wins!

"Third-Hobbit, Third-Wizard, Third-Cinematic-Genius... makes one of the Greatest Cinematic ""Thirds""...","I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.""Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!""This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature.And through this ""Return of the King"", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed ""to have a story before the story"", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity.Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of ""The Return of the King"" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake.And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a ""The End"" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections.Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Titanic"" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Astounding,"The movie was spectacular. The trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. It was unbelievably impressive. Starting with the movie, once again, the acting was phenomenal. The emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. It's amazing at how a movie can be four hours long, yet not feel as if it was more than three, or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievable; marvelous; stupendous; phenomenal; you understand what I'm getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. It's an adventure all throughout; not only for the protagonists, but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. Each movie was released one year apart of the other, and they're all over 3 hours long. The script is great and so is the directing, and everything else. There is no way this trilogy can disappoint.

One Movie to Rule Them All,"On december 12, just like the previous 2 years, I was invited to attend the dutch premiere of Lord of the Rings. What an event it was...From the stunning opening scene (simple yet effective) Peter Jackson plays out all his cards in this final chapter. The epic wars are bigger, meaner, and longer (Helms Deep will now look like a fun afternoon in at playground), and then there's ""that"" climax. Jackson always said that the 3rd part was his favorite and everyone will agree. He puts the most difficult scenes together with nothing but flair & skill, sometimes he goes a bit ""over the top"" which adds some humour and a modern touch. At the actor front, one is in top-form: Bernard Hill. This great actor plays the part of his life. A supporting actor Oscar should be his reward. As said before in other reviews, the music is first rate, as are all the other things: cinematography, art-direction, costumes, editing, CGI-FX.....etcetera.My verdict is clear: for 20 years, since I saw Return of the Jedi aged 7, movies are my life. I've been known to be very critic, so when I say that this movie is the best I've ever seen; I'm not exaggerating. The other 2 parts have been at the top of my all time favorites (along with the StarWars saga), but this one tops them all.I'm glad that as a fan of the book since 1991, I've been able to experience this.

The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here?

"An Orgy of Ugliness, Death, and Destruction","As you can no doubt surmise, I was not very taken with the (hopefully) last of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy.  Although I was extremely impressed with the special effects, the story itself was as tedious as reading the book.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the idea of the diminutive Hobbit heroes, Frodo (Elijah Wood), a sweet, gentle dwarf and his flabby sidekick Sam (Sean Astin), from some yah-yah land called Hobbiton, traipsing across the geography while risking life and limb so that he could ultimately drop an evil ring into an erupting volcano while wholesale death and destruction rage on nearby.  It seems that the film was primarily interested in exposing the violence-hungry audiences of the world with as much death, suffering, ugliness, and gore as they could cram into their painfully long (3 ½ hours) cinematic colossus.It is easy to cheer the slaughter of the adversaries since most of them were masterpieces of ugliness, decay, and disease.  Some of the evil crowd depicted an orthodontist's fantasy come true with teeming examples of really bad dental decay and deformity exploited at every opportunity.  To compound the repulsiveness, director Peter Jackson must have scoured the dermatology handbook for examples to create puffed out, discolored, and distorted skin tissue; lesions, cancerous oozings, and other disgusting aberrations.  Of course, there were also the obligatory humpbacks or other physical anomalies to add to your visual distress so that when the heroic saviors sliced and diced them by hundreds you would not feel so bad.One cannot help but admire Gandolf (Ian McKellen), the wise wizard with his flowing white beard.  He is not only all knowing, omnipotent, and full of convenient magic when it suits him, but for a guy in his sixties he rides like a cowboy stuntman and brandishes his sword in battle like a twenty-something.  Since this is all a fantasy, why not do something far-fetched now and then?The good guys in this piece of prolonged carnage are extra nice and the female love objects like Arwen (Liv Taylor), are truly heavenly to look at. Frodo and Sam look like they would be terrified to walk around in downtown Carmel, let alone to take on the hideous lineup that seem to lurk behind every bush.  Why they put up with the whims of the numskulls who insist on slaughtering the entire leper colony entourage is beyond my comprehension.If you see this movie just to enjoy the special effects, it is well worth the price of admission.  However, if you want to see a good film, well that is another matter entirely.  If you enjoy lots of blood and destruction, this piece is for you.  There is enough carnage in this flick to make war films like `Saving Private Ryan' or `War and Piece' seem like a walk in the park.  It is one helluva commentary on the American public who seem to enjoy a lot more violence than they are willing to admit.  It is hardly a wonder that Americans so easily rallied to Bush's deceptive war cries when the Nation ostensibly professes to be such a peace-loving people.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The adrenaline-rushing conclusion of the Epic,"Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler.In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo and Sam (who are led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that was set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry and Pippin at the now-destroyed Isengard, thanks to Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory, but Aragorn was worried about Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, which had been found and confiscated. But then something happened: the palantir revealed The Eye of Sauron and his plans to attack Minas Tirith, so Gandalf took Pippin and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to return home. So she rode home and begged her father to resurrect Narsil's ancient blade and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he could become the king he was born to be.So overall, all three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son; I mean, it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the friendship that is developing between Merry and Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"A 6/10, missing alot even as a film","This movie could really use an EE -- BADLY.  Characters are just picked up and discarded (Eomer, in particular), Eowyn's battle with the Witch King will, with luck, be expanded.  It was over before I knew it and the editing was shabby.  Too many oliphaunts and CGI, atrocious battle tactics on the part of the Rohirrim (sure, charge into a head of 10 story beasts even though we have bows and arrows and can shoot from a distance - sounds good!), meaningless inventions (Arwen's life tied to Ring, the Arwen ""to leave or not to leave"" flip flop, the Lembas Conspiracy, and that stupid Legolas-Oliphaunt trick), a limp confrontation scene with the king of the dead, no resolution to Saruman (the main bad guy of the first two films, if you've forgotten), and the worst hatchet job on an established fictional character (Denethor, Denethor, Denethor).  Horrible, horrible.  Plus a cheesy bed-jumping scene and coronation where the cheddar flowed in abundance.  It was a mess that I hope the EE will mend somewhat, but there's a lot to fix. A LOT.  A disappointing end to a trilogy that began with a masterpiece in FOTR.On the plus side, David Wenham, Billy Boyd and Sean Astin.  They were brilliant and made it worth spending the money to see it once.

The definition of epic fantasy,"The end of Middle-Earth draws near as the armies of orcs march against Minas Tirith, the great city of Gondor and the last bastion of Men, while at the same time Frodo and Sam have reached the borders of Mordor with their guide Gollum. Darkness spreads and all hope seems to wane, for even if the diminishing strength of Men were to prevail against crushing odds, their fate rests on the shoulders of a hobbit, the smallest of beings.The Return of the King is an epic conclusion to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the individual plot lines come crashing together as we witness the last great battle between the forces of good and evil. This is grand fantasy at its finest. Every time you're allowed to draw breath and every time you hold your breath in fear and terror, there's something new and even more majestic waiting to reveal itself. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith is probably the finest individual battle scene I've ever seen put on film. An opinion shared by many. And the thing is, it has aged remarkably well. Here and there you can spot the use of CGI, but not often. I've seen big budget movies this year, full twelve years later, which look noticeably worse than this film in that regard.I also really like how the scale shows not just in battle scenes but in every other aspect as well. The dialogues are full of emotions, great speeches, deep feelings, talks about fate, the elusiveness of hope, the strength of belief. Sure, it's escapism, but at its finest. This movie is the prime example of why we still tell stories to ourselves.And yeah, I'm the first to admit that this is the most flawed film in the trilogy. They have turned Gimli into a complete joke character at this point. There are perhaps one or two endings too many. The ghost army subplot comes a bit out of nowhere. The emotions do boil over a touch too much. But in the end, I still love this film and this world. It is an archetype, an ideal against which all alike stories are measured.The Return of the King is my least favourite film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Perfection On A Screen,"This film caps off the greatest trilogy ever made and nothing has even come close to it since. It is incredible the amount of effort put into the entire trilogy. Having to watch Rings of Power now is simply a reminder of just how incredible and fortunate we were to be delivered these movies by Jackson and this cast. This final film is no exception. The only problem it has is that you are so engaged for its entire length that you are worn out and exhausted by the end. In fact it is likely that you had just recently completed the first two films adding onto that exhaustion and to make matters worse it's probably your 50th time doing the marathon. All of this is of course a compliment and not a complaint.These films are the ultimate battle of good versus evil. They make no effort to try to explain away why evil is the way it is and instead hammers home the message that sometimes compromise can't and shouldn't be pursued and that it takes strong, brave, and courageous characters working together to put a stop to the spread of evil.There is absolutely nothing about this movie I would change.

A perfect end to this epic trilogy,"It's very rare for the third film in a series to be good but The Return of the King has surpassed that and managed to become the best film in the LOTR trilogy.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King shows Aragorn, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship getting ready to fight Sauron's army whilst Frodo and Sam approach Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring once and for all.It has all led to this. A 3 hour and 20 minute finale to end the Lord of the Rings story and it couldn't be better. This is my favourite out of all three films as I believe Peter Jackson has crafted one of the best finales to a film ever. It's amazing how much effort and work has gone into this trilogy as this film wouldn't have the same impact if the previous two weren't planned so well. All three films have such a fantastic connection with one another. A huge amount of credit goes to the entire team working on all three films.The Return of the King is the best one as this one ups the ante. If you thought the battle at the end of The Two Towers was impressive, the battle in this film is breathtaking. The fabulous camerawork, special effects and magnitude of the fight makes this a cinematic achievement. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and Howard Shore's epic score increases the intensity of the fight. I was in complete awe as nothing of this scale has been done before. I'm so happy the Academy recognised the work put into it.It's not just the fights that make this film perfect but the characters are fully developed here and given great closure. This film brings the most development to the Hobbits especially Pippin, Frodo and Sam. Pippin really grows in this film after realising what's going on and Billy Boyd did an excellent job. The friendship between Frodo and Sam developed so much here. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were so good.

Masterpiece and best movie that won Oscar after the Godfather. I can't believe that the Academy recognized this masterpiece and gave it an Oscar.

Jackson's crowning achievement,"Just like the book it was based on, the third Lord of the Rings movie towers above its siblings and brings the series to a cataclysmic conclusion, in every sense of the word. From its gigantic battle sequences, to its heartbreaking personal moments, Return of the King redefines what is possible in cinema and sets the impossible bar every other masterpiece must be measured against from now on. Clocking in at almost 3 and a half hours in its theatrical cut, it covers most of the material in the book and wins every point for its immensely satisfying coda. Howard Shore gets another two Oscars and Jackson and co are finally paid their dues. I have never been happier on an Oscar night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Perfect viewing (maybe at 11.00 at night!!!),"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn the concluding adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy,Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) head with Gollum to Mount Doom to dispose of the troublesome ring,whilst the rest of the gang brace themselves for the final battle for Middle Earth.Having put my achy,fidgety,restless bum through the ordeal of the first two movies,I found it only fitting to watch the concluding part (which would be the longest part at a whopping 201 minutes!!!)Luckily,I happened to be watching this one on DVD as opposed to at the cinema and was therefore free to press the pause button at any moment I deemed appropriate in order to take a break and watch it entirely at my own pace.I would certainly only deem it advisable to watch this at a cinema that has a break for refreshments halfway through.I think my school of thought all along really has been that of a fair few others.If you were a fan of the books,then these movies will probably be the equivalent of a wet dream come to life.If you have never read any of the books,however,it's all likely to emerge as a big overblown,self indulgent affair,as I think sadly has been the case with me.The ending especially here is a real nerve grater,as it appears to come again and again after over three hours of patient sitting and observing,only to keep droning on that bit longer.Given the heavy handedness of it all anyway,it just makes for even more of a labourious experience.In the movie's favour,it is a bit more emotionally involving than the last two and manages to draw you in to the plot a bit more,although that may just be because you know a bit more what to expect and so you've resigned yourself to it that bit more.The battle scenes and cinematography in general are certainly nothing to sniff at either.This is,giving away from some laughable and not entirely convincing acting indeed.But,given how little the story had already engrossed me to this point,it's all a bit too little too late.It may have reached #4 on the IMDB top 100,but given I don't know a 'hobbit from a racehorse',it's best use in my favour would seem to be as the ultimate late-night cure for insomnia.**",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A little too much,"I think the Lord of the Ring books are really great, and with a story such as that, and the environments and characters of an awesome tale, you've got that part settled. The actual filming is also impressive, many scenes work really well, but in at the end of the movie Peter Jackson kind of over extends himself a bit. There is crying scene after crying scene, which to me is too much. The ending is very important for a film, and so in my opinion it cannot be given more than a 7.Another thing that bothers me a bit is the academy awards. They mean nothing no more. Even though he might not have deserved them all this year he had to get his 11 awards just to prove that the jury has taste, and to equal it to Ben Hur and... Titanic...(You see what I mean). The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions didn't even get NOMINATED for best special effects. This is probably because they would have had to win...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Disappointing conclusion,"I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

THE BEST TRILOGY IN HISTORY,"As I'm writing this I can't quite believe that this was 20 years ago. I've seen these three films a gazillion times and regularity watch them at least once a year. The Two Towers is my favourite and when Retun came out I didn't like the ending... mostly because I think I was just sad to realise it was all over but also because the last half hour feels like it has about three endings and keels going. But now regard it as pure perfection. I don't think a film series can be beaten for music, script or acting. It's masterful in all three. I think we can forgive Jackson for the few directing failings along the way, the. Man had a lot on his plate lol. But seriously I'll be watching these films forever. Simply The GOAT. If you don't love these movies then you seriously have no soul. And if you've read the books you'll know that it was a near impossibly task to make them at all.

"Technically outstanding, dramaturgically weak","I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is ""heavy"" and full of ""meaning"", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen ""oversize"" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Shorter version of my review...,"I can't talk about the (thousands or more) positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to it's sometimes unacceptable flaws.When I saw it I wanted to spit at the moviescreen. It's a truly great movie, but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it!Doesn't people see the excessive use of cgi-graphics making this film look like... Final Fantasy? Don't YOU SEE THAT?! What - you just think it looks cool??!!""Wow, look what they can do those special-effects-guys!""Don't you realize? No one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years!Those of you who haven't read the books, how can you like this at all as just a movie? cuz it isn't even a movie, it's a really detailed animated synopsis of the books (the three of them, that is) - and not really accurate at that! Ever wondered where the drama went, the depths of any scene or character, the direction and exhibition (if I can use that word) of the parallel story lines? or are you just revelling in the roller-coaster-ride-feel to the film: the cool effects, weaponry and armour, digital creatures, the battle-scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon (I actually usually enjoy the latter things, but it's just too much here, and not good enough).This really is true porn for the mid-teenage RPG-junkie and immature and nerdy men. Are you really that superficial? Can't you smell the melted plastic? Sure, this truly is a gourmé-dish - all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it!!!!!This review wont be helpful to most of you, of course. Cuz y'all are probably like everybody else. I just needed to spread my word. Get it off my chest.Peter Jackson deserves all the respect he can get (and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles) - but don't over-do it! This trilogy-film IS NOT the best movie ever made! Not a chance!!!!! Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away each carry more depth than all three parts of LotR together!It's MAGNIFICENT... and Overwhelming... but NOT BRILLIANT!!!A film of this magnitude shouln't leave anyone unsatisfied, but it did, at least with me, cuz it didn't live up to it's potential and it wasn't even better the the prior part! So of course I was mad at it, how couldn't I be?! How couldn't you be?

"I gotta tell ya. It was perfect, perfect, everything down to the last minute details","Lord of the rings return of the king, is breathtaking. It brought the book to life, and made it better. It was super lengthy, but I honestly liked it that way. It means it had time for a lot of epic events, and the battles could be longer. It also made it more emotional, dragging out the ending, it wrapped up well. It is the best movie I have seen in a few months. I had already seen it before 5 years ago, and I don't remember loving it. So my expectations weren't that high, but it was amazing. I guess the movie is just a bit sophisticated for an 8 year old, but brilliant for a 13 year old. At times the C. G. I was pretty bad, but the action, the cast, the story, the emotion, the scenery, the acting, and the charisma of Pippin, and Gollum were perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
this is the best movie out of all three,"Let me explain the action sequences in the first two Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there wasn't much action, just mostly running. In The Two Towers, it was fighting without much gore included. The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie. But this had excellent special effects and fight scenes. This is a movie that will thoroughly spend 200 minutes of your time, and it's usually hard to find a movie like that. This movie is rare, adventurous, and enjoyable.

"Two decades later, this is still incredible","It's just incredible how well Return of the King wraps up the overall Lord of the Rings trilogy. Things expand and branch off in wild directions in The Two Towers, likely making first-time viewers pessimistic it could all come together. But come together it most certainly does, with The Return of the King delivering spectacle, emotion, and large-scale action that few other blockbusters have come close to equaling in the 20 years since its release.Instead of gushing endlessly about things other people have already gushed about (I agree with all the positive things anyone has said), all I can really add is that the extended editions made me love The Return of the King even more. Even though the theatrical version is still about 200 minutes long, numerous great scenes didn't make the cut. Seeing them back in for a final installment that now spans 4+ hours really makes everything gel better. It made a great film into a fantastic one.I used to feel like the various endings of The Return of the King took too long. After watching all three movies as effectively one movie - and doing all the extended versions in one go to boot - the ending feels just as well-paced as the rest of the movie. All the scenes in the epilogue feel earned and truly emotional. The longer journey spent with these characters seems to make all the difference, and I feel like generally speaking, the extended versions are probably superior overall (though there's a scene or two here and there that feels superfluous for sure).Anyway, The Return of the King is fantastic. The whole trilogy is fantastic. I don't know how Peter Jackson and everyone else made such a big trilogy that all works so well. It holds up after 20+ years, and I'm starting to wonder whether it will ever even age at this point.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best movie of all time!!,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a masterpiece in visual storytelling and for me they are the greatest movies ever made.

"The phrase ""Save the best for last"" has never been so evident.","My Take: The best of the best. An unforgettable grand-scale epic.""This is it"", director Peter Jackson might have said. ""This is the film where the name Peter Jackson will be remembered for."" Indeed, it is. The phrase ""Save the best for last"" has never been so evident. And not since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK have we had a sequel that outdoes an original that is too powerful to defeat. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING is a sequel the third movie in the series of adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's bestselling novels including THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, two very strong box-office hits that aren't easily topped from the highest spot. But, surprisingly, it was (by this film, no less). But still, all three films act like one big epic of a movie that's just plain beautiful, exciting and enjoyable to watch.The film continues the events where THE TWO TOWERS left off, having not much separate characters to focus on. This time, it only have the escapades of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood, companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum/Smeagol (voiced by Andy Serkis) on their quest for the gates of Mordor and continue their mission to destroy the One Ring. On the other end, we have Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and the people of Rohan fighting for glory against the forces of Mordor who has besieged the capital city of Gondor, ruled by a treacherous ruler (John Noble), a typical stereotype of a cowardly ruler.Director (Jackson) doesn't disappoint the fans he has earned with the series he created. Of course he shows new special-effects advancements in the brilliant battle sequences, lots of creative creatures and outlandish settings, but he also keeps a strong direction, brilliant performances from the cast and other stylish works behind the camera. Films like this come ones in a full moon, but Jackson does such a great job, he succeeds to make such a rare and min-blowing achievement.Here I am, brainstorming one of the best films of the last few years and I'll make sure that the LOTR series is there, with THE RETURN OF THE KING on the top spot of the entire series.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A technical master piece that falls short in other areas.,"It is hard to make a fair review based on the shortened version of the movie but I will give it a try.First of all I want to praise the team behind the CGI and especially that of Gollum which is nothing short of perfect. The sound FX crew, costume designers, smiths, makeup artists, sculptors etc are all worthy of praise as well.Unfortunately, all is not well in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth. Many important characters are ill adapted, ill casted and perverted.Take Aragorn for instance, who in the book is a tall, proud and weather bitten man with many hard years of life carved into his body and features; a descendant of kings with great claims to make. In the movies he is of average height, narrow of shoulders and weak of limb, judging from how he moves. His face does not carry the slightest trait of a hard life and his manners are soft and his voice is weak.Take Gimli who in the book is a great dwarven warrior with a passion for hollow halls of stone. In the movies he is perverted into a comic relief character who moves nearly as poorly as a ""real"" dwarf.Take the Ringwraiths who in the book are imposing figures with dark powers that make their enemies shake with fear. In the movies they are a bunch of sissies who get their asses whooped time and again while actively seeking physical confrontations.Take the elves, who ought to be timeless and beautiful beyond words. In the movies they look ordinary and nearly ugly at times.Take the Orcs who ought to be fearful and cruel warriors with their own cultures, languages and conflicts. In the movies, they are killed as easily as bugs and they move as if they were 100 years old and moreover they do not show off any soul or will of their own.I could go on and on forever with a list of such poor adaptations but will end it here. The point is that fantasy is very much about the individuals who inhabit the world and how some are of greater power and stature than others. This is something which Peter Jackson has not managed to bring to the screen visually at all.What he on the other hand has brought to the screen visually is Sauron himself: the greatest power and fear of Tolkien's Middle Earth compressed into first a mail clad warrior and then a burning vagina revolving on top of Barad Dür like a search light. Whether to laugh or cry at this adaptation is up to the viewer. It is pretty much the abc of horror that what you can imagine is a lot more scary than what you can actually see. And this brings us to my next point, the aurals:It can never be stated too many times how important the aurals are for bringing a world to life and drawing the viewer into it. While the sound effects are very well crafted in Peter Jackson's LOTR, the music is not. In fact, the music is so poorly fitting that it spoils the entire experience. It is too ethereal and carries no dynamics or inspiring rythms and where it tries to do so it is more of a turn off than whatever crap the standard radio station is playing. It is altogether pretentious and the only feeling it successfully conveys is melancholy.Another thing that strikes me is how empty the world is. No wild life, no natural beauty but bare mountains, no hamlets or buildings outside of the cities, no roads, hardly any traits of the civilizations of old and no agricultural signs at all except in the Shire. A few cities and the rest is wasteland.The movies can be summarized as technical master pieces but ill adapted, ill casted and musically disastrous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great views, few thoughts","Well, this movie is not for people who like subtlety. Not for people who like good dialogues. Not for people who like interesting characters. It is for people who love action, action, and nothing much else. For people who love pompous battles on big screens, hollow words, rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of, big words like 'today mankind will not fail'. Sure, I can see why people like this movie. They are just easily pleased. They see a big battle-scene and they're happy. They see orcs, orcs, and still more orcs, and they think, 'wow, these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet. How deep! What geniuses are Tolkien and Peter Jackson!' They see a helicopter-view of a battlefield, great graphics of a fictional city, a realistic monster-spider, and they're happy. They see good triumph over evil and they think that's the way it should be, because... well,..., uhm... because it's different from real life I guess? It gives them... uhm ... hope? It must be nice to not see that cheap emotions, the flat characters, some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film.It must be great to be able to love this movie!",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Wonderful finale, sweeping emotions and action","Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like ""gets everything right"", and ""I enjoyed every minute of it"", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving ""Into the West"" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends.  The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored.If for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet:  As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An epic and spectacular climax to the greatest film trilogy ever created... just pure genius...,"What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect.With the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life.Through this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion.And perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling ""You Shall Not Pass!"", The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings!Above all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a ""fantasy"" epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Breathtaking,"'Return of the King' was one of the best films that I have seen in a long while, and it has helped to fill a void and get audiences more interested in fantasy films. Like the previous two films in the trilogy, the photography and use of scenery is amazing. The cast of characters and the battle scenes were also done extremely well and set to an equally-beautiful soundtrack. This is one of the best films in film history and almost equal to 'Star Wars'. It has a good mix of action, adventure, and character development. It's also the most emotional of the films.The main problem that I did have with this film is the lack of an answer regarding the evil wizard. In fact, this was cut completely from the cinema release. The wizard was the face of evil in the previous two films, and he suddenly disappears, leaving an empty and unexplained face of evil. Despite that, the film is excellent in every other way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great story; well adapted for enthusiasts but feels long for others.,"Let me say first that after seeing Fellowship of the Ring, I went out and read the LOTR trilogy for the first time. I enjoyed it immensely, but I only read it once and not before I saw the first movie. So I might not be what you'd consider a true enthusiast.From an Enthusiasts perspective:There were a few disappointing momemts: the fact that Gandalf *still* didn't break Sarumon's staff on screen, and the way a lot of things were glossed over a bit. Additionally, there was way too much Legolas jumping around during battles. I understand they cost $9 million to make and not showing them would be effectively ""wasting"" $9 million, but there are more important things to show.Finally, and this was known very early on so it wasn't a surprise, the conclusion of the trilogy was completely removed. This trilogy began and ended with the Hobbits. It began by exposing them as lovable but helpless characters, and ended showing them to be courageous and capable of addressing significant problems. The movies, however, focused a little more on the characters people love, and while I don't fault them for that, I do fault them for not trying to show the ending of the trilogy in any way whatsoever. As an enthusiast, I can't grade the movie on its own; I must rate it as a trilogy. And this trilogy would get 9.5 / 10.From Joe's perspective:Joe wouldn't be nearly as acquanted with the characters, and a lot of what this movie succeeds on for the enthusiasts plays off of that. This is still a good movie, if a bit broken up giving far too many ""it's wrapping up"" signals.

Return of the King starts strong...,"...and although it loses steam in the middle, the spectacular battle, iconic design work and blistering finale pump it all up to the quality of its fore-films.The film is peppered with cool moments, a dawn raid against the archers of Osgiliath has a total dungeons and dragons feel and Gollum is such a schemer and a villain he's toe-curlingly watchable. The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake.Regarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The most outstanding conclusion for a trilogy ever,"As I said in the reviews for the previous two chapters, I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of ther reputation and many reviews. The first was great and a nice introduction, the second, while not outstanding, still good in some ways and the third... too great that it's a shame that you can't rate a movie with a score higher than 10, it's too damn perfect!After a prologue that shows us the origins of Gollum we join Gandalf, Eomer, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (Ian McKellen, Karl Urban, Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom) that on the way to Isengard meet Merry and Tuc (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) that tell them about Treebeard that won against Saruman who is now imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf then goes to Denethor for preparing him for Sauron's attack but Denethor is insane because his son Boromir (Sean Bean) died: in the meanwhile Frodo, Samwise (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) and Gollum arrive to Minas Morgul where Gollum makes Frodo believe that Sam wants the precious ring, but Sam will save Frodo from a giant spider. After a long battle Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and the army of the dead ogres arrive to Gondor, and now they don't have any other choice than go to Mordor, so that Frodo can go to Mount Doom for destroying the ring. Frodo is attacked by the ogres only to be saved by Sam, and can finally throw the ring in the lava despite a fight with Gollum. After the ring melts, the army or Mordor goes away and Sauron's spirit is defeated forever. Frodo and Sam are saved by the eagles and are taken to Gondor, and the day after in Minas Tirith there is the crowning of Aragorn as the new king and the celebration of his wedding with Arwen (Liv Tyler). In the end we see Bilbo finishing his book and Frodo decides to travel with the last elves left to Valinor.The sets are huge and spectacular at the same time, and the money was spent well for the scope. The performances by all (Mortensen, Bloom, Astin, Cate Blanchett, Wood, McKellen, Tyler and Rhys Davies) were all the great, and the soundtrack was on par with all the other settings. I especially loved the song OVER THE HORIZON by Annie Lennox towards the end credits, it was that great. The battle scenes and special effects were marvellous considering it was made in 2003.Overall, a must for fans of the trilogy and besides that, a masterpiece that has to be seen at least once for its greatness, it's that powerful!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Steaming...,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy reminds me of something with which I am quite familiar as a long-time denizen of Central New York: a steaming pile of horse manure. You know, that sickly sweet smell, wafting across hills on a summer breeze. Some people find the scent pleasant. I disagree.Likewise with LOTR. It seems Peter Jackson confused everyone into thinking that this series was something epic, something gargantuan, something important. Really, though, it's not. Yes, it is epic and it's long too, but it's not an important cinematic event. In fifty years, I dare say it'll be forgotten along with Titanic. You remember that plate of tripe, don't you? No, by the time I'm lying prostrate on a hospital bed, these three movies will have long been expunged from my memory and the memories of most others.You see, Mr. Jackson somehow forgot to concoct an interesting story when he drafted his endless (and often excruciatingly dull) battle scenes. There is, really, no character development to speak of. Frodo and Sam remain one-dimensional throughout and what depth Jackson gives them is cursory. And the rest? I have a difficult time keeping them straight.I'm sorry, Ringies, this movie just isn't that good. Maybe it's the glossy coating. See, I love Star Wars and, to be fair, many of the criticisms I've leveled against LOTR could also be leveled against George Lucas' films. Oh, and when I say Star Wars, I speak of the original trilogy. Yet, for all it's craftsmanship, the original Star Wars films were sort of clunky. You could tell that they were models made by hand, sets made by hand, costumes made by hand. It looked like a B-movie and felt like a B-movie and it was a B-movie, albeit one with great set design, costumes, effects, etc. LOTR really is a B-movie as well. Or at least it would have been 50 years ago. Yet, in today's market, it gets gussied up, made into an A-picture and it doesn't deserve it. I'm sorry, I just don't find this movie all that good and you'll never convince me otherwise.5/10 - Three points for tree-beard or whatever his name is and two for the ambition to even film it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Still black and white. But the spider's cool.,"Not surprisingly, a lot of good plot had been removed from the story, and a lot of bad plot inserted. This is hardly news; the same happened to the two predecessors. Much was lost by skipping ""The Scouring of the Shire"". The computer graphics are well-done but rarely convincing, and Gollum's only task is to provide comic relief. Most of the audience seemed to find him quite funny. I was just bored.Tolkien's books told a great story basically about the weakness of men (and other races), and the importance of not fighting alone. The best example being the events on the edge of Mount Doom. Tolkien made a strong point in that nobody is perfect, neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil.The film completely ignores this and simplifies things to pure black and white. There's good, and there's evil, with nothing in-between , no shades of grey.And that I think is sad.All that being said, the film has a few but important qualities, and that's the great camera work, the excellent acting and the stunning scenery - CG-scenery too.The rest of the CG is not that interesting, except for Shelob the spider who really makes up for it. The sound of a whole cinema audience simultaneously gasping in horror as ... Well, I won't spoil for those who haven't read the books. But wow. So, in the end, despite all its flaws, I recommend seeing this film. But go see it now, on the big screen. It won't be worth your time on TV.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The hype will die down,"The conclusion to what has been a seriously overhyped trilogy.  As of the time of writing, this movie was rated #4 in IMDB's top 250.  However, I suspect that much of that rating is due to overexcited fanboys (I hate that word but couldn't think of a substitute), and the film will slip a considerable number of places in subsequent years.Return of the King is probably the second best of the three films, surpassing the lackluster ""Two Towers"" but nowhere near as good as ""The Fellowship"".  I enjoyed the first half of the film considerably and was prepared to accept it as a good final installment.Unfortunately, like ""The Two Towers"", the film moves from the sublime to the ridiculous with the introduction of the battle scene.I'm afraid I am not a fan of CG animation in live films.  While the character of Gollum was well produced, the CG in the battles in lackluster and obvious.  It is like being slapped in the face whenever it appears.Even leaving out the CG however, the biggest insult I find is that the main characters have to do everything.  This was a particular problem in ""The Two Towers"", where the three heroes held off a whole army of orcs, but it is also prevalent in the battle in this movie.Sure, I've heard of suspension of disbelief, but it can only go so far.Unlike most people, I didn't mind the long ending with Sam and Frodo but the film had already been ruined for me before that.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A fitting climax to a peerless cinematic legacy,"As the saying goes, ""All good things must come to an end"", but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics.Debate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease.Only in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel.But even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling ""GO AWAY, TROLL"" at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless.Capturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance.The forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Théoden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen.Such praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"the journey may have ended, but the legacy will live on","And so, Jackson fulfills his vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle-earth and he does so with breathtaking detail and near-flawless artistic craftsmanship. Both previous entries of Jackson's epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy were spectacular achievements. ""Return of the King"" is an eleven Academy Award-winning movie and I suppose it's very worthy of such a title. It pretty much has won all of its Oscars for the entire trilogy, finally scoring big in the Best Picture category. Box office was also incredible, this film is the second biggest hit worldwide, just barely behind James Cameron's superb film ""Titanic"".""Return of the King"" is the conclusion of the trilogy. The stories of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Aragorn, and the others comes to a close as the characters all meet their fates. The final battle against the dreaded Sauron begins and there are numerous, almost countless battle sequences throughout the film using combinations of live-action actors in costumes and makeup, and state-of-the-art flawless visual effects created through months of hard work. The giant deranged elephants, trolls, and the sadistic Gollum are all incredibly convincing despite the fact that they are simply an illusion put on the film screen. Sometimes you might be able to guess that they are CGI, but Jackson's skills at directing a medieval battle sequence draws you into the action too much to pay any attention to the detail of the graphics. And you have to look hard to find any possible flaws or weak points.The Lord of the Rings is an amazing film trilogy, definitely one the best, ranking amongst others such as ""Star Wars"". ""Return of the King"" is an amazing achievement as well. Perhaps its only flaw is the excessive running time at nearly four hours in length. Still, that does not make it a disappointment in any way. That is unless you want it to be extremely faithful to Tolkien's original work. For me, it's a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The culmination is happy and this has a feel good ending. everything is so perfectly commercial on the face of it. But, to tell it the way it has been told is stupendous.The acts by all, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Austin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn are the most memorable for me.

Just happy that Peter Jackson did his bit in bringing one of the greatest fantasy novels to the public reach, He actually did a great service by doing so.

"Four Words: The Pyre of Denethor Butchered (ok, 5 words)","This movie, the conclusion of Peter Jackson's epic film series based on the Tolkien novels of the same name, was fairly good on the whole. However, having read the books beforehand, I was disappointed at several aspects of this movie.1. The Pyre of Denethor. This was my favorite scene in the book, but PJ mangled it. Instead of having Denethor kneel down on the pyre with his palantir, he leaped off of a battlement. This, while hilarious, was outrageous also. It was funnier than most parodies, and that's bad. It also seemed rushed, whereas in the book, time was taken.2. The Wild Men. I don't know why, but this exclusion got my goat. I guess I just liked the Wild Men, Ghan-Buri-Ghan saying ""Kill gorgun!"" and the fact that they still used a few big words. Maybe I'm just a purist.3. The Mouth of Sauron. His exclusion irritated me also, and I hear it will be on the EE (Extended Edition), so I guess that's something to look forward to.4. SARUMAN! Why, oh, why cut his scene? Wormtongue as well. Those were two of the best characters! 'Nuff said.5. Orcs. I was disappointed with the portrayal of the orcs, especially Shagrat and Gorbag (who are never called by name, along with Grishnakh and Ugluk from TTT). It seemed as if every orc line was yelled. Can't an orc merely talk? Shagrat and Gorbag were, again, two of the best characters. Tolkien's orcs were surprisingly sophisticated, and here they are reduced to yelling, angry simpletons. They even discuss post-war plans in Tolkien. Therefore, it was disappointing, except the cockney orc in TTT. ""Why cahn't we 'ave some meat?""6. Eowyn and Faramir. The love story is gone, and Eowyn is not as disguised as she should be (in the Battle.) Obviously it was filmed but cut, since the two look at each other at Aragorn's coronation.So, it was a good movie with a few flaws.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The pieces are moving...,"Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Stupendous.  Simply and utterly stupendous.,"First, no storyline description is needed for this movie, seeing as how the majority of the known universe has seen it.  Second, I have read the books, thoroughly and repeatedly, so I may offer my humble opinions on the film's comparable continuity.In short, this movie cannot be topped.  By anything.  Ever. Period.But since this section is meant for me to voice my opinions, I will justify my judgment.  Peter Jackson had his work cut out for him when he took up this task with New Line as his backer, mainly because it is a presold product.  The LOTR books have a following second to none, and failure on Jackson's part would likely have led to his assassination by an overzealous Tolkienite.  However, he has performed admirably, and has managed to stay as close to the literate plot as possible.  There are several jagged details which cause me to cringe every time I encounter them on the silver screen, but as a whole, I remain nonetheless satisfied.  The most obvious of these is the romantic subplot.  While I am by no means sexist, I believe that this subplot was added simply to keep female viewers who had not read the books interested.  Arwen and Eowyn's romantic involvement with Aragorn in the books is no more than a passing mention, if that.  There are no long dialogues between Aragorn and Arwen, and there are no dreamlike telepathic connections.  In this matter, Peter Jackson certainly took some creative liberties, but I suppose it did help romanticize the plot slightly.  But only slightly. I have several other small complaints about altered plots and over-dramatization, but I will continue to annoy my friends and relatives with these, instead of subjecting the worldwide audience to my extremist scrutiny.The CGI effects of this movie are mindblowing.  The Battle of the Pelennor Fields will stand out in cinematic history as the crowning jewel of combat sequences.  It will be many years, and many failed attempts before this battle will be paralleled, nonetheless succeeded of it's title.  Also, no doubt through the aid and constant vigil of the Official LOTR Fanclub (who always had Jackson's ear) I often found myself thinking ""that was exactly how I imagined it"", and was very pleased and even surprised by how accurate he had done his craft.  As for Gollum, what can I say, but that he was a continuation of perfection from The Two Towers.  I especially enjoyed how it further explained Smeagol's past, and his finding of The One Ring.Now some quick ratings.  Some of these may spoil their appearance in the movie for some, so be warned.Gollum: ASiege of Minas Tirith: A+The Oathbreakers (Ghost Army): A+Death of the Witch King: A-Arwen: CFrodo and Sam's ""relationship"": BFilm length: A (will be explained)That is one matter I feel I should address.  These books were written in a time when it was completely acceptable for one man to say to another that he loved him, strictly in a platonic way.  Leave your homophobic inhibitions outside the theatre, and please do not say lewd comments during what should be rather emotional scenes.The other major source of much moaning and groaning in the theatre is the length of the film.  Yes, it is three and a half hours.  Yes, that is a long movie.  Yes, you knew how long it was when you bought the ticket.  No, other people do not want to hear you moan about how long it is.  And finally, yes, Peter Jackson stayed as close to the books as possible.  The storyline does drag on near the end of the books, so by making the movie similar to the books, Peter Jackson was simply doing his directorial duty.  These books mean a lot to a lot of people, and if he had sold them short on what (for many people) are the most influential novels of their lives, he would not be a very good film maker would he.  Peter Jackson had an enormous task ahead of him, and he most likely had two main challenges on his mind during production.  First, to satisfy the already obsessed LOTR fanbase; second, to captivate the part of the audience who do not live and breathe LOTR. There is a fantastic volume of story to be told on those pages, and much of it has been left out from the movies, leaving only the core events and their inspired emotions.  Had Jackson not trimmed them down to where they are now, each movie would easily surpass twelve hours.  Easily.  It is a minor miracle that Jackson was able to convert such a literary masterpiece from pages to picture, and the audience should be pleased by its creation, not moan every fifteen seconds waiting for it to end.All in all, Return of the King was a flawless finale to a fantastic trilogy. Few trilogies can boast the numbers that LOTR can, and still remain captivating when it comes to it's end.  Return of the King is a shoe-in for Best Picture at the Oscars, and will likely sweep the globe in a flurry of well-known and not-so well-known awards.

"From part 1 to 3, completely devoid of soul, explanation and rationale","Firstly, let me get it clear that I have never read Tolkien's books nor do I intend to. As such I don't know how the real story was and what was cut out? The following comments refer only to the movie, as a piece of cinema.There is way too much presumption. The story starts off about a ring that is oh very powerful, controls everybody, is evil blah blah. All that is fine. OK, the ring is so very evil and powerful. But would'nt any rational person ask what makes the ring so powerful? The reasons are never provided. What makes it so valuable and important that people are going to wars over it, people are mutating over it and why does the villain want it? What is its secret? It would'nt be unfair to assume that the Return of the King answers all these questions. It absolutely does not.There is simply no story in this movie. It fails to explain what happened or even whats going on. As with the ring, why should one also has to presume that Sauron is so evil that hes worth fighting with all the armies of middle earth? With so much story surrounding Sauron, his appearance is restricted to nothing more than a large fiery eye. Just why is he so evil. Just why is he so feared? What did he do that was so bad? None of that is ever answered in any of the LOTR movies.Devoid of a story, the whole series are nothing more than a tour through middle earth when your, or anyone else's specific presence do not really matter. It looks more like a big documentary rather than a movie. The first two parts may have been slightly entertaining but streaching the same formula for yet another movie delivers an abysmally boring experience. The inhabitants of middle earth may have also been something original when Tolkien wrote them, but it is not so today.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Thrilling, Gripping, Visually Exciting Conclusion to the Trilogy","""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is a terrific demonstration of CGI and special effects made to serve a thrilling story of good vs. evil.I came in fully expecting that the ""Return of the King"" aspect would be the story line that would draw me in the most, but found that was given short shrift with a lot of that left out from the book, given over more to cinemascope-worthy battles that are the best since the early ""Star Wars"" movies.If I hadn't read the book recently, let alone re-read the appendices several times to be sure I was getting the prophesies and genealogy straight, I would never have figured out what was going on with Aragorn as the heir to Isildur, as much of what he does to convince doubters is missing.I also was a bit disappointed in Viggo not quite living up to ""LOTR: The Two Towers,"" but I don't know if it was his acting or the dialog, especially in his ""rally the troops"" a.k.a. ""another Crispin's Day speech,"" or if I found his traveling down the Paths of the Dead less frightening, and less motivated, than in the book. His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch.Second to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting.I am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well.But the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor.I didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material.Howard Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song.(originally written 12/28/2003)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The end of an epic, unforgettable adventure","It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step.So, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake...Like in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story.Now, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: ""I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!"", probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance.Well, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time.Peter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
From the beginning...,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe third and finale film in The Lord of the Rings series is the best. Peter Jackson left the best for last in this epic of all epics. The scale of the film is huge and the battles and set pieces are massive. This film is a masterpiece that needs to be experienced. The ending is touching and brought chills.The acting is once again amazing.

I have to stress once again that they are also perfectly cast in this film.The pacing and runtime is perfect.The battles in this film are grand, spectacular, and massive.Pros: Amazing story throughout all three films, a wonderful and touching ending, amazing acting, perfect casting, perfect pacing, a good runtime, and the battles are amazingCons: None at allOverall Rating: 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Dreadful,"I had such high hopes when I first heard that a Tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live-action+CGI version of Lord of the Rings... ... only to have them cruelly dashed.FOTR was a bit rough but I said to myself ""It'll only get better"".  Boy was I wrong.I suppose the main problem is twofold.First, Jackson is way too young/inexperienced to have taken on this project. He certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project.Second, for alleged lovers of the source material, Jackson and company took WAY too many liberties with the story.  Changing them in pointless and even foolish ways.  Perhaps this was inexperience, maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material.Goodness knows that LOTR is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in Tolkien's massive tome.Too bad that Jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen.  By the TROTK, Jackson's exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and he's lost sight of many key elements of the story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

One of the most unnoticed parts of this series,"The one thing Jackson did here that was a HUGE move away from the norm ... notice that none of these DVD's have any trailers for other movies in the beginning of the DVD or any other BS that you have to go through before getting to the actual menu - these three are the only ones out of 200+ DVD's that I own that I can just put in the DVD player and actually be able to watch them without a 5 minute BS runaround of having to try to fast forward through all of the ads and trailers - most of the DVD's out won't even let you access the menu until you watch these forced advertisements ..... I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Good but massively over-rated!,"A lot of people looking on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comments but I feel justified in saying that the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this final part in particular are possibly some of the most over-rated films of all time! I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too.Most people who loved the books or loves this kind of story understandably lap the films up enthusiastically. An epic, massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and loved fantasy stories is somewhat irresistible to anyone who likes fantasy stories at all. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the films and have remained so with each viewing. They are not bad films at all. They have great spectacle, have some epic action, some scenes with effective humour or emotion and some fine actors but there is a lot I find disappointing. LOTR would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and I don't think these films do it as well as they could. There is a lot of time wasted unnecessarily and important aspects of story and character are left out or underdeveloped.I find Peter Jackson generally a far from 100% successful director. His version of King Kong is poor and shows his faults even a lot more than the LOTR trilogy. All these Jackson made films are a bit overblown and a little pretentiously directed. Extremely long shots of characters gazing into camera, at each other or into the distance occur so often it is incredible. A great director does not need words to tell a story or convey emotion and the face and eyes of an actor can be used to huge effect. But most shots of characters without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they are wasting time! Frodo (Elijah Wood) especially just gazes or gawps for what seems like ages without making me connect with his feelings and without moving the character or story on at all.CGI is the real king in these films and as impressive as many scenes are, it never thrills as much as the real scenery or real action in some older epics. The epic spectacle is therefore not enough to carry me away on its own, it requires great storytelling. Some great storytelling does occur in these films but I do not feel Tolkein's story or characters are done full justice due to Jackson wasting time on 'pretty', glossy, showy film making. A real efficiency and supreme skill was needed to get the most from the source material and this is lacking. For instance, Return of the King misses out important aspects of Aragorn, Feramir and Saruman's stories and I find Frodo comes across as rather petulant, annoying and lacking heroism. Samwise comes across a lot better.A great villain completes a great story. Sauron appears a feeble 'villain' throughout the trilogy. A flaming eye is not exactly Darth Vader! Tolkein created a villain difficult to show effectively on screen and Jackson's presentation of Sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all. Saruman is a good villain and is brilliantly acted by Christopher Lee but has totally insufficient screen time, particularly in the final story where he goes straight to DVD!Overall The Return of the King is easily the weakest of the trilogy for my tastes featuring faults I have listed above, rather overblown CGI action and an extraordinarily dragged out ending.Yes these films are very good but for me they are nowhere near the classics they are reputed to be or that they could have been if perfectly directed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Tried Way Too Hard To Be Profound,"The high rating of this movie baffles me. While it had superb special effects and above average acting, it failed miserably in telling the story. I was extremely disappointed. I adored the first film in the trilogy, understanding that you cannot include everything in a movie that is in a book. The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Sorry, fanboys and girls, it is not the greatest movie, nor the greatest trilogy, ever made.","This third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy suffers from the same faults as its two predecessors, namely it is (1) overlong, (2) takes itself way too seriously and is (3) a case of much ado about nothing . ..Three hours in, as it was winding down to its predictable (both in general and specifics) ending, I found that my arse was sore and numb.There was another twenty minutes to go as we are made to sit through one endless coda after the other. Ultimately I felt as empty as we are made to believe some of the main characters are supposed to feel . . . and as empty as the movie itself.And make no mistake: Return of the King is an empty spectacle.Nowhere did any of its characters feel like real people with real emotions  they were simply too nobly self-sacrificing, too evil, etc. for that  they are mere archetypes. To be honest I found myself more emotionally touched by the 80 minutes or so of the recent Pieces of April (shot on digital camera for a mere $160,000) than the entire three hours of the multi-million dollar Return of the King.Don't get me wrong. As far as third installments in movie trilogies go, The Return of the King rates among the best. It is better than Return of the Jedi, definitely better than Matrix Revolutions and nowhere as disappointing as Alien 3. Something tells me that it'd probably be better than the upcoming Star Wars pic (if Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are anything to go by, that is).There can be no denying it: the three Lord of the Rings movies are quite an achievement as far as sheer spectacle and special effects go  they are truly grand to behold.Unfortunately, the battle scenes, as impressive as they may be, become repetitious and after similar scenes in The Two Towers, I began to suspect that maybe the whole series could have skipped an entire movie altogether and still have gotten to the point.And the point being? Well, that's the other problem: it is an epic triumph of special effects wizardry, but in aid of what?Tolkien's massive 1 000 page plus doorstop of a novel also isn't about much really. Its Manichean concepts of good and evil are too simplistic to take seriously. Ideologues who insist that Tolkien's novels are some kind of fascist tract however have it wrong. While they reflect Tolkien's conservatism and dread of modernity (not to mention his racial and chauvinist attitudes), Lord of the Rings is simply something he wrote to pass the time.The movies too will pass the time, but as someone once remarked: the golden age of sci-fi is 13.Thirteen is also the best age at which to have read Tolkien's books. Writer Brian Aldiss mentions in Trillion Year Spree (his excellent history of science fiction) that the success of fantasy novels is due to the absence of the one thing that their adolescent readers are always short of: money. You never see Lord Sauron struggling to make the mortgage payments on any of his huge castles. Or even the dashing Aragorn slapping down a few pence for his drink of ale at the local tavern. Or how about Frodo and Sam never having to pay any toll road fees? Money just never figures in any of these tales, Aldiss says.Aldiss may have been exaggerating, but he has a point: real-life adult issues never feature in Lord of the Rings. Ah, you say, but it is an age old battle of Good versus Evil.Actually, it isn't.Has anyone bothered to figure out why exactly the Orcs would support the evil Lord Sauron? Just what is in it for them? In the novels, the Orcs' non-White (as apartheid apparatchiks would have it) origins are hinted at. In fact, it would seem that the Orcs are the downtrodden untermensch of Middle Earth.Racist overtones aside, just what is gained after all those numerous battles? As the title implies, a monarchy is restored after fighting it out with a dictatorship.Heck, we might as well be talking about the (decidedly undemocratic) Kuwaiti royal family being restored to power after Gulf War I during the early 1990s. Neither are exactly causes to get all excited about. In fact, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has deeper insights into feudalism than all of Tolkien's thick magnum opus. ('Oh, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you!')Also, its seriousness gets wearisome. At some point in the movie my wife started cracking silly jokes, something she never does  anything to break the intermittent tension she later told me.Return of the King is like a small puppy instead of the roaring lion it pretends to be: it wants nothing more than to be liked; and while I admired it greatly, I found that I didn't really like it all that much. Is it a great movie? Absolutely. As good as these LoTR fanatics would have you believe-think ""greatest movie ever made""? Absolutely not. It is easily 8/10, but with all the ignore-flaws-it's-perfect reviews, I felt I would submit this to point out only the opposite.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Overrated,"Ok just to clear something up. Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life.I guess thats why the genre is called fantasy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
LOTR 3: The Video Game,"Many critics cite the 1952 film ""The Greatest Show of Earth"" as the poorest Best Picture selection in Academy history.   That dubious distinction should now go to ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" which makes DeMille's circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison.   It was not only the Academy, but also the once-relevant New York Film Critics Circle that chose this film as the year's best.  It's a wonder that the ghost of Pauline Kael didn't use her after-life influence with the All Mighty to strike the entire group dead.This video game-like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development.

Ian McKellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects. The female stars of the film, Tyler and Blanchett, have so little screen time that it doesn't make sense to even have them in the film.

One of the greatest movies ever made,"Peter Jackson and Wingnut films have created what may very well be the best movie trilogy in history. And, having just seen all three movies in a row at a marathon showing, I find it safe to say that The Return of the King is the very best of the lot. It goes all out on the technical level, outclassing just about everything else out there, but it also showcases Jackson's talent as a filmmaker. The final chapter of The Lord of the Rings is tightly cut, stunningly beautiful, well acted, and captures the essence of the book it's based on so brilliantly, it's uncanny. I say this both as a film student and a literature student.However, if you find this movie to be seriously flawed, you have a problem with Tolkien's source text, and not with Jackson's adaptation of it. This is perfectly reasonable; after all, high fantasy is not everyone's cup of tea, even though everybody seems to like these movies, or pretend that they do, because that's what you're supposed to these days. I say it's a matter of taste, but I really doubt there will be many that dislike this extremely impressive film.Purists will notice a lot of changes in the storyline, just like with the two previous chapters, and find this somewhat annoying. I felt like that with the first movie, but then I realized that these changes are implemented purely for cinematic reasons. After all, if what we wanted was a perfect rendition of the trilogy in every little detail, why not just read the books instead? Some things just don't work on film, and we're lucky that Peter Jackson knows this very, very well. I also like the way he dares to add extra bits not present in the books.If you still think that the movie is missing some parts along the way, well, you will most likely find them present in the forthcoming Extended Edition. That, however, does not mean you should not see the current version. It feels very much complete as it is. I give it my highest acclaim.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Yes But,"It's fantastic that someone finally succeeded in bring Tolkien to the big screen like this, and it took fantastic planning, and Jackson is deserving of every award he's received - and he should have received more.But there comes a time when CGI gets so close to but yet so far from reality that everything looks like a cartoon animated by van Gogh. I think these movies go too far without having much of a choice.The first part was enthralling because it was finally happening, and the Ringwraith were fantastic. The second part surprised by the emotion it invoked - it had all the flurry of a Lucas attempt at an epic but it had guts and grit too. And Jackson made his cast look earthy and human, and he introduced hormones into things that seem absent in the book(s).And it's a fantastic conclusion to be sure, but as with Titanic, the achievement is first and foremost that it happened and that it was a success. There is no way Jackson can get enough acclaim or recognition for what he has done.All I've got to say is I don't especially appreciate all these special effects. They come closer and closer to looking real but they will never be convincing. Serkis is amazing of course, and he should have received some sort of award. But there comes a time when the fantasy of the mind is better than trying to paint the impossible on screen.A lot of people will laud the movie because the effects were so good; this doesn't have squat to do with the quality of the movie. Like saying James Bond's Aston Martin is cool, therefore Connery/Lazenby/Moore/Dalton/Brosnan are good actors.No one can take away from Jackson what he did: a major achievement, a milestone in cinematic and cultural history. But I wasn't overly impressed, and in fact found myself looking at my watch wondering when it would all finally be over. Maybe I was satisfied the movie had made it and lost interest because I already knew the ending; maybe it was the plethora of CGI wizardry that had me longing for Wiley Coyote and his Roadrunner friend.At least there no one's trying to fool you into thinking it's real.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What happened to the script?,"This film was so chalk full of cheesy one liner's that one wondered what happened to the script writers.Gandalf the wizard was reduced to a swordwieilding soldier who merely clubs over the head those who disagree with him.What is clear is that Jackson, Boyens, and Walsh do not have a firm grasp of the source text.One can discern script weaknesses clearly as confused actors muddle through dialogue that they know is suspect at best (see Mortensen's (aragorn) speech at the crowning of the king).I laughed and I cried, but for all the wrong reasons.Rest in peace professor Tolkien, however difficult that may now seem to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Lord of the movie cliché,"To say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement. Like its predecessors, this flick employs just about every movie cliché in cinema history like long, long death scenes; fake death scenes (how many times did Freddo die, only to our ""surprise"" he's really not dead at all!); ""a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"" scenes, in fact what with the clip-clop galloping of horses everywhere I thought it had strayed into a Western. ""Ride like the wind"" type comments abound. The mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz he's so mad and bad. The cute little Hobbits we're all supposed to cheer for. And even a Darth Vader type chief villain!Coupled with a script that was so lame, the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original. In fact, the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money-grabbing movie cynicism were the villains! The orcs at least had character.Not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it.In years to come, this lumbering saga of over-hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way Star Wars is but in the same way Titanic is.... bit of an embarrassment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Good in its special effects,"Commenting the first part of this novel I said that it was a real message for peace, but I cannot assert the same for this final one . Although technically this film is one of the best in its special effects, it has too many battles which make it sometimes boring, battle after battle with no space to think or to relax. It also amazed me to see that the villain of this story, i.e. Christopher Lee disappeared with no explanation. I was unsuccessfully looking for him in the film, but later learned that even the same Lee is now arguing for the exclusion of his scenes from this film. Why such a exclusion? It is a real mystery. One can guest more or less the rest of the plot, the good boys winning over the evil. In fact the end of the film is like a poem, Frodo has to go to a kind of a sweet death leaving Sam sad. This scene is certainly unexpected and makes you think that death is fatal but can be welcome when good doing has taken place. In any case, my criticism here does not demerit the success of the whole serial of these three films, but the third one should have been the best and it was not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great visuals, not so great storytelling...","Return of the King - Special Extended Edition.While normally a person to find enjoyment in both fantasy and science-fiction, I am one of the few who haven't really enjoyed Jackson's earlier takes on the Tolkien masterpiece I had less than stellar expectations.The film however did kick off on a promising note and for the first hour or so I was having a pretty decent time. After a while though my mind started to wander and after another hour I couldn't really care less about what happened to the characters.What is it that makes me so indifferent to these characters? I believe the whole thing boils down to Jackson's storytelling. At his best when he can wield his mighty camera over vast landscapes, showing off weird and wonderful creatures and humongous armies. He seems a lot less comfortable when dealing with human (hobbit, dwarfish, elfish) interaction on a smaller level. Unfortunately this somewhat spills over too the battle-scenes as well, and any enjoyment is purely on the visual side. Yes, the spectacle is certainly great - but it is still JUST spectacle.Another problem is that the actors are for the most part delivering speeches rather than having conversations. It makes the whole thing stale and the characters less life-like.On a positive note Jackson and his editors have improved the flow between the different story lines since the last film. The effects are mostly top-notch as is the production-design.Unfortunately it is let down by a director who seems to be bellowing, ""look what I can do"" to at all times. This ""more is more""-style served him well in his earlier work but it's just a bit too shallow to do a justice to a story of this scale.All in all not horrible, but certainly not the film to end all films...5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

was expecting much more,"Well, after 3 years of waiting from the first time we see FOTR to the so-called ""epic"" conclusion of the lord of the rings, I have to say I was expecting more. Storywise I believe that several essential elements were left out ie. Saruman's appearance in the Shire. In its stead were non essential, showy special effect scenes which added little to no substance to an already way too long movie. I had an extreme case of the fidgets by the time the 5th ending finally ended the film for good.That being said I do think that the battle scenes were absolutely fantastic and Jackson had captured the emotional undertone of Tolkeins work superbly so I definitely don't blame hard-core fans for enjoying it so much!

doesn't belong in the top 250,"first, i am a huge fan of the LOTR series by Tolkien. it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time, and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced. i didn't mind 'the fellowship of the ring'; i thought it was definitely the most concise and well-directed of the three films. also, the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent. the set design and choice of locale is impeccable, and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen. however, it is the technical aspect of the project, what should be the real beef of the film, that puts the knife in.'the two towers' marked the real beginning of jackson's self-righteous altering of tolkien's noble story, and left many fans and serious film-goers wondering what went wrong. but 'return of the king' takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history. jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose; even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did. the character development is excruciating, as some of the major character-based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film. jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters' names and their titles, but has drawn a blank on their behavior, values, emotions, and relationships with other characters. the script is pathetic; tolkien's majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long-winded, sappy, cliché monologues, complete with the exact same musical score used for the previous two films. entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns, and filler dialog is rampant; it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3-hour running time.the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkien's telling of them, but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries, using cheap close-ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action. jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles, giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives, but rather swashbuckling for swashbuckling's sake. very simply, this is not the 'lord of the rings' that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkien's masterpiece. i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process (i.e. kubrick, coppola), but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft (jackson, genius behind such film classics as 'the frighteners' and 'dead alive'). this film does not belong in the top 250, nor do the other LOTR films. knowing that this film is above 'seven samurai' and 'casablanca' (and that the first two LOTR films are the reason 'citizen kane' sits at #11) sickens me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"7.2/10 - A Pretty Good Movie, But Doesn't Reach the Heights of its Predecessors (or: Exhaustion Has Taken Hold)","Well, that was...a lot. I mean, literally: a lot. This trilogy being in the top 15 of the IMDb top 100 (which, by the way, is kinda insane that a whole trilogy is ranked so high here) made me go through quite a few weeks on which I'm only watching 3 hours+ long movies. It can get exhausting, especially now, towards the end, even if I'm having a good experience with the trilogy overall. Anyway, I'm glad to finally finish with that and move on to...well, another long movie, but at least moving on from this very lengthy trilogy.The Return of the King, again, picks up right were we left off - Frodo and Sam are making their way into Mordor, led by a treacherous guide, prone to danger because of Frodo's clouded mind. The armies of Sauron gather once more to crush the remaining resistance of the free folk of Middle-Earth - especially men, since Aragorn poses a danger to the dark lord, as an exiled king that might gather them all under one flag, one army. Will everyone survive against the rising darkness, push through it all one last time?Now, the thing is, I'm not the sole soul who's exhausted with this all. Quite the opposite - Peter Jackson and everyone else working on this trilogy, after years of intense work, being buried deep in it - well, it only makes sense that your energy will run out, eventually. That's not to say that it's their fault, or that they didn't still do their absolute best here (and maybe Tolkein's source material is to be blamed), but everything feels more mechanical, leaning more on CGI, less subtle and immersive, fewer moments of iconic composition. The good of the previous films is felt here, and it's not a bad movie, but it's important to understand to background, in my opinion, in order to understand what made things this way.Another reason that the intensity and impact of the previous couldn't be maintained here, the way I see it, at least, is that much of the conflicts are now already past and gone, with one side winning already. It makes for less involvement, and generally I'd say that the conflicts that this film depicts don't hold the same potency. Gollum, for instance, was so interesting BECAUSE of his inner conflict. Now that one side has won, there's less complexity, fewer emotional layers. Look at Théoden's story and compare it to the plotline of Denethor and Faramir - there might be some good moments here (in fact, I feel like Denethor and Faramir's conflict here makes for some of the best moments in the movie), but in many ways it still feels only like a shadow of Rohan's storyline.The action, which is a very essential part in both films, this and The Two Towers - and I'm sorry I'm comparing everything to Two Towers, but this is the best way I could come up with to get my point across - is so much better on the previous film, despite having less time to build up. It still utilizes its time in a better way, making us actually care for the characters before Helm's Deep, or any other action scene for that matters. And, by the way, yes, 4 hours is a tough watch, even for a movie that's pretty good overall. But, back to the main point - it's not that the action here doesn't have its moments (despite the infamous ""I am no man!"", which is hands down the most cringe-worthy moment of this trilogy), but the buildup isn't as powerful, the effects lean more on CGI, and things just generally feel too much like a blockbuster.Frodo is still not a very good character, and everything being so grand but not in an effortless way (sort of stiff at times) kinda makes me feel detached. But you know what? I've been saying all of this bad stuff about this movie, but I want to emphasize - this movie still has many highlights, it continues a story I'm already invested in, and the production design, soundtrack and all are still very, very good, even if at times they're somewhat inferior compared to the previous movie. I love the army of the dead section, I love the way things ended up with Gollum's plans, Denethor and Faramir have some great moments too, like I said. It's not all bad.If I had to rank this trilogy, I'd say that Two Towers>Fellowship>The Return of the King, but none of them is bad. This one is where the exhaustion shows, where they need to end a very epic story, where so many climaxes and important points happen, and despite missing some of the qualities its predecessors had, I'd still say it did a pretty good job.The Return of the King, despite being worse than its predecessors, isn't a bad movie. It is, indeed, more blockbuster-y, less immersive, but it still has its fair share of iconic moments and highlights, great production design, and lots of love and care that went into it. I'm feeling a 7.2/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic movie,"Probably the best movie in the series The hobbit and LOTR this movie is the best because of three crucial parts.First the Stunning CGI only a genius like Peter Jackson could create along with Weta Workshop.The CGI will make you feel like the orcs are standing right in front of you.Second up on the list is amazing writing.With dialog that makes it seem like real life instead of a movie,with most of the dialog coming from the books too.The finally thing that makes this movie great is the soundtrack.Often Put down as one of the best soundtracks ever,the sad violin theme for rohan, the iconic gondorian theme and even the Mordor theme are good.And you can't deny it you probably cried towards the end of the movie.Yes maybe the ending is a little over the top and gimli really isn't that cool and serves as comic relief but otherwise this movie is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Despite not being a fan of ""fantasy"" movies, i was completely taken by the magic of the story, and particularly Peter Jackson's incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie, and raise the scales of film making. The Return of the King grabs audiences and places them in with the characters, one by one. It is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 Oscars, and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of The Hobbit to see if Peter Jackson can outdo himself.

Different and very good,"To keep rating simple for my vote, let's just say that I'll give this film 9/10, but don't ask me what I'd say for what's lacking, for I wouldn't know what to say. It's a generously long film, no commercial breaks, if a person wants to call those interruptions breaks anyway, and I definitely am not qualified to criticize this film in any respect. Still, I'll give 9/10 rather than 10/10, to be conservative, say. :)People should, however, learn the basics of the story before seeing this film in order to get the most satisfaction from it. I read Tolkien's story in book form and later saw the three-part film for LOTR. So, seeing this film directed by Peter Jackson, I had no pre-study to do. One thing viewers need to know is the importance of the ring. I guess that it is the most elementary part of the story. Otherwise, people can naturally wonder what the fuss is about a ring even if it appears to be made of gold. If it's supposed to be gold, then that's not what's important about it. What is, is the magical or mystical power that it provides to whoever is wearing it and that this power is related, say, to evil.

Is it which one?,"That refers to the fact of the extended edition(in my opinion) being so much better. What i hated in the third movie was, sad to say, that it felt too much cut. There were clear gaps in the story and 48 minutes of new material make the story now complete, thus rising my original 4 stars to full 5.So, if I now review the extended version. Well to begin with the feeling's GREAT! the original Lord of the Rings is on screen again. Right starting from the appearing of Saruman to the Ending of the film. What a bad decision to cut that out from the original. In the Extended version you have a hole nother adventure. The true and final ending of the excellent trilogy of movies. The AMAZING battle scenes as well as the intense character relations come to a full circle. Yeah, you might say that there are ""too many"" endings but the movie is no lesser. It kinda has to be that way.As in an article I read: Of course Tolkien's books are the most powerful Middle-Earth, but would anyone even deared to imagine the book like Peter Jackson.This movie trilogy should live forever, and it most likely will...

Too Damn Long Weeping Hobbits...,"Yes, it's battle scenes were second to none. But battles are not all the stuff of great epics. The fact that none of its actors were nominated says alot. I feel in time the recollections of this film will be revalued to nothing more than a good movie.The edit of this film was criminally long. At 3 1/2 hours without intermission it felt like six. The ending upon ending was one weepy hobbit scene after another - emotionally redundant.I feel that two phenomenoms in hype are at play. First , it was released at a time when most epic adventures are directed without the wit, sensitivity and storyline Jackson has. Two, after investing all day into a movie, if it's good you liable to say it's great, especially after recovering from severe butt cramp.When the hype dies and people look at the film again, they'll see it for what it is. A good film with great battles and mediocre to in some cases below the line performances. Elijah Woods shades of torment read as the same response except at different volumes. While diffusion, a good sound mix save Liv Tyler from utter ridicule as she gives us her unequaled rendition of the gaumless pout.It is her stoyline I find the most distracting. Her lack of craft amidst a well trained cast, cheapens the overall perfomances. Her attempts to looks deep are as vain attempt to show life behind her eyes as her Oscar Night spectacles. Thank God she wasn't in a scene with Cate Blanchett. The contrast would reveal the babe casting truth. Was this an appeal to Frat boys far and wide. Surely they could've found a comely brunette with chops.In the end, the endless moaning and weeping of Hobbits, especially in the last reel, will be viewed for the sentimental drivel it really is.Had they cut down on this along with Liv Tyler's distraction, the film could have been a tight 2 1/2 hours with far more resonance.And on a philosophical note, are we too take the somewhat physically and sometimes mentally feeble Hobbits seriously as heroes.

I think this is just an ordinary movie not a great movie,"Why? I'll tell you why this is my opinion. First of all I can't believe it's in top five of all times!!! This is unbelievable and I think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie:) I'm just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought. First of all the story was already used in a previous movie(The Lord of the Rings 1978). The special effects are great but what about the Matrix? The music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget, and the plot is for kids(let's face it) with no passion or feelings etc. just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any Jean-Claude Van-Damme or Stallone movie.

my ideas about the film,"I think the film is great. The battle scenes are quite huge, which are as what i have been told, but i think the story can go on a bit faster, so the audience can ""feel"" the film more thoroughly.Most of the film goes quite well and is interesting, but there is a particular scene that left in my mind. Before Aragorn went into fighting with the half-breeds to distract Sauron from Frodo, he said, ""I've seen in your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart with me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we resell our friends and break all bounds of fellowship ...... and the age of men come crushing down, but it is not this day. This day we fight!""The sentence boost morale and have great influence to the audience, it makes us ""feel what we see"", causing us to feel like part of the characters. Also, it is meaningful. Perhaps this is not the main idea that the film wants to give out, but it wakes people up, when they are in their bad times.I also like the music of the film. It really affects my emotion. I have tried to watch this film when the sound card of my computer is out of work. It is not what it is like compared to what i have seen in the theatre. (Another reason may be the screen in a theatre is a lot larger)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
OH MY GOD!!!!! (slow motion sucks),"What on earth are all you people praising this movie as the perfect ending and better than the first three talking about?For the record, I really liked the first two so I am not just a hater. I won't even complain about elements left out of the movie that were in the book.The main problem with this film is that apparently director Peter Jackson has grown an enormous ego with the success of the first two films. Apparently he felt the need to make this finale even more epic than the first two films (the although the story is already quite epic enough). He decides to do this in an enormous number of ways. Let's see.....he uses slow motion, and then um....yeah he uses slow motion, and oh wait....he also uses slow motion. My god!!! I have never seen such unimaginative directing. The movie could have easily been only 2 hours had all these slow-mo scenes been played in real time. Slow motion at certain points in the story can be effective. Overuse is clearly detrimental to the flow of the story.My other main issue with the third installment was the infusion of simply awful one-liners throughout. ""I am no woman!"" and almost anything Sam said from what I can remember (which is probably less than I should as I had to start tuning out the stupid things half the people were saying).Now to be fair the movie wasnt awful. I mostly liked it. But these problems took away from what was largely a successful ending. Again, I attribute it to the director trying to be epic with the repeated use of childish editing techniques when the story itself was epic enough.Definitely a bad ending.SLOW MOTION SUCKS",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Dull, uninvolving, forgettable uncharismatic characters.","This was the dullest film of the 65 films I have seen all year.It took an age to get going. After 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out, the rest were asleep. I personally demanded and got my money back. If people develop DVT through sitting through this then Peter Jackson should watch out.What happened in the Gollum effects department between Two Towers and this entry? For the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty. Dreadful effects.I also find the actors in these Lord of the Rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic. In the end I was willing Frodo to die because I got fed up of his constant whining. Peter Jackson made a BIG mistake dropping Christopher Lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them, and was sorely missed.Lord of the Rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original Star Wars Trilogy, simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of a best films what I have seen,"The final chapter of the confrontation between the two opposing forces of Middle-earth, good and evil, in which the end of the multi-thousand-year history of one of the parties must be put. Peter Jackson, his team and, of course, John Tolkien, as the creator of the world of Middle-earth and its history, were able to create a film that, I am sure, will be remembered for more than a decade. The harmonious combination of an incredibly interesting plot that is interesting to people of all generations, professional acting of all actors, special effects that are striking even by the standards of 2021 (and unobtrusive computer graphics), and, of course, musical accompaniment composed by Howard Shore, each track of which is recognized from the first notes by the absolute majority of people, did what it was supposed to do - become this film one of the favorites for most people, even far from cinema.

as rousing and enthralling an epic fantasy adventure as any ever committed to film,"No amount of accolades seem to do justice to The Lord of the Rings. This is film-making at its most masterful, an epic adventure of extraordinary scope and depth, balancing its spectacular visual spectacle and deeply stirring emotional power without shortchanging either.With The Return of the King, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy has firmly cemented its status as three of the greatest films ever made. This is sheer cinematic brilliance at work, visually stunning, profoundly moving, and virtually unparalleled. ""Enthralling"" seems to be the only word to accurately describe The Return of the King. We are kept riveted on the edge of our seats for three hours, with the result that by the end we are almost emotionally exhausted- in the most satisfying way. Everyone involved can be proud of what they have accomplished here, and in particular Peter Jackson, without whom this brilliant film adaptation of J.R.R.

"Better, but...","The conventional wisdom that this is the best of the three is certainly true, but I still can't call this a great movie. Just like the others in the series, there's lots of style but just not much story. And also just like the others, it's a three hour movie that would have made a better two hour movie. The FX are remarkable, but the characters for me are still just not all that interesting. I'm not sure how it was accomplished, but Jackson managed to put over nine hours on film without creating characters I cared about (with the exception of a modest amount of sympathy for the long-suffering Sam). I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure flicks, but watching this for me was more like an endurance test than a three hour escape into fantasy. I'm sure lots of Tolkien fans out there are going to be deeply offended, but I'm afraid there are some of us that don't find the stories all that gripping.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A great disappointment - but no surprise,"Very few trilogies manage to keep an even level of quality throughout. The classic example of course being ""The Godfather""-trilogy, who, although the first two 'chapters' were brilliant, floundered in the end. The very same phenomenon exists in the world of literature as well, to name an example; the ""Gormenghast""-trilogy.Why is this? It is probably not possible to arrive at a complete answer, but one possible solution is obvious. Firstly, Jackson must have been exhausted from making the two previous movies. Making cinema at the highest level is very hard work, and especially so for a director so closely interwoven with all aspects of the production. I believe he simply lost his concentration. A few of the obvious weak points of the movie should have been rooted out on an early stage. The fact that they weren't indicate a lack of the control Jackson exercised over LOTR I and II, in particular over the script. The story in the most complicated part of LOTR, near the very end, is so appallingly bad that many in the audience felt embarrassed for their interest int the trilogy as a whole. Now, Mr. Jackson isn't solely to blame for it all. Everyone who has read LOTR know that Tolkien also very much messed up the story at the end. Being a no more than mediocre writer he simply lacked the experience to round off the story in a fashion that suited the mammoth amount of verbiage leading up to the final battle. The predominant problem is that neither Jackson, who could have rewritten the end, or Tolkien offer anything new or remotely exciting. Instead they rehash the battle at Helm's deep. And, after many hours of careful storytelling, Jackson's heroes stumbles, out of nowhere, upon the ""Deus I'm machina"", an animated phosphorous-green army of semi-transparent ghouls. These specters, horribly reminiscent of ""the Judge"" from Jackson's flop ""The Frighteners"" save the day. The importance of these undead crusaders is inexplicably exaggerated by Walsh and Jackson. In addition, the digital effect used to create the army reminds one of a commercial for soap, a green blob magically swooping away the dirt. Visually, Jackson tendency to rely too much on digital effects was his downfall. It really isn't necessary to add that the final scenes was rather pathetic, a reminder that Tolkien dodged complex emotions for a very good reason. The supposedly bitter-sweet goodbye at the dock is drenched in golden light, no doubt added digitally, and adds the last touch of defeat to this great disappointment.I rate this movie: 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The greatest movie of all times ?,"Is the Return of the King the greatest movie to ever appear on the silver screen ?It grossed over 1 billion dollars, it got 11 Oscars, 4 golden globes and countless other awards. You could argue that awards are always a subjective thing and don't necessarly say anything about the quality of a movie. But you can't argue that the movie reached a huge amount of people all over the world. But does this mean that the movie itself is actually good ? Well that again depends on what you define as good or as bad. For my part, I went into the movie with quite some prejudice, since I'm not a particularly big fan of fantasy films, nor did I ever read the books. As a cineast I didn't expect much. But I was shocked. This movie is truly fantastic and as perfect as it gets.What's most important about a movie is obviously the story and it's themes. Well the Lord of the Rings has a fantasy overlay, the stories underneath it though, are the very stories that concern us all, like love, friendship, confidence etc. So if you're able to read between the lines, this movie has a lot to offer, but the great thing is, that the movie is also able to entertain. I mean ask yourself, what do you want to see, a dialogue heavy slow paced movie, that almost sends you away in the land of dreams, or a movie that entertains, but still doesn't leave the themes of our everyday life out of sight ? The Lord of the Rings movies shouldn't just be hated because they're fantasy movies, it's not what they deserve, so much love has flown into these movies, that they surely deserve their place at the top of cinematic history. The greatest movie of all time ? Well the Return of the King surely stands among the top. And we should all be proud to have been a part of the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

I liked part 1: ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and part 2: ""The Two Towers"" was not the best of the trilogy, but at least everything was set up for this movie - the final chapter in the trilogy! Back when I saw this for the first time on DVD, this was the third best movie ever made (now this is the 4th best movie ever made with ""The Godfather: Part II"" taking that spot, another movie I plan on watching in the future) and this is the best action movie ever made according to this website. I definitely agree - all the action sequences are breathless! However, the very last 20 minutes of this film were too slow for me - but at least that meant that all good things must come to an end, huh?

*A Triumph for Middle-earth: Unforgettable Finale*,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just the conclusion of a trilogy; it is a breathtaking culmination of an epic journey that resonates deeply within the human spirit. Peter Jackson's masterful direction and the creative prowess behind this cinematic odyssey bring to life J. R. Tolkien's timeless tale of courage, sacrifice, and the persistent glimmer of hope amid despair.The Return of the King envelops the audience in a tapestry of emotion and grandeur. The film's scope is staggering, drawing viewers into the climactic battle for the fate of Middle-earth. The sheer scale of the battles, particularly the Siege of Minas Tirith, is both a technical marvel and a poignant reflection of the struggle between light and darkness. Each clash of swords and every charging cavalry echo the weight of choices made, reminding us that heroism isn't just about valor on the battlefield, but also the relentless fight against the encroaching shadows of despair.At its heart, The Return of the King is a profound exploration of friendship and loyalty. The evolving dynamics among Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are a testament to the bonds that can illuminate even the bleakest of paths. Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee is, without question, one of the most moving performances in cinematic history. His unwavering loyalty and heartfelt determination to support Frodo through the darkness encapsulate the very essence of what it means to be a true friend.The film also brilliantly weaves in themes of redemption and sacrifice. Characters like Aragorn step into their destinies with stunning grace, while others confront their own demons, exemplifying the notion that true strength often lies in vulnerability. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn is a masterclass in embodying a reluctant hero, bringing forth an emotional depth that resonates through every moment of conflict and resolution.The Return of the King is nothing short of a masterpiece. Each shot is meticulously crafted, showcasing the vast landscapes of Middle-earth-each location imbued with its own unique story and history. Howard Shore's sweeping score elevates every scene, stirring emotions and evoking the gravitas of the moment, leaving audiences breathless as the powerful themes reach their zenith.As the film reaches its conclusion, viewers are reminded that even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Frodo's journey culminates in a bittersweet farewell, encapsulating the essence of sacrifice and the cost of carrying an enormous burden-a theme that lingers long after the credits roll.In the end, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a film; it is an experience that encapsulates the triumph of hope over despair, the power of friendship, and the beauty of sacrifice. It is an artistic achievement that will be celebrated for generations, a poignant reminder that even in our darkest hours, the light of courage and love can lead us home. This film stands as a glorious testament to the resilience of the human spirit, forever etched in the hearts of those who dare to dream of a better world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Too many changes,"""Lord Of The Rings will become a milestone in movie history.""It will, indeed.  Peter Jackson pronounces Return of the King the best of the three movies. I think it's the worst, because it makes the most changes to Tolkien's story. It deletes many sequences, about which more in a moment, and adds many others. I wanted to see Tolkien's story; I have no interest in Jackson's embellishments. My opinion of this movie was somewhat rescued by a perceptive usenet poster who summarized the many scenes, and there were a lot of them, quoted verbatim from the book.I thought the whole journey into Mordor (or as Elrond says, Mor-r-dor-r) was very poorly done. The business with the lembas was a Jackson improvement sarcasm mode completely unnecessary. He might have been better served filming Beregond, a character whose interaction with Aragorn serves to demonstrate Aragorn as a wise king, or Aragorn's confrontation with Sauron via the palantir, which serves to establish Aragorn as a power in middle earth, the equal of Elendil and Isildur, his illustrious forebears. It wasn't Frodo who came across as a wuss here. It was Aragorn.Having read the book a number of times, I have no quarrel with the ending of the movie. I thought the staging of that ending was ineffectual and it defenestrated the considerable pathos that Tolkien so poignantly evoked, but it was Tolkien's ending. I would have been thoroughly upset if the movie had ended any other way. I am probably the only person who thought the ending was too short, and left out much from Tolkien's appendices that could have been included in an epilogue.The Grey Havens sucked, no other way to say it. It struck me as if Jackson had invested himself so much in the Battle of Pelennor Fields and the siege of Minas Tirith, he had nothing left for one of the grandest chapters in this marvelous story, and one of the saddest: the passing of elven-kind from the affairs of men into the uttermost west. The book evokes a terrible, achingly poignant sense of loss - the loss of grandeur - that the movie altogether misses.The short version: too many discomforting changes ..

Au revoir Lord of the Rings!,"Three years of fuss concluded with Peter Jackson and his army of smiling puppets walking away with the American Academy Awards. I really didn't care that much because Mystic River took the acting awards (quite right too) and frankly 'Master & Commander' & Co weren't strong enough.

Disappointing!,"This movie was disappointing.  As the third and final piece to the LOTR trilogy, this film took a step back from the previous two.  I commend Peter Jackson's work on ""The Fellowship..."" and ""The Two Towers"" as great spectacles in modern film, however, ""The Return of the King"" will go down as the weakest link in this trilogy.Some problems I had with this movie is the reoccurring patterns that we have already seen in the previous two movies.  Just when it seems as though all hope is lost for the ""good"" guys, some swooping x-factor comes in and helps and saves the day.  And come-on...how in the world is anyone supposed to beat ghosts.  I feel this was a poor interpretation from the book.And how many more times do we need to see Frodo about to give up, and then Sam giving a pep-talk to keep his spirits up.

Jackson makes best of three with smart appreciation of entertainment,"Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their quest for Mordor to destroy the one ring while the Battle for Middle Earth rages on.The final part of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy was at the time, the highest grossing film ever to grace our screens and up until this film, fan hype and speculation was rightfully anticipating how the magician Jackson would conclude the wonderfully courageous adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's novel.The previous release, The Two Towers, was showcased by an eccentric display by the director, orchestrating a once more beautifully cinematic approach to scenery and balancing it with a blend of tight and exciting war and fantasy concepts. He proved The Fellowship was no fluke and maintaining his flow in the sequel, the New Zealander was able to carry forth this momentum into the final part with the same vigour and energy as his previous two smashes. There are certainly cases here for the best shots of the entire trilogy. When Frodo is walking slowly and there is a huge spider looming makes great tension but, on a personal level, the best part of the entire series comes near to the end when Frodo and Sam are so very close to banishing the ring for good, and with one simple close shot, Jackson captures Frodo's feelings of desire and madness, which makes for a heart stopping and riveting twist.Peter Jackson has certainly taken the magic of the novels and twisted and shot them into fan's favourites. The complexity of the battle sequences, the close eye upon constant political and action ideologies and weaving a tight knot around such a huge crew is a fantastic achievement and is only bettered by the fact he has made the legendary books into films for anyone of any age, for anytime of the year and for any situation. There is humour, romance, action, war, drama and significantly a wonderful sense of escapism with the fantasy genre, astounding stuff to recapture the critically acclaimed mind of J.R.R Tolkien's work.One huge input into the success which still has fans in awe is the CGI Andy Serkis who blew audiences away with that voice and self manipulation. Smeagol opens proceedings here as his friend discovers the one ring at the bottom of the lake. Up to this stage we are fully aware of the ring's pull over Gollum, but there is a delightful shock in store when the real Andy Serkis sets his eyes upon it in his friend's hand. A wonderfully cut montage sees Gollum up the present and his still changing debate over how his master affects him.Like the previous two films, there are multiple stories with the fellowship in the battle for Middle Earth, Frodo and Sam on their quest whilst there are numerous activities in the different parts of the country. The multiple concepts and issues flying around are smartly condensed into manageable moments of brilliance. Jackson has easily made the best of the three here, and rightfully and finally clinched his Oscar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Excellent movie from an excellent book,"The movie is all what i expect and imagine from the book, excellent effects, actors, direction, photography (is amazing!)..the music!... i have no words...The movie has a amazing develop from the first movie, so this is the most involving, but the end, although the length is ... well..From USA today:""The three-part story of courage, friendship, honor and duty  spanning The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King, which comes to theaters tonight  is ideally suited to epic film-making. It is steeped in fast-paced action and grand adventure, yet still grounded in humanity  a rare combination among large-scale film extravaganzas.It isn't until now that director Peter Jackson's efforts can be fully and fairly judged, notwithstanding the monumental box office success of the first two films, which have grossed $1.8 billion worldwide. As good as each individual movie is, the third film vaults the work into the stratosphere of classic movies. Key characters are enhanced, new civilizations visited and battles fought more intensely, while feelings and motivations are plumbed more deeply and movingly.After the release of the first and second films, one wondered how the trilogy, as a nine-hour film fest, might compare with other cinematic watermarks. In its entirety, The Lord of the Rings surpasses other multi-part sagas such as Star Wars or even The Godfather. Both Star Wars and The Godfather had weak links, whole movies that didn't work as well as the best of the series. Rings maintains the same standard of excellence with each film and grows more assured with each installment. Of course, some of that escalating power is attributable to the storytelling prowess of J.R.R. Tolkien, upon whose classic novels the trilogy is based.The books depict the odyssey of the humble hobbit Frodo, whose quest is to destroy a powerful ring that could enslave all the inhabitants of the fictional land of Middle-earth. Helping him accomplish his mission is a heroic cadre of creatures: Gandalf the wizard; Legolas the elf; Gimli the dwarf; Aragorn and Boromir, both men; and three other hobbits, Sam, Merry and Pippin. This unlikely alliance comes together in a spirit of acceptance and tolerance to fight the satanic Sauron and his devilish henchmen.Those of us who do not consider ourselves fans of fantasy initially may have thought to dismiss the movies as far-fetched, overblown silliness. It was hard to imagine the films as relevant or transcending their genre.But many of us have come around to another point of view: The films tell a classic story that espouses the virtues of love, hard work and compassion and decries greed, deceit and abuse of power in a mighty struggle against temptation and the corrupting forces of power. The story's message about conserving natural resources has profound significance for our times, as does the notion of taking up arms against an evil tyrant and the importance of overcoming prejudice to work toward a common goal of peace.Ironically, these simple messages were massively complicated to pull off, requiring a budget of nearly $300 million, a crew of 26,000 extras and a production team of 2,400, which included medieval weapons designers, stone sculptors, linguists, blacksmiths and model builders. Bringing to life such a wide-ranging story with technical proficiency and visual dazzle is an unprecedented achievement, one that likely will define Jackson, much as George Lucas is forever linked to the Star Wars movies he directed.Though the acting ensemble is strong, the movie does not belong to any one of them. While Elijah Wood capably carries off Frodo's transition from boy to man, his is not the most indelible performance.Gollum, voiced by and physically patterned after the movements of British actor Andy Serkis, is the most realistic other-worldly character since E.T. and similarly will remain etched in moviegoers' collective memories.Ian McKellen's Gandalf has a larger role in the third film, morphing from wizard/prophet to army general, and one cannot imagine the role played by anyone else. Viggo Mortensen's principled Aragorn is the king to whom the third film's title refers.A key character is the landscape of Middle-earth. The movies feel mythical but look historical. In the third installment, for example, Minas Tirith, a seven-tiered city of kings, looks European, Byzantine and fantastical at the same time.There is a bittersweet quality in the trilogy's coming to an end  even if The Return of the King seems ready to conclude at least three times before the movie finally comes to a rather anticlimactic close. Many moviegoers, like Jackson and the cast  who grew quite close during filming  may understand, and even appreciate, the lingering goodbye. And while scores of film goers clamor to see the final installment, no one is eager for the journey to end.Jackson's masterpiece will no doubt have a long life on DVD and be the subject of countless revivals over the years. The director's next project is a remake of King Kong, which seems a bit like hiring Michelangelo to paint an office building. Though if anyone can make something out of that tired vehicle, Jackson can.Should Jackson sign on to make The Hobbit, the Rings finale might feel more like a temporary ""till we meet again"" than a formal goodbye.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

What can I say? The conclusion to perhaps the best trilogy of movies ever made!,"Well, let me start by saying,I may be biased, because I truly believe the LOTR films are definitely a very strong contender for the best trilogy of films ever made! I have to revisit them and binge watch the extended editions of these three films over a weekend, at least once a year! While The Two Towers is likely my personal favorite of the three films, if I am being 100% honest, the ROTK is likely the most well made of the three films and it shows in the breathtaking beauty of this film! Even in 2022 this film still holds up extremely well. And it is such a satisfying end to this trilogy, I was not left wanting anything, or feeling the producers or film makers missed the mark on virtually anything. It is hard to nitpick or fault this film. The first time I saw it, perhaps my one nit pick, was it felt about 15 minutes too long on the extended edition. However, over the years as I have re watched it, it feels exactly as long as it needs to be and should be. And as I watch it and learn more every time about these films, it actually is about as close to a perfect 10 for a film as I have ever been! It truly is a beautiful spectacle to behold, even after all of these years!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"I liked this film all the way through, apart from the ending","I liked all of the Lord Of The Rings films, but this one has to have the best battle scenes in it though and the most stunning special effects in it. The acting was pretty good in the film, and Peter Jackson is a good director.As you may might have known the story carries on from The Two Towers. Frodo, Sam and Gollum are trying to get into Mordor and taking the ring into Mount Doom to destroy evil once and for all. While the others fight off the orcs and the other creatures to defend them.The only part of this film I didn't like, was the ending. It just dragged and dragged for ages. I know that's probably how it ends in the book but come on!. Did the ending have to be 25 minutes long?. It could have easily been shortened down to 10 minutes.Overall, I do think that this film is a very good action/adventure film but it could have got a better score if the ending was a lot shorter.I would give this film a rating of 8/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A poor adaptation,"How can anyone who has read the books think this is a good adaptation? The liberties taken with the story were almost forgivable in the previous two movies, but The Return of the King is just hogwash in my view.

"Awesome movie, hugely overrated","This truly was the epic trilogy of our generation. It was done perfectly and will have a nice little slice of film history to go along with it. I have one gripe about this movie, It's high rating. Sure, this was a good film that brought the story to a completely satisfying end while still making the audience want more when the credits rolled. It was a good movie.But to say that something like this is even able to compete with such films as Pulp Fiction, Psycho, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, or even the original Star Wars, then you are gravely mistaken.This was a good movie to watch, and definitely defines the term epic. I do believe, however that people rank this film too high. It's not even close to the greatness of any of the aforementioned films or even Fight Club or Dr. Strangelove.

"Spectacular, More spectacular, Most spectacular","In 2022 my plan was to review both the ""Lord of the Ring"" trilogy of Peter Jackson (2001 - 2003) and the two ""Nibelungen"" movies of Fritz Lang (1924), the reason being that both are ultimately based on the German ""Song of the Nibelungs"" and / or the Scandinavian ""Völsunga saga"". The ""Lord of the Ring"" novel by Tolkien (Jackson) and the Nibelungen opera-cycle by Wagner (Lang) functioned to a greater or lesser extent as an intermediate station with respect to these adaptations.As if they had heard about my plan, right at the start of 2022 Dutch television broadcasted al three episodes of the ""Lord of the Ring"". You can only admire the courage of Peter Jackson, because he was taking an enormous risk. How to involve all those that had not read the book in this labyrinthine story without rousing the indignation of those that had read the book (and often loved it) about leaving out too much detail?Jackson proved to be up to the task in a marvelous manner and brought the fantasy genre to the next level. Twenty years ago the computer generated images (cgi) used by Jackson were nothing less than revolutionary.In his review Roger Ebert remarked that in comparison with the novel the ""sword and sorcery"" element in the movie was emphasized too much. It was too much of ""The adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938, Michael Curtiz & William Keighley) and too little of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming). To translate this remark to the actual characters of the story. In the novel the Hobbits are realy the central characters while in the movie they are the weak spot of the group that have to be defended (in flashy action sequences of course) by the other members of the fellowship.There is a grain of truth in this comment. On the other hand, if you invest heavily in cgi and takes the fantasy genre to the next lever (as stated earlier in this review) you want some action in return, don't you?I called the story labyrinthine and indeed there are many species and races involved. The essence of the story is however rather clear.It is a story about the struggle between good and evil.The forces of the good (Hobbits, Elves, Dwars, Men) cooperate in a fellowship and are learning to appreciate each other more and more as the story unfolds.The evil as represented by the ring (lust for power) is not limited to certain characters. Anyone can in principle be infected by it. In effect there are characters that are evil in the trilogy, but had been good in earlier era's of the Tolkien story (not covered by the Jackson trilogy).""The return of the King"" is the last episode of the Ring trilogy. It is amazing that after the first two episodes Jackson is still capable of surprising his spectators. The battle at Pelennor fields in ""The return of the King"" surpasses the battle at Helm's deep in ""The two towers"", which was already taking your breath away.In the general remarks about the trilogy as a whole I defended the balance that Jackson has kept between action scenes and the Tolkien story. This does however not apply to the bombastic speeches preceding the action scenes, that irritated me more and more.Also in the general remarks I praised the computer generated images (CGI) that were state of the art at the time of release. In the scene in ""The return of the King"" in which Gandalf enters the city of Minas Tirith for the first time it striked me how well these cgi were integrated in and synchronised with the life action.While Frodo was the lead character in the first episode and Aragorn in the second, in the final episode the two lead characters were well matched. An improvement! On the other hand the character of Smeagol / Gollem is less interesting in ""The return of the King"" because his good (Smeagol) side is nearly non existent and he becomes the rather unidimensional bad Gollem.In ""The fellowship of the Ring"" Aragorn has a romance with the elf Arwen. In ""The two towers"" Eowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan, feels attracted to Aragorn. Because you expect that the battle against the evil Sauron ultimately will be won by the good forces, the big question becomes which of these two romances shall eventually come to fruition? Jackson answers this question, but in my opinion quite in a rushed way. Especially the story of Eowyn is rushed, but maybe this is less so in the extended edition of the film.Talking about Eowyn, in a MacBeth like scene she kills the Witch King of Angman, who imagined himself save on the battle field because he could not be killed by a man (just like MacBeth feels safe because no man born of woman can kill him).One of my favourite scenes towards the end is the scene in wich the Hobbits are back in the Shire, having a pint in a pub. This is the kind of life they have been fighting for, but after all they have gone through they are no longer capable of enjoying it. This realy is a scene in the spirit of Tolkien, who fought in the First World War and was of the opinion that in a war there is no winner and only losers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Long, but spectacularly done","(this review was written by a non-die-hard fan of the series.)The final segment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy was spectacular, as the acting, directing and visual effects were all awesome! One aspect I couldn't stand in the books was it's length and tendency to drag on, along with its anti-climactic ending. The movie, unfortunately (in my opinion) kept that original feel of the novel. I thought a good 40 minutes, at least, could have been edited out, to make for a more captivating movie experience (the last 20 minutes could have easily been taken out, unmissed!). Just because Tolkien had it that way, does not mean it was perfect! I also thought there was too much sappiness - everybody was crying over everything! There was no machismo or stoicism amongst the hobbit heros. I didn't like that feature either.I realize the above complaints will not be accepted by Tolkien fans, as they wanted the movies to be exactly like the books. I think that's foolish, as one could put down a book to continue some other time, while if one were to get up and leave a movie theater... A movie is a different medium, and the story is meant to be conveyed accordingly - 3 and half hour movies make my butt sore!!The visuals were all spectacular, with far-shot epic battle sequence and a flawless blend of CG and live-action - it put the Matrix trilogy to shame with the amount of shots that were inconspicuously CG!!Overall, I really did enjoy the movie, but for those of you who would rather not sit through the whole thing, leaving exactly 20 minutes early (the whole thing is 3 hours and 20 minutes long) would be perfect - nothing really happens then anyway, trust me.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Extended Edition is definitive,"Return of the King, Extended Edition, is a decent improvement on the theatrical release, except for a couple of small mis-steps.The EE improves the flow of the story immensely, succinctly explaining a lot of points that before seemed a little arbitrary. It extends some crucial parts of the movie to greatly improve the sense of time passing, such as Frodo and Sam crossing Mordor. It includes the much-missed conclusion to Saruman and Wormtongue's story - not in the same style as the book, which depended on the unfilmed (and unfilmable) Scouring of the Shire, but in an appropriate way that stays true to the spirit of the book. (In fact this scene is a good example of the very effective way that the writers collapsed multiple book scenes into one movie scene. Kudos.)The extended cut also gives a lot more personality and interest to some characters; notably Denethor, Steward of Gondor, but others as well. The battles feel more grueling due to subtle extensions here and there.It's still not quite perfect; I still think the role of the dead army was too much, detracting from the efforts of the living warriors. This was probably not easily correctable in the EE, since it would have meant filming some quite substantial additional battle scenes, and further the writers had clearly made a decision to go away from the book version here. Still, I would like to see that improved somehow.The Paths of the Dead itself is extended, but most of this is unnecessary and frankly cheap. Looking back now, the theatrical edition is much superior both for suspense and lack of cheese. I would rather have seen the spooky and sad scene with Bregor's (?) skeleton lying at a the sealed door of some unknown chamber. And if I'm getting fussy, a bit more actual darkness would be nice!There are other niggles, but they decrease in importance and probably only reflect my opinions and personal vision of LotR.In terms of story balance, the EE of RotK was what should have been originally released to theatres. Unfortunately, this would have been impossible as it is an hour longer, and many casual viewers already found it much too long.In any case, the final Extended Edition of Return of the King is absolutely stunning. Where I had previously felt the movie strayed a little too far into traditional ""Hollywood blockbuster"" territory, the EE now feels balanced, complete, and above all moving and true to the spirit of the book. I thank Mr Jackson, New Line Cinema, JRR Tolkien and everyone else who contributed.For myself, this is the best series of films ever made, and I am quite happy to call Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King a masterpiece, as is the book it was based upon. Film and book snobs be damned, this is an amazing movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Too much of most of it,"I have the impression the LOTR trilogy is in the same category as Matrix and others like them. A first movie is made to set a standard, but subsequent movies are not able to live up to the first. Such was my impressions from watching this third installment of the LOTR trilogy.I really wanted to like this movie. This was when all would come to an end. When the story would be wrapped up, and all come to a conclusion. For me, this movie missed its mark with a couple of yards. But wait, there are nice things to say too. The scenery was good, and nature gave an overall impression of vastness and divergence of a country in turmoil. From the green fiends of Shire to the dark lands of Mordor.From there things started to go downhill. I have seen plenty of movies being able to tell twice the amount of feeling in merely half the time of LOTR. The pacing is uneven, and many many loose ends hang from the story. No, I do not want to wait for the four hour plus DVD edition to see what becomes of i.e Saruman, I wanted to see conclusions, but in many cases all I get is a bunch of question marks.All I can say about the acting was that it was meager, hidden behind layers upon layers of CGI. Today I hear people hail the detailing of Gollum as the best CGI ever, and he is quite impressive, but nevertheless obviously computer made. If not for the voicing of Serkins, Gollum would be long forgotten in a couple of weeks.The CGI way too often shades the underdevelopment of the story. For example, when the heat of the battle actually gets tense and interesting, and when we see reinforcements come to aid in still hopelessly outnumbered forces, all of a sudden the tension is gone. It is all wrapped up in the same way the battle of Helms Deep in The Two Towers, leaving me only with a ""Hey, what happened!?"". CGI can enhance elements in a movie, but it can never be all there is, as it does in the LOTR trilogy, escalating by each movie.Characters are quite two dimensional. No development takes place, and treating the royal son of Glóin as a slapstick-one-liner-sidekick only serves to disappoint me.Best movie ever? Well, no! It is an Ok action flick, but with better pacing, better acting, and better story telling, this could have been THE movie. As for epic battles, I would prefer Spartacus anytime, without even a touch of CGI, but still extremely tense and impressive.I feel robbed of an experience. In my book, this gets a 5 out of 10. In visuals it is astounding. In everything else it falls rather short of lots of other movies. Too bad. I really wanted to like this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It's overrated,"I think that this movie is overrated, it's a great movie, clearly worth seeing, but it's overrated, to ment people hasn't read the book by J. R. R. Tolkin and so they think that the end of the story is like it is the movie, but really there are missing about one hundred page from the book, that in the book are some of the best part I think, when they return to the shier and finds Salomon how has ""destroid"" the peace in the shier, it's a great part of the book, and it isn't in the movie. In the movie they are just retuning to the peaceful shier they leaf, and Tolkin is in the book trying to say (after my opinion)that there personalty chanced a lot, and also did the world around them, so he tried to say that, you aren't the only thing that chance in your life. So I think that Tolkin is turning in his grave. Not that Peter Jackson didn't make a great movie that will go over in history as one of the best, I just think he leaf out a very important part of the story. I gave it an 8, I think it's fair.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Lord of Many Endings,"Don't get me wrong, these movies are very well made. It's amazing that these books were actually made into films in the first place. It takes a lot of vision to accomplish that. However, as a film or even a trilogy, there are several fallbacks. Firstly, there is a lot of unneeded dialogue. Secondly, after the audience waits for the climax and then the rundown at the end of the film, the movie doesn't end. It feels it needs to tie up loose ends that most audience members won't see, such as what happens to Bilbo. All in all, the vision deserved the Academy Award, although as always, there is room for improvement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A few things overlooked,"Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there.As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow.The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book.So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Good, but not something I would want to see again","This movie was extremely entertained and well, filmed, my only complaint was that the ending kept ending, then starting, then ending.

Some scenes seem to go on forever, but at least it does not suffer The Two Tower's problem of having half the movie be entertaining and the other half necessary drudgery. Still, better editing would have helped step up the pacing a bit, and the filming for close quarters was poorly done, with far too much shaking around and closeups of random bits of steel.

Battle scenes beyond compare... but not the best film ever made,"The battle scene for Minas Tirith is unquestionably, no matter what one thinks of the film or indeed the trilogy, one of the greatest ever committed to film (or digital) in terms of scale, realisation and tension. For the second hour of ROTK my jaw dropped as Peter Jackson's vision was realised in a field battle of awesome scale and terrific tension.But (currently) the 4th best film ever made? In a poll that has Godfather at 1 and Shawshank and 2 who really cares, except that it's not. Too many characters, too little explanation - as at least one reviewer has commented, the director has, if anything, not been ruthless enough with Tolkien. Denethor is the worst example, a pointlessly depressive king - but by no means the only one. Poor Liv Tyler has to manage Arwen through 3 films, for barely a snog at the end (not even THE end, just one of 10 in the last half hour that were badly paced).The dialogue was cloying and soap-operatic at worst. I lost count of the number of times someone cried out ""FRODO!!!"" - who in himself became a whining, annoying character, unlike the book.A great cinematic achievement in many ways, primarily for Minas Tirith. And a great night out. But hey, so was ""Attack of the Clones"". Or ""Die Hard"". In 10 years I do hope not to see the 3 LOTR films in the IMDb top 10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The end is bitter sweet,"I have never loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I considered them nothing more than a fine fantasy story, with its smart and silly characteristics, too long and seriously overrated. The fact that these films were thoroughly enjoyed by loads of people I can comprehend easily: the movie's theme appeals to all and I can not deny that it is nicely all nicely put together. But it is still far too long as it lacks a certain...intelligence. Coming to the third installment, I sit and stare. Making fun of a movie is quite easy, what's hard is to understand it. I am not trying to say that this here film has left a mark upon me, but merely that some people are wrong and that I may be as well.SpoilersIt's got some strong points, it's got some weak points and overall it's just what I expected it to be. After a rather pathetic beginning, the movie gets off from where the previous one let us. War, freedom, good and evil, love, trust, friendship, maturity, justice and peace. That's what will concern you once you're in this joint. Some impressive scenes, with sparkles of humor and shallow morality will add up into a massive fight. It's never about the outcome, it's about the way you do it, so I will accept the more shameful moments regarding the story. I might say I would want to admire it all, but it's just too much of a contrast between dark and bright. That's all in this movie but not in our hearts or in our world. Are the characters really complex? Is anyone really worth remembering? They are all weak faced with the power of the ring and none impress in this regard. I try to think of a weakness for us all and I can't find it. This fantasy world is supposed to have one evil which really concerns us, with minor ""misunderstandings"" between people. It's a call for unity, because only through this can we be able to outlive a fight. I fear just that I can not relate to it. I see no war for a common goal. And the problem does not lie around us, it lies within us. We can't find a ring and make all problems disappear after a tremendous quest. That's what makes me feel that The Lord of the Rings is just a story. A long, sporadically remarkable story. But I live in an era of naturalism and realism and I can not accept such a piece of art, as it is, just for the sake of being. I simply can't feel this as a great movie, because so many fates are involved and everything is too perfect. Perfection is bitter sweet, not this film. For me, LoTR is just bitter. But at least not as bitter as the Matrix.Fans will remain fans, detractors will remain detractors. Things don't usually change in life and for that you need to make a great effort. Linear and coherent storytelling adds up in a never ending experience. For most, I am somewhat convinced to say, a superb one. In my heart I feel both joy and pain, because it all means something. The fact that people dream of such a fantasy world, means something. This is not my fantasy world though. This is not my world. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Worst of the three,"As with the other two films in the series I wonder if the director actually read the book or just had a secretary read bits of it to him.The scenes are drawn out to ridiculously tedious lengths and bits of the plot are missed out whilst other bits are invented. And of course to appeal to the ""ER"" watching mentality a romance was invented for the film. Then to add further insult they all burst into song at the end.I don't know if these films were made chronologically but the actors do seem a bit fed up of the characters by the end. Also, our Shelob was so obviously a computer animation it made the pseudo scary build up a complete anticlimax.Tedious.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Superelf to the rescue...,"I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot.

The perfect ending,"I hardly have the words to describe how satisfied I am with the entire extended versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Let me say though that after the second improved so VASTLY on the movie version of the Two Towers I was confident that LotR3 would also be vastly improved from an already fantastic final movie - and it was! I forgive Jackson & co. for cutting Saruman and the final Shire-part out of the script as it is a side story basically that does not directly add to the main story, which is Frodo's journey to mount Doom and the fight to save Middle Earth.Admittedly though, it would have been wonderful to see it, if for no other reason than to extend the amount of time you can sit and watch these movies. Personally I wouldn't mind Jackson adding hours to it.Let's all hope he gets off his ass now and films The Hobbit asap (while Ian Mackellen is still alive and kicking at least, and perhaps Ian Holmes could take on the part of the much younger Bilbo? who knows).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Stunning & Inspiring series, & What a Way to End!","I used to hate fantasy & sci-fi, especially Lord of the Rings. Of course, at that time I'd only seen the first film and barely payed attention to it, passing it off as rubbish.However, I'm a huge film buff. So, my friends and I decided to start having Movie Nights every week. One of them brought 'The Two Towers' over & I figured, I'd give a shot to actually sit down and watch one of these films seriously. Well, after it was over, I was amazed. I couldn't believe that I had shrugged off such a fine piece of cinema for as long as I did! Then, I got to see Return of the King, excited to see another good movie come out. My jaw dropped when I first saw it. Never before had I seen such fine use of computer technology & live action together in a film. It was so believable, so REAL. The scene with the Paths of the Dead absolutely blew my mind. It's probably one of the most visually stunning scenes of the 21st Century. The costuming, the sets, the entire WORLD created in this film out of pure love & passion for a man's novel is just inspiring. Now, I've read the books and have to say that yes there are differences. However, the films capture the spirits of the characters and hearts of the stories immaculately. I do believe it would bring a tear to Mr. Tolkien's eye if he were alive to see it.Ian McKellen as Gandalf is now one of my favorite performances of all time. Another stellar performance is by Bernard Hill as King Theoden. Most people in the film give their all & it shines; there is nothing lackluster here! My biggest props to the set/costume & technical designers. These people have officially raised the bar for the future of film-making.Just a note to the doubters of the film: you will not be disappointed, but truly blown away. The Return of the King is the greatest of the the three, using cinematography & computer technology together like never before. However, this is done so seamlessly that you might miss it the first time around. A film worth watching a thousand times, I still get goosebumps during most scenes, & of course I recommend the Extended Edition just for the extended Paths of the Dead scene-- it's fantastic! 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

EPIC,"The best movie of the trilogy and one of the best movies in the history of cinema.At last the full arc is visible, and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy comes into final focus. I admire it more as a whole than in its parts. The second film was inconclusive, and lost its way in the midst of spectacle. But ""Return of the King"" dispatches its characters to their destinies with a grand and eloquent confidence. This is the best of the three, redeems the earlier meandering, and certifies the ""Ring"" trilogy as a work of bold ambition at a time of cinematic timidity.That it falls a little shy of greatness is perhaps inevitable. The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece. It is a melancholy fact that while the visionaries of a generation ago, like Coppola with ""Apocalypse Now,"" tried frankly to make films of great consequence, an equally ambitious director like Peter Jackson is aiming more for popular success. The epic fantasy has displaced real contemporary concerns, and audiences are much more interested in Middle Earth than in the world they inhabit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"good, but definitely not deserving of #4 of all time","A movie shouldn't be elevated beyond it's true value simply because of special effects.  All three movies had exceptional special effects.  They were amazing.  The realism is unbelievable.  However, superfluous additions to, and needless omissions from, the original story, along with quite a bit of over-the-top acting are certainly enough to move it quite a ways down the list.  This movie is not better than Schindler's List.  It's not better than The Usual Suspects.  It's not better than many of the movies it's currently beating in the top 250.  This film is currently rated higher than The Seven Samurai -and- Citizen Kane.

About the length of the endings...,"Why is this the most common complaint about this film?  I honestly don't get it.  First of all, I take it all of us here (or a majority of us) prefer the extended dvd versions of the first two films to their theatrical counterparts.  Also, these aren't short movies anyway (208 mins, 223 mins, 210mins), and yet we still can't seem to get enough of them.  So what's the big deal about these LAST 20 MINUTES?!  Peter Jackson had you captivated for 621 but you just couldn't take 20 more?  Come on, people!  You can't just wrap up something that monumental without giving the audience a gradual wrap up that is to scale with what came before it.  Once the extended edition of ROTK is released and we all sit down to the inevitable marathon viewing of the entire trilogy as the single epic that it is, I think 20 minutes is going to seem like a pretty scant wrap-up in the grand scheme of things. So if anyone is going to criticize the movie on this point, please try and take that into account.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson's odyssey comes to a welcomed conclusion,"The ring is destroyed!  Middle Earth is saved!  Hobbits and Elves rejoice!Peter Jackson's masterful odyssey that began 11 years ago is complete with the release of the third installment of the Lord of the Rings, Return of the King (ROTK).Peter Jackson's love affair with the J.R.R. Tolkien story is complete with the third film installment, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (ROTK). Audiences have waited through three years of release dates, countless DVD editions and marketing tie-ins to view what is essentially one long 11+ hour movie.  And at the end of it all, I too found myself rejoicing - rejoicing that the third movie finally ended!Lord of the Rings: ROTK is both good and bad with the good being exceptional, but the bad, being prominent enough not to be overlooked. First the good.  Ian McKellan as the wise wizard Gandalf is the best he has been in ROTK.  Gandalf transformed from being a new generation's Obi Wan Kenobi - as all wise and more powerful after death -  to being a vulnerable participant in a future unknown.  A scene shared with Viggo Mortensen's Aragon shows Gandalf to be scared for Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Aragon must reassure him to follow his heart.  This is Ian McKellan at his best and if he was good enough to garnish an Oscar nomination for the first Lord of the Rings, then he should be assured one with ROTK.Also showing more acting range that was expected of him is Sean Astin in the role as Sam, the Hobbit that accompanies Frodo on his journey to Mount Doom. Sean shows courage, heart and conflict and we believe in the conviction that the young actor put into his role.Also on the plus side are the fight scenes in ROTK.  The great battles in the Pelennor Fields, Minas Tirith and the Black Gates are speckled with special effects mastery never before seen on the big screen.  Kudos also to Mr. Jackson for the amount of humor that was absent from the previous two installments.  Seeing Gandalf react to an overeager Pippin (played by Billy Boyd) put the audience into an outburst of laughter - a response not yet heard in the first 9 hours of storytelling.And finally, and most importantly, the story receives note for being the strongest of the three.  With many balls in the air to juggle, Peter Jackson weaves the story through Frodo's trek to Mount Doom with the ever-schizophrenic Gollum, Aragon's journey to regain the throne and Rohan's King Theoden search for an army to wrestle the evil Orcs just to name a few. All stories are equally interesting and Jackson is able to stay true to the novel in bringing the story to the masses.But not all is good with ROTK.  The special effects in the final film are average, that being, not on scale with what was presented in 2001 and 2002. Some effects actually look terrible.  The scene where Legolas (Orlando Bloom) is able to get atop a giant elephant looked cheap and unrealistic, and his subsequent dismount which was suppose to appeal to the skateboarders in the audience looked like the promo for some average Sony Playstation game.  And Aragon's confrontation with the ghosts of a disgraced army looked like it was cut and paste from Jackson's previous film, The Frighteners.Also notable was the amount of blue screen images used in the finale. Aragon in front of the army at the Black Gates or Frodo's gaze into the fires of Mount Doom looked terrible when compared to some of the film's other effect achievements.Then there is the ending.  All of them!  In a DVD world where extended versions are widely accepted as superior to the original cut, I would have enjoyed ROTK more had the last 30 minutes be struck from the record. After sitting through 3 hours, I had run out of popcorn and was restlessly waiting to use the restroom, but Peter Jackson marched each of his characters out for a curtain call of hugging, bowing, kissing and crying that I thought was completely unnecessary (Do we really need to see Sam get married?).However, for all its faults, ROTK is intended as one long film adventure and at that, it is exceptional.  Peter Jackson had an incredible undertaking in front of him, and unlike the Star Wars or Matrix franchises, The Lord of the Rings was able to maintain a constant tone and feel through its multiple components.  For that alone, I take my hat off and salute you.So it is finally time to take a breath.  Or is it? Next year there will be the DVD release of Return of the King followed by the theatrical extended version, then the DVD extended version, then the DVD box set, then the DVD box set with all the extended features.  Maybe if we are lucky, someone will rifle through the old house of J.R.R. Tolkien and find the unpublished works of Sam the Hobbit:Journey to Neverland Ranch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An Overrated Epic,"The Oscar big pay off was, I thought, nothing but a pity courtesy hand clap, while they left the way-better deserving Mystic River in the dust. It's hard to deny the great panorama the movie generated, the 1000 minute-long battle scene, the over sized elephants. but the cliché, flat dialogs that should be the spine of the movie, turned out to be an arthritis, that made me, as an audience, gasped and itched like I just saw one of those lifetime-channel original movie. There was no real great dramatic acting, all actors seem weary and only put on one emotion, and unlike the excellent first part of LOTR, where they have frodo, an average-joe hobbit turned into the ultimate ring bearer, puzzled and over bared by this new-found strenuous job he now has, the drama is alive by other characters struggle to convince frodo and themselves to defeat their own fear to fight for humanity.

Every sweeping action shot, every camera pan is executed flawlessly, making this entire film a joy to watch from start to finish every time.Ian Mckellen is the star performer as Gandalf, as his command of the men of Gondor easily makes up for the fact that he's not actually much of a wizard. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin pull out all the stops to give a fantastic performance for the ending to a fantastic set of films. Hats off too to Andy Serkis as Gollum, with near perfect voice acting.The battle scenes have been copied many a time since, but the original is still the best. Peter Jackson proves that artistic license can be good, as the changes made are mostly for the better.Overall this is the pinnacle of film-making, with Jackson creating what Tolkien himself described as the ""unfilmable"" book.

Good film. But top 10? Nah.,"I really enjoyed Return of the King - just like the previous two films. They were fantastic epics, with some great battle scenes, some lovely ""epic"" acting. But I can't help the feeling the hype has wrecked it a little.In my opinion, it is not the best film ever, nor the third, or the fiftieth. I have seen better epics - ones that didn't need to use CGI (Lawerence Of Arabia). I have seen better battle scenes and action scenes (Braveheart, Last Samurai, Matrix 1). Return of the King is great - just not as good as some people like to believe.It looks fantastic. The design is second to none, and the epic feeling is captured so well on the battle field. Acting from everyone is fantastic - Mckellen and Viggo being standouts, as well as Sean Astin. And, damn, has this film got some great set pieces (Pelannor fields!).But what wrecked this film? The editing. I know some purists loved the ending - but it ended about (checks his notebook) four times. It faded to black - BUT WAIT - it's starting again! Really, Jackson could've cut this down. It made the film over-wrougt to the point of screaming.All in all, a great film, one of the best ever - just not top 10 worthy! It has great production value, Jackson is talented for doing all three in a row - and everyone involved should be proud they've been in such a film.

awards winning epic,"Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor.

Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven.

"Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!","I have seen this movie more than three times and it never gets boring to me! I just love it!

In my opinion, the extended/special addition is better as it gives more outline to the story. Storyline rules as usual and the directing is good. But I particularly like the scenes where they battle at Minas Tirith because it is a very climatic area of the movie. Of course, there are scenes that don't make sense sometimes but no movie is perfect and this one is the closest to perfect I've ever seen!Overall, I'd watch this one if I were you.

Perfect,"I just finished watching this trilogy for the second time and was just as moved as the first time I saw it. Cinema with sound has been around now for nearly 80 years and this is the very first TRUE masterpiece. It took THAT long. Sure, other movies have been branded ""masterpiece"", but Peter Jackson has redefined what a masterpiece really is. After seeing this trilogy, I will never look upon movies in the same way again. There's no reason why every movie can't be of this quality. It just goes to show that some of the most creative minds in the world don't necessarily hail from out of the Hollwood movie making machine. Peter Jackson not only isn't an American, he never even went to movie making school. If someone who's never set foot in a movie making school (let alone barely set foot in the United States) can make a movie of this caliber, than that ought to say something about these ""schools"" and the Hollwood movie making machine.

Middle of the road.,"This film was compelling - it kept you watching. The spectacular backgrounds and both strange and interesting characters are all attractions. But the storyline is basically rubbish. I haven't read the books myself, but can only imagine them to be terrible as the story by itself is poor, and only works with the images to support it. This story is fantasy that isn't quite convincing. I didn't feel that you got to know the characters at all which made you feel distant from what was happening. I'm not a particular fan of this genre, but it can be effective if it convinces you that you are there and that it is real. I would watch this film, purely as something to fill a couple of hours. Long movies are always hard to keep at a good standard the whole way through and often drop down in your ratings, within the last half hour.

"A hugely satisfying movie, but the greatest? come on","As a HUGE fan of the books of JRR Tolkien (IMHO some of the best pieces of literature to grace the world), I was immensely satisfied by the LotR trilogy in general as well as with the finale (Return of the King). It was a journey to Middle-Earth that lasted three years and now that's over I have to say I'm a little sad :(However, as much as I enjoyed the trilogy, I will NOT fall into the trap of irresponsibly naming this ""the greatest movie ever"", as many other have done. Come on people, you truly believe that ROTK is better than Citizen kane, Casablanca or Gone with the Wind? Why is that? Cause it has awesome effects and large battles?There was a time when I truly believed that if some brillant director (like Oliver Stone) filmed LotR and sticked to the book, making only the changes he had to while remaining TRUE to its spirit, the LotR trilogy could be in fact the greatest movies ever cause the background and story between them are simply legendary and classic. As it is however, Peter Jackson didn't avoid falling into the trap of commercialism, introducing cheesy or cheap scenes where he shouldn't. You know what I'm talking about... Legolas shieldboarding Helms Deep like a power ranger... how can a movie with an elven power ranger be the greatest? Batallions of elves showing up on Helms Deep to fight along with the Rohirrim, negating everything Tolkien had thought about the retreat of the elves and the age of men. Faramir and Theoden protrayed as weak and selfish, instead of the noble characters they were. Etc, etc.I did enjoy all the films as much as I could, despite being a little annoyed by the liberties the director and/or scriptwriters took with the books, liberties that were at times excessive.I think I can count the trilogy as one of my ten favourite films (since it's essentially one large film rather than three), but certainly not the GREATEST film ever made.

Such a disappointing journey,"Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
stunning.,"saw it. loved it... ditto to the rest of the comments. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King--is God in movie land.

Space and time is over, ladies and gentlemen... get ready for arrows, swords, battles, love stories galore! This is one of those films that comes only once a blue moon and it is indeed a joy to see it in our lifetime.So sit back, enjoy and come to realize that this film is for the truly dedicated...you can't handle 3 hours? well then, the exit is to your left. sorry you're missing out.

Probably the best movie (trilogy) ever made.,"Top level writing, acting and dialogue.Don't expect anything like this in our lifetime.Maybe when we will have advanced-A. I. making movies we will get something as brilliant, but I doubt we will be alive to see that.10/10, no hesitation.While it does not fully respect Tolkein's writings, to the letter,it respects the spirit of if writings perfectly.It is made with the uttermost respect for Tolkein, his writings and the European Culture it is based on.The CGI is better than what you see in 2022 movies.The action scenes are very coherent, generally avoid being over the top and even when they're a bit cheesy, they're cheesy in a good-way.It's one of those movies you wish you could wipe your memory so you could see it again but you can't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Perfect Conclusion to a Perfect Trilogy,"A perfect end to a perfect trilogy, Return of the King left me in awe, sadness, joy, and every emotion in between. Even with a 4 and a half hour watch with the extended edition, there's so much to enjoy, just like the other two. The battles are epic, never missing suspense or a feeling of power. The romance is sweet and warm. The dialogue is smooth and empowering. From start to finish, you're so on the edge of your seat, waiting for the final scene, and enjoying every minute on the way. The continuation of the epic pull between good and evil is ever present. And the end is so emotional and sad, but rewarding nonetheless.

Utterly fantastic!!!!,"This movie has to be the best ever film made out of Hollywood. Not many people at the start of this trilogy of films would believe it was made in Wellington, New Zealand.Peter Jackson, a kiwi himself, has made many movies in his time and with the help of the cast and crew, has made this his most popular and successful one yet. He knew the book and is a huge fan of Tolkien's work, so this film was going to be a handful filled with so much action and battle, but I feel he has made one great job, and has proved that some things aren't impossible.Unfortunately, I haven't read the books myself, so I don't know what has been missed out or added to make this movie. But from what I have heard from fans of the books, its not a bad copy.""The Return of the King"" has got to be my favourite out of them all, for the fact it has everything- action, romance and every now and then a bit of comedy.Jackson must have thought hard about who was going to play what part and how he wanted it played, and I cannot see any other actors in the roles- they are PERFECT!All that's left to say is that these films are the best made ever!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A great film, but something is not quite right","The final episode of Peter Jackson's telling of the JRR Tolkien classic comes to screen.Return of the King is the big wrap-up to this landmark project. The filmmakers have done an excellent job bringing this ""unfilmable"" project to screen. As always, they deserve kudos for such a beautifully crafter work. From the set designs to the costumes to the scenery, the CGI, special effects, sound, all of these elements are Oscar-worthy and far surpass anything ever shown on screen.The performances, too, are stellar. Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Andy Serkis are all excellent. Even the supporting cast gives it their all. It is a shame Christopher Lee didn't make the final cut, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.Even with all these kudos, this film still has problems.The sequence with the Palantir in Edoras is very silly, I have heard others call it the ""Glowing Bowling Ball of Doom"". Rather sloppy for the quality the filmmakers have shown to date. And the ghost army is way too ... phosphorous and Disney-like.But beyond various technical flaws, the real problem is both the rush to the ending, and the drawn-out portion after the ending. For the former, we have the tense lead-up to the great Battle of the Pellenor Fields, which by itself is unlike anything ever put on film before. We have Frodo and Sam facing great dangers all by themselves. Then, suddenly, Frodo and Sam are back on track, the battle is over, and we rush right along to the climax of the film. That whole portion is simply rushed right along.So then we have the Big Finale ... and fifteen more minutes of movie (at least). Depending on how you count, there are five or six endings of the film. Here, unlike anywhere else, the writers have actually been too faithful to JRR Tolkien. His books also end (or not) in this fashion, and that is acceptable in a book, but not in a movie. The multiple endings simply drag us along to collapse. PJ should have kept some of that footage for a future DVD release.Even with these flaws, I have a hard time grading this movie poorly. I am, after all, a huge fan of LOTR and PJ. So I am cutting him some slack, and give the film 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Wonderful!,"I am so glad that Peter Jackson made these movies. I have read the books countless times, but to finally see them has been a dream come true. Thank you Peter Jackson! The actors were fantastic!! They were all so believable in their parts. I would not change any of them. Even though there were differences from the book, it did not matter one bit. I loved the extended versions of the movies. I would have liked to have seen them in the theater rather than having to wait a year for them to come out on DVD. Wow! I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. I laughed, I cried. I did not want the whole experience to end. I am so glad that special effects have come so far that Mr. Jackson was able to produce this epic. I hope he will make ""The Hobbit"".

The Very Definition of Perfection,"There is a point towards the end of THE RETURN OF THE KING in which Aragorn leads a contingent of warriors to the Black Gate of Mordor. Surrounded by thousands of Sauron's forces, he quietly looks at his troops and says, ""For Frodo.""And that is what the last chapter of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is truly about. As the hosts of Mordor launch an assault upon the last free city of Men -- Minas Tirith -- ringbearer Frodo moves ever closer to the peak of Mount Doom.Whereas THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was about friendship and compassion, and THE TWO TOWERS was an out-and-out war film, this final RINGS installment is a marriage of the two. Middle-earth is indeed at stake, but more importantly the lives of these characters we've grown to love are on the line.The story kicks into high-gear twenty minutes in, with mischievous Pippin stealing the palantir from a sleeping Gandalf. Looking into the Seeing Stone, Pippin sees a dead white tree amidst a city in flames. Gandalf sees this as a sign that Sauron is ready to launch a strike against Gondor's capital. Taking Pippin with him, he rushes to the White City in hope of counseling the present steward, Denethor.Denethor is the father of both Boromir, who perished in FELLOWSHIP, and Faramir, the Captain of Gondor who held Frodo and Sam prisoner for a time in TWO TOWERS. He is grieving the loss of one son, and disgusted with the other, for he has failed to hold the city of Osgiliath. Facing his father, Faramir asks if he wishes that his sons had switched places, and that he was dead and Boromir still lived. To this, Denethor coldly replies ""Yes"" and begins to eat his dinner, sending his son on a suicide charge to retake the city.With Osgiliath taken, the orcs have the ability to cross the River Anduin and make for Minas Tirith. Realizing that Denethor is lost, Gandalf convinces Pippin to light the Beacons of Gondor, which signals the need of aide to the likes of Rohan. Heeding the call, Theoden prepares to ride to Minas Tirith. But they are outnumbered, and Aragorn is advised by Elrond of Rivendell to travel the Paths of the Dead and seek fulfillment of a thousand-year oath to the King of Gondor.Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum move closer to Mordor, traveling through the emerald city of Minas Morgul. As they begin the climb up the long stair, they witness the march of an army: Sauron's forces, lead by the Witch King of Angmar, who also happens to be the Nazgul that stabbed Frodo in FELLOWSHIP.Making their way deep into Mordor, Frodo is betrayed, and finds himself alone in a dark lair -- home of the monstrous spider Shelob, portrayed as a wonderful Visual Effect by WETA Digital.In the two previous films, there have been several scenes that made my heart leap. RETURN OF THE KING has these as well, only tenfold in number. Director Peter Jackson clearly shows off the city of Minas Tirith, letting us see each level as Gandalf climbs higher and higher to see the steward. As this happened, a wide smile stretched across my face. There it was -- the White City.The scene that topped all others in this regard, however, involves Eowyn, niece of King Theoden. She is confronted by the dreaded Witch King. He utters `No mortal man can defeat me.' To this, she proudly removes her helm and replies, `I am no man!' Their battle is breathless and elicited quite a cheer from the audience I saw the film with.Some have criticized the ending(s), saying they are too numerous and run on too long. To this, I contend that they're wrapping up a 10-hour story, and the sense of closure is needed. Many mention overly long fades to black, tricking the audience into thinking the film is finished. In fact, there is only one fade to black, and the audience whom I was with seemed to love the last two segments most.Quite a few moments induce sobbing. As Gandalf puts it, ""Not all tears are evil."" Many of the final scenes will have your face running red, but others in the middle may bring upon the same response. Whether it be Gandalf explaining life after death to Pippin, or Denethor in a final moment finally appreciating Faramir, you'll be hard-pressed to find someone in the crowd who had dry eyes for the entire three hour, twenty minute runtime.So, what now? I dearly want the Extended Edition, and a film of Tolkien's original THE HOBBIT. But I'm very much content with what we have. THE RETURN OF THE KING is easily the best of the three, and a fine end to what very well may be the greatest trilogy in motion picture history.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What a load of rubbish!,"I thought LOTRs couldn't get any more drawn out, with pointless scenes, I was wrong! Plus, is Gandalf actually a wizard?

"Easily, one of the greatest film experiences you will ever have. Period.","With ""The Return of the King"", Peter Jackson's trilogy based on the works of Tolkien, come to a dramatic and climactic end. Throughout all of my movie going experiences, never have I ever wished a story to never end, but unfortunately, all stories do have a conclusion.The story, for those of you that have been sleeping these last few years, concentrates on Frodo and Sam's journey into the heart of Mordor to destroy the One Ring. While, in the meantime, Aragon, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, and the surviving members of the fellowship, prepare to do battle with the minions of Mordor.In retrospect, let me just say that this film has everything anyone can ever wish for in a movie! Action, adventure, romance, humour, mind-blowing special effects, a superb story, and characters that you actually care for. During this film, I think I experienced every feeling that we, as humans, can feel. Joy, sadness, excitement, awe, and obviously just being stunned and speechless. Peter Jackson did the impossible when he made this film, and I applaud him for his efforts, as he genuinely deserves all the credit he has received for this, and the previous two films.If there is one film that you MUST see, ""The Return of the King"" is definitely that one film. Run out and buy (don't rent) the extended version of this film, as this is the true vision. An utterly mind-blowing experience.

Beware of the corny ending,"So this is the end of the trilogy. For today's standards it is the apex of epic film making and audiovisual effects. Moreover it honestly tries to follow the plot of the books (but notice I'm referring solely to the plot). The Return Of The King is a movie you simply have to see for the sake of it. Now the bad part. It is unbelievably corny! Please, guys, why did you have to make the breakup of the Fellowship just a series of end-of-summer-camp goodbyes? No respect to the spirit of Tolkien, no inner meaning, no depth. This was completely unworthy of the rest of the effort and it spoiled it for me.

"""But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.""","I think the vast majority of people who have seen and love the LOTR trilogy fell in love with it from the get go with the 1st film TFOTR. I, however, wasn't so sure when I first saw the Fellowship. I enjoyed it, yes, but elements of that film left me somewhat disappointed and in particular my preconceived feeling of what its general tone would/should be like wasn't satisfied. Now, some years on, as the proud owner of the special extended edition dvds I can announce that the series has grown on me somewhat and I find all three movies an immensely satisfying experience to sit through.I could criticize the Return of the King in a nit-picking manner, it is far from perfect, but as we all know, nothing is perfect. What appeals to me most in this film is its beautiful nature, which will shine through for many years to come. And isn't the nature of things that which truly matters. Themetically strong, and new to the series, emotionally powerful, ROTK is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy. Never have I witnessed the theme of death dealt with in such a positive manner, which works for me, although it's true I'm not on my way to A&E as I write this.Congratulations to Mr Jackson and all involved in the making of this trilogy and the bringing to life of Middle Earth. Their efforts have produced something special.Lastly, although ROTK would narrowly miss out on my top 5, probably pushed out by Luke's Cool Hand (see what I did there?), I'm delighted to see it ranked #2 here on IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Well...it doesn't hold true for this one.Yes--the direction is good, the special effects still fantastic...but I was bored.  It had an air of ""been there--seen that"" about it.  I've seen these special effects, I've seen these creatures...there were no surprises.  And the story moves VERY slowly...much slower than the first two.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's trip to Mount Doom took FOREVER!  Also Viggo Mortensen (after giving a good performance in the second one) really was lousy this time around.  Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies were good but hardly in it.  The best acting was from Ian McKellan (a tower of strength as Gandalf) and Sean Astin as Sam.  Also it was good to see Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett back again...and I DID enjoy the battles somewhat...but I was continuously looking at my watch.  And the film has at least FIVE endings!Also the tone of this film was darker than the first two and this film is WAY too violent for a PG-13--this is an R rating all the way.I can only give this a 7.

"worst of the 3, and the stink of the first 2 rose pretty high","Obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel, but what's worse, a terrible movie.  Lacking flow, sense, linearity and dramatic impact, this played out like a highlights reel, not a coherent story.  The actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given, with some exceptions.  Peter Jackson's only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots, both of which are heartily abused.  And the special effects, for the most part, would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability. There were high points, but this was and is the first and only movie I have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the Eowyn-Nazgul scene.  A hollywood blockbuster?  No Doubt.  A good movie? Hell no.  Possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on?  The fact is, if this were based on real events, I don't think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names. Maybe that wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to hear about Jackson's love of the books, or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material.

The Best Trilogy Ever Conceived!,"After watching the three chapters of ""The Lord Of The Rings"", I'm able to say out loud that Peter Jackson has created one of the best productions in history. His talent and how he has involved crafting the 3 movies have erased any possible doubts about his directing skills. Because back 3 years ago, there were lots of criticisms about letting Mr. Jackson direct what was one of the most ambitious projects in the movie world. And they also criticized the casting of known actors as Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler...IMO, I'm sure nobody will surpass for a long time what LOTR has achieved as a trilogy. His conception was somehow brilliant and risky at the same time filming the whole trilogy in one year and a half, nonstop, in New Zealand, away (luckily) from the Hollywood influences. But Peter Jackson knew exactly what he had to do. He knew what New Zealand's landscape could offer to recreate the Middle Earth, he took the most outstanding and skillful crew to assure that the movies will make justice to Tolkien's novel and satisfy the fans. Nobody knows how much work the LOTR crew has done for the sake of the trilogy, but watching the films, you get the idea: you usually don't step into the cinema and watch a movie that is as detailed as the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Far away from being a Hollywood popcorn movie, all three movies evoke emotion, fear and worship.The first chapter, ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" was introductive, setting up the story and the characters. ""The Two Towers"" was the transition between the beginning of the novel and the epic end that was told in ""The Return Of The King"". The last chapter of the trilogy, IMO, is the best one, for so many reasons.First of all, it's the book that I enjoyed the most. So, I was willing to see several parts from the novel translated into eye-candy. Also it's the end, the conclusion, so it has to be huge and epic. I've been astonished by ""The Return Of The King"", the plot is brilliantly taken from the book, with several retouches for movie's sake. After watching the whole trilogy, you realize it was a good idea to leave the last TTT's chapters for the last movie. These changes are necessary for the movie, because being faithful to the book doesn't mean to copy everything on it.The cast is awesome in the whole trilogy, but I think they're superb in the last movie, because the characters are evolving and each one of them is unique and deep. The SFX are great and very authentic, plus the score is brilliant. Howard Shore has surprised me with his geniality.I'll probably say nothing new about The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, but I've got a statement: we're so lucky to have lived the conception of one of the best trilogies ever made, and I think that it'll be remembered for a long time.Definitely worth a look! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It's an art,"This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies.The Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc).Here the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut.Another major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings.I'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters.And finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word ""wizard"", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of ""some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure"". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular.The Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

best movie about age of kings,"This movie best describe something i would call age of kings or castle age. Similar to computer games like Age of Empires, Cossacks, Stronghold. It motivated me to play such games because they are very similar to movie. It is emotional, realistic, moral, cultural, religious, adventuristic, magical. It reminds me of those religions such as Qur'an and movies about religions and religious war, but also other types of wars like national. Although most things in the movie are unreal, they can be compared to real life analogues such as habits, culture, manners. Everything and everybody looks so real and this is not a low quality movie. I am amazed that there is vast number of newer but worse convincing and looking movies. This one looks like it is ahead of its abilities for that time (year 2003). Meaning, even today I am amazed by graphics, quality, reality of it all. Good history lesson and good religious inspiration. It inspired me to never give up, to fight for something better, to be prepared in advance, and to not get discouraged. This movie is probably the most interesting to those interested in history, because despite most thing being fake, it shows us great deal of history, including buildings, weapons, nations, behaviors, technology, nature - like it indeed was. There is some magical feeling at the end that feels out of this world and could be best described as inspiration and insight into the victory, freedom, success, relief.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Remarkable,"I have never made any comments in English or posted any here. But I really hope to see the movie get higher rating and I really feel need to write down how I love the movie.As a child,I was nowhere living in any surrounding of western tales.  I had no idea where the story of LOR would go when I had the first sight on the 1st episode TFOR.I didnt even understand the most fundamental questions: why need Frodo go to destroy the ring, why it's him not others, and why frodo could resist the power while others cant. The story was totally 'exotic' for me. But still, I was so attracted by the scenes and braveness, united spirit, loveness showing by the picture.Now comes the third one and the best movie ever may I say. It is even much better than all I can imagine. I watched the movie in a theatre late night with only 2 other movie viewers sitting far behind. It was quiet and no one would have seen me shedding tears along the movie going. Yes, I choked and was so moved. The only other movie which did the same thing to me was Shawshank's redemption, which was once in the no.1 place of my favorite movie list. Now it's taken by LOR3.Lor2 was considered as one movie with less compassion and moving moments. For lor3, there are so many touching scenes that any few of them would be enough to gain my full respect for the filming groups. No one can complain being given too much, right?The picture is describing an ideal world. but why not? We are living in a busy and wearing world, what is the chance for us to be a warrior or some small man who can gain the highest respect from others, like hobbits. The original story must be good. But I am still sure I would enjoy the movie much more than reading the novel itself. Thank the filming groups and the ones who performed the film. It was and will be a memorable 3-hour-time in my life.The character I liked the best is Sam(performed by Sean Astin).Sean played the role vividly and delivered so well the deep meaning of friendship and loyalty. No doubt, he deserves an Oscar for best supporter role.The story ends and I feel sad at the same time coz there is no lor4 for the next December. I will watch the movie again and again, along with the other two.Life becomes meaningful. Thank movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The trilogy I can watch over and over again,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is not just a film - it's an epic conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. The movie delivers breathtaking visuals, emotional storytelling, and unforgettable battles, making it a monumental achievement in fantasy filmmaking.The narrative beautifully weaves together multiple storylines, balancing intense war sequences with deeply personal moments of courage, sacrifice, and redemption.The visuals are nothing short of stunning. From the sweeping landscapes of Middle-earth to the hauntingly dark plains of Mordor, every frame feels meticulously crafted. The Battle of Pelennor Fields is a cinematic triumph, with thousands of warriors, towering oliphaunts, and the terrifying Nazgûl creating one of the most thrilling battle sequences ever filmed.The cast delivers outstanding performances. Viggo Mortensen's transformation from a wandering ranger to the noble King of Gondor is powerful and inspiring. Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee provides the emotional heart of the film, with his devotion to Frodo leading to some of the trilogy's most tear-jerking moments. Andy Serkis' motion-capture performance as Gollum remains one of the best, capturing the character's internal conflict with eerie precision.Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score elevates every scene, from the triumphant ""Ride of the Rohirrim"" to the hauntingly beautiful ""Into the West."" The music perfectly complements the film's emotional highs and lows, making it an unforgettable part of the experience.The Return of the King is a rare film that exceeds expectations, delivering an emotionally satisfying and visually spectacular conclusion to the trilogy. With its sweeping battles, deep emotional core, and masterful storytelling, it is a testament to the power of cinema. It rightfully won 11 Academy Awards and its place as one of the greatest films of all time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
slightly disappointed,"Perhaps it was because I wasn't in the best of moods prior to watching the film but I was slightly disappointed with the final part of LotR.I don't think that the makers have done anything differently in style or tone to the first two and I'm sure it is their equal. I think I possibly have Rings fatigue, all the weighty speeches, ham-fisted attempts at comic moments, and truly epic battle scenes have become a bit done for me.I want to stress I still liked the film and maybe if I watch it again my opinion will change. Three hours+ passed really quite quickly, which is always a good sign, and I think it would be spurious to criticise it for going on a bit too long at the end as it is based on a book, loads was cut out from the end as it was and it was necessary to show most of those scenes for narrative closure.The world is a better place for having this trilogy in existence but weighing in over 9 hours long proved just a touch long for this particularly viewer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
boo,"I've waited three years for a disappointing ending. The scouring of the Shire wasn't in the film, and that was by far the most important scene in the story, with Saruman and Wormtongue. Okay, so maybe it's in the second DVD comes out, after the regular one gets bought up---but this is just a marketing scheme---the exploitation of a fine story. This proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the author's intent, fixed only on making large sums of money. Tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave. People against this argument no doubt say that, ""well yes, but it brings the story to the masses!"" Why not encourage them to read instead? I feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having Wood in their minds as Frodo, or Astin as Sam. And the characters don't act that way in the book.And how can we justify Jackson's liberal treatment of the story to promote CGI graphics while disregarding the characters in the film. Basically the computer is now a character.These books should have been left alone. This isn't the best film of all time, it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Greatest Epic Trilogy,"First of all, The Lord of the Rings (L.O.T.R) trilogy should always be
appreciated as a whole rather than 3 separate movies (despite the fact that each of them, alone, is already a beautiful piece of art). It's also the reason why you will find the exact same post on each movie's topic (10/10 for each and 100/10 for the TRILOGY!).The series has everything needed to be a masterpiece :Great cinematography: thanks to the exceptional common works of Andrew Lesnie and Peter Jackson, we could experience all theses monumental battle scenes throughout the series (in magnificent landscapes of Jackson's native New Zealand). Some of them are the most epic battle scenes ever made!Great script: excellent adapted screenplay for the legendary novel of J. R. R. Tolkien.Great ensemble cast: in one sentence, they were just perfect for the series. In such a large screenplay, each one has precisely done what is needed to develop their character, not too few nor too much, for the common great goal : the global plot development.Great directing: respect to Jackson for putting all those great elements together so that we now could live Tolkien's splendid fantasy world on big screen. The TRILOGY has also engraved Peter Jackson's name on the wall of the Directors hall of fame alongside with Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola...I've been re-watching the whole series from time to time for the last 15 years since the release of The Return of the King, and it's kept me enjoyed every single time! For me, the L.O.T.R is the greatest epic movie of the cinema history and will remain for the next decades. And I have no doubt that many will agree with me on this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The best movie ever,"I just wanted to say that for a long time i thought it was just a crappy fiction movie but i was completely wrong. It's the best movie ever made (: The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called 'Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Beautiful. A Myth bought to life for the modern age.,"Note: I now only ever watch the Extended Editions of these movies, the only worthwhile versions as far as I am concerned.I am a Tolkien fan, I've read LOTR, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion. I was, it must be admitted a movie fan first before I got into the books. Perhaps if it has bene the other way around I would see things differently, but I don't.Tolkien wasn't just a fantasy writer, he was a craftsman: he crafted mythology and fairy tales for the modern age. Its possible to nitpick about some of the lore changes, but I firmly believe Jackson's Trilogy is faithful to the spirit and intent of J..R. R Tolkien's Magnum Opus.It is a beautiful, reverent, epic retelling of the timeless tale of good vs evil. Of the story of the courageous Hobbit Frodo and his best friend Samwise Gamgee's quest to destroy the One Ring. Alongside, all the Free Peoples of Middle Earth unite in their fight against the Ring's Master, Sauron. A terrible and powerful supernatural being whose very being is tied to the Ring.Jackson's stories are lovingly told, with the same attention to detail as a the Master Craftsman who wrote the books. The costumes, armour, sets and dialogue and all attest to the years of careful work put into these movies.Every time I watch these movies (and I have nearly a dozen times) I notice some new detail which either ties back to the lore or the the Legends so beloved of Professor Tolkien. Unlike the Amazon adaptation, the lore is not just the odd Easter Egg, but carefully woven into the story.Everyone should watch these movies at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Watch the extended versions!,"This is an almost perfect cinematic conversion of the book. What I must stress though is that that the extended version is much better. I have no idea why New Line, by all accounts, insisted on a time limit for the theatrical releases. The extra footage adds context and gives a variation in pace that the movie really needs. Given that the core fan base often complain that the book ends too soon this was a misfire of some significance.But otherwise it is absolutely brilliant. Many people are hoping that New Line and Jackson eventually do a deal to do more of Tolkien's work. It is hard to imagine anyone else coming close to this level of realisation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Almost a masterpiece,"LOTR-3 is probably the most astonishing achievement in computerized effects in film history - a masterpiece in this field, and it will stay so for a long time. I is a great piece of visual arts, and a good film in many other respects - well acted and directed, complex plot, with many interesting threads. However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better.Nevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production. It is probably the best film of the year, and it gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

End it already!,"I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition.But the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional ""bonus"" footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two.The Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie.Not only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways.Return of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations).Once again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Even better than expected. Too bad it's over...,"I'm not going to tell you about the story. I'm not going to tell you about the special f/x either. I'm just telling you, that Peter Jackson did it.

The Matrix Revolutions was not a bad movie, but it still was a disapointment. The Return of the Kings is quite the opposite. It makes the whole trilogy ""shine"", because everything is well balanced.

Best Fantasy Movie Of All Time,"""Return of the Kings"" is a cinematic masterpiece that not only lives up to its title but surpasses all expectations, delivering a truly unforgettable experience for fans and newcomers alike. Directed by visionary storyteller Peter Jackson, this epic saga marks a triumphant return to the world of fantasy, setting a new standard for the genre.From the opening scene to the final frame, ""Return of the Kings"" captivates audiences with its breathtaking visuals, impeccable cinematography, and a soundtrack that weaves seamlessly with the narrative. The attention to detail in every frame is a testament to the dedication of the filmmakers, creating a world that feels both mythical and tangible.The strength of ""Return of the Kings"" lies not only in its technical prowess but also in its rich and multifaceted characters. The ensemble cast, led by standout performances from Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellen, brings depth and authenticity to their roles. The character arcs are masterfully crafted, allowing the audience to connect with the heroes on a profound emotional level.The narrative is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending epic battles with moments of quiet introspection. The pacing is expertly handled, ensuring that each plot point contributes to the overall story arc. The script is filled with wit, wisdom, and poignant reflections on power, friendship, and the human condition.One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to pay homage to the source material while simultaneously subverting expectations.

This movie perfectly captures the world that Tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. The acting, cast, CGI, wardrobe, and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie.

For me, the emotional trek was always not ""who is going to live or die?"", but ""how much computer power was needed?"".Fantasy films can be bit overdone and full of themselves, and I suspect that this is somewhat the case here.For real, human drama, sans all the cgi and such, see what I thought was the best film of 2003...Mystic River...",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very little to admire,"There are a few things very admirable about Jackson's latest installment. The special effects are incredible, the...um...No, I think that's about it.Before I go any further, let me state I am an admirer of Tolkien's work, and this review will be largely biased because of that. The breadth and scope of 'The Lord of the Rings' amazes me every time I pick up the novel. The character dialogue is long, eloquent, and puts the reader in a grander time and place than his own. The story is about traveling with friends, talking over dinner, and exploring a world unlike anywhere else in literature. But Jackson's movie has very little of any of that.I understand that because of the cost of the movie, he had to adjust it for mainstream audiences. However, the problem is not that he adjusted the material, but that he absolutely butchered it. Tolkien's beautiful dialogue is trimmed down and thrown away to be replaced by bad one-liners and soap opera scenes. The characters feel one-dimensional and act like cardboard cut outs of their alter egos in the book. Does Frodo panting or groaning or complaining for the hundredth time tell me anything about him or why I should care that he's panting and groaning, etc?I don't hate everything about Jackson's interpretation. I enjoyed the wonderful sets, realistic cgi, and thrilling battle scenes. But was it necessary to make the Battle of Plennor Fields an hour long computer simulate scrimmage when Tolkien spends only a single page describing it in his book? It's a pity mainstream audiences have swallowed the movie and accepted it as a masterpiece, when really it's nothing of the sort. It's a real shame.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Phenomenal ending to the trilogy !,Just like the two previous this one explores a action packed adventure/fantasy world with a extremely well crafted story line thanks to JRR Tolkien books.

As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple ""fantasy"" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been. This is probably the best movie ever made.

A breathtaking and emotionally powerful finale to a great film trilogy,"The Return of the King is the renowned final chapter in Peter Jackson's legendary Lord of The Rings film trilogy. The films in this trilogy are widely considered to be some of the greatest fantasy films ever made.It is a testament to the quality of Return of the King that it is without a doubt the best film in the trilogy. The story, characters, world building, and cinematography all combine to create one of the most magnificent franchise finales of all time.The Return of the King boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance, love, loyalty, and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength. It also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage. These were always the core themes of Lord of the Rings and this film makes sure they take center stage in the narrative.The story is also brilliantly grounded in human emotion which makes for a very emotionally stirring watch. Many of the most powerful scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate, bittersweet, and touching moments with each other. Some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyone's eyes.This timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast. The amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like Sir lan Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Orlando Bloom all giving memorable acting performances in an enormous ensemble cast. The performances of this top notch cast perfectly bring the characters to life and help to immerse the audience into the film's captivating world.The Return of the King's spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking. The larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of Middle Earth. Grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges, nearly endless fields, volcanoes, gigantic ancient cities, and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail. The way Jackson effortlessly blends CGI locales with real places in these shots is astonishing and something I have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside of the other Lord of the Rings films.On the subject of CGI, the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art. The impossibly realistic motion capture on Gollum's face, along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold.This great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of The Return of the King's jaw dropping battle sequences. The battles in this film simply must be seen to be believed. I do not speak lightly when I say that Return of The King has some of the most epic, breathtaking, and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history. Peter Jackson's excellent direction and the overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes are enough to make them endlessly exciting on every re-watch.These unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling and awe inspiring musical score by composer Howard Shore. This phenomenal soundtrack also permeates the film's more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to. It works wonders to elevate these scenes as wellOverall, The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in American Cinema. It can make you cry, cheer, and smile like almost no other film. It is a timeless grand epic and a true landmark in the fantasy film genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Three movies to rule them all,"As my first review here on Imdb I can't find a better movie than The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I'll write here on the third one but I consider all three as one big movie.
I think Lotr's the best book adaptation I have seen. There isn't everything that happens in the book (if they followed the book but by bit there would have been at least 6 movies), but Jackson managed to put all the important stuff, he kept the best and most interesting parts, always keeping the true story in mind.
Acting, setting and cinematography are amazing. Moreover, the music plays a really important role. I think no other movie I've seen (except maybe Star Wars) gives such importance to all the tracks. Every moment has it's different and unique soundtrack and if you close your eyes and listen you can actually link the music to the moment. Hobbits have their theme, the Fellowship has hers, Isengard and Rohan have theirs. Everything fits perfectly into place.
Plus I really advice watching the extended editions. They add a lot of tiny precious details to the plot and to the characterization of the characters.

Absolutely amazing!,"This film has made a dent in cinema history. People have said it isn't able to do, people said that it was impossible, but these people were proved wrong by Mr Peter Jackson. I think this film is the best that I have ever seen. I first said that ""The Two Towers"" was, but this film ceases the first or second. The cinematography in this film is extremely graphical and the special effects are awesome. The music is enchanting and so extraordinary. The storyline is a tearjerker and is extremely moving. I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it, but I would also advise you to see the first two because they are equally as god-smacking as this one is. People who say this movie is bad interpret the movie before they see it; they judge it by the length of the film and don't look at the layers of meaning that are within the movie. That is why the film is misunderstood by some people and I would recommend this.

I thought the film was over 20 minutes before it actually ended). A part from that, the film really deserves some recognition... (and I don't mean getting big bucks... ).

a fine close to the trilogy,"The core of the final film in Peter Jackson's mammoth 'Lord of the Rings' series is Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, assisted by Sam and opposed by the ever-desperate Gollum.  At the end of 'The Two Towers', Gollum had sworn to kill the hobbits and take the ring for himself - at the start of this film they (or at least, Frodo) still see him as a friend.  So there's scope for conflict there which is exploited admirably.The other main storyline concerns the quest of Aragorn to reclaim his crown - will the king overcome all enemies and claim his birthright?  'The Return of the King' is darker and more bloody than the preceding films as the full force of Sauron and the enemies of man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit regroup and find their strength.We see a decaying Gondor lost somewhere in time, with Denethor (powerfully played by John Noble) wandering in distain of his surviving son, Faramir, and mourning the loss of his great child Boromir.  We see the young hobbits Merry and Pippin both grow up and serve with distinction in battle, while Gandalf, now the all-powerful white wizard, rallies the armies to victory.Four scenes stand out for me - Aragorn and Legolas commanding the hidden armies to join their king one last time; Frodo's battle with the spider; the final confrontation between Frodo, Gollum and the Ring (although I was disappointed at the decision to make the last key fight an invisible one); and the final grateful bow of Aragorn to his little friends.Is 'Return of the King' exciting?  Yes, there are many meaty battles and situations here.  Is it involving and touching?  Yes - with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin giving their all as Frodo and Sam, and even Pippin making good. Not to mention the resolution of the story of Arwen and Aragorn.  Is it the best film of the three?  I'm not sure.  For me, the huge scale of the first film, the beauty of Rivendell, the innocence of Middle Earth, the heart-stopping appearance of the Balrog, possibly had the edge.  Is this version of 'The Lord of the Rings' really worth the hype?  As a nine-hours plus film, undoubtedly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Kick-ass finale,"Final chapter in Tolkien trilogy returns to the standard set by fantastic first entry. Corrects it's course from the in-comparison-only lesser Towers, which suffered from two significant faults: 1) pointless deviations from the source material, the best fantasy work ever written; and 2) a tendency to make the odds against our heroes laughably impossible. Not that this one is perfect on those counts but it tries a little harder, maybe they felt Towers needed more ummmph or something. We're talking a good 500 pages or so for Return, they do about as nice a job of stuffing the material in as they can. Pretty much flawless acting, my personal favorite being Hill as Theoden King of Rohan. Real nice job on lighting the warning beacons, a dazzling combination of sight and sound (although I still would have preferred it ""by the book"" while Gandalf and Pippin are on the fly to Gondor). I lived with these books so much as a kid I get choked up throughout this movie it's visualized so well. Tolkien was a master of having his characters (often Gandalf, sometimes Galadriel, but not always so) say the perfect lifetime-memorable line; somehow with all this effort they still miss some of the great ones. But I guess nobody's perfect. Great movie. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I showed it to my parents,"Took me 2 years to convince them.. They don't like unrealistic movies with fantasy elements and they pretty much complained throughout the entire trilogy. Although they did tear up in the end even tho they refuse to admit it.. They're not fooling me, they loved and they know it. The Oscar committee generally don't recognize fantasy movies as best picture material but in this case they did, and for good reasons. Having read the books I can safely say they are far superior in terms of storytelling but I don't care. No one could have done a better job than Peter Jackson and his crew, bringing this epic story from book to film is in theory an impossible task but they nailed it.It remains the best trilogy ever made, that's a fact and no argument is ever gonna change this fact... I would say The Godfather could have been the greatest but they blew it with the third one. Although this is not really a trilogy, more like a 10 hour long movie split into three parts.. No matter how you look at it, this is movie history.

Everything was very well thought out, down to the last camera mans angles to the way the background cooperated so gracefully.I have always wondered how The Return of the King would play out, such a strong role didn't really seem appropriate to the actor that they had chosen to play Aragon, well that was my initial thought with the first of the trilogy ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" but nonetheless Viggo Mortensen played the part brilliantly!

Somehow it seemed all far too distant,"After I have seen the first movie, when it was shown at the movies, I thought it was the best movie I ever watched. Forgive me, I was a child. Because I could not wait for the second one to be released, I read the whole trilogy. When ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" were released, I watched them in great expectation. My thought on the second part was, that it was different from the books, but it was still great in it's own manner. But the third movie disappointed me. I could not find any sign of the Tolkien-feeling that I knew from the books and that was partially carried on by the first two films.Yes, for sure ""The Return of the King"" is the most imposing one of the trilogy, but somehow it leaks depth. To me it seemed like this movie focused/decreased only on views of great fortresses, huge marching armies and heroic battles. Unlike the previous parts, this movie left me totally cold. I was never feeling inside the happening or feeling with the characters, I never experienced something like catharsis. I can remember sitting in the cinema and being just sad. There was a lot of action, a lot of things went haywire, but somehow it seemed all far too distant. It was like eating something you haven't eaten for a long time and expecting a certain taste, but realizing that in truth it tastes totally different, much more synthetically.I think it's a pity and I hope that one day there will be a non-Hollywood adaptation of The Lord of The Rings.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

How can it be #4?,"I don't think that without the book, this series could have been this popular. The third and final episode of LoTR is massive, well done and entertains without doubt, but I really don't think it deserves to be dubbed one of the greatest movies of all time, even though it makes a similar effort.For starters, there is no great story involved and the subplots aren't really interesting. The progression of events is the same as in the second part and really not very different. Huge armies clashing with nothing really new involved in the battles, constitutes 60% of the movie. The movie only really gets interesting during the very end but thats something you have to wait over 2 hours for. The progression and storyline themselves are highly predictable and there are no real twists which occur besides the predictable one in the end, which is quickly brushed aside and progression, once again returning to normal.I really wanted to see Sauron as a fighting form in part 3. He simply remained as the eye and made no great appearance, was eventually defeated with no effort. Instead, they just throw in some random general who makes rare appearances, does nothing to intimidate and gets killed easily. That was a huge disappointment. You'd think that some special effects improvements had been made in part-3 but thats only partially achieved. Obviously, they ran into budget constraints and cut back on the CGI budget. While the overall CGI effort was pretty good, it is certainly not the best in the world.Although LoTR was a mammoth effort and I really can't suggest anything to polish it further, it was really just that from the very start and is far from brilliant. The good thing is the experience that the director would gain from this project to go on and direct masterpieces like King Kong.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The greatest book to film adaptation and fantasy film of all time, bar none!","On Lord of the Rings in general:This is how film making should be done, this beautifully woven piece of cinema deserves all the praise and attention it gets, it is truly a labour of love and care, the tremendous amount of effort put into these films makes it a must see for anyone wanting to see how a big budget fantasy blockbuster SHOULD BE MADE! There's nothing bad about this film, and if there is then people would be looking for things that are bad, and that's just knit picking. Everything from the writing, casting, acting, production design, art, cinematography, lighting, music, sound EVERYTHING is spot on with this these films.On this film in particular:The best of the three, that's right, this is the first time I have watched a trilogy/ sequel and can put my hand on my heart and say that these films get better as they go along, mainly because it reaches the ultimate climax it possibly can without losing any momentum and steam from the first films, and has the best pay off you could ask for, changes have been made from the books of course, but every change Jackson has made from Tolkien's novels is completely justified for it's use in a cinematic context, I honestly cried at the end of this film, and that's not an easy task for me, to get me as invested in this world and it's characters as Jackson's trilogy has, well lets just say, it takes a lot, only Pixar has achieved the same with me, and I'll be lucky if any other film is capable of making me do so again. What is there more to say, a beautifully made film, with a wonderfully dramatic climax, you really do get the feeling of being on a journey with these films, you feel enticed with the characters as they embark on it, and for a 3 hour film to do so without losing any momentum (as with all three of them), well that's an achievement in itself.

"It is the one movie I would classify as ""BEST""","After ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I really wanted to see a sequel that goes with it, but I was afraid that it will turn out stupid. I wasn't disappointed. Same story after ""The Two Towers"". But this time, I was more than satisfied. For all you out there who haven't seen it, you're missing out on something. I especially liked how the soundtrack goes with the scenes. When Gandalf approaches Minas Tirith, the music makes you think of a king on high. When the army marches out of Minas Morgul, the music makes you shiver. No other soundtrack gave me such an affect. I personally think it was unfair in the Battle of the Pelenor Fields that the enemy had airborne creatures, while the goodies were only on horseback, but the eagles were a good idea. Most interestingly, the end ties back to the beginning; Frodo had the Ring bitten off, while Sauron had his Ring cut off.

"Epic Conclusion, Mixed Emotions","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the grand finale that fans of the series were waiting for, and in many ways, it delivers on its epic promise. The scale of this film is staggering, with massive battles, breathtaking landscapes, and a sense of finality that wraps up the trilogy with a satisfying bang. Peter Jackson's direction is as ambitious as ever, and you can feel the weight of the journey as the characters reach the end of their respective arcs. I couldn't help but be swept up in the sheer spectacle of it all. The performances are strong across the board. The bond between the characters, forged over three films, feels genuine, and that makes the victories and losses hit home all the more.However, despite these strengths, The Return of the King isn't without its flaws. The biggest issue for me was the pacing. The film feels overlong, especially in its final act. Just when you think it's about to end, another scene is added, and then another. While I appreciated the need to give closure to all the characters, the multiple endings began to wear on me, diluting some of the emotional impact.There's also a sense of predictability to the story's resolution. Given the journey leading up to this point, there are few surprises left in how the story wraps up, which makes the final stretch feel more like a formality than a thrilling conclusion. The battle scenes, while impressive, can also become overwhelming, with the CGI-heavy sequences sometimes lacking the grounded intensity of the earlier films.In the end, The Return of the King is an epic conclusion that mostly lives up to the expectations, but it's not without its bumps along the way. It's a film of grand moments and emotional payoffs, but also one that can feel a bit too drawn out and predictable. Still, for fans of the series, it's a fitting end to an unforgettable journey, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
meaning,"The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King, is an outstanding movie full of everything you could ever ask to be in a movie. There is romance between Sam and Rosie, and Aragorn and Arwen who almost could not be together because of the war, and Faramir and Eowyn.There is loads of comedy, specifically speaking of Merry and Pippin, but also between Gimli, and Legolas when in the fight scenes. My favorite quote of Gimli's is always: ""Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?"" i can not help but include a small giggle no matter what mood i am in. Another scene is when Legolas just takes on the giant elephaunt, with many men in his way, and Gimli still manages to keep that as one: ""That still only counts as one!""This movie is of course action packed. Thousands of blood-thirsty orcs, completely built for killing, march to the gates of Minas Tirith. after a few blows from the Gondor catapults, throwing chunks of the city, the massive army breaks into the city destroying everything in their path. just as all hope fails, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas come to the rescue. Of course they couldn't do it alone! the three heroes come to the rescue with a massive army behind them. what kind of army you may ask? A dead army. the deadly army of the dead joined forces with Aragorn, to assure their own freedom.The true meaning of the movie however, is friendship. in the darkest times of Middle Earth, 2 hobbits had what everyone in the world could have. each other, or their own friendship. it seems as though, the only hope in the world, which they were, lied with these two hobbits who berally knew how to wield a sword. carrying the one ring, and each other, Frodo Baggins, and Sam Gamgee finally save Middle Earth, and rid the world of its evil inhabitants, just by keeping hope in front of them, and holding on to each other. basically, their faith in each other, and their friendship saved all of Middle Earth.

But wasting what must be 3 hours on repetitive and unbelievable battle action is a poor choice to make, at least from my standpoint.The first movie was certainly the best, as it spent the least time in a relentless parade of special effects and battle scenes. The second movie was good up to a point; the third bludgeoned the tale with relentless footage of trolls and oliphants that were not in the books and didn't need to be in the movie. I gave ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" an eight the first time I rated them, and movies 2 and 3 a seven. This time I removed a star from ""The Two Towers"" and ""Return of the King"".Certainly the production values are great. The casting is excellent as well, and considering the roles that must be played the acting was very good. One exception was the choice of Miranda Otto for Eowyn and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, who I found to be nearly homely when in the book they were the fairest of women.I know I don't understand the public and what they want, and the producers of this series do. It is one of the most financially successful series of films ever. But I cannot help but despair of the total lack of subtlety. As much as most people seem to love this series, I do not. Perhaps I should never watch another movie where I love the book. There are only very few (The Godfather and Hopscotch chief among them) where I find the book and the movie both to be excellent.And did we really need to have the Mt. Doom ending be crumbling bridges behind Sam and Frodo? This type of thing coarsens and cheapens the epic tale. They would have roasted in that proximity to lava. If the scientific knowledge is such that the average viewer can even begin to think this type of thing is reasonable...I guess it is not reasonable to expect reasonable in a fantasy, but there are limits.In particular, I was looking forward to the real end of the book, ""The Scouring of the Shire"", as that puts a fitting end to the feats of the hobbits. Alas, they chose to remove it entirely.All in all, I will try to remember to not watch this again. I will choose to remember the imagery fondly, and revisit the films by looking at still pictures instead of the actual footage.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The biggest problem of all is lack of character development ...,"I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development.ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them.Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is.SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.OTHERSThe same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh -  this is kindergarten film production.I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good.Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R.

The Greatest of All Time!,"How can you even review this movie!
I've been reading the books and watching the making of these movies/behind the scenes and they just get better and better every time. Being a New Zealander makes inherently bias to LOTR, although even if I was from another country, I would still see it as the greatest.This movie and story is so compelling because it tells the story of a journey or an adventure. By the start of the third movie we've already invested so much into Frodo and the fellowship. It has such strong character duos that I'm already won over before they even begin. You can't help but love every scene with Gimli and Legolas, Mary and Pippin, Frodo and Sam. And you know that after the massive success of The Two Towers, that they're going to do everything they can to make Return of the King even better than that. And yes boy, did they do that! How many other movies on IMDB have higher rated instalments after the first movie?Return of the King improves itself in so many of its battle scenes. The Oliphants scene with Legolas blew me away as a child and still does to this day. The witch King of Angmar is so intimidating. The riders of Rohan coming to attack brings such emotion to me every time. The battle and city of Minas Tirith is so well detailed. The Nasgul are incredible! Shelob is terrifying. Sam's heroic and courage get me tearing up every time! And the music! Oh my, the music. The LOTR soundtrack has been my most replayed soundtrack of any movie, especially the Return of the King. The black gate battles and the joy of the ring being destroyed are the height of excitement and satisfaction. They are so epic! There is such a relief in knowing that the ring is destroyed and watching the Tower of Sauron come down is a beautiful thing.This is the ultimate story that tells the battle of good and evil. Before it was too cliche and the good guys always win, or no one on the good side ever dies. This was the original story for me that nailed it and still continues to nail it. It deserves every Oscar it won.Is it perfect? Well no, you only have to watch something like CinemaSins to discover all the issues with any movie - we're only human, perfection is never attainable that's the way its meant to be. I have a few problems with the 5 or so endings being way too long, and Sam's being completely unnecessary. The eagles were fine for me until they came up again in the Hobbit and we all got a bit over the eagles saving the day. The massive earthquake only making the orcs fall into the abyss and not any of the good guys was far fetched. But it doesn't really matter. The pros are too great, they make the negatives a small blip.I'm so glad this movie wasn't made in 2020. There would be a CGI Minus Tirith, every Orc would probably be CGI, the Riders of Rohan would of been one man on his horse and all the rest CGI. Corners would've been cut, it wouldn't have been honouring of the story. It may have had a lot more extra female characters, and racial diversity and leads, which could be something better actually, but could have also led it away from the original story, making it more 21st Century then about the world of Middle Earth. It probably wouldn't be filmed in NZ and just wouldn't have been any good. This was made at exactly the right time, in the right place, with the right people. They got everything right!Return of the King is a movie that actually gets more and more impressive when you look into how it was made and how they actually pulled a lot of this off. No movie it seems like would go to the extremes these guys went to for the three years in a row to pull of the greatest trilogy in the history of movie making. Talk to any NZ'er and we're very proud of Peter Jackson and his team.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
This Christmas The Journey,The Fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. The story comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. The movie has a stunning power unlike the other two. Peter Jackson uses incredible insight into sstories and themes and character study. The Return of the King culminates its three story lines unimaginably. As the characters finish what is a three year journey you see exactly why Peter Jackson made the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at this incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. I enjoyed this film for two main reasons action and intimacy. The action is stunningly realized by weta workshop. But even though the action is great at the center of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. As Frodo and Sam make their way to Mount Doom we really get to see them both rise to the occasion. We see the real power of friendship as Gollum continues to try to break it. When Aragorn and Gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs and yet they stand as strong as they were at Helm's Deep. I become more amazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will either side win. The feelings of community within us. This is a classic and whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Can He Conclude It?,"To me this is easily the worst Lord of the Rings film, primarily because it simply does not know how to end. We have a total of four false finishes before this gargantuan trilogy finally leaves us in peace. In fairness, this is the story's fault, not the film maker's. That Jackson was able to adapt these books is a stunning achievement.The practical effects are absolutely stunning, as is the cinematography. This is one of the finest looking films ever. One need only compare this to the Hobbit films, to get an impression of the amazing scale of the LOTR achievement.My main issue with Lord of the Rings is the lack of truly compelling characters. To me, Gollum is the only truly great character. Characters like Gimli and Legolas are paper thin, and everyone in between is basic. Again this isn't really the film makers fault in my opinion.For me this is the best that could possibly have been done in adapting these stories to cinema. They're the kind of stories that really are more suited to the pages of a book. Perhaps Jackson could have trimmed a little more fat than he did, and it would have made a more concise and impactful film, certainly the extended cut is vastly worse.So for me this is a fantastic spectacle, brilliantly acted by most of the cast. I feel that the story is limited, especially on screen, and that means the film is bashing it's head on a glass ceiling.Eight out of Ten.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

return of the king eh?,"This movie was by far the worst of the trilogy in my humble opinion. Bad acting throughout by the majority of the cast, especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, made their scenes near intolerable to watch. The script might as well have been nonexistent, as every line was cliched melodramatic crap. Finally, my biggest pet peeve of the film, the last 30 minutes or so of this movie is painfully hard to watch. Not because the viewer is being challenged, like in 'The Passion', but because I nearly fell asleep because it was so boring. 11 Oscars? Please. That only proves one thing. The Oscars are no longer an important award that stands above the rest of the crappy hundreds of awards show that are out the now, but rather, they are just another one of these bland, repetitive, mass appeal shows that are just there so everybody can see what their favorite star or most hated stars will look like. 5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

One device that is often used in this trilogy is the effect of ""almost"" - Frodo ""almost"" gets killed, the ring is almost lost, nothing really happens out of the expected, just as plain and stupid as an average sci-fi crap.

How to Ruin a perfect trilogy.,"I have never loved a film series more than LOTR. It just hits the spot. The only problem with the third instalment was the over reliability on CGI characters and monsters.A moral exposition of good versus evil? After The Two Towers, I heard normally sensible critics jabbering the word ""Miltonic"". But imagine if Milton had decided to cut Satan out of Paradise Lost. Because Jackson has cut Saruman out of Return of the King: the evil lord so brilliantly conveyed by Christopher Lee. I don't know how that plays with the Tolkie purists, but I'm disappointed. Lee was one of only two really good acting performances in the series, among all the simpering maidens and beefcakes and callow hobbits, the other being Ian McKellen's splendid Gandalf. Saruman gone! Could it be that Peter Jackson decided that what with all the expensive battle scenes, there wasn't time? He could have cut half the shots of Elijah Wood's Frodo doing his bug-eyed, smudgy-faced worried expression, and freed up about 20 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One Trilogy to Rule Them All,"It's hard to choose which one I like more, 'Return of the King' or 'Fellowship of the Ring'. The third installment is so grand with huge battles and utter desperation. The odds are stacked against the world of men, but with alliances and a few cheat codes (army of the dead), they stand a chance. Though, everything falls on Frodo and whether he's able to complete his mission. And we see him struggle mightily.I remember the theatrical versions very clearly, so I can pretty well pick out every scene that is added in the extended versions. Throughout the trilogy the added scenes are actually almost obvious. I definitely prefer them for all the extra lore, but I would be lying if I didn't think they sometimes broke up the natural flow of the films or seemed out of place.The movie is over 4 hours long. And I loved all of it. It deserved every Academy Award it won. The number one franchise where my heart is so invested I actually don't want it to end. We got the 'Hobbit', which in my opinion doesn't come close to this trilogy. But thankfully, we get more this coming fall in TV format, 'Game of Thrones' style (as in quality and production), with at least 5 seasons planned.

Film Review,"In Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) is the last movie of the lord of the rings trilogy. (Spoiler) In this movie Frodo(Elijah Wood) and Sam(Sean Astin) are close to Mount Doom where they are playing to throw the One Ring on the Fire. On the other hand Gandalf(Ian Mckellen) and Aragon(Viggo Mortensen) are leading the World of Men Army which is going to fight against Sauron's army. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam(Sean Astin) have been away for a long time and the rest of the fellowship doesn't have any news or know if anything has happened to them. Smeagol (Andy Serkis) is leading Frodo (Elijah Wood) to Mount Doom.(Spoiler) Multiple plots occur during this movie. One of the most important ones is that World of Men army is not as powerful as the orb army. Even if they added the young men to the army they would still not be a match for the orb army. Elmord(Hugo Weaving) has the sword put together and gives it to Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) to take back his place as king. Also the Eye of Sauron is able to get into Pippin's (Billy Boyd) thoughts and see what the plans of the fellowship were.There is no other film like the Lord of the Rings but if any other can come closer to it, it would be The Matrix because they were also on a war to free humanity. Lighting was a very important technique use during the film. It allows the characters to become more realistic, by having the view focus on the amazing backgrounds or clothing rather than facial expressions. Since there were hobbits and humans together in some scenes the lighting helped disguise the computer generated characters and make the screen very realistic.The angles were also very important, they help the cameras make some characters smaller than the others in other to have them look like hobbits. Most of the scenes for the movie where computer generated in order to make them realistic to the viewer they had to utilize the correct angle. Gondor and Minas Morgul where astonishing. At the end the movies Theme was that One Ring to Rule them All created with a different purpose than what it was intended and Frodo(Elijah Wood) got drag into the journey to destroy it. They accomplish their goal and it was a movie with a extremely well done ending.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

This Christmas I got the Two Towers and The Return Extended DVDS. I watched both of them in the same day and was in awe when I was done. The return of the King extended edition is absolutely mindblowing. There is no word to describe how much better the extended DVD is than the regular edition.

When you're watching this movie, there's this little voice in your head going 'this is the last one. Next Christmas there won't be a part four you can look forward to. This will be it. That's it.' But I'm sure if I watch RotK a few dozen times more, this little voice in my head will fade away. And then there's always the rumors about 'The Hobbit'.But secondly, and that's more important: most of the characters come to a standstill. There's not much evolving there. Only Aragorn has to grow to become a leader of men, and good ol' trustworthy Sam will rise to become the real hero of the War of the Ring. But most of the other characters in RotK just have to buy time for Frodo and Sam, so they will have a chance to complete their mission. But then again: so it was written, and so it was done.Furthermore I thought I was always aware of some missing scenes here and there. So I can't wait to lay my fingers on the Special Edition-DVD. Only then will I be able to appreciate the full glory of RotK. After my experience with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' I know that the Special Editions are far superior to the cinematic versions (which seems almost impossible anyway, doesn't it).But don't listen to my babbling - go see the movie! It is good fun to watch and will blow you away. I'm an arachnophobe, naturally Shelob scared me out of my socks! There are some wonderful Gollum-scenes (thanks, Andy), the ending in Mount Doom is breathtaking, the battles are boombastic, the art department and especially the conceptual artists have outdone themselves, and everything is created and executed with so much love and care for detail.Peter Jackson has rightfully earned his seat in the eternal Olymp of the greatest film directors of all time.

"A decent film, nothing more, nothing less.","I am astounded by the sheer magnitude of praise that this film, and its two predecessors, has received.This film is overstuffed, overacted, and over-directed, and yet, it elicits a fanatical following of kool-aid drinkers who bought into the hype. There are just too many things wrong with this film and the series in general for me to look at it in an objective manner and say it is one of the best films of all time.It's definitely not Best Picture-worthy, but it can hold its head high as one of the better sci-fi/fantasy films in cinema history. Maybe it's just my non-conformist nature, but I find myself, a year removed from the last release of the three LOTR films, questioning the magnetic power of this lumbering behemoth of a film.I just find myself in awe of the rabid following this movie has generated.It's good, not great.

Amazing,"I watched the trilogy yesterday at a theatre in Ontario, Canada yesterday and it was the most amazing experience. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire 'Return of the King' even though I have read the books multiple times and knew the ending it was amazing to watch it brought to life on the screen. If they do not give Jackson and Mortensen the Oscars it will be travesty. I still believe they should create some category where Andy Serkis (and the developers) could win for his amazing portrayal. I do realize that the developers brought him to the screen, but with Serkis I think Gollum might not have been such an amazing character.I just can't believe the waiting is over (until the extended version) it is somewhat of a letdown. It's over. It has been done and done well. Who ever would have thought it was possible. Apparently, Jackson. Kudos to you Mr. Jackson thank you for bringing this to the screen and doing such an amazing job. Viggo Mortensen, thank you so much for bringing my hopes of what Aragorn would be to the screen. You went above and beyond what ever could have hoped for for the character that I have been love with since I was eight years old.Amazing movie! Amazing trilogy!

The story is changing...,"Well, Peter Jackson has done it again - made a movie where I felt a little put out by the omissions and gratuitous additions, and had initial difficulties dealing with some of his choices as a director, especially one or two instances of cheesy effects. I felt it rather obvious where scenes had been shortened or cut out entirely, and I find the rumour that over an hour of footage was removed from the final cut entirely believable.I still hold true to the idea that, as there are six books, six movies would have been ideal and would have allowed enough screen time to avoid cutting out any of the material - HOWEVER - I remember feeling this way about the first two movies, and now that I have viewed them countless times I love them dearly. Furthermore, some things that I had thought erroneous previously are actually contained in the books, as I discovered afterwards upon close scrutiny. Judging by that, I have to stand behind Peter Jackson as having done an immense amount of research, almost to the point where he is more of an authority than I. I have great respect for this man, and I have no doubt that Return of the King will garner several Oscars - perhaps not exclusively for the film itself, but for the series as a whole, which has yet to be officially recognized by the Academy - surely they are waiting to award everything to the concluding film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
simple but amazing,"eying that this film starts where 'Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. 'Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of 'Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in 'Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need tone up on your 'Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film. I want see this movie again and again",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

They saved the best for last,"An unbelievable achievement! I felt that the ""Return of the King"" (ROTK) theatrical release was better than either ""Fellowship of the Ring"" (FOTR) or ""The Two Towers"" (TTT) theatrical releases. I felt that ROTK stayed pretty close to the book, having re-read the book last week in preparation for the movie. I'm a big Tolkien fan, but I can see where someone who hasn't seen either of the first two movies or read any of the books might feel a little left out. If you haven't seen either FOTR or TTT, I would strongly suggest viewing those two films prior to viewing ROTK. Of course, if you're going to see ROTK and haven't seen either of the first two films, you must have been living under a rock.  As for me, the only movie I have left to look forward to is for the extended edition of ROTK, or possibly ""The Hobbit"" if Peter Jackson is allowed to make it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Most Satisfying Ending To Any Movie-Franchise,"I am, after my i believe 6 or 7th Rewatch, still again in Awe Of These Movies !Greatest Trilogy ever",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"At this point, it's all about the payoff and ""Return of the King'"" delivers","When a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings,"" its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. Such is the case of ""The Return of the King,"" an absolutely colossal conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic vision.Considering a majority of ""Return of the King"" is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters, the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. If you loved the previous films, you can't not love this one more. It's not necessarily that the film is better. Rather, it's so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end, it stands out as an incredible experience, hence its winning of the Oscar for Best Picture.After the Battle of Helm's Deep and the defeat of Isengard, the armies of Mordor move on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith. With King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of Gondor, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride there to convince the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), the mourning father of Boromir, to extend his hand to Rohan and in effect, to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) heir to the throne and rightful king of Gondor, a title the ranger struggles with.The War of the Ring is something to behold, even though it's interrupted by Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) quest to cast the Ring back into the fires of Mt. Doom. Rather than having the forces of Sauron and the armies of Gondor and Rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear, the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides, namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching Minas Tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph.On the other end, we know that Gollum (Andy Serkis) has plans to betray Frodo and Sam in order to repossess his one and only Precious. The debate between the two hobbits on whether Gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of Gollum's intentions, and by this point, with the Ring reaching Mordor, it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on Frodo.The story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the War of the Ring and in Frodo and Sam's quest to destroy the Ring, and it's easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it can't possibly end in a horrible way. That's testament to the power of the storytelling going on here.How ""Return of the King"" really one ups ""The Two Towers"" is that it doesn't feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. The momentum of the impending battle and Frodo and Sam inching closer and closer to Mt. Doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. No scene feels obligatory or like its stalling, and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger.From an action and visual spectacle standpoint, ""Return of the King"" completely outdoes the previous chapters. A battle sequence in which Legolas (Orlando Bloom) takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. Even with all the doom and gloom, there's still plenty of humor in this one as well.The resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of ""Two Towers"" in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. Everything that Eowyn (Miranda Otto) does in ""Two Towers"" feel for naught by the end of that film, but she gets her shining moment in ""Return of the King"" that brings her character full circle.""Return of the King"" works well on its own, but it also proves that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was meant to be watched together as a trilogy, as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. Jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entity; you couldn't just hold off on the rest of the series if ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" didn't pan out financially.The emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production, for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing, while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time Frodo and Sam reach the summit of Mt. Doom. As with their journey in the story, once you've gone this far as a viewer, you're incredibly committed to the outcome, and what an outcome. Bravo.~Steven CThanks for reading!

That ending was pathetic. I laughed so hard!,"Of the three I think the Two Towers is the strongest. I thought the beginning of Fellowship was weak and boring, but I loved it's end. Bit now we have ROTK and I was hoping for more than I got. The beginning was disjointed, clearly the movie was affected by something having been cut. The middle was fanntastic. But that ending?!?!?!WHAT?!?!Ten different slow motion endings that made no sense. Homosexual hobbits jumping on a bed. In the showing I went to half the audience, myself included were laughing at just how pathetic this was.Just like AI ruined itself when the movie should have finished with the boy staring at the submerged statue, so ROTK should have ended with Frodo and Sam on the rock surrounded by lava.

Good movie but it brings nothing new and the end takes toooo long...,"The third movie brings nothing more than the second... It has more goofs than the second i won't enumerate them here. The end is so boring that when I went to the cinema to see it, all people stood up about 3 times in the last 20 minutes to go home... It also misses one important chapter when Saruman destroys the Shire... Some characters have no meaning in the movie (Faramir, Witch King)... Witch King has very big orientation problems trying to hit Eowyn with that big weapon rather than use some witchcraft to kill her... Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) doesn't have the voice of a King when he tries to encourage the army to fight (see Braveheart (Mel Gibson) or Gladiator (Russel Crowe))...It would have probably been a great movie without the first 2 parts, but this one brings nothing new or extraordinary except the Undead army which kills all orcs BAAH !If you are interested in special effects then go watch the movie, if you are interested in how the story ends better read the book.6 points out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

You'll be surprised at how good it is the SECOND time around,"I admit it:  I'm a bit of a late-blooming Middle Earth geek.  I never played D&D role-playing games as a kid, but in recent years have actually played them with a group of guys who grew up on that stuff.  Regardless, I was NOT a Lord of the Rings fan whatsoever when the first movie came out.  In fact, I knew very little about it, and indifferently agreed to go to see it two years ago.I was completely blown away.Since then, I've become a full-fledged LOTR fan, having devoured the books now twice.  Last year, a group of us (yes, the same thirtysomething dorks that I play role-playing games with) went to see ""The Two Towers"" at 12:01 a.m. the day it opened.  We did the same thing again this year with ""Return of the King"".This is an utterly fantastic movie, and the phraseology understates just how tremendous it really is.  This is the epitome of an epic film and is, in my opinion, the ""biggest"" movie (scope, grandeur, depth, overall size of presentation) ever made.  It is a HUGE movie, without question the ""biggest"" of the series.  You don't have hundreds of orcs at a time like in ""Fellowship"" or even ten thousand in battle like in ""Two Towers"" -- you have a HUNDRED THOUSAND.  You don't just have a cave troll, you have twenty hammer-wielding trolls.  You don't have three Oliphaunts like in ""Two Towers"", you have a dozen.  Throw in swarms of fell beasts, Nazgul, the army of the dead and the kitchen sink while you're at it.  This is an unbelievably impressive movie.I saw it a second time with my 11-year old daughter (also a LOTR nut) and the emotions shifted.  I was of course still impressed, but much of my feelings shifted to pride.  I was proud of Aragorn for finally assuming the leadership mantel, proud of Gandalf for being the born leader he is, proud of Eowyn for standing up to the Witch King, proud of Merry for going to battle against all odds and *especially* proud of Sam's courage through adversity.  His stand against the feral, horrific Shelob is a sight to behold (and the special effects, especially when she has him cornered and is coming at him from above and to the side, are jaw-dropping).I'll be honest:  I loved the original movie, as I felt it spun a tale of classic good versus evil, which clearly etched the undermanned, underdog human/elf/dwarf/hobbit fellowship against the legions of evil.  It had ""heart"".  The second movie was good, but lost some of the original's wondrousness along the way.  The final chapter regains the franchise's ""heart"" with a classic tale, told in a soaring, rousing fashion.  I'm not sure if I like ""Fellowship"" or ""Return of the King"" better, but I'm happy to say that it's a damn close call either way.See the movie once more, at least.  See if your amazement turns to another emotion or two along the way.  I know mine did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A tribute and anticipating the prequel/sequel,"The Lord of the Rings was a unique film made by a director and cast that were in tune with the book from which it was taken.

The Return of the Epic,"The critique that Saruman was noticeably absent is accurate.  The critique that the ending went on a bit too long is accurate.  The critique that the score was unoriginal is accurate (however it does provide continuity with the previous movies-as it should).HOWEVER - those critiques are in the deep shadows of this brilliant final film.  Overwhelming is perhaps the best adjective for this.Jackson demonstrates not only great direction, but incredible vision, and huge cajones.  It will be a long time (maybe never) before anyone tries anything as ambitious as this and not only pulls it off but does so spectacularly.  If they ever run all three movies together, I'll buy a seat cushion and be first in line.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
You will suffer me,"Gondor comes under attack from Sauron's armies as Frodo, Sam and Gollum reach Mordor.This is an action-heavy, crowd pleasing final chapter to the trilogy that gives a satisfying conclusion. Like other fantasy-adventure movie sagas it involves mass conflict, suspense, glory and reflection.Amongst all the spectacular action scenes and beautiful imagery there are moments that stand out for me. The lighting of the beacons, the charge of the Rohirrim, Eowyn's girl-power moment, Aragorn whispering ""For Frodo"", and all scenes involving the hobbits are brilliantly done, particularly Frodo's ending.As with the previous two movies your opinion of Peter Jackson's take on the source material will likely influence your enjoyment of 'Return of the King'. The pacing of this film for me is slightly better than 'The Two Towers', but personally I think the sense of hopelessness followed by elation generated by the Battle of Helms Deep is never quite matched by the spectacle here at Minas Tirith. Also by the time it rushes the characters to the Battle of the Morannon, my senses feel quite saturated by large scale battle sequences.That being said these are only minor gripes in a largely excellent movie. What I particularly appreciate is that it does not end in total celebration and glory. Tolkien acknowledged the damage war does to the soul as an important theme in the book, and I'm glad this is incorporated into the film's arc for the character Frodo.Much like 'The Two Towers' the visual spectacle and CGI dominate far more than the characters and performances. The movie has great computer animated sequences that are par for the course now in large scales Hollywood movies, but it is a totally different cinematic art form than the type of movies I regard to be classic cinema. I won't name any, but let's just say they rely on great cinematography, editing, sound, and performances above digital effects. That's not to say that this movie does not contain the above, as it does, but the computer programming for me dominates mostly everything. One example is the scene where Theoden gives his rallying speech before the Rohirrim attack the Orc infantry. This should be a moment where Bernard Hill's presence commands your attention, but it's difficult to sometimes make out every word he is saying. This is not the actor's fault, it is how he is filmed and the clarity of the audio.The cast are all solid as in the previous movies. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan and Miranda Otto have the best opportunities to shine on a pretty crowded screen. For me the standout performance once again is Andy Serkis.Looking back at the trilogy with today's streaming services in mind, I wonder if Jackson ever wonders if he could have done a better service to Tolkien's imagination with a series.For me an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
is everybody crazy?,"I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three.  I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning.  I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful.  Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness.  Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief.  The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (""A diversion!"") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question.  Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background.  It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive.  Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake.  Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from.  Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes.  Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops.  Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right?  They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long.  The songs were good.  The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent.  Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies.  The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace.  ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT.  And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good.  *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy.  Gak!

But these are 3 of the biggest movies of all time, and the only thing keeping them from being solely wonders in visual effects is the emotion felt in each movie. Sam is the hero in ROTK and carries the film. So the Academy should give Sean Astin what he deserves and nominate him for the Oscar for supporting actor. Anyone who has seen the film know the reasons why he has earned it. It must be difficult to play an emotional character like Sam, but imagine doing so when nearly all of your scenes are against computer generated images. Whereas Frodo would not have succeeded without Sam, Elijah Wood would have been nothing without Sean Astin. So let's do the right thing this time Academy and not the the crappy Golden Globes dictate what you do. It's time to honor Lord of the Rings with the Best Picture Oscar, Best Director Oscar and Best Suppporting Actor Oscar for Sean Astin. Lord of the Rings should have won in 2001 and 2002. Peter Jackson should have won both years also. But instead the less than mediocre 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Chicago' won just like the Golden Globes. The Academy also had a chance to do something original at last years awards. They could have been the first awards show to nominate a cgi character (Gollum played marvelously by Andy Serkis). But instead they opted to follow the Golden Globes and nominate 4 out of the 5 that were nominated for the globes. So what will the Academy do this year? Are they simply going to give the award to 'Cold Mountain' since it got the most globe nominations? Or maybe Peter Jackson will be snubbed again by the Academy since one nomination 2 years ago was enough. Is Sean Astin a big enough name for the Academy to honor (Seriously, William H. Macy in Seabiscuit. I liked the movie but it's not nearly his best work)? It's time for the Academy to step up and show why their award show is taken seriously and the Golden Globes are simply a joke (Anything that nominates Billy Bob Thornton for 'Bad Santa' or Goldie Hawn for 'The Banger Sisters'(2002) should not be considered anything but a joke). Honor the cast and crew of the greatest trilogy ever made with a victory. Nominations aren't enough anymore. It's time for a 'fantasy' type movie to win. If far below average dramas (A Beautiful Mind) and very mediocre musicals (Chicago) can win, then there is no reason why a nearly flawless in every way fantasy movie can't win. I guess it's time to see if the Academy Awards should be taken seriously.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Definitely not Second Greatest,"OK. The movie was OK. It took forty-five minutes to end, and really could have had a lot more on the cutting room floor, but I'll let the idea that it deserved best picture of 2003 slide for now. But there's no chance in hell that it's the number 2 all time movie. That's just nuts. I liked it, don't get me wrong; it was nice. But it was really just a blockbuster without any real meaning. When I left the theater, there were no questions I asked myself. Maybe someone could say I learned something about friendship, but really it was just pure entertainment. Saying this movie even ranks with the greatest movies of all time is just plain crazy. The only reason it even won Best Picture was Hollywood's newly founded appreciation in the epic. There were definitely better movies made in 2003, for instance, The House of Sand and Fog. The movie, sure it was good, but it definitely doesn't deserve a lot of the hullabaloo it's received.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Braindead,"Well, the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie, which hasn't much common with the great book from Tolkin. ""The Return of the King"" has some nice battle scenes, but it's just another action movie with mostly good special effects. Many good parts of the original book where totally twisted, mixed or deleted with not much sense, and some very stupid parts are just invented from Peter Jackson, to show more of this not so impressive Orlando Blum. It's good that Tolkin can't see this movie - I just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave. My hint to Peter Jackson: Stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like ""Braindead"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Cool,"It was a very cool and inspiring movie, it was kind of long for my taste, maybe that's why I only gave it an 8 but I really felt close to the story from beginning to end, even though it was kind of long i still actually wanted more. I know that sounds a little contradictory but the movie just pulled me in and brought me to a place where I was actually sucked into the whole world of the lord of the rings and I felt what everyone was feeling and although it was long time seemed to move by fast and 3 hrs felt almost like 1 or 1 and a half which for my taste is kinda long or just pushing it, maybe that's why it was a little confusing for me time wise but overall I thought it was a solid movie. As far as the acting I thought it was good. No one really stood out on that front but maybe that's what they were going for so nobody really out shined another actor, it was a team effort at I admired that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Incredible viewing experience ... 10/10,"(Opening night, post-midnight showing, 5:00am)  Only a very quick set of reactions, because I'm really tired: the film was amazing, incredible, mind-blowing, and every bit worthy of its hype (and then some).Personally I loved the long series of endings that seem to be the sticking point for most casual viewers All that went before redefined the word ""spectacular.""I was prepared for the alterations from the book, so I wasn't as annoyed as I was by The Two Towers. Would I have made different choices regarding the major changes Maybe; But then again, I could never have accomplished 0.000001% of what Jackson & Co. did -- even if I were given twice the resources that they were.Of course I missed the obvious scenes (EE or unfilmed): the confrontation with Saruman, the Houses of Healing, the Scouring, etc.  Overall, however, I was thrilled with all that was retained.For the record, I also love the book and have read it numerous times. Contrary to extremist dogma, it IS possible to love both the book and the films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Epic Conclusion,"Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King is no doubt the best of the Trilogy. I saw the extended version (the 3 hour and a half stuff) and that was brilliant. Long but brilliant. Gollum's revenge, the end of the journey and sadly, a few losses make this trilogy the best on Middle-earth. The action sequences are just wow with more action than you can possibly dream of. The constant plot twists, the romance that is not returned and the heroic action is wonderful. I really enjoyed this film and I hope you will too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
