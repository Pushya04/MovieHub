All The Time in the World,"Looper is an exciting and mentally stimulating science fiction movie that goes above and beyond in the realm of creativity. Original and thought provoking in its execution, this is a movie about time travel with a future that is gritty, plausible, and fantastic to absorb.Taking its cues from hard hitting gangster movies, the story follows Joe, a young man living in 2044 America that is crippled with economic collapse. He works for the mafia as a ""looper"". This is a job that requires some explanation. You see, 30 years from 2044, time travel will be invented. It is highly illegal, but is used by the mob to dump bodies, because it is impossible to do so in the future-future. Loopers get set times and places where they wait for their victims to appear, bound, gagged, and with a mask over their head. Sometimes a looper ends up killing himself from the future. This begins happening quite often, and rumor has it that a man named the Rain Maker is ordering the killings of all loopers. Joe does not seem to think much of this until his future self arrives, without a mask on. His future self escapes, looking for the child who will one day become the Rain Maker. Young Joe finds a woman and her young, troubled boy who are one of the people on Old Joe's map. He decides to wait there to confront his older self, to try and make things right with the mob.The movie twists and turns in unexpected ways that create a true feeling of suspense. Rian Johnson takes major influences from the likes of Martin Scorsese to craft a cold and calculating crime film. However, Johnson makes a movie that is so original and eclectic that it is obvious this is the work of a man who knows how to tell a story. There is plenty of action, but it never becomes more important than the story or the characters. Johnson also wrote the script, and he brings humanity to all of the players involved. The introduction of alternate timelines is only the beginning of the insane subplots that pop up, and all fit nicely together. The gritty and subdued style invokes a noir aspect that only serves to enhance the movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays young Joe. He is fantastic as the cool, calm, and collected gunman. His face is altered with makeup to make him look more like old Joe, played by Bruce Willis. Levitt even speaks like the action star. Willis is really great in a subdued and complicated performance, although it would have been nice for his character to have had a more expanded role; he seems to fall into the role of the antagonist too quickly. Emily Blunt plays the hardened and self reliant mother of the boy old Joe is hunting. Blunt's character is used well and she gives an excellent performance.Looper is a bizarre movie, and that is a very good thing. Exciting, thoughtful, and at times disturbing, this film is mesmerizing to watch. It's not often that an action film is even half as good as this one, and rarely are movies so much fun to watch.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Refreshingly original,"Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations, Looper thunders onto the screen, showing, much like Inception did two years ago, that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it's done right.The film tells the story of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hit-man for an organised crime syndicate tasked with assassinating targets sent from the future. After being confronted with his future self (Bruce Willis) and failing to perform, Young Joe is forced to track down Old Joe and finish the job before being tracked down himself by the nefarious mob led by Abe (Jeff Daniels). However there is much more to the story than the basic premise, and Johnson isn't afraid to keep details close to his chest until later in the film than most movies of this type, so I won't spoil them here.While certainly paying subtle homage to its predecessors, Looper is a stunningly original sci-fi masterpiece, vastly superior to any of the higher profile action releases this year. While certainly made on a much larger playing field than Johnson's previous work (Brick, The Brothers Bloom), there is still a small-scale, independent feel to the film, and it benefits from clearly staying completely under the control of the young director. Delivering excitement sprinkled with thoughtful themes of personal sacrifice, he offers us much to chew on.Johnson understands that a successful action film doesn't need an explosion every ten minutes, and allows ample time for developing character and story, something which will likely divide audiences. Looper is very deliberately constructed, and after the highly charged opening establishing the intricate time-travel premise and direction of the plot, Johnson scales back the action almost too much as he ambitiously juggles the many and varied story elements he has created. Thankfully, any weakness in the middle of the film is largely overshadowed as Johnson launches the third act with such ferocity that the stark change of pace leaves you breathless.Despite the problems in the middle of the film, Looper overcomes its flaws purely by being that rare beast in Hollywood nowadays, the totally original script. Not an adaptation, not a sequel or remake, but a fresh idea from the mind of an immensely talented young film-maker. In a perfect world, Looper would be the game changer it deserves to be, slapping Hollywood studios across the face and announcing that not everything has to be a PG-13 franchise based on a comic book. It's unlikely that this will the case, and it remains to be seen whether or not the film will even be a success, but it's encouraging to see that there are young auteurs at work who are fighting to craft new and exciting stories, even if we only get to see the results every year or two.tinribs27.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Parenthood and Self-Sacrifice,"i always approach a film especially when it is classified as scifi with liberal suspension of disbelief. because it is only through that that i was able to appreciate such scifi gems as Stargate and Fifth Element and many other that were otherwise written off by these so-called critics.Looper is one of those films that should be appreciated by its message more than its genre. it uses the science fiction medium, complete with action stunts and wonders, as an apt and well-sculpted vehicle to a very beautiful message of self-sacrifice and positive reinforcement parenthood. the film goes to extra length to make the story plausible and solid and the actors, including the 'rainmaker' child, did a marvelous job of pulling it off.i've always believed that the soul of any film, even as i appreciate great plot twists and great special fx and great acting and direction (yeah, i said great too many times!), is the message and/or portrait it intends to get across.

We are entering a Loop 7/10,"""Looper"" by Rian Johnson is an impressive film with an original story. Centers in the future where assassins known as ""Loopers"" kill targets who are transported from the past by the mob. Joe, a skilled assassin discovers he has to kill his older self sent from the past and unveils a plot that will effect his life of both his and his older self. The movie is great and relies on the term of ""cat and mouse"" game between all characters. Joseph Gordon Leavitt is a great actor and portrays perfectly every role of his. As the main character he does a good job. Bruce Willis is amazing yet again, his performance reminded me of his role in ""12 Monkeys"": a traveler from time who is a skilled assassin and needs to stop a plot from happening. Emily Blunt is as always, Emily Blunt. I mean there's nothing wrong with her performance but her character is annoying and reminded me of her role in ""Sicario"". The film in general is good and has it's moments but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it immediately after seeing the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Very clever, very original and very welcome.","I would have thought it doubtful that anyone could have anything new to add to the sci-fi sub category of time travel movies. After watching Looper yesterday, i'm happy to report that Rian Johnson has removed those doubts and given me hope that sci-fi in Hollywood can be more than just empty spectacle.First off i would say, don't get discouraged from watching the film if you think its going to be too complex or difficult to follow. To follow the story and recognise characters motivations does require a little concentration, but not to the point that you wont enjoy the action beats and other more visceral elements.The story is well constructed, information and plot points are presented at an entertaining and well judged pace. There are some nice little throw away visual references and metaphors which, if you catch them, add a nice texture to the story and stop it feeling too clinical in its plotting.The script is tight, hard edged and very dry in its humour, the actors are fantastic. I think its fair to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is well on his way to being ""one to watch"", Bruce Willis pops back to life here, clearly enjoying himself again, (although i wouldn't say this is solely a Bruce Willis movie in that definition).This is a brilliant movie experience, its an wholly original and entertaining idea, that the writer/director has managed to successfully transpose to film without, it would appear to a layman, pressure or interference from external sources.No matter how much of a good time you will have watching this film (and you will), Hollywood could stand to learn much more from it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Could be a cult classic.,"""This time travel crap just fries your brain like an egg."" (Abe)Not since Children of Men (2006) and Source Code (2011) have I been as jazzed up as I am now about Rian Johnson's Looper. Here's sci-fi that will happily fry your brain as you figure out the implications of changing the future by altering the present. Also throw in thoughts about Christopher Nolan's Memento and Inception to get the flavor of Looper.But as Sinatra sings, ""Regrets I've had a few, but then too few to really mention,"" this film challenges you to think of the implications of reversing those regrets or keeping the future the same because you kind of like the way things went.Joseph Gordon Levitt's Joe is a ""looper,"" an assassin who goes into the past to murder someone needed to be absent in the future, 2072. The Mob, headed by a very relaxed and dangerous Jeff Daniels as Abe, determines to eliminate all loopers, and Joe is next on the list to kill himself by flashing back. Yes, it's existentially a difficult task, and therein lies the drama of this satisfying sci-fi.With less CGI and few glitzy machines (in fact most of the vehicles look shabby 2012 and the loopers' weapon is a sawed-off Steampunk shot gun—how's that for past and future?), this thriller relies to an effective degree on the excellent cast to relay the challenges inherent in altering any past.Because it's an intelligent tale, the overall theme of responsibility for our actions (the existential part) flows quietly from the action, be it as simple as running from the bad guys to the complexity of deciding on the sacrifices willing to be made to alter the future.A leitmotiv of this film is that no one is immune from the effects of the past, Sinatra notwithstanding in his apparent satisfaction with how things turned out. For Looper, cult status is its future.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intelligent  Science Fiction Thriller,"Looper is a film that goes to extraordinary lengths to leave every base covered in its quest to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies and in my mind it deals with the problems associated with time travel very well. One thing I liked is that the older Joe is aware of everything the younger Joe is about to do which gives him an edge if they were to do battle. I also liked that the older Joe in true Bruce Willis style bypasses the whole idea of trying to work out how and why what is happening is happening by saying he can't be bothered to work it all out. As well as the older Joe having the advantage of memory over the younger Joe, the younger Joe in turn has his own advantages which become apparent. There were several times when I thought I'd worked out what was going to happen or what a particular character's arc was going to be but the film cleverly manipulates its audience, leading them down alleyways only to jump out at them from behind and spin them around. There is a nice early twist which gave me a smile and plenty more to keep you guessing right the way to the end. In the end it turns out that time travel plays second fiddle to another phenomenon which I was pleased by as there was no mention of this in the trailer which I've been trying to avoid for several weeks. The plot is multifaceted with each character having their own reasons for being where they are, when they are and doing what they are doing. It is a dense plot which explores several different ideas and concepts both personal and scientific.As well as confidently dealing with a complex script which would have been very easy to either make too complicated or too full of holes, Writer/Director Rian Johnson (Brick) also creates a very believable future and fills it with people and events which feel plausible. Cities have continued to expand upwards and outwards but they themselves are filled with tent cities in which a large vagrant class live. Life is cheap and hard in this world in which the have's and have not's are much more separated than today. There is enough in the film to make to world feel as though it is our near future and the technology on display feels as though it is a few logical steps along the road. I especially liked the ingenious solution to running cars after the inevitable the oil crisis and there's also a great line about China in there which had a lot of people laughing.The writing and direction are superb but another strength are the acting performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt wears heavy makeup and prosthetics to make him look more like Bruce Willis and although this is occasionally a little distracting, it looks unnervingly good at times, especially closer up which is odd. The effect is actually better in close up than when JG-L is in the middle distance. Underneath the prosthetics though Gordon-Levitt delivers a fine performance, adopting a few of Willis' telltale mannerisms and affectations but avoiding pure mimicry. He appears confident and at ease in the dense lead role, carrying off a mixture of hard edged killer and caring young man while switching from one to the other with ease. Bruce Willis equally is very good but we have seen this kind of performance from him many times before. Nevertheless he is on good form here. The chemistry between the two leads was great and really helped with the believability of them being one person. Emily Blunt was another actor who performed very well and in a departure from her more familiar roles. She adopts a convincing American accent, drops a few F-Bombs and looks comfortable holding a gun. She brings to the fore the feminine caring side when it matters though. Probably the standout actor though despite the three A Listers is Pierce Gagnon, a very young child actor who is incredible in a pivotal role. He and Gordon-Levitt have some funny and tense scenes together which work very well.Overall there was little I didn't like about Looper and it has gone straight into my Top 10 films of the year so far as well as being probably my favourite Sci-Fi since 2009's Moon. It treats its audience with respect and isn't afraid to keep you them of the loop for a while as it teases them with false and sometimes seemingly false information. It is well designed and acted and features a wonderfully multifaceted and intelligent story which rewards patience and concentration with a fantastic ending.www.attheback.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A novel twist on time travel,"There are some parts of this film I like SO MUCH. It's too bad there are many others that just drag on. The first 25 minutes are genuinely entertaining. This is where the movie sets up the plot, introduces the main character, (who gives a great performance) and exposes the movie's unique take on time travel. However, the rest of the film is just your average chase thriller. Not bad, but just not that good. I have watched and rewatched the first 25 minutes, and they are uniformly terrific. When I started watching it for the first time, I had to call my wife into the living room because those first 25 minutes TOTALLY drew me in. Unfortunately, like so many movies of today, it soon veers off into the trite and predictable. A shame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
High Concept Intrigue,"Looper seems like it's inspired by Philip K. Dick's several works. It's a Sci-Fi story that is set in the future with a quite interesting concept. The ads shows this as a typical nonstop action film. Surprisingly, it's much better than anyone would expect. It's actually a mind blowing film that tells an unpredictable story and has a great amount of thrills. The performances are strong and the directing is solid. Unlike most modern Sci-Fi films they depend on the action and the explosions. Looper is all about letting the audience intrigue all the way on the concept.The important thing you should expect in this film is the brilliance of the concept than the action. Yeah, there's fighting and gunfights but it's mostly about the idea. The film tells it in a stylish and mind boggling way which makes it compelling. The story development is clever. The first half lets the viewers root for the film's world until the plot twists. It's great when a scene suddenly becomes confusing then it all make sense afterwards. Aside of its storytelling, Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job playing the young version of Bruce Willis as he imitates Willis' accent and gruffness. He still plays the role with his own style. Gordon-Levitt is energetic and striking. The rest of the cast are excellent.The production design is decent. Its futuristic world looks magnificent and their weaponry looks awesome. The camera-work is one of the merits of the film. It makes the action look stylish and brings cool vertigo to the trippy moments. Every shot of the film is impressive. The most interesting one is when Joe was in the fields, you prominently see a cloud trail on the sky remarking the scene. The script is smart enough for explaining its concept and making things gripping.Looper is one of those films that would stuck in your head in a long time because it's plain brilliant. It's so different to popular modern Sci-Fi films. This film is not an action movie cookie-cutter that leaves the high concept as the background of the film. This film simply narrates, mind-bends, and intrigues which makes it amazingly interesting. The idea is original with some inspiration. Looper has the art, the heart, the tension, and the brains that any science fiction fans would love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an egg""","Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred, surely Y would happen, which means X wouldn't happen after all And so it is with Looper.Alas, to avoid dishing out hugely unpopular plot spoilers I need to skirt around the concerns, so you'll just have to come round with cake and we can discuss it in private. But there are some pretty substantial issues with Looper that cause questions to be asked and lead to more than a couple of possible explanations as to what exactly is going on. Don't see it alone; you'll need a friend around to discuss it on the journey home.Equally, don't be put off. You don't need to be Einstein to enjoy Looper, as some of the audience provedIn 2072, time travel is both possible and illegal and murder is more easily solved because corpses are harder to lose. However mobs and Mafiosi types are prevalent and have ingeniously devised a solution: tie your victim up and send him back in time to a location where a looper will be waiting to blow his/her brains out. However, when a looper's contract is up, they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older, Old Joe (Bruce Willis) outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren't called Joe.Confused? Good. Don't think any more or you'll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like, Is he actually... Dammit.Along with the quirks, possibilities and matters left to interpretation, there are one or two clear boo-boos that cut against the rules writer/director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) has set himself. I'm sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I'm giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It's not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.There's only one way to watch Looper: suspend all disbelief, put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed, it's a superb film. No, it's not as intelligent a film as Inception, but it kicks the ass of Wanted and Gordon-Levitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.I'm not sure that I buy Gordon-Levitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn't stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He's matured as an actor and, though he's been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades, it's the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there's no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg's Lincoln and Don Jon's Addiction (which he also wrote and directed) in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.As for Willis, it's good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt (Sara) and Jeff Daniels ably provide support, the former, sadly, barely stretched and the latter, as Abe, the loopers' boss, clearly enjoying himself. Equally, Paul Dano gives a wonderful, trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to Gordon-Levitt and One Tree Hill's Pierce Gagnon as the child, Cid, whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement!There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because s/he knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn't the case with Maximum Overdrive (Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again) but with Looper it's a very strong case in point.Johnson, though he bends his rules, has created a multi-layered, rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and to-die-for quips, to wit, ""I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand."" He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause, cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint, jump or shoot-out. Though he has nothing (publicly) on the slate, there'll be plenty more from him in the next few years.As is increasingly the case, my biggest complaint with last night's viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening, namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium (big thumbs down to Cineworld) and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood, even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah, but these are niggles and hopefully you won't be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you'll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you, but if you don't mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception, then Looper is for you.Just don't think too hard.

Looper is a thrill ride that has a nice blend of thrilling action and matters of the heart.,"Time travel sci-fi movies are inherently intriguing to me, so when I first saw the trailer with THIS cast, I knew I wanted to see it.As in the trailer, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. He lives in the year 2042 but the mob he works for lives 30 years ahead where time travel would've been invented. When his employer from the future wants to get rid of someone, they zap that person back 30 years where someone like Joe would be waiting with a big gun in hand, ready to blow them up to oblivion. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you. The job seems easy enough, I mean, the targets are blindfolded, so it's not like they could really escape. That is, until one did, and that target happens to be his older self, in the form of Bruce Willis.Now, before the action begins in full throttle, Director Rian Johnson sets up the story by introducing the Looper doing their jobs and how these junkies hit-men spend their lives in a dystopian future (is there any other kind in the movies??). ""Loopers are well paid, they lead a good life..."" Joe said in his narration, but what he means by 'good' doesn't mean a happy one and it's clear that Joe is disillusioned with his life.Let me just say the less you know about the plot the better as I went in pretty much 'blind,' other than seeing the trailer weeks ago, and it's fun to see the story unravel in ways I didn't really expect. There's really a lot to chew on here, as do most time-travel movies, and I have to admit it was a bit mind-boggling to digest it all as I'm watching it, but now that I've processed the movie more, Johnson actually told the story well enough without an overly drawn-out exposition.The strengths are in the performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who seems to only get better and better as he grows to be a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Seems like every time I see him, even in minor roles like in 'Inception' or 'The Dark Knight Rises,' he never fails to impress. I've got to admit though, his prosthetic make-up to make him look like Bruce Willis is distracting at times, but once I get into the story, I got used to it. In fact, in some scenes Gordon-Levitt's mannerism and expressions really do remind me of Willis! Now, I've always been a fan of Bruce. He's a bad ass guy with a heart and I feel that he sold me on the emotional moments as well as on the action front, in which he channels his iconic John McClane in the 'Die Hard' franchise. In fact, I kept waiting for him to yell 'Yiippiikayee' during some of the shootout scenes! I'm also impressed with Emily Blunt and child actor Pierce Gagnon who plays her little boy. Both played two key roles that serve as the emotional center of the story. Their paths crossed with both the younger and older Joe in a way that not only affect their own lives but the lives of Joe's fellow Loopers. Their scenes with Gordon-Levitt are well-played, though it could perhaps be tightened a bit as it does feel dragging at times. Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano also lend memorable supporting performances, Daniels is sort of a comic relief as Joe's manager who happens to be sent by the mob from the future.It's refreshing to see a movie based on an original script, not an adaptation nor a remake. Despite all the time travel elements, the film also doesn't feel too science-fiction-y. I'm also glad Johnson doesn't pile on one action set pieces after another, instead there are a lot of quiet moments to establish character development that help you get immersed in Joe's journey.Final Thoughts: Looper is a thrill ride that has a nice blend of thrilling action and matters of the heart. There are brutal action and some totally-unnecessary nudity here, but fortunately not so much so that derails my overall appreciation for it. At the core of this movie lies a heartfelt love story between a man and a woman, and also between a mother and his son. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Speculative enterprise,"When one deals with time travel as the process has not been discovered everything written or filmed about is always speculative. For instance the Jean-Claude Van Damme film Time Cop shows something quite different when we meet our future and past selves as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis do here in Looper.Instead of the forces of law and latent fascism getting control of time travel in Time Cop, Looper has organized crime doing it and eliminating problems that Robert DeNiro in Casino remarked are usually swallowed up by the Nevada desert. Levitt is a Looper one who travels ahead to the future, specifically trained as an assassin and then goes back to his present origin and as targets come through a time portal, they get eliminated. Then at some point, the future selves are eliminated and the present selves just go on with normal lives as we define normal.Bruce Willis is Levitt's future self only he doesn't like the idea of elimination. And the big boss Jeff Daniels doesn't like how Levitt screwed up the elimination of Willis. The chase is on.Another question answered by Laurence Olivier in The Boys From Brazil said that we should not eliminate a cloned Hitler. Here a telekinesis gene has entered our gene pool and someone in the distant future has been harnessing its full potential to battle organized crime. That's an even bigger mission that the Levitt/Willis problem.Looper is a nice and original take on time travel with an outstanding cast giving some standout performances. Note particularly Emily Blunt as the mother of young Pierce Gagnon who has powers and abilities far beyond those of other mortal beings. And young Gagnon is something to see as well.Looper is definitely worth the price of admission.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, but not as good as it thinks it is","LOOPER is the latest Hollywood movie to tackle the thorny topic of time travel. This one's a little bit like the Van Damme vehicle TIMECOP, although it strives to be less cheesy and more realistic thanks to the presence of former indie director Rian Johnson, who also made the high school murder mystery BRICK with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt plays an assassin who executes criminals sent back from the future for spurious reasons, although inevitably he soon finds his life spiralling out of control when things take an unexpected twist.I really wanted to like this film. It feels fresh and appealing in many ways, and visually it's a triumph. Gordon-Levitt's performance is fine, although that prosthetic make-up is distracting, and it's fair to say that Bruce Willis is pretty good too, as this is probably the best performance he's given in a while. The action sequences, when they come, are efficiently handled.So what gives, then? Well, the truth is that LOOPER isn't quite as entertaining as it thinks it is. For once, the story doesn't really work under close scrutiny. All of the other time travel movies I've seen have made a point of not allowing the characters to encounter themselves in another time period, as this would cause a paradox. In this one, Willis and Gordon-Levitt share cups of coffee together, and it never quite gels.In addition, the pacing is off, with long, boring and tension-free interludes spent sitting around in a farmhouse with the miscast Emily Blunt. Yet another twist involves characters who are telekinetic, which is all a little too much; wasn't the time travel plot enough? Although it's not bad for what it is, LOOPER doesn't hold a candle to the ultra-efficient low budget Spanish time travel movie, TIMECRIMES.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A sci fi masterpiece that combines heart, brains and excitement to make possibly the best film of the year","Sci-fi films often strive for originality. Contrary to what many spiteful internet fan boys claim, Hollywood is not afraid of new ideas, It just doesn't come up with them that frequently. But every so often amidst the failed attempts at being the next matrix or blade runner, there's an inception or a district 9 that makes you believe in the movie industry's commitment to quality once more. With Looper Rian Johnson manages to do something very few films ever do. It makes us think, feel and sit on the edge of our seat often all at once. The premise is not that mind boggling. Whereas other intelligent sci-fi's have convoluted plots that we try to decipher amongst the spectacle Looper sets us up with a basic idea, but an idea that deepens and grows more dimensions than the trailers suggest. To give away too much would be a crime, so its best to go in knowing the basics. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Joe, a specialised assassin known as a Looper. These Loopers are hired for the not too taxing job of assassinating people sent from the future all tied up with a bag over their heads. They then receive payment in the form of ""silver"" attached to the targets back. The looper then disposes of a body that technically doesn't exist and so wont be looked for. However with the job comes a specific requirement. A looper will also have to retire himself by assassinating their future selves this is called ""closing the loop"". And this is where the core of our story begins, but crucially it is not the real focus of the story as it moves on. As you'll know from the trailers Joe is tasked with killing his future self (Bruce Willis) and when he fails to do so is on the run from the criminals who hired him to do so in the first place. Where the story goes from there is unexpected and in places rather dark. There are many smart little details in Johnsons phenomenal script, that really flesh out the world he has created for his film. The characters use their own lexicon and slang, they have their own type of future drugs (taken through eye drops), and some of the details regarding the time travel are inspired. Again to say too much would do the film a great disservice but its clear Johnson has an eye for both ideas and spectacle. The camera moves in such an organic involving way, each frame is so precisely positioned you know if you got the chance you wouldn't change a thing. Techinically the film cannot be faulted. The look is warm and believable, stylistically there are moments that will stay with you long after you've left the cinema (a moving and thrilling ride through 30 years in particular is very cleverly interwoven into the story structure) and the soundtrack fits exquisitely. The characters are all sympathetic and deep with multiple dimensions. Even when one character goes to do something unspeakable mid way through the film, its believable through the brilliant direction of Johnson. The cast are all superb, especially Gordon Levitt who plays a complicated character and evolves him masterfully with the aid of a screenplay that puts character in the foreground and lets the action merely be the cherry on top. Thats not to say that the action is anything less than outstanding. Looper proves that action can still be thrilling with just a few men and some guns but at the same time provides us with some fantastical comic book fantasy spectacle with a dash of surprisingly brutal violence. As the film powers towards an awe inspiring and heartbreaking conclusion we begin to realise just how involved we've become. It actually matters to us what becomes of Joe and how this stylish, smart tale will end. Perhaps its down to a great cast giving it there all. Perhaps its down to great technical wizardry, but most likely its down to the vision of Rian Johnson, who does that rare thing of proving, Hollywood can take risks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi With a Brain,"Looper (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)I think to fully enjoy LOOPER it's best that you go in with very limited knowledge as to the story and the events that happen. If you've seen the trailer then you know all you need to know. The film takes place in the future where ""loopers"" kill people being sent back from the future. A loopers job is over when they send his older self back to be killed. LOOPER is a very rare type of science-fiction film meaning that it has a brain, which is something missing from most of these types of movies. I'm not typically a big fan of the genre but there's no question that when someone takes the time to come up with a great story then the result can be something special. Writer-director Rian Johnson deserves a lot of credit for not only making a smart film but he also deserves credit for keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat and not knowing what's going to happen next. I said it's best to view this film knowing very little about what happens and that's because there are so many twists and turns that it would be a real shame for someone to know what happens before actually seeing the film. Even a smart film will often times go off the rails because the twists become confusing and make no sense but that never happens here. The film flows beautifully in and out of every plot twist and in the end the viewer feels rewarded. The performances are another major plus with both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt doing good work on their own and especially when they're together. Emily Blunt and Paul Dano are also good in their supporting bits. LOOPER is certainly a film that manages to take a familiar plot (time travel) and do something originalwith it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
On Second Thought - Not So Great,"Of course when you sit down with the popcorn to watch a movie about time travel you should be prepared for the time paradoxes and contradictions. In Looper they come in spades but unfortunately in this case they really don't make even a little senseA quick summary of what the film is about: In the far future it is impossible to criminally dispose of bodies so the mob instead beams them back 30 years where ""Loopers"", in league with the future Mafia shoot them dead and crimate the remains. To tie up loose ends these Loopers themselves are also terminated in the same way by their younger selves, 30 years after they retire. This all goes swimmingly until a retiree escapes after being beamed into the past. Chaos ensues...I have to say as I watched the movie unfold I enjoyed it. There was a good balance of action and drama and it was unpredictable enough to keep me on the edge of my seat.However, now I am home I am thinking more about what nonsense the end actually was, (yes, a time paradox) and worse than that I also realize there is not one character in the film I liked. This makes it difficult to rave about later on.Looper currently has a very high IMDb rating. I think over time it will come down to less rarefied altitude as it certainly doesn't deserve to be listed among the all time classics.All that said, it's great fun, so don't let my tepid review stop you from seeing it. Make up your own mind. It's certainly worth watching if you are a sci-fi fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Crazy ideas all jammed together and somehow works,"Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Brick) is the writer and director of this sci-fi film. Like his other projects, this has original if slightly off-kilter thinking in its story. It is not a regular sci-fi movie. There are some crazy ideas going on here. Time travel is not enough. There is also telekinesis, post collapse apocalypse, mob killings, and pre-planned suicide for hire (yeah figure that one out). Does it all make logical sense? I can't tell. But it sure was fun trying to follow it. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as the young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt is refreshingly new. Also staring is Paul Dano and Piper Perabo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Past In The Future.,"To begin, Looper is a sci-fi film set in the future, dealing with the implications of time-travel, although it is very much a film about the past. The film is all about the past, how it affects the present and the future and how it drives people with the majority of the film building characters and establishing plot.Anyone looking for an action film will be sorely disappointed because this is first and foremost a writer's film, focusing on plot, character and dialogue. As mentioned above, the brunt of the film falls on development, more so than action set-pieces and CGI. The portions of the city and the near future Johnson has created, whilst some may see as unoriginal, I see as tributary. A lawless country split socially in half, poverty on one side, excess on the other, the world Johnson has manufactured carries an air similar to that of Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, a comparably important sci-fi film in the struggle to build the credibility of the genre in the realm of modern cinema.Not only is the film intelligent, it also acts as a courier for Johnson, a director of hit (Brick) and miss (The Brothers Bloom) repute following his sophomore outing.If you support intelligent science fiction in the intellectual vein of Inception and Primer, Looper is a film sitting firmly in the middle of the two. Break the box office with this film and bring intelligence back to film-making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looping back to the Future,"Going into this movie, remind yourself of one thing ""Time travel will never make sense."" There. Now you can enjoy Looper.Looper is about a futuristic assassin called Well, a Looper In this case, his name is Joseph Gordon Levitt, or affectionately named, Joe. Joe gets people sent from the future, to the present, where he kills them on the spot. One day, his future-self, Bruce Willis, shows up. He's all like, ""whaaaat?"" *Insert movie-long chase scene here*It's a really fun sci-fi flick that plays with different themes, and different ideas of morality. Can the end result justify a person's actions, regardless of how dark they may be? Things like that At the end of the movie, I almost felt like it was lesson in thematics, and I think it was very successful. It's a little more serious than I envisioned, like Lawless, a little more gritty than expected.Looper is a big fat 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
They lost me in the middle,"So the idea of the film is very interesting, until you start to think about how this all pieces together.If you start demanding the viewer make enormous intellectual decisions while trying to concentrate on a fast moving sci-fi plot, then you are losing the audience by the minute. I watched this on DVD and was interrupted twice by my wife asking me to explain the plot. My 80 year old parents would have given up after 10 minutes.Anyway, Bruce Willis certainly deserved his fee for the movie. Why they plastered a fake nose on JGL thinking that made him Bruce Jnr, well it just didn't cut it for me. As to why the hell Emily Blunt agreed to do this film, it should have been Olivia Wilde or Elizabeth Banks.One point I would agree with - the demonised kid (future criminal overlord) was brilliant and very scary.What you had here was a killer idea - in the wrong hands - this had all the makings of a Total Recall (the original) and left me thinking B movie all over.You might enjoy this movie more if you are completely drunk or with a group of teenage boys who like violence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Very Decent, very clever","No Spoilers will be shown, the story is basically the public knowledge shown on the trailers.The story is about this man named Joe who is played by both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis. Basically his job is a looper. In the Year 2074 civilization has created time travel however it is highly illegal to use it. It is then controlled by the highest criminal mafia in the world. In the future they cannot kill a person, so instead they send them back 30 years and the looper will kill them. When the young Joe saw the Old Joe standing there, he hesitated and the plot clashed.The story was very confusing at first, but the movie does a good job to explain to us as it goes along. To be honest at first I thought this was going to be bad, the story took some time to build up, and the plot just didn't seem to have any structure. Once the movie did pick up, boy did it pick up. It became intense as the hunter became the hunted.The story had emotion, action, we laughed and cried. Many places where things appeared to be stupid ended actually be part of the story and working out. There are though, a lot of silly moments in the story that to my opinion could have been left out and the story would have been just as good. The acting was very good. Also kinda shows how much Bruce Willis is getting old, but can still pack a punch. I give this movie an 8.5/10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The idea didn't fully materialize,"A fascinating theory, an intriguing concept that got let down by a set of inefficiencies in its script. Those of you who know me are also acquainted with the fact that I long for these subjects, anything remotely associated with Time, Space, or Paradoxes intrigues my conscience. I am somebody who is always on the lookout for such titles and that's exactly how I stumbled upon Rian Johnson's Looper.As I said, this has got an incredible idea, and a compelling notion indeed, but the execution failed to match up to its ambitions. While the first act is adequately paced and kind of sets up the stage, the second act as well as a part of the third heavily struggles with pace and is fraught with inconsistencies! Even though the ending made conscious efforts for redemption, but it was already too late. (By the way, I had already guessed the twist by then).As a direct consequence, the vision never fully materialized. Albeit make no mistake, this still was a fun watch and has a lot to showcase but I wish it had done better in supervising the complicatedness of the subject.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Original, but hugely flawed","This movie divides audience in opinions, with some loving it and others absolutely hating it. However you feel about it, you have to admit it presents an interesting and original concept. It's action-packed, mind-bending and entertaining. It offers existential questions that respond in a form of an inevitable fatalism. The logic of the movie, however, is the main flaw because if you start to question it even in the slightest, the entire story quickly falls apart. It looks good on the surface, but lacks any kind of wisdom or credibility.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of my favorites,"The time travel is not new, but this story is original and complicated. Joseph Gordon-Levitt uncannily takes on the persona and mannerisms of Bruce Willis as his younger self - in my opinion, one of his most nuanced roles. He has always totally embodied his characters, and he doesn't disappoint here. Bruce Willis is solid in his role, no big surprises there. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the story. It held my attention and interest throughout. Emily Blunt is great here; she's brilliant in everything I've seen her in. Jeff Daniels does a perfectly villainous turn as the mob boss who coldly orders hits. Very entertaining film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Thought provoking, time traveling, science fiction...Seriously!","Time travel has been something integrated in cinema for decades now. Usually, when you hear about a film with some sort of time travel element involved, you're in for a fairly cheesy ride, full of plot holes. Very rarely can a film take a premise so out of this world, and make it grounded in reality. I am very happy to say that ""Looper"" is one of those rare occasions.The film takes place in 2042, Kansas City. Time travel has not yet been invented, however, in 2072, it has. The mob in 2072 sends their target back in time 30 years, where a Looper will than shoot the body on site and dispose of its remains, making it forever untraceable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of summer, The Dark Knight Rises) plays a Looper named Joe; he is the youngest Looper to be hired. Always doing his job without hesitation, he doesn't look at their faces or ask any questions, he just gets his job done and collects his money. However, his life takes dramatic twist when one day, he is face to face with an older version of himself.That's about as much of the plot that I will give away, going into to this movie as fresh as you can will benefit your cinematic experience, dramatically. The film is written and directed by Rian Johnson, who made his directorial debut with the detective film noir, ""Brick"" which also starred Gordon-Levitt. Johnson has a unique style to his directing, which is clearly present in this film. He uses unorthodox angles and lighting to add a certain dark and gritty feel to most of his scenes. While also using mostly practical effects, it gives the film a certain feel of realism that is refreshing in today's film culture, to say the least. There are no weak links here acting wise, as Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a breathtaking performance as a man who is troubled with his past, that is also trying to protect his future as well. His portrayal of a young Bruce Willis is spot on, getting all the little mannerisms down to a tee. This is the best I have seen Bruce Wills in years, giving his all in the more emotional scenes in the movie. For once I felt like I wasn't just watching Brice Willis playing himself, I was watching the character of Older Joe, who happens to be portrayed by Bruce Willis.Time travel is nearly a back drop in the story. It is explained in fragments, not giving you a clear cut explanation how it works, yet not dumbing it down as a cheap plot devise either. Johnson paints a not so glamorous take on the future. The look and feel is rather dark and bleak, rather than a flashy, technology driven future, we see in most science fiction epics. The story is small in scope and just deals with the characters at hand. Every scene, plot point, and action, has a purpose to how the film will eventually rap up, in its ambitious conclusion.If you are going into this film expecting a big sci-fi chase movie with none stop action, you may be disappointed. It is a character based movie with science fiction and time travel elements. Elements that are done extremely well and also very entertaining. As a huge fan of sci-fi, it was nice to see the genre have a more personal and unique take on it. Seeing a character, played by two different actors that are from two different time periods, brought together in a smart, thought provoking manner, was a two hour rush that is gladly worth the price of admission. It reels you into this futuristic universe with its opening shot and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling. There is a period in the middle of the film that takes place at a barn which is a little slow and some of the CGI effects that are present aren't exactly top notch. Yet those are just minor setbacks, to one of the most original films I have seen in years. In a world where we are surrounded by reboots, sequels and prequels, ""Looper"" was a brilliant breathe of fresh air.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Has its moments but mostly it is ideas without cohesion, flow or spark","Looper was compared (by some, but not many) to The Matrix and Inception in terms of it being a smart film supposedly based on ideas and, to a point I suppose it is. The plot sees hit men recruited in the near future to kill and dispose of people the mob want out of the way; the twist being that these hit men exist many years before the hits need doing and the mob are sending the victims back to be killed and disposed of because in their future getting rid of bodies is apparently very difficult. These hit men are very well paid but, at some point they will do a final contract – their futures selves – at which point they are well paid off and allowed to life out the rest of their lives until the point where they become that person who is sent back to be killed. When Joe is sent back to be killed by himself though, he has other plans, sparking a race to change the future and the present.It sounds like it could have been a smart film but unfortunately the delivery from concept to filming is lacking. In terms of the ideas it is important not to think too hard about them or else the wheels will immediately fall off – even the idea that mob would have a time machine but not be using it for many other better ideas is one, but there are many others. The story unfolds with messy coincidence and a real lack of cohesion with many ideas and tones banging up against each other in a way that doesn't work – the film never seems to settle into a rhythm or flow and it is quite hard to watch as it is so uneven. I was surprised by how little spark there was to it as well – the filming style seems to be deliberately slow and moody, but the material doesn't support this approach, meaning that the unintended consequence is that the story seems lethargic and quite dull. It still has its moments but mostly it bored me.The characters and actors don't help. I understand why they wanted Gordon-Levitt to look as much like Willis as possible, but, as impressive as the transformation is, it is endlessly distracting – and considering how much more disbelief I was being asked to suspend by the rest of the film, I don't think it would have been a massive stretch to accept him as he is. The transformation into Willis also hurts Gordon-Levitt's performance as it is so much impersonation that he loses the character; it is excellent in terms of impersonation of mannerisms, tone and the like but there is no character here. Willis doesn't present one either and is so-so. Blunt is more interesting and at least has more to do than Perabo, although the latter will be more memorable to some viewers.Looper has some good ideas in here but they are presented without much cohesion, flow or spark. The tone of the film is all over the place and it never really got me engaged as it should have done and the manner of the ending suggests they had that as their first idea and sort of pieced it backwards from there. It is a very average film at best.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Looper - review, 6/10","Looper drew me in with its interesting premise; a hired gun (Joe) who assassinates targets for a criminal mob from 30 years into the future until he comes face to face with himself. It was a unique idea and the concept of 'modern-Joe vs. future Joe' translated to film really well for the first half of the movie but at around the half-way point the barebones explanation of the details of time-travel, paradoxes and alternate timelines is waved away with a succinct ""I don't want to talk about time travel shit."" (yes, an actual line in a movie about time-travel) as the plot became more complex. This was a disappointment in a movie who's main draw (for me) was its potential for thought-provoking questions on its sci-fi premise, what I got instead was a more character-driven plotline within a looser framework of sci-fi concepts which, while enjoyable, still left me somewhat let down.The de-emphasis of time-travel and the minutia of its consequences contradict the grounded tone of the rest of the movie, a focus is placed on the feelings of human beings, and the world seems feasible but the hand-wavey fashion that the film deals with the core idea of time-travel (which is vital to the plot) ruined the immersion for me. It demands a suspension of disbelief so great that it softens the emotional impact of the performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who is the star of the show), and the supporting cast of Emily Blunt and Pierce Gagnon (who are central to the plot) The characters are the main focus of the story but even this isn't perfectly executed, Bruce Willis' character, while competently acted, is mostly just used to further to plot and shoot things which did not make for a compelling watch.The movie suffers for its deviation from the initial premise and its confusing venture into a low-effort and ill-conceived dip into vague, supernatural thriller territory on the biological super-evolution of humans (which is about as unexpected and awkwardly introduced as it sounds) and the claims of movie's cleverness are only half true, while on the one hand it presents the motivations, desires and emotions of its characters with some skill and humanity but on the other a surprisingly low-effort attempt is made in fleshing out the mechanics behind the time-travel which I believe to be a major misstep on the writer-director's part, holding back what could have been a truly great, original movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Time and Crime doesn't pay either way,"What would you do if one day you had a heart-to-heart talk with yourself, which is decades older than you? What if you were a hit-man and you were ordered to take out yourself? Such questions and much more are posed in Rian Johnson's ""Looper"", an excellent addition to the science- fiction genre. No wait, it isn't just science-fiction, it's also an action thriller and a crime drama (complete with noir-like narration) with a healthy dollop of romance. This movie knocked my socks off.In the future, time-travel is illegal, and yet somehow some criminals managed to get their hands on the technology, and send targets back in time to be assassinated by hit men called Loopers. These Loopers, such as Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) live rich when the economic structure of the rest of society is crumbling around them. However, a thing called 'closing the loop' happens when the Loopers kill older versions of themselves sent back from the future - effectively eliminating all trace of the Loopers back to the organization which hired them. Trouble befalls Joe when he lets his guard down enough to let his older self (Bruce Willis) escape. How a young Kansas farm lady (Emily Blunt) and her son fit into this plot I will not reveal. One might be thinking ""A- ha! I know where this is going"" in many scenes, but Johnson is smarter than that. He has a trick up every sleeve, turning a potential cliché over its head. Such an intense ride. Such superb writing by Johnson who also directs the film with flair, and kinetics when duty calls him to. This being his first mainstream film, who knows what he'll come up with next.Looper delivers. An ingenious, intelligent, daring screenplay which brings a fresh and thought-provoking twist to the time-travel genre while also inverting it. It has brutal violence in between the genuinely thrilling, adrenaline pumping action sequences - adding raw edge to the film. It is also a strong morality play - it blurs the line between hero-isms and villainous acts. The younger Joe, the hero of the film played by Gordon-Levitt in a smart-aleck performance, is a thug that kills people for money and luxury. The older version of the character as portrayed by Willis is a bruised, tortured, intense soul underneath all that toughness, a wounded, broken man who is determined to set things right his way - however morally skewered it is. Not forgetting a vulnerable and fragile performance by Blunt who provides a strong emotional and (non-cliché) romantic core to the younger Joe, and a mischievous, mysterious yet witty act from little Pierce Gagnon, who maintains the right balance of emotions for the role. Not forgetting Jeff Daniels as a businessman-like supervisor for the Loopers - charismatic at times, brutal at others.Some very good cinematography by Steve Yedlin really shows nice, wide angles and refreshingly crisp action sequences in their glory - and also showcases the sleek production design, a futuristic Kansas metropolis not unlike the city of Blade Runner, only with more impoverished people. The special effects are good for what the budget is for the film but I strongly appreciate its subtlety for not choking on unnecessary CGI. It actually enhances the intensity of the film. Editing is crisp and paces the film nicely, without leaving too much or too little. Nathan Johnson's score is very good, actually, some old-school action orchestra work among the subtler parts can be heard here, with perfect timing, and it is a fine addition to the movie.""Looper"" is extremely entertaining and yet one hell of a film. Very intense and thrilling, very exciting, very thought provoking, substantially emotional and stylish and ultimately just damn great. We might see a cult of fans hoarding this movie soon. Just when you think there's hardly any more original sci-fi flicks, out comes this wallop of a film - surprisingly one of 2012's very best.Overall: 90%Eat your heart out, ""Inception"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent 40mins in a 2hr movie,"It's not giving anything away to say that Looper involves time travel.The first 40 minutes of this movie are excellent with a convoluted story-line that makes you think whilst enjoying the swirling action.And then the lead characters come together in a diner.From here out the movie drops a couple of levels and becomes a generic action movie where one person is trying to get another person whilst another wants to stop him, along with the usual array of involved parties (mothers, mobsters, etc). I thought the mother figure might just as well have been called Sarah Connor.It's also one of those movies where you have to fill in some plot holes yourself.The acting is mostly flat and I didn't find any character that I could care for.So for me, the second two-thirds was a disappointment given how well the movie started.But if you are happy with a generic action movie, you could do a lot worse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A Complex But Engaging Sci-Fi Thriller.,"Take my advice as someone who watched this movie without distraction. If you are going to watch Looper, then actually watch it. Don't be on your phone. Don't read or pay a bill. Don't fall asleep. Don't use the bathroom or anything like this without hitting the pause button. Looper is a complex film, and even I may catch more out of a second viewing.Nevertheless, Looper is a complex yet engaging sci-fi thriller. The plot begins in 2044, and the modern day mob is made up of hitmen who know the future and kill those who will be evil and corrupt what's yet to come. They are called ""loopers"".One such looper, Joe (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) messes with time travel and meets his future self, played by Bruce Willis. As a ""looper"" with news of his own destruction, he is to end the loop of his own life, but Willis convinces him to hold off.I could get into more, but that would hit too much spoiler territory. Looper has many plot layers, and it flops back from 2044 and 2074. Again, it is essential to pay attention as you watch.Luckily, Rian Johnson, who wrote and directed the movie, has fashioned a very compelling narrative, with helpful narration and explained phenomena, in ways that guide you through the plot without dumbing it down.Speaking of direction, Looper is also well made, with tons of neat effects and special gadgets. While not as futuristic as other movies of this type (Steven Speilberg's Minority Report comes to mind), there are many fascinating ideas throughout the movie about the future.There is also some good acting talent here. Apart from Levitt and Willis, Emily Blunt does well as a tough yet motherly woman who lives on a farm. (Her son becomes an important plot point, which is what I tried to avoid spoiling earlier.)The son is played by Pierce Gagnon. He's done a bit of voice talent since, but I hope he goes on to act in more live action work. He was 7 when he did Looper, and he's 17 now. Hopefully he has a bright acting career ahead of him.I'm giving the movie 9 stars and not 10 because the plot does get a bit confusing at times. Again, the movie does a good job explaining itself, but it's hard at times to remember what year it is, who is who, and such with all the time flops. As I said in the beginning, a second watch may remedy this.That minor complaint aside, Looper is an excellent and engaging sci-fi movie. It's a unique and complex plot that thrilled me all the way through, even if I didn't get parts of it right away. For those who don't mind a challenge and want a fresh action film that lives up to the genre title of a ""thriller"", Looper is an excellent choice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
More depth than I was expecting,"I thought this was going to be a run of the mill Bruce Willis lots of explosions movie and of course there were lots of explosions BUT the film changes from what you expect into something much deeper, about half way through you realise the trailer hasn't done this movie justice, some parts of it I was actually shocked at but I can't tell you why without spoiling the movie.. It's not the usual good guy/bad guy and time travel fare, it's much deeper than that and explores the issues in novel and sometimes shocking ways but the last 30 minutes of the movie blew me away...totally unexpected...

An average and predictable action movie that could have been so much more,"Looper wasn't a bad film, however it fell well short of its potential and no doubt falls into the category 'only watch when bored'. My biggest issue with the film - aside from its climax being predictable - is the plot, which seemed confused and noticeably switched focus midway through the film.Whilst I'm not against that if done correctly, it was the subsequent lack of character development that really made this film suffer. Most of Looper's characters seemed insignificant - you found yourself simply not caring about them. This to my mind was caused by the surface level knowledge you're given throughout the film. That said I did enjoy Blunt and Levitt's performances, whilst Bruce Willis does what he does best. The action set pieces are okay - nothing you haven't seen before - but are thankfully good enough to hold an audience's attention.Overall a decent watch but nothing that will make a lasting impression.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Bruce Willis was equally impressive and portrays his character perfectly well. Emily Blunt's character works as an icing on the cake.Screenplay of the film is good, evenly paced and intense.

The story is intruiging and is presented nicely by the filmmakers, I found it to be well paced too.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a strong performance, even with make-up that occasionally makes him look just like Sean Connery's 'disguise' in 1967's 'You Only Live Twice'.

It has dystopian future, action and most of all things are stake here and also no explosions.The story is sensible, for some people it'll have loopholes because they are familiar with certain theories about time, thing is no body knows and understands time as of right now people think that they do but they dont. Big budget and classic movies all have present time flows however they wanted to and got away with it becasue of big names or something else. Yes I'm talking about Back to the future, endgame, tenet and a few more. You can take there time travel as grain of salt you can take this movies time travel with the same grain of salt and enjoy the movie as movies should be enjoyedOver all great plot, very entertaining, will watch it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent Performances But An Overly Ambitious Mixed Bag,"This is simply one tough film to review or sum up. It's a very interesting film and the movie certainly sticks with you. Still, it plays as overly ambitious and it does stumble over itself far too often. It's a shame because it strives for so much and buckles under its own ambition.It does capture a kind of ""Twelve Monkeys"" vibe being that it's a gripping, grim and often times bleak film that won't make anyone's ""feel good"" movies list. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels all deliver excellent performances as one would expect. There's a mixed bag here to be sure.I'm glad I saw it but I really can't say I care to ever see it again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Looper face,"So like why did they do that Joseph Gordon levitts face? That was very distracting. On par with justice leagues mustache debacle. But this time it played out throughout the whole film. Why not make Bruce Willis look more like Joseph? Too much screen time for the distracting looking fella! His face had my mind puzzled the whole film!Anyways... putting that aside
This movie starts really strong. It's a really creative concept, it works as really great sci fi but feels very human. It's beautiful looking, well acted. Really not much wrong with the first half of this film. I was totally prepared to give it an 8. But halfway through the writing really lost its way. It dragged.

Outstanding sci-fi thriller,"I was impressed by everything this movie had to offer. Noteworthy performances? Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of the younger version of the Bruce Willis character Joe is at times, stunning. Subtle facial expressions and body language are spot on Bruce Willis. Truly impressive. Although all the performances were solid, the other real standout was Pierce Gagnon as the young boy Cid. At only six years old he turns in a convincing and powerful portrayal of a character who is pivotal to the story. I can honestly say only good things from here. The story and script are compelling.

Amazing movie!,"This movie simply blew my mind. I never write reviews, but I decided to do so in this case because people simply must know how great Looper is. I went into the movie expecting it to be very good, but it was so good, it became one of my favorites ever! The story is so well written and put together and the whole time travel thing is very complicated as to make you think really hard and intrigue you, but not too much as to make you not understand the movie or plot. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants an exciting thriller that keeps you at the edge of the theater seat and delivers awesome action-packed scenes, all while you try to figure out what will happen next.

"""Disney's The Kid"" Part 2","If you could go back in time and kill baby Hitler, would you? Like ""The Terminator"" with a touch of ""Firestarter"", ""Looper"" is the newest attempt at creating the next revolutionary Sci-Fi film (because everybody wants to make the next ""Blade Runner""). Written and directed by Rian Johnson, the writer/director of the under-appreciated ""Brick"", and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, ""Looper"" tells the story of a dystopian year 2044, where 10 percent of the population has developed laughable ""super powers"" that don't seem to go beyond levitating quarters and time travel has not yet been invented. But in thirty year's time (in an even more flawed future) time travel will have been invented and quickly outlawed, only to be used by mobsters and the very rich, to send people back to 2044 that they want killed (because in the more distant future it is nearly impossible to get rid of a dead body) and that's where Loopers come in. A Looper is a hired gun of sorts from 2044, who is paid a substantial amount of money (silver) to kill those who are sent back in time by the mob and said very rich. Joe (Levitt) is one of these Loopers. One day he hears a rumor about a man called The Rainmaker, who, from thirty years in the future, is attempting to rid the world of Loopers by sending each Looper's future self back in time for the Looper to in turn, kill. OK, I'll stop here only because I have undoubtedly confused you all by this point, even though there is so much more to this story I could get into, such as the aspect of futuristic drug use, important terminology such as ""closing your loop"" and how much makeup one would have to apply if their future self came back in time and looked like Bruce Willis.Levitt's notable transformation: The fact that Levitt and Willis' face look nothing alike, even with a heavy coat of makeup and prosthetics, isn't as distracting (or intriguing) as one would think. In fact, most audiences will become so wrapped up by the story, that they will be inclined to simply ignore any visual flaws this movie has to offer. And aside from the much anticipated makeup aspect of ""Looper"", the acting from the two male leads isn't all that memorable. In fact, Emily Blunt and the young boy who plays her son (Pierce Gagnon) practically steal the show. But even more interesting than Levitt and Willis' overshadowed performances, is the tone of ""Looper"" throughout. At times playing for laughs and at others playing more for extreme violence, Johnson seems to be in control of most of his story. Issues only arise when the tone of this film is drastically thrown off on two separate occasions. The first major tonal disruption comes during a crucial plot point (aka when the goal of Willis' character is revealed) which I won't give away, but let's just say when the audience I saw this movie with was blindsided by this aggressively dark plot development (involving children) the somewhat light atmosphere in the theater was thrust into an immediate and very uncomfortable silence. The second tonal aberration comes into play with the introduction of a small child (Gagnon) who throws nasty temper tantrums. Though the real star of the show here is Johnson's script, with an almost perfectly structured plot, ""Looper"" is only flawed by a few visuals that go awry; all of which are centered around the child character. In short, and not to give too much away, the sequences when the child has his ""tantrums"" are filmed in such a way, as to resemble something out of a bad episode of ""Heroes"". And while the unavoidably over-dramatized and unintentionally funny scenes of this child having a fit, in slow motion, doesn't take away anything from this massively intriguing storyline, ""Looper"" is a perfect example of a film that would have been much more impactful as a book (if you know what I mean).Final Thought: Is ""Looper"" the greatest Sci-Fi movie of the year? Yeah, it probably is, seeing that the amount of movies which would fall under the Sci-Fi genre in 2012 is quite thin. And it is worth seeing for the story structure alone, but visually I wasn't as blown away (aside from a few scenes of visual brilliance) as I thought I was going to be. In saying that, the hype machine may have gotten to me far too prematurely, because at the end of the day ""Looper"" is in fact a well constructed piece of Sci-Fi entertainment, which will be thought of by many as being as innovative as ""Inception"" was a few years ago (even though ""Inception"" was a better Sci-Fi film).Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Chix Chat on Film Review: A very creative loop.,"Looper as seen in the trailer has to do with hit men thirty-two years from now in a future that includes time travel. The thing with time travel that continuously tends to be the case is the probability of a paradox. It always comes down to which came first the chicken or the egg, but this film does a masterful job of taking the audience through a finely crafted tale that is creative, captivating and in some instances just plain sad. Young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) provides the narrative behind the story so that the audience understands what a looper is and some of the terminology that accompanies the vocation. I say vocation loosely, since it seems that there aren't very many jobs to be had in this future other than crime figure if you're a man, vagrant and working girl. With the narrative we learn that there is the possibility for a closed loop, a running loop, and that the business of being a looper really has very few if any redeeming factors. Old Joe (Bruce Willis) makes the latter aspect of being a looper painfully clear. For a fleeting moment 12 Monkeys came to mind, but the two films have time travel and Bruce Willis in common and nothing else, not that I would mind seeing a crazy eyed Brad Pitt, I digress. Emily Blunt (Sara) does a great job of playing a country girl, she seems to have a knack for taking parts in creative stories. The Adjustment Bureau is one of my favorite movies, for the single fact that it is creative and the story was new. This film was not at all what I expected. It is so refreshing when the trailer doesn't give away all the goods. I had an expectation and I am glad to say that the direction that this film took was nowhere near what I had thought, in fact the trailer was a bit misleading which was an added plus. To say that I was impressed by the writing is to say the very least. I was floored by the writing, the special effects, the shocking manner in which Seth (Paul Dano) was dealt with, and the nose bridge that made J G-L look like BW. There was a time that I was asking myself where is this film going and as each scene unfolded I became more and more engaged. This film was very well done, green light.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
""" Picture a dog chasing his tail. Now substitute a man for the dog ""","Rian Johnson is fast becoming a mainstream writer/director and his movies are proving that. This film called "" Looper "" is also written by him. Indeed with Bruce Willis staring in this futuristic movie it's sure to become a favorite of many. The story may be difficult to follow, but then Time travel is difficult to understand. Bruce Willis is 'Joe', a retired American Hit-man or 'Looper', living in China with his wife. Reflecting on his life, he becomes aware, his wife will become a victim of a sinister character known as 'The Rainmaker', who is the head of the strongest gang in the future, due to his powers of Telekensis. When Joe decides to prevent the future event, he discovers that the 'looper' he must stop is himself. Things really get disorienting when Joe goes back in time to meet and talk with 'Joe the younger' to try and change the past. The movie is a highly charges with danger and dark futuristic excitement as a man chases himself through the wet streets of the city in an effort to stop the future from happening. It makes for good drama and soul searching events when one realizes that one cannot change what already exists. The cast is extremely top notch and includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels as Abe. Recommended. ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Great acting,"This movie is very well executed, it has a few side stories on the background of the main plot and I love the way they portray Bruce Willis as a fading shadow for the main character.In just a few words, without spoiling the action, this movie focuses on alternative facts and makes the acting lean towards the emotional factor, even though this should be more of an action genre movie.I even found one possible flaw regarding the way they describe time travel - you can't travel backwards in time if the device (that you traveled with) doesn't exist in that time, but somehow they managed to mask this flaw just by avoiding the whole subject. Also what I rely love about this movie was the reaction to the environmental CGI special effects.I rarely give a movie 10 out of 10 but trust me, if you love twisted facts mixed with drama and a bit of action, this is the right kind of movie for you to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
an intelligent sci-fi thriller,"Once the future was projected in movies as a colorful and peaceful environment, where most of the human challenges will come from encounters with other civilizations and the confrontation with humanity's own thirst in discovering the Universe and breaking all its frontiers. Then dark political fiction interfered, as movies like '1984′ and 'Brazil' brought up to screen the social nightmares of a world dominated by totalitarianism. Nowadays almost all movies that deal with the future seem to be dark dystopias that describe the planet after some kind of atomic, biological or ecological apocalypse, or in the best case populated by a society that resembles some kind of Orwellian nightmare. Director Rian Johnson's 'Looper' is no exception, as the world of 2044 or 2074 in the film is dominated by violence, human life has lower price than ever, and the technology progress did not bring to mankind any happiness (neither cleaner streets). Time travel was invented but quickly forbidden, as organized crime took over, and as with any forbidden substance or weapon it is the mafia that controls the illegal trade.'Loopers' are paid killers whose mission is to execute in cold blood in the year 2044 the victims targeted by the mob of 2074 to die. The trick and the trigger of the story is that 30 years later it may be decided that the looper is the one to die, and then if the sentence is not put in action a loop is created. Loopers are not allowed to feel any mercy, not even to their own self in the future. The smart script of this film, one of the smartest that I have seen lately avoids with the twist of a sentence the hard questions asked when the two instances of the same paid killer (Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) meet in one of the scenes that is hard to forget for anybody who saw the film. 'Too complicated, let us not enter the details'. And if details are left apart, this story works perfectly, and the ending makes a lot of sense in a story which could easily get too complicated and too hard to follow.It's hard to tell from this film that writer and director Rian Johnson is almost a newcomer in the world of Hollywood. Not only the pace of the film is perfectly tuned accelerating and slowing as the story demands, and the cinematography choices he made seem efficient and the story and dialogs create the atmosphere of distrust that lets the viewer ask all the time what is meant by the sequence he watches and what comes next, without explaining things too early or too late – there is also something in the realistic style he picks that makes the story credible and the characters resonate with viewers despite the unusual situations they are facing. Bruce Willis proves again that he is much more than an action hero actor (although the fans of Die Hard will find here a few scenes that will remind them their beloved character), Joseph Gordon-Levitt approaches the role with a self-confidence and a palette of nuances that makes me believe that we may have in him another megastar of tomorrow, while Emily Blunt confirms the good vibrations I felt watching her in 'The Adjustment Bureau'. 'Looper' is a more than satisfying action thriller, it's one of the best written, acted and directed films I have seen in the last year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't get better with time.,"I went to see Looper when it came out in Finland, and I was in love with it since then.I've always liked the idea of the story. It's complicated in the way time travelling stories are always complicated. Still the plot is mostly straight forward and it's clear what people want. Also it's brutal just in the right way.Of course if you're serious about the time travel aspect, sometimes the time travel paradox doesn't seem to make awful lot of sense, but if you're just in it for an action thriller then you're going to be fine.One of the weirdest things in this movie is to see Joseph Gordon Levitt look like Bruce Willis. Like he pulls that off, and it's not completely awful, but it just look odd. You could've made that happen some other way too, not just make JGL copy Bruce Willis completely...I'm usually not a big fan of science fiction, but when it comes to only small doses of science fiction, I might love it. With Looper the only doses of sci-fi are the time travel element and the telekinetic abilities possessed by some of the characters. Even if time travelling is a key element in the story, it doesn't make the story feel too futuristic. The weapons look pretty regular and there are only few futuristic looking vehicles in the world.This makes it possible for the story not explain the world too much. It looks and works pretty much like ours apart from the few details that are explained very clearly. It's not necessarily only a good thing: you might want to know more about the world, but you can't. You can only see the slightly dystopian aspect on how there are clearly wealthier people partying and then there's so much poverty on the streets and all that.If I absolutely hate something about this movie it's the sound mixing. Sometimes watching this movie is painful because the characters talk quietly but then there's all that action noises and shouting... It's easier if you have subtitles on, then you don't have to blast the movie on full volume. I often stop paying attention to it, but there's that one diner scene where I always pay attention to it, it's just super annoying.It's always a risk to rewatch a movie you used to like 5-6 years back, because you might ruin it, but also can you be neutral in reviewing it if you already like it? The thing about Looper is that while it's a good action movie, watching it too many times doesn't make it good, unfortunately. It's still alright, and there are still some scenes that are breath-taking, but everything between those few amazing scenes feels dull.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An assured time travel flick which challenges you both cerebrally and emotionally,"Films portraying time travel are always among the most fascinating - and fallible. There simply has to be illogicalities, but when viewing these kinds of films there's no point in getting too hung up on those. What's important is the logic within the illogical. And this is where Looper stands out as more tight-knit and thrilling than most of its peers.The penner and executioner is the young and talented Rian Johnson, and he's recruited the even younger and, much to some of his previous critics' surprise, equally talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role. He plays a man in a not too distant post-apocalyptic future who works as a hitman - a ""looper"" - killing people sent back in time to him from the somewhat more distant future. Confused? Don't despair - these mind-benders are much of the allure of Looper, and it gets even more intricate when it turns out that the mob from the future start sending the future, older versions of their loopers back to get killed by themselves - hence ""closing the loop"". Not surprisingly, it turns out that the future version of our protagonist (played by Bruce Willis) isn't too keen on being offed by his younger self.There are plenty of films in this sub-genre that try to seem intelligent by obscuring and muddling its premise and plot, but although Looper isn't completely free of this, it shows a refreshing self-confidence in what it tries to do. And for a good reason, because despite the many loops (no pun intended) in the story's logic (arguably inevitable in any discussion of time travel), these are of a kind that makes you ponder and philosophize, not become annoyed by the idiocy of the plot, which on the contrary remains relevant and consistent throughout. I also liked Johnson's vision of the future - it's not distanced or robotic, like in so many other sci-fis; he understands that people will be people also in the future. And therefore, in the wake of the apocalypse this society has seen, people here are paranoid, aggressive and untrusting, but also warm and full of suppressed love and affection.For most people, the finale will leave them with an ambivalent feeling, but that's easily forgettable when the compensation is a film which really challenges you both cerebrally and emotionally, and does this while being all the while entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I'm kinda surprised Looper isn't praised more than it was and talked about. I love that Emily was in this which has time travel and Edge of Tomorrow a couple years later.

"good effort, don't get too hyped up for it though","Looper is a stylish film with a solid cast and an interesting premise, it was entertaining but doesn't quite work, it delivered exactly what i thought it would so i'm not disappointed. It had some good action sequences however some of the action seemed a little ridiculous and ended up being unintentionly funny. There is some good humour in it though which i like it didn't take itself too seriously like say Inception which definitely worked in it's favour. Looper was visually impressive although that has come to be expected with this type of blockbuster flick in this day and age, it didn't fall short and not just the special effects I thought the costume design and sets and vision of the future world all looked great. In spite of all this it does fall short for me;it was a decent effort at the timetravel subgenre I have certainly seen worse but ultimately it wouldn't make my personal top 100. Looper has been Touted by the professional critics as the best thing since sliced bread, or Inception (the last Sci-Fi blockbuster critics had a raging erection for before having even seen the movie) well i prefer it to inception I was entertained and intrigued but left frustrated. don't expect watertight chronology or the film to add up in any way at all (why on earth would you?

I love it!,"Looper is an action-packed sci-fi film about assassins who target time-travelers. It started off as a clever movie but gradually became more intense. The movie is set in the future, but the technology hasn't changed much. Despite this, the movie manages to create a believable, exciting, and immersive world. Although time-travel movies can be confusing, Looper's creative storytelling and direction make it easy to follow. Emily Blunt and Bruce Willis both deliver solid performances, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt steals the show. He is especially impressive as his character undergoes a dramatic transformation.However, Looper could have benefited from some more hard-hitting action scenes. It's a shame because Bruce Willis is such a talented actor, and there were missed opportunities to showcase his skills. Additionally, the relationship between the two versions of the main character could have been better explored. Both characters have their own story to tell, but the movie moves too quickly past this aspect. This is unfortunate because it would have added more depth to the film. Lastly, the decision to focus on the young Jean Grey wannabe character feels like a misstep and detracts from the movie's overall quality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This film kept you on edge all the way through and really wrapped up neatly at the end.Also, and worth rating a film highly, in my opinion, is the fact that the film had a very deep moral message about how children are vulnerable to becoming good or evil, and that good and evil simply result from the experiences the child was subject to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""Looper"" is the best time travel movie of all time","Wow. After picking your jaw up off the ground, you'll have plenty of thinking and discussing to do when you see the best serious time travel movie ever made: Rian Johnson's ""Looper"". ""Looper"" sets the bar high early on with a breakneck pace and infectiously energetic atmosphere that pervades the entire film, as Jospeph Gordon-Levitt's character, Joe, violently kills a body that randomly appears in front of him in a desolate cornfield. Huh? Turns out it's his job. In the future, time travel exists, of course. But so dangerous is it that it is outlawed, meaning of course that only the bad guys use it. They set up an ingenious system where men are sent back 30 years in time to be killed and disposed of, a method so clean because the person doesn't even technically exist when they appear in the past to be blasted away and burned. The targets come with a hefty vest full of silver bricks, the pay-day for the killers, who are known as Loopers. Confused yet? Joe lives a cushy life, staying expensively drugged-up and sexed-up when he's not working, but a mistake by a fellow Looper throws a wrench in everything. The other Looper (Paul Dano) let his target go. Why? Because it was his future self, a pre-determined end for every Looper known as ""closing the loop"", so there are no messy ends. The bodies on these jobs are loaded with gold bricks, a step-up for killing yourself. Dano's Looper tells Joe that his future self warned of a man known as the Rainmaker who was closing loops with reckless abandon. With this new knowledge, Joe is faced with killing himself, and in a bizarre series of events that would take more than a book to explain, ends up in a race against time to stop his older self (Bruce Willis) from doing some very bad things. What's ingenious about the script is its ability to make us root for both versions of Joe, and yet pray that they are both stopped as well. The subtle make-up job for JGL is Oscar quality stuff, as are the special effects. The world that Johnson has created is simply stunning, and feels so realistic that we are immediately pulled into the mind-boggling loop of time travel without looking back. The actors are solid, and the action is fantastic. I have never seen a more flawlessly scripted movie about the paradoxes of time travel.

All on a Saturday night
All on a Saturday nightIn the year 2042, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has a unique profession as a ""Looper""; he dispatches people from the future for the mob. After thirty years on the job, a Looper is retired by being sent back 30 years in time to himself to be dispatched. Older Joe (Bruce Willis) is fine with this until an inappropriate shot dispatches the love of his life. So now he must go back and correct the system by removing the person who made this shot possible.Will he succeed yes or no? In either case what will be the outcome? Will younger Joe cow-down to his wishes or learn something from this experience? We watch this presentation and wonder what we would do if we were either Joe. We too must make decisions in life and this movie may help us or not in making those decisions. In any case, it's worth watching this movie at least a couple of times.The story is really about relationships and choices. It is not a sci-fi story about time travel. The time thing is just one dimension to help show the outcome of the choices we make.The presentation even though having lots of action does not contain a lot of gratuitous gore. It also does not rely on a lot of CGI. There may be a tad too much background music but not enough to distract from the presentation.There is a big logic flaw. I cannot go into detail without placing a spoiler. But the trigger that created the antagonist could not have happened the first time around in the loop. You did not let this distract you from the purpose of the movie.If you're watching the streaming version then you're going to miss the voiceover commentaries which in this case are just as good as the original presentation and give you an insight as to what they were trying to accomplish.

Great at a Glance,"On the surface this is a great movie. Interesting plot and great acting make for an enjoyable movie experience.That is unless you give any critical thought to the story line. From the very beginning you are presented with a constant stream of time travel errors and poor choices by the characters. I found it difficult to sit back and enjoy this film while contemplating problem after problem.While this movie has some action, it isn't as much as you would expect from a movie staring Bruce Willis. For this type of movie, I think it was an appropriate amount.I give this movie a six because everything but the story line is great, I'd recommend waiting until it's out on DVD, and rent it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great storyline but a missed opportunity to be something more,"I saw this at a preview screening in London.Its thought provoking and certainly intelligent sci fi. For Willis fans, of which I am one, I'm happy to say that he is at his laconic and bad-ass best with a complex emotional drive attached to his character's purpose. Levitt, who plays a younger version of Willis character, is however, doing more of a Robert De Niro impression than a Bruce Willis one but thats not a big deal because he does it damn good. Jeff Daniels also makes a mark as a no nonsense gang boss of the Loopers organisation, not the type of role one sees him do often but he's effective.I don't relay plot, you got the synopsis for that but don't expect this to be a big sci fi action film because its not. The visual aesthetics of the future setting is unspectacular, very basic and unimaginative. Its the sub standard ghetto look of a lawless society. It has absolute bare minimum of any signs that the film is set in the future with just two or three shots of a hover bike and one shot of holographic computer monitor). Focus is on story here that drives a moralistic catch 22 type narrative. I think the film is meant to be a thriller too but rather than being thrilled for any of the main protagonists I was simply intrigued which was enough to keep me engaged.There are only a few action scenes, most of which are basic chases on foot and gun fight set pieces. Some do pack a punch especially when Willis is involved but on the whole they are not anything special. The direction is placid but to the point. Dialogue is OK, there's a tiny sprinkle of dark humour but overall it lacks spice.The time travel element is certainly imaginative, and well thought out to serve a fluctuating storyline that doesn't trap itself in restrictive rules. I do find it has holes though but perhaps with a bit more thought on it and adding a time travel rule here and there, you might be able to fill those holes.So does it live up to the hype that its currently getting from press critics? No, not really but thats because the hype was too high. Its a very good film, it tells a superb moralistic high concept story and I reckon it is still the best sci-fi film of the year. I just cant help the feeling that its a missed opportunity, given its excellent storyline, it could have had a much bigger impact with a more punchier and exciting execution. Its just not the all round entertaining experience as I perceived it would be from the general consensus.So lower the expectations and enjoy the great story, some vintage cool Willis moments and an intriguing finale. If you enjoy everything else about it too, then good for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Fabulous and fantastic and flawed deep down, but enjoyable!","Looper (2012)A futurist romp with time travel, double and triple identities, and hot rod punk culture where everything is more like a beat up 1980 than a real 2044. The whole scene, though, and the plot, is fun, dramatic, compelling.And confusing, for sure. I think it does mostly makes rational sense (there are some things that will never make sense with time travel, so don't think too hard) and it will help a viewer to know that the whole movie is set in 2044 (as far as I could tell—not including brief flashbacks for backstory).You'll wonder about whether Bruce Willis really looks like an older Joseph Gordon-Levitt (even with a prosthetic nose). This matters quite a bit—in fact the movie needs a level of credibility all around. The weakest point, I suppose, thinking back on how it feels a day later, is that it was all fun and wild and dramatic and if you left it out there just for the thrill and the mind-bending, you'd be happy. But the rules of reality and time travel were really so loose, almost gratuitous, you had to take each huge twist as just the liberty of the director/writer Rian Johnson.And this left me a little disengaged. I mean, I was fully watching trying to keep up with it, so there was that kind of engagement. But in terms of the characters and their real dilemmas of how to stay alive (or not), I was forced to just go with the flow. The story was ""told"" to me.It's worth saying that there are echoes of Terminator here—the idea of going back in time to change the future, and even the idea of finding a future leader as a child. This movie is less futuristic—more on that in a sec—and more romanticized. Where Terminator pushed the idea of the robot to an unlikely level that we could at least envision, this movie tips into telekinesis at key moments, and it's a huge stretch—pure fantasy fiction. Not my personal thing.As for the way the future is depicted? ""Looper"" might not seem low budget with such an ambitious plot and famous cast. But it cut every corner possible to make us work very hard to believe this hyper future was really just sustained by a bunch of old American cars and trucks with tubes attached to their fuel tanks. That's the best they could do? Terminator went into a very high tech militarized future, which was fair enough, but what about ""Minority Report"" or ""Blade Runner"" or ""Brazil"" as a whole range of options that actually felt like the future?Maybe these things don't matter as much to you. And maybe you don't mind a plot with lots of logical holes. Either way, go for this one. It's actually ""great"" on many levels. I really liked it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Incredible. Best movie of 2012,"Wow.Not sure if I can describe this movie any better than simply saying 'wow'.The story-line is masterfully put together, the acting is phenomenal, and the soundtrack couldn't fit more perfectly. Normally, movies set in a futuristic time don't interest me, but it focuses more on the substance of the story than elements of the future. If, for some reason, you find yourself wanting to bail out of the movie halfway through; don't. The ending alone is worth the $11 you spend to get a seat.Not only one of the best movies of the year, but in my book; one of the best of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining (If Not Entirely Coherent) Time Travel Flick,"Before becoming public enemy number one after helming Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson directed other fare. Here, he plays with some interesting time-travel conceits and utilizes a wonderful cast to create an entertaining--if not always plot-focused--flick.For a very basic overview, ""Looper"" is set in a future where time travel isn't invented--yet. It will be in thirty years, and primarily used by the mob to get rid of their ""dirty laundry"". Each day, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) waits in a field and guns down time-looping individuals as they appear. One day, however, Joe must ""close the loop"" by killing the older version of himself (Bruce Willis). When the time comes, though, Young Joe hesitates and Old Joe does not, leading to an interesting scenario filled with astounding possibilities.The hallmark of ""Looper"" is its stylized, film-noir approach to the sci-fi time travel trope. All but sneering at explanations for what is transpiring, Johnson instead creates a gritty, lived-in atmosphere that feels as close to reality as a movie like this will ever get. It contains a great many thrills and much action-adventure, so it's never boring as the characters race from one set piece to the next. Fortunately, the interesting time-loop premise holds everything together (if by twine instead of sturdy rope).This is able to be accomplished largely on the backs of the stellar cast. The two role-sharing leads are fantastic, while Jeff Daniels, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, & Piper Perabu also shine. Seeing such a collection of top-notch acting talent in a genre film isn't an everyday occurrence, and Johnson utilized all those ""chess pieces"" remarkably well.The ceiling of ""Looper"", though, is that it sort of falls apart in the endgame. Not to say that the ending isn't coherent--because it is. But for all the intriguing possibilities that the premise might indicate, I felt that one of the lesser ones was chosen for the final bow. As such, ""Looper"" is more of a ""solid"" movie than a ""great"" one.Overall, though, ""Looper"" is a unique melding of styles (time travel meets film noir) that has the star power to mostly pull it off. It doesn't ascend to the heights of, say, ""12 Monkeys"" or ""Arrival"" in the ""ultra-serious time travel"" annals, but it won't fail to entertain and engage the minds of viewers all the way through.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The Bad Path is a Circle,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Rian Johnson (Brick) delivers a very entertaining, thrilling and clever sci-fi film that features time travel, dark comedy, romance, metaphysics, and enough action to keep just about any viewer engaged ... as long as you enjoy using your brain a bit.Source Code, the recent film from Duncan Jones, used time travel in very limited segments. Here time travel is 30 years into the future and has been declared illegal. So, of course, only crime syndicates use it. When you think about it, sending your enemies back in time to be killed and disposed of is brilliant. It's very difficult to solve these type of crimes ... though, there is no evidence anyone is trying. The future mob boss known as The Rainmaker hires ""loopers"" from 30 years past to handle the dirty work. When The Rainmaker begins ""closing loops"", he does so by sending the loopers back in time to be killed by their younger selves. Yes, somehow this works.Well it works until Seth (Paul Dano) chokes up and lets his future self escape. That doesn't go over well with the modern day crime boss (Jeff Daniels) who just can't allow these future guys to be roaming free. Then, just like that, the same thing happens to Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt). His future self (Bruce Willis) appears, he flubs the kill, and the next thing you know, the Joe and Old Joe are seated in a booth at a remote diner ordering the same breakfast and staring into their own eyes.Plenty of fun stuff in this one, although, I had a tough time buying a blond Emily Blunt as a Kansas farmer. Her young son Cid, played by Pierce Gagnon, is one of the more interesting characters in the film. He is supposed to the young version of the future Rainmaker, and he possesses some unusual traits ... with Blunt trying to supply sufficient motherly love to prevent him from spinning off track.Director Johnson has a knack of tossing in some dark humor at just the right time. Some of the romance seemed a bit forced, but the criminal element and the Joe vs Old Joe stuff was really fascinating to keep up with. If you enjoy movies that are somewhat challenging, and you can suspend reality for the time travel elements, it's one that you'll probably find quite entertaining.

As long as you are able to suspend disbelief which is indeed a necessity to appreciate science fiction especially when it comes to time travel, you will be kept on the edge of your seat and thrilling all the way through.

Looped In and liking it,Looper is a lot of fun with a lot of interesting plot twists but is on the gory side.This narrated film needs it (narration) to fill you in at different places in the context of that given place in the film and that is the extent of the narration.The film is written so as to be understandable but not simple minded. The character's in this film are well written and acted out and seem real enough. The director has chosen to tell the story in an effective way so as to generate some suspense and keep you guessing till the end which I of course won't get into.What I thought remarkable about this film is the idea that it would work at all and making it work and watching the story unfold is quite an experience and worth the price paid for admission.I couldn't help but think of the work of author Stephen King as the story played out on screen. It seem so effective in its totality that I thought it possibly an adaptation of one of his (Kings) works.It is gritty without being to gritty and gives you a break from the carnage enough to make this film very viewable.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"An enthralling film, yet could've been better-developed","Let me start by saying that this is probably the best science-fiction film of the year. Somehow, Rian Johnson was able to turn time travel into a relatively unique, fresh concept that was at times very dark. In fact, this entire film is very dark, yet it handles it well--you are not consistently being hit over the head with it, although it is definitely always there. This film absolutely takes you on a journey, and I was highly entertained the entire time, and found myself wondering what was going to happen, and how it was going to end.This film also makes you care for the characters, which I feel many movies and films today skip over. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job as the present-day looper Joe, trying desperately to close his own loop before the mob catches up with him, and Bruce Willis is fantastic as Gordon-Levitt's future-self trying to avenge the death of his wife by murdering the potential past-selves of a mass-murdering vigilante (it gets a little complicated, but by no means is it not followable). All the while, Joe comes to know Sara, portrayed by Emily Blunt in a fierce and standout performance, and her son, who are both hiding dark secrets. All of the actors, from Jeff Daniels to Paul Dano, actually do very good jobs, and as I said the characters are really well thought-out.However, this film is absolutely not without it's flaws. I was actually expecting something quite different when I walked into the theater--it was definitely more supernatural than I thought it would be, which sort of detracted from the otherwise-believable world, but ends up being a central plot-point. Also, there are plenty of loopholes and paradoxes that could've been explained better or fixed within the confines of the script. Lastly, many people are saying that this film has three acts, but I'd almost say it only has two, at least based on the setting. For me, the two halves have completely different feels to them, possibly because of the contrasting settings, which doesn't necessarily detract from the film, but makes it somewhat incoherent.(Half of it is essentially set in a rundown, futuristic city, and I liked the fact that, although it was not beaming with future technology, there were hints here-and-there where you could tell it was in the future. The other half is set in a farmhouse that's old even for today's standards. It's quite a contrast, although I felt as if Johnson was saying something about how modern society is slowly taking over traditional values.)That being said, the script is still great, and there are actually some genuinely funny moments of dry humor, snide remarks, and comical situations. I'm not sure if all of these were intended to be taken as comical, but the majority of the theater was laughing at some points throughout the film. Overall, though, it is definitely quite dark and dramatic, but don't come expecting an action movie. There is action, for sure, but this is more of a character's film, and I'd say that despite the fact that it could've been better-developed, it definitely didn't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"And exciting, unique, mind bending and clever modern science fiction thriller.","Okay so this is the hard part; explaining the mind bending plot for this film. Yet it's a plot that's actually quite easy to follow; strange right?It's the year 2044. Time travel has not yet been invented but in thirty years time not only has it been invented but also its use outlawed. Except for sophisticated crime syndicates who secretly use the time travel to dispose of undesirables, by sending them back in time to 2044 for execution by specializes assassins called loopers. Now the phrase 'closing the loop' means when the older self of a looper is sent back to be killed but their present day self or younger self. There is an up and down side this, the looper receives a hefty pay day but must live with the knowledge that he only has thirty years left to live. This is what happens a highly regarded young looper named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); but he fails to kill his older self (Bruce Willis), which violates the one rule loopers are expected to obey, never let your target escape, even if that target is you. Now Joe is on the run from his criminal colleagues led by Jeff Daniels, older Joe wishes to change his future by eliminating a young boy who will one day become a powerful enemy. Younger Joe finds himself on a corn farm where a young woman named Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) live; Sara allows Joe to take refuge so he can decide his next move. I could go on and on believe me, but I think that's more than enough and I really must stop before I pull out the little hair I have left on my head.Well first I'll say that this is a time travel movie done well. I was unable to find any real plot holes, I'm sure there are some but I was just to busy doing mental somersaults over the film's concept which is mind bending to say the least. Many have said this already and I do agree that its Terminator meets Inception, that's probably the best way to describe the film to someone in once short sentence if you're pressed for time. It's a very clever film that's extremely well written, it's really something very unique. And much more violent than I was originally expecting and it's really bloody. It adds to the film's tone which I sensed an overall bleakness about it.The three main characters are very strong, especially older Joe who I found to be very interesting. You could say he's the villain but from his point of view the acts he commits are cases of justified evil. Our characters face some pretty unusual moral dilemmas.Sating the obvious, Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks strangely different as a result of some impressive make-up work to I suppose make him resemble Bruce Willis, which he doesn't but you still believe they're the same person. Now is it me or is Emily Blunt almost too sexy? That part when she's out on her front porch pretending to smoke a cigarette; for me that was borderline torture, what an image!Looper was fantastic, a truly exciting and unique modern science fiction thriller. This time travel stuff really does fry your brain. I loved that we were given a moment of classic Bruce Willis style action, it didn't really fit well with the film, it's actually a tad degrading but it was so much fun to watch. It's an excellent film.For more reviews visit my blog: cinematicrandomness.blogspot.com.au",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Solid, entertaining, but predictable and somewhat mindless","I was really surprised to see that this movie got an 8.5 at IMDb when I was looking for movies to watch, imagine it's the bump as it's newly- released. I'm always interested to watch a new time travel movie and see how they resolve the paradoxes and puzzles inherent in the idea. Unfortunately, this movie didn't even try for the most part. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty enjoyable in any role, I felt like Bruce Willis was phoning it in and expected something more for such a highly-rated movie.

Definitely Recommended,"I feel somewhat overwhelmed when thinking back on this movie in order to share my thoughts on it, given I only got done watching it a couple of hours ago, and it's one of those films that really sticks in your head after you've walked out of the theater.What I can say for sure, however, is that you should definitely give this film a watch. Also, I recommend you go into the movie knowing as little as possible about the plot. There are a number of twists and turns throughout the film, some small, and some pretty huge, and I have seen reviews that have given away some of these twists without adequate spoiler warnings, so tread very carefully when seeking reviews for this film. In fact, maybe just don't look at any reviews at all; the less you know the more you'll enjoy the film, and the more you'll be engaged by it. All you need to know going into the film is that it's very good.There's nary a dull moment in it's nearly two hour long running time- the pacing's perfect, and its fairly complex narrative is perfectly and naturally described through its use of voice-overs and exposition(that doesn't specifically feel like forced, direct exposition). It's definitely the boldest American film I've seen all year, as this year has been plagued with flashy, admittedly entertaining franchise films and over-produced block-busters that are fun to watch but not usually particularly memorable. Looper is not one such film.It's original, engaging, and goes places the vast majority of American films almost never dare to go. Definitely go watch this.I'd give it 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"A looper is a killer for hire. 30 years in the future, time travel will be possible. Future mobsters, to get rid of someone will ship him to the past where a looper waits, shoots the person and disposes of the body.One such looper is Joe. He's young but acts as if he's old and very experienced. He practices French, steals money from his bosses, is addicted to a drug called hope and has a relationship with a prostitute. Suddenly a new bad mobster in the future known as ""the rainmaker"" decides to ""close all the loops."" That's when a looper from the future is sent to the present to be killed by their younger self. This is happening to all his colleagues. And eventually to Joe as well, but Joe fails to kill his future self and now there are two Joes out there. And that's when things get interesting. First in mostly fast-forward we learn what happens to Joe in the future. He follows his boss's advice and goes to China where he meets a woman who makes him very happy. Suddenly loopers show up, kill the woman, and send him to the past to be killed.Then we go back to the story of the two Joes. Future Joe has some information on the rainmaker and figures he can put and end to the closing of the loops by killing the rainmaker as a toddler. Young Joe is not interested in that project. He wants to get rid of old Joe.Old Joe has the addresses of three possible rainmaker children and has to eliminate them all. Young Joe knows one of the addresses and waits there. It's a farm were the mom is very overprotective of the boy. Joe and the mom will get closer and he will learn to like them both. What will he do when old Joe shows up? Looper works with a familiar idea in a very original way. Rather than avoid the time travel paradox and its circularity it jumps right into it and makes it the main theme of the movie. On a first glance, the logic seems to work just fine. The key moment is when the lives of both Joes intersect and separate. The movie is also quite funny- there is a lot of physical humor. The action is good even remarkable as when the rainmaker gets angry and starts controlling the environment with his mind. That's because in 30 years from now there are mutants with telekinesis out there. The scenes surrounding the rainmaker in particular are exciting. Unfortunately we know his identity before the movie gets there. That aspect could have been handled better. It should really have been told from the perspective of old Joe and his tracking down of the the three kids. Another problem with this movie is that it tries to inject an emotional tone into the movie that is not suited and doesn't even belong there. For the most part of the movie, it doesn't try to present young Joe as likable or as ethical or as the good guy. On the contrary it's old Joe who is far more likable. But by the end we're supposed to feel more for young Joe. On the other hand, a little bit of romance between the farm lady and Joe is handled very well.Looper is a fresh, original, and exciting movie. At 2 hours it's at least 15 minutes too long. It does have a lot to tell but at times it should have focused on other things. It could easily have been a 10 with some better editing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Superb execution on a tired and old premise. Entertaining!,"In this latest film by Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Breaking Bad); the premise is old but execution, superb. Looper is very entertaining for a time travel science-fiction thrillerNow that I have gotten sensationalistic thoughts out of the way, there is no doubt that it is a tad cluttered (or misleading) for something sold as ""sci-fi time travel"". But hey if Looper is messed up, then 2046 must be f**king depraved.Considering the number of films in this genre (Source Code, Frequency) tend to lure viewers in with the promise of paradoxical intrigue only to finally climax in a cesspool of logical absurdities (and thereby, obliterating any fun or entertainment I could have possibly gleaned from the entire viewing experience) I'd say Looper concluded with a nice touch.Eight out of ten either cop-out of the premise in their final acts, or bend the rules of time travel so far out of shape that narrative collapses under the weight of a rigid past-present-future time line.At least, Looper was entertaining enough to finish in one sitting without cussing.

Someone better probably should have been cast instead of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's too soft, with nothing edgy about him, for the character he's playing.

Not as original as it claims (and not as smart as it thinks it is),"As my summary suggests, this film thinks it is smarter than it is.

Strong Message Was Enough to Make Me Overlook Numerous Plot Weaknesses,"This time travel sci-fi thriller is one of those movies that instantly begins to unravel if you start pulling at its plot strings, but if you're willing to just accept certain things as presented without questioning them too much, it provides a lot of entertainment and a welcome message about the role strong parenting can play in helping children navigate the journey into adulthood.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the best young actors currently working, and he gives a terrific performance here even under heaps of makeup designed to make him look like a young Bruce Willis. Willis is the adult version come back from the future to be bumped off by himself, in some strange system of hit men established and run by a mysterious crime lord living in a near-future world. Why on earth the system would have people sent back to be killed by themselves in the first place is only one of the first wonky plot devices that it's best not to think too hard about. The wrinkle in this particular plan is that Gordon-Levitt can't kill himself, his older self gets away, and Gordon-Levitt must track him down before he kills the child who will grow up to become the aforementioned crime lord who will ultimately be responsible for his (Willis's, and by extension, Gordon-Levitt's) death and the death of his beloved future wife. Are you following?If not, don't worry. It all makes sense, or mostly does, while watching the movie. The best storyline in the film is that of Emily Blunt's, who plays the mother of the kid who will turn into the evil crime lord responsible for the bleakness of the future world. It's her character that understands the need to intervene as a parent and that with strong guidance someone who might have tendencies to turn into something bad need not necessarily take that path. Gordon-Levitt's character comes to that realization too, and takes action to stop the endless cycle of violence and destruction that this looping system has created. The ending provides an emotional payoff that makes the grimness and violence of what precedes it worth sitting through.A strong film for its genre.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A wonderful perspective of the relations between crime and time travel,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars alongside his future self Bruce Willis in this sci-fi classic to be, Looper.Joe Simmons (Levitt) is just one of many cohorts affiliated with a criminal organisation running Loopers; assigned hit-men of the present who gain wealthy lifestyles through assassinating criminals who are sent from the future only to be shot an erased in the outskirts of Kansas City. The organisation is altered through the use of time travel, invented in the thirty years ahead, the mob of 2074 sees the machine beneficial in terms of body disposal. Once the target is sent back to the year 2044, it is placed in the hands of Joe and Co to finish the task.Kansas is home to the strangest of folks with a major decline in poverty as well as a fascinating trend of telekinesis. Abe (Jeff Daniels) who is head of Loopers, feeds off the low class of 2044 Kansas, who took charge of sending himself back through time to run the killing business.Although the Loopers are nothing short of ordinary, Joe and longtime friend Seth (Paul Dano) feel the need to use a particular eye drop that not only enhances there vision and stamina, it is almost like the party drug of the future. However, to the disgust of Abe, Seth lets his target slip, leaving an outcry for him to be captured. Joe, who hesitates in covering for Seth, finds a portrayal to come as Seth reveals the danger for the current Loopers as a future figure head calls for all Loopers to be closed; meaning their future self appears as the next target, seeking for you to erase yourself from the future.Hesitant to this belief, Joe faces his worst nightmare when he himself is faced with the nerving task upon killing himself, Bruce Willis. The plot finds Joe suffering a similar consequence to Seth as he too lets his target run loose, resulting in a chase of cat and mouse involving the mob and an older, but much wiser Joe.Joe; ""I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you."" With Joe focused on finishing the task at hand, older Joe follows a path of destruction as he sets on seeking the ""Rainmaker"", a future figure involved in closing all the Loopers. The concept is blended between a general mix of future scenes and future flashbacks if you like, painting a picture of Old Joe's life from crime to love. Destined to make his future current, Old Joe is hell bent on changing any off direction of his younger self, even if it means the introduction of Sarah (Emily Blunt), who finds herself caught up in a convenient piece to a time traveling puzzle.Looper begins at great pace, offering a classic ingredient of Science fiction, a genre we have recently come to forget. It is obvious to see the comparison of movies such as The Matrix, but it should take pride with enhancing its own premise. Of course, time travel has been done before but not like this. Looper took this concept and kept in focus, without managing to run away with it, keeping any possible exaggeration in tact.The on screen chemistry between Willis and Levitt is delightful as it is when they both sit across from each other for the first time you realise the hype surrounding Joseph's Die-hard resemblance. However, the interactions between Joe and Sarah shined nicely as it took aim in slowing down the movie, focusing on what is a potential romance that intervenes in what feels like an appropriate time.The movie offers a thriller of intelligence, creating some what a less confusing direction towards what many people believe time travel to be quite mindless; Example, Inception, Donnie Darko, both fantastic films in their own way, although it still takes me some time to get to grips of the apparent aim of those movies. Inception was known for it's mind boggling asset, leaving Nolan to let the viewer decide. So on that note, Let's just say you can enjoy Looper without any long-term debates.Is it what the critics say; 2012's Matrix? No, I believe Inception was 2010's Matrix, and you can't have a film every year relating to the same film can we? Director Rian Johnson made this movie his own, like nobody else, just like when Nolan got a hold of Inception. Not many Directors/Writers succeed in creating a time travel concept following the success of previous creations, however Rian has put together something original, with a not-so original cast, and made what could be my film of the year thus far.Overall; Not only do the performances from Levitt and Willis make this enjoyable, the all round dark and twisted concept rates this as one of the best sci-fi thrillers of the last 10 years!

One of the most impressive films and casts of 2012.,Joseph Gordon-Levitt further earns his growing reputation in this surprisingly touching sci-fi thriller. JGL receives jaw dropping support from Blunt and young Gagnon while Willis lurks in the shadows for most of it as a sturdy yet vulnerable nemesis. Some of the more predictable plot devices are forgivable as they're handled so skilfully.This is a film with lots of action but the term action film doesn't do this justice as it manages to be heartfelt without crass sentimentality. What could've been a standard action movie turns out to be a nice character study of a person determined to not take the wrong path.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Loop closed (?),"The movie does not emphasize on time travel conundrums, but instead it focuses more on other problems such as those in family relationships, questions surrounding fate and so on. Hypothesis makers can speculate to their hearts content since this movie has a huge cliffhanger. Also action is great. The thing that bothers me is the slow pace.

"Looper is a surprise scifi winner, not ambiguous like Prometheous","Looper - CATCH IT (A-)Looper turns out to be the most surprising and suspenseful sci-fi of the year. The shock value definitely relies in strong screenplay and performances by all actors.

Emily Blunt is an unusual casting for playing southern mother trying to protect her child but I think it's really refreshing to see her doing something contemporary and not indie. Bruce Willis is great this time around.

One more made for the popcorn and sugar drink salesmen and Home Theatre types, that's it, this is not High-Art. This is not Cinema at its best. This is fantastical fluff presented as some sort of intellectual stimulation and clever storytelling. But it is a rather sloppy Shoot-Em-Up that tries to be a bit different. Despite the Critic's ravings, it is nevertheless just average.Nothing here is new, especially the Action or the SFX. It is somewhat labored and laconic, pedestrian and plodding, with a jolt now and then of some often seen scenes of Telekinesis and remorseless wholesale slaughter shown with very little style. It is far from the creative criteria of the best of Sci-Fi and is a wholesale cribbing of better gun battles.

I'm biased..but still!,"How crazy is it that $30 million is almost considered low budget for a movie?! Thankfully in this case, good acting and good writing easily make up for the budget. In the interest of full disclosure, most movies with JGL get a 10/10 from me (even Angels in the Outfield got 7/10). This is just one dumb fan's opinion, but MY GOD is this a fun movie. Its unique and weird and Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are the same person!? See it. Its a damn good time.Paradoxes and plot holes are what some reviews criticize Looper for, which honestly is fair. However, overall Looper did a damn amazing job putting a new twist on such a popular genre. For those interested in partical physics, Special Relativity, etc. you may be aware of some complicated plot holes, but the good news is none of them directly hurt or confuse the story. Basically? Time travel's weird, man.For me it's the cast that makes the film, and the talent put together on a $30 mil budget?! Captain Marvels budget was $160,000,000 btw. Almost gotta give credit for even pulling this off (as well the cast who took comparatively smaller paydays). The constraints must have been a nightmare ( I read that scenes in Paris were switched to Shanghai because the budget couldn't cover the air travel), so despite some imperfections, im sticking with my amateur and opinionated rating 10/10. Yes, I'm saying mathematically that Looper and Casablanca are equals. Yes, that's rediculous. Casablanca isn't even in color!I remember worrying that Bruce Willis and JGL look nothing alike, but after 10 minutes I was in shock seeing JGL suddenly reminding me of Mr. Willis. Just pay attention to things like their mannerisms, body language, or voice tone and the effort put into these characters is obvious. I just appreciate the hell out of stuff like that, get to actually see that effort reflected on the screen, it's sadly often not the case.So. In conclusion.....It's freakin' Bruce Willis, JGL, Paul Dano, Emily Blunt, Garret Dillahunt, AND Jeff Daniels!! Its good. Or don't see it whatever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Hunted By Your Future. Haunted By Your Past.,"Taking the tried & tested formula of time-traveling in sci-fi films, Looper creates an original beauty of a film that is as satisfying as its smart plot. It's one of those rare sci-fi thrillers that tells its story in an effective way, presenting itself as an intelligent yet not confusing piece of cinema, wildly entertains as well as amuses the viewers and finally signs off without leaving any trace(s) behind. One of the finest examples of its genre in recent memory.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Too Many Holes,"It's rare to see a movie nowadays without its trailer spoiling all the plot points and action but Looper certainly scored points for allowing me some genuine surprises throughout the movie.Let's start with the film did well before I get to my gripes. Willis and Gordon-Levitt put in their usual good, albeit stoic, performances and the other characters add some colour to the proceedings.It's a good looking film too with subtle FX work and great change of lighting styles between the city and the countryside. The premise, which I'm sure I don't have to explain, is very nice also with plenty of scope to explore.That said, I had some serious issues with this movie, specifically the plot. The more I think about this film the more it dawns on me how completely flawed it is. I understand that time travel is always going to offer certain challenges but Looper offers no consistency with the way it handles action and consequence. Rules established at the start of the film are conveniently ignored by the end. It's fair to say no-one knows how time travel works and how actions changed in the past would manifest themselves but I am certain Johnson has got it wrong. It's the same with motivations of the characters, which are not just shortsighted but verging on the ridiculous.And don't get me started on the 'TK' sub-plot which was included for no other reason than lack of imagination from the director. Just because it was introduced at the start of the film doesn't mean it not a deus ex machina.I feel this was a wasted opportunity by a talented director who gave us a great idea and then destroyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This is as good as it gets,"In the not so distant future 2044, ""Looper's"" exist to provide an execution service for a more distant future 2074, where time travel has been invented. Undesirables are sent back in time and Looper's effectively erase them in the future by killing them now.Bodies cannot be disposed of in 2074 without paperwork, it's much easier to ""outsource"" your killing to a time where life is cheap and the administration overheads are less.One such Looper is ""Joe"" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), he drives out to a deserted field for his 11:30am appointment, spreads out a sheet to prevent a mess. Person appears, ""Boom"" with his Blunderbuss, collect silver sent back as payment, dispose of the body and repeat.R & R constitutes getting high with a hallucinogenic drop administered via eye drops. The world Joe inhabits is not pretty, thumping nightclubs, hobos and lawlessness pervades in the streets, it's a dystopian nightmare with a capital D.Joes does not have buddies as such, this is not a business where you make friends, the one he does have, creates a pivotal turning point early in the film.When the criminal bosses in the distant future want to ""close the Loop"", the Looper himself is sent back to be executed by their youthful self. They arrive complete with a gold bar bonus, signifying their time is up, they then have thirty years in which to enjoy their booty before they get sent back to be eliminated.Joe and the Looper team realise that a lot of Loops are closing and times are changing. If a Looper lets a execution go awry and they have a runner on their hands, this is not a good result for the Looper or runner, a very bad situation indeed.Tasked with ensuring compliance in 2044 is ""Abe"" (Jeff Daniels), sent back through time to make sure the space time continuum does not get messed up, he rules through fear and ruthless enforcement.When the older version of ""Joe"" (Bruce Willis) is sent back to be erased, this proves to be a catalyst for a series of events that throws the messy but orderly status quo into chaos.The story is strong, at times difficult to follow but does unravel slowly to provide a worthwhile and believable world. Time travel in movies is notoriously difficult to pull off, as one character says, ""if you think about it too much, it will just fry your brain"". However, just when you believe that the Director and Screenwriter Rian Johnson has painted himself into a corner, he manages to pull off a satisfying conclusion.There is considerable violence, although not wholly gratuitous. Many actions that would have added to the carnage are shown off screen, the film also flirts with a movie taboo, certainly for Bruce Willis to carry out the actions he undertakes, is a very different path for him to travel.There are times when you forget that you are effectively rooting for the bad guys, there are no good guys. Whether the Loops are being closed for a higher purpose, which may become apparent by the films conclusion, is open for debate. In fact, this is a film that is made for Internet discussion, theories will abound and may prompt further film visits to this world in the future.If there is a moral, in a world with none, it perhaps asks how far would you go to have, experience and even remember the life you wanted. Would you kill to protect it and if so, who would you sacrifice.The acting is of a high standard, Levitt, Daniels and Dano excel. Willis is an older version of the Willis we know, although his scenes with a younger lover do stretch the boundaries of good taste a little. Levitt looks physically different due to the prosthetic he wears, to make him appear similar to a younger Bruce Willis.Emily Blunt adds another solid character to her resume as Sara, sexy, strong and with her young son Pierce Gagnon, scarily good. The film borders on light horror in later scenes and certainly some images and intent may be considered disturbing for some.Any film that is not a sequel, is largely original and makes you think, is to be treasured. This movie because of it's complexity, does introduce several ""realisation"" segments, that delightful moment where a piece fits into place. Much like ""Sixth Sense"" but taking a much less big bang ""Twister alert"" approach, a film to misunderstand and then slowly comprehend, like ""Memento"" rather than a ""twist"" as such.Certainly the audience reaction was stunned silence, at this viewers showing at the Multiplex.SummaryA Sc-Fi treat that blends the best of the genre (Inception) but comes up with something fresh and original with excellent performances and a cracking story that will permeate long after the credits roll.Not to everyone's taste due to the subject matter but for those that enjoy a good Sci-Fi thriller, mixed with a chase movie with tinges of horror, this is as good as it gets.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie (But don't take it too seriously),"I watched this movie with high expectations. I didn't get the action movie I anticipated from the previews, but I was pleasantly surprised just the same.The plot was new and interesting and the acting was superb all around. I really enjoyed that this wasn't a good guy/bad guy flick. The leading characters all had mixed pasts, presents, and/or futures and the lines between right and wrong were blurred. I found the manner in which changes to the past affected the future, from a mental perspective more than physical, to be an interesting take on possible effects of time travel.Other reviews I read have indicated that some were disappointed with so called illogical time travel scenarios. To be honest, I find that a tad silly as time travel a) doesn't exist (yet) and b) can lead to paradoxical events which can't possibly have a logical outcome.In the film many subjects are intentionally brushed aside or ignored, such as discussions regarding time travel logistics and detailed information about why exactly the future poses certain limitations. I actually found this intentional and vocalized avoidance helpful. It told me things were the way they were for a reason and I should trust the movie and focus on the plot points being driven without getting caught up in the technicalities.That said, the secret to getting the most out of this movie is to not take it too seriously.

"Always trying to do something unique, interesting and self-assured even when it fails to do so.","'Looper (2012)' is surprisingly dark and properly grisly at times, especially during its first act. It navigates its complex, non-pandering sci-fi premise with poise and aplomb, but does take quite a turn around its mid-point while also including quite a few odd character choices that see our protagonist betray himself in more ways than one. Still, it's an entertainingly pulpy and simultaneously intelligent affair, blending its grandiose themes with its gritty presentation almost impeccably. It knows exactly what it is while also conveying its deeper messages, though they can be diluted at times through strange conceits and annoying - if interesting - characters introduced fairly late into the flick. The flick is always trying to do something unique and equally impressive even when it falls a little short of doing so. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"""You're going to kill this guy, your own self?'","LOOPER did fairly well in the box office in October 2012 and now that it is available on Instant Video and in DVD the popularity grows. Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is another take on the concept of time travel (a topic that never seems to miss with audiences) and while the film is entertaining, it is very bloody and gory and the only salvation is the fact that the cast contains some of filmdom's more popular actors.The story is best summarized by the lead character in the film, Joe played with skill (despite phony makeup trying to make him resemble Bruce Willis – his looper self) by Joseph Gordon- Levitt: 'I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you.'

Someone like Joe, who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by transporting back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis). So the film opens in the year 2044, and Joe is a looper, friends with Seth (Paul Dano in a very brief appearance) and lovers with Suzie (Piper Perabo) and working for head looper Abe (Jeff Daniels). Joe discovers his next assignment is himself (Bruce Willis, Joe from the future). He also encounters Sara (Emily Blunt) who knows the strange coincidences that are about to happen (!) and mothers a child Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who has particularly useful end-of-the - world powers etc etc.It is a clever idea and if time travel and assassinations fascinate you, then this is a well-made move in that genre.Grady Harp",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Looper is surely an unique film like its trailer,"Looper turned to be one of the best sci-fi time-traveling flick on par with ""Source code "" , ""Terminator"". It had a well-structured story line and finest performances I've seen in the recent times. 2044 is the year when time traveling concept was discovered in which a target is sent back from the future by mob to get killed by hired gunman called Looper. Joe is one of the looper who discovers that mob wants to close the loop by sending back his own future. Directed by Rian Johnson ( Brick) , Looper is one of the difficult and challenging movie to make considering the complex story and genre of the film but hats off to Rian for directing it with aplomb. The movie begins with narration in the background by Joe (Joseph Gordon Lewitt) and runs at a snail-pace until the appearance of Bruce Willis(Old Joe). This point onwards , film gathers steam and gives an interesting plot with twists and turns. Interaction between Willis and Lewitt is the highlight of the film with both of them trying to kill each other. However , the film looses the steam and becomes bit tiring that you wish you could speed up the motion little bit. Thank god ... the climax has been wonderfully shot and gives you what-will-happen-next feeling. Screenplay is good not great .. editing should have been more crispy .. dialogues are punching .. art direction is OK where as Cinematography is eye- catching.

"Looper, or Blooper?","What did I want from Looper? Rian Johnson's science fiction film throws you right into the loop, so why not do the same?Picture a tennis match between Roger Federer and a P.E. teacher. That could be the finest method of description for this cycle of exchange in quality. We were served with a highly original premise that set us up for a thrilling two hours, only for the return to be anything but. The binary opposition in this picture that is foremost conspicuous, regards no thematic presence, yet is the conflict of quality and enjoyment you attain from it. Some moments in Looper are highly respectable; we are witnesses to great acting, a unique premise and sensationally explained narrative complexities. When dealing with time travel in film, the likelihood of having your audience disperse from the theatre with more questions to ask than they had before they arrived is not uncommon. Looper phenomenally clarifies the enquiries you may have gathered throughout the feature, though it fails in many other respects.If maintaining its form as a time travel film was not intricate enough, the writer decides to evolve the concept of telekinesis within the already crowded plot. Though we are lead to believe this incorporation exists as no more than a device to show us of the 2044 time period, we eventually discover its fundamental contribution to the climax. This is disappointing. You begin to suspect the projectionist of switching reels with a different film, as you feel two separate stories are being told, and all you paid to see was Joseph Gordon-Levitt's interaction with Bruce Willis (his older self), which you get briefly, and is the prominence of pleasure one gains from the film. Another disappointing element to Looper would be its unnecessary inclusion of comedy and romance. I have no issue with these genres, though I must when their involvement in a narrative has about as much place as Looper will in my DVD collection. It will not be there! If one is to integrate these aspects into an abundant plot, at least do so with some class or dignity. The humour was so forced, you almost felt as if you had to laugh to prevent the screening from feeling awkward; the editor seemingly permits moments of silence for us to commence in robotic laughter, though I am confident in saying it failed to work. Meanwhile, Sara (Emily Blunt) engages in an inevitable yet needless instance of intimacy with Joe (Gordon-Levitt), which is not again revisited and you feel no desire for their peculiar relationship to progress, if initiate at all. While minor components of the two hours, these, along with the evolution of telekinetic powers cause a dynamic post-summer blockbuster, where dynamic is not a positive, and renovates Looper into our final product and perhaps more appropriate title: Blooper.So, what did I want from Looper? The theatrical trailers and copious varied marketing insinuated a simple narrative, as simple as time travel can be. By this, I mean the underlying premise of our protagonist Joe and the complications that arise with his future self. While this occurred at times during the 118 minutes, the enjoyment levels were indeed elevated amongst the otherwise unsatisfactory sequences, that the studios' marketing departments did a capital job of concealing. Taken as a whole, Looper certainly does not fulfil the expectations, principally due its attempt to show and tell too much, like the kid whose plentiful discussion on their generic item overshadows the next child on the list with their time machine, whom gets cut short because of their disappointing predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Highly overrated, but a fun time.","Looper is writer-director Rian Johnson's highly rated third film. It stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. I'm going to start right off the bat here and I say it is overrated. Completely overrated. However, I still do think the film is good. I mean, I'd probably watch it again, but it doesn't deserve the rating it gets. The acting wasn't even that good from everyone, it dragged on a bit and there was tons of stupid and unrealistic crap. Also, the whole film is not memorable.When you make a film that is mind-bending a lot of people tend to pretend that they like it, even if they didn't understand it, and a lot of people tend to not like it because they didn't understand it. I don't think that is the case here, as this film isn't really mind-bending. It's just action attempting to be logical, and it does so, but I think it thinks that it is smarter than it is and so it tries to bring too much logic to action. The film couldn't decide whether it was action or logical. Because all action is mindless.I did like the film however, I mean, it was enjoyable, as all action films attain to be. And, as I said, in that aspect it succeeds. But it tires too hard to be more than action and that was the wrong choice. It is highly overrated and a bit predictable with a load of stupid crap thrown in. But then again, the stupid crap comes with action and that's what this is.

Tries to be more than it is.,"Looking at the ratings and reviews I had expected this to be a great movie, but it simply failed to get me hooked.The plot is pretty smooth except for the fact that if the future mafia is clever enough to use time travel to assassinate and dispose bodies they would know better then to make a man kill his own future self. They deal with the time-travel associated paradoxes in a satisfactory manner without creating much confusion. And had they just made the whole thing into a sci-fi action flick without aiming for more depth, it might have been a pretty good movie. But, after having put in elements of X-Men and The Terminator, and spending considerable screen time on unnecessary dialogues and passive scenes if you try to go for emotional depth, its bound to be a pretty hollow movie, isn't it? They tried hard, too hard perhaps to make it into a deep/meaningful film, ending up introducing misfitting stereotypical drama in my opinion.To sum it up it tried to hard to be something that its not thus missing up on all that it might have been. But, if I were you I would go watch it despite these words, for even though it doesn't pack a punch it does have some good cinematography and a very clean ending.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Really Enjoyable Sci-Fi Thriller,"A really enjoyable sci-fi thriller. The performances are solid, the story is really original and well crafted and the action is shot in a really engaging manner. Mostly I just like how well the characters are developed - all of their motivations are logical and it makes the film a lot more enjoyable to watch. The film felt very Nolan-like in its world building and use of heavy exposition, and as a big Nolan fan, I enjoyed those parts of the film a lot. The visuals are also great - the production design gave me Blade Runner vibes, which is a huge compliment (although maybe that's just because the films have very similar settings). I did think the makeup on Joseph Gordon-Levitt was really bad, and also there were a few scenes that felt a bit cheap in their use of dramatic tension, particularly during some of the farm scenes. I also think some of the sound mixing buried the dialogue during the exposition scenes - another Nolan trait in this film. But overall, this was just a really enjoyable and well crafted film that I would definitely recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This Is Amazing,"I remember watching this when it first released, I was still in School and we were assigned to write a movie review of our choice. The story of looper follows a time In a future society, time-travel exists, but it's only available to those with the means to pay for it on the black market. When the mob wants to eliminate someone, it sends the target into the past, where a hit man known as a looper lies in wait to finish the job. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one such hired gun, and he does his job well until the day his bosses decide to ""close the loop"" and send Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) back in time to be killed.I had a very strong desire to watch this mocie again after seeing it and even years later I've continued to rewatch as it really is a remarkable different type of film that I've never encountered.

Proves that time-travel movies are difficult to make,"I am normally fairly hesitant concerning time-travel movies because it is next to impossible to get them right. They more or less always become very unrealistic and full of paradoxes. I would almost go as far as to say that producers making serious (non-comedy) time travel movies are the ones that are scientifically too stupid to realise that it is just going to be a mess, or they do not really care about the issues hoping that the audience also will not care.This movie is really proof of this. It is full of paradoxes and annoying ""but if this happened now then that couldn't have happened then and vice versa"". Maybe some people can force themselves overlooking these things but I have some difficulty doing so. I fully agree with the statement that one of the characters in the movie was making: """"This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg"".Anyway, trying to pierce through the cloud of time-travel issues and enjoy the movie, it is not a bad movie. Given that it really had no chance of succeeding in the science area, or have a plot which didn't defy all logic (time travel you know) it does indeed make a valiant try to entertain. It is not one of Bruce Willies standard all-out action-filled roller-coasters. That is not to say that there is no action but there is also plenty of time for trying to actually tell the story in the movie. The movie is actually quite dark and melancholic. The future seems to be fairly dirty, run down and ridden with criminal organisations.As if time-travel itself wasn't bad enough the story also involves 10% of the population having developed psychic powers. Most of them good for nothing except cheap show tricks like levitating small objects. Most of themexcept our future crime lord which of course is found to have super-psychic powers. Also, of course, the kid had to behave like a spoiled brat with anger problems which was somewhat annoying.The ending, which I will not divulge here of course, was not very surprising and left quite a few open questions. On the whole I would say that the movie was entertaining but it is far from going on my top ten list.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

One wild ride right to the end.,"Looper is, in my opinion, the best movie of 2012. This is the type of movie that people should be making, one that keeps us intrigued and on the edge of our seat right up until the end, at which point we are left breathless. Not only is this such a good movie, there is so little that we know about this film as we go into the cinema, that to almost say anything about it is likely to ruin it for somebody, particularly since we are left guessing right up unto the end.Looper is a movie with no real bad guy, since it becomes clear that everybody in the film is pretty much connected with the criminal underworld, and in fact it becomes pretty clear that in this futuristic world the criminal underworld pretty much rules everything. There are scenes in the movie where one of the character is being chased by the underworld, and we hear the sounds of the sirens of police cars which are out looking for him.I will simply outline the film in the way they outline it at the beginning. Time travel does not exist yet, but in thirty years time it will, and it will be instantly outlawed. However the criminal underworld will take advantage of it, and use it to get rid of people and send them back in time, since it is impossible to dispose of a body then. They are sent to appear before executioners known as Loopers, whose job is to execute the person and dispose of his body, and are rewarded appropriately.The only thing that seems to drag the film down is what I call the time travel paradox, but if we suspend our disbelief enough we can let is slide. The paradox is simply something that pretty much infects most movies about time travel. For instance, in Back to the Future, we have Marty McFly go back in time, meet his parents, muck something up but fix it up again, and then return. However, one thing that is left out is the suspicion as to why Marty McFly looks so much like his mum's ex-boyfriend from the fifties.Unfortunately the paradox is almost impossible to escape from, and will pretty much undermine most movies. It generally isn't the case in a TV series (such as Dr Who), though it will always rear its ugly head. In the end, the best thing to consider is that this is a movie, and it exists only for entertainment purposes, so my suggestion is to be entertained.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not bad,"Bruce delivers. Story is good and original. Nice ending also.The contact lenses blew me off, just couldn't focus on the character as it looked freakish.

Fun thriller,"What would you do if you know you have 30 years left to live?A very interesting movie with a unique twist to time-travel genre. However, with a fairly complicated plot, the story was a lot more small-scaled. This was actually a good thing because the movie could focus more on the characters and the story.When I understood the concept from the main character's narration at the beginning, I felt like this concept is a lot more serious and impactful than what it seemed to our main character. It sounded like there would be a bunch of potential plot holes. However, Rian Johnson seemed not wanting to expand on the concept too much, as reflected through Bruce Willis's character. If you accepted the amount of information that Johnson wanted to show, the movie became an entertaining thriller.The main three stars were all great. Emily Blunt with the American accent was surprisingly great and convincing.Overall, a fun thriller with a unique premise, great acting, and camera work. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Every actor in this movie steps up to the plate even the little kid (Pierce Gagnon)who brings to the table the best acting i have ever seen a child do in a movie. Seriously he could teach some much older actors a thing or two. The actors couldn't do their job well without a good script, and boy do they have a damn good script to work with.

The Dolly Llama himself,"I hate reading reviews of time travel movies where pseudo- intellectuals think that they are all of a sudden quantum physicists because they've found a paradoxical plot hole. It's one of the reasons why I've never tried to review any of the Back to the Future movies. There are such problems in Looper, and Willis himself tries to brush them off by telling us not to think about it. However obvious these logic problems are it still makes you think more than the average action fare, which I why I am giving it higher score.In a future that is so heavily surveilled the only way to kill someone is to send them back into the past and have them taken out by a hit- man. A hit-man who will eventually take out his own future self one day, thus closing the ""loop"". Joseph Gordon-Levitt (an actor I am not really keen on at all) is one of such hit men. When faced with his old self (Bruce Willis, actually making an effort for a change) he is outwitted and vows to hunt down the old man before his mob bosses lose faith in him.But there's a twist. The dark future is ruled by robots and old Willis is here to take out Sarah Connor, or something like it. This secondary plot line doesn't completely fit with the premise but director Rian Johnson just about makes it work as long as you don't have any ridiculous expectations. The atmosphere and cinematography are very nice and the Louisiana locations make for a refreshing change from New York or California. There's not much else to bring you back to it though, but I appreciate the film for what it is and for the quieter approach to the material which would otherwise be a loudmouth disaster in lesser hands.Only hardcore Caddyshack fans will understand my review title.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Thrilling and intriguing sci-fi to ponder about....,"Despite the childish name, this isn't a kid's movie. It's a violent action packed sci-fi film which will test your patience.

The basic idea is that our lead is involved in killing people sent from the future to the past to remove trace of them! As you expect, this system breaks down along the way and we have a chat on our hands.Surprises galore as said and some fine acting for a sci-fi movie keep our attention. Taking in the elements of time travel you will find plenty of loopholes (no pun intended) but suspend your disbelief. It does lag at points but will retain your interest.Some will have a problem that it is derivative but that is being churlish. You'll find it has influences and parallels from too many to be deemed a copy: Inception, Blade Runner, Carrie, Terminator, Jumper, Donnie Darko and even Back to the Future amongst others. Possibly the truth may also be coincidence in some parts.Overall, a fair movie. The director has had the confidence to make a movie that is testing and interesting.

Watch till the end,"I can see why the reviews are mixed, my advice, don't overthink the plot, enjoy the complexities and paradox of time travel and a nice twist at the finish.

The second half of the film adds some depth to the characters and an unexpected ending which closes out the story beautifully.But it takes concentration, so give it undivided attention throughout, I have to be honest, I was tired and my mind drifted after half the movie, raising the same questions as other critics, but I skipped back to rewatch it a few days later and that worked well, had I just continued I would have probably have given a lower rating because there is a lot of detail mid way through which is relevant to the ending.I'm still left with some unanswered questions, I feel it's worth a second watch to see what I missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
all time-travel movies suffer,"from logic burps and flat-out absurdity, but I did like this one more than most. Bruce Willis really sells the concept, as he does in the much different, and better, time-travel film ""12 Monkeys"". He doesn't resemble Gordon-Levitt very much, but the latter does a nice job mimicking Willis's by-now-familiar mannerisms so we don't notice their physical dissimilarities.Emily Blunt's performance stands out to me. The scene on the porch where she's smoking a make-believe cigarette (presaging a later post-coital scene) is a nice touch.

Time Travel anyone?  Imagination is wonderful!,"Great movie! It took me about a week to watch this, piece by piece and I finally got through it. I liked the concept because if we could time travel, we might alter the manners in which we conduct our personal affairs. I wonder what a peak into the future would look like because I rarely understand what I'm doing to control and manage it very well. I don't even know if I'm giving myself a fighting chance here in the unknown world that has gone crazy. But I digress, let's get back to the time travel thing and the movie. Yes, he time travels. Yes, he has encounters with his future self. Yes, he realizes that paths can be altered. And yes, he makes a better decision based on this knowing. Now isn't that an imagination? A resounding YES!! If my mind could time travel, I would return to a period when I was a baby and cause my own death instead of having to deal with this kind of place, these kinds of people who are heartless and those who have cause some to become heartless and be in a 'world with who knows what kinds of messes have been made here and figure out why is it my responsibility' to fix this place, correcting things and trying to get things to go more my way? How I can relate to this kind of imagination when time travel might be so much more necessary as an imagination, not merely for the self expansion and creativity and the material things, but more about family morals/values and how we rear our children today. I don't know how this is altering because I don't know exactly what we did to mess it up and cause all kinds of emotional instabilities. It is an emotional journey, I get that. Some of us suppress emotions and some of us express emotions. Some of us don't want any part of the emotions. Where does that put me in the middle of all this mess? I actually like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but I l like him more in his less serious roles. He's a great actor, don't get me wrong, but I prefer him in more emotionally touching movies. Dream on time travelers! It is YOUR journey! See how you can envision your future self right now! Go ahead! Enjoy this movie, I did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper is a Winner,"I think that I am going to start out by saying that it is very difficult to surprise me at a film. They are usually very predictable. I have to say that this film got me (which I love). Director/Writer Rian Johnson did a very good job explaining what a Looper was right from the beginning. Just when I was asking myself ""what if"" questions in my head, they were being answered right there before me. If you go to this film expecting a lot of futuristic special effects, there aren't many, but the storyline did not suffer because of it. Although this film pretty much centers around regret and redemption, there are splashes of sacrifice and lost love. As expected there was a lot of retro-vision (my made up word), but they were very well placed. The transformation of Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) into his older self (Bruce Willis) was expertly demonstrated. I think that the casting of these two look-alike actors was brilliant. Abe (Jeff Daniels) was the futuristic mob boss and the controlling force behind the loopers. As seen in the trailer, Joe fails to eliminate his older self and the cat and mouse game begins. Abe is relentless in his pursuit of both versions of Joe. Sara (Emily Blunt) is a single mom just trying to survive and raise her son in a very hostile world. I would be remiss if I did not mention Cid (Pierce Gagnon). You find yourself really falling for this kid, even though there are many things transpiring with him. You really don't know the significance of Beatrix (Tracie Thoms), who is a waitress in a local diner, until the end of the film. This mind-bending science fiction film has the viewer wondering about all the possibilities that could have developed in the film. I think that I would put this film in the mystery category as well. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, you don't. Although at times this film did have a terminator feel to it, I was blown away by the end of the film. There were a lot of times that I said to myself, ""I didn't see that coming"". Even without stunning special effects, this film is definitely worth the price of a ticket. You will not regret it. I recommend that you close the loop and go and see this film. I give it a glaring green light.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Enjoyable. Clever,"In the future, it is 2074 and Time Travel has been invented, but is also illegal. The MOB (the Mob will always be around) uses it anyway to send someone they want whacked back 30-years where a Looper, an assassin who closes the loop and shoots him and disposes of the body. Young Joe (Gorden-Levitt) is a Looper and because Time Travel is as complicated as it is, a now Older Joe (same guy) (Bruce Willis) comes back from 2074. Now Young Joe sees himself as Older Joe and he needs to whack Older Joe. What to do? What to do? But, Older Joe escapes and has an agenda and that is to find and kill the Rainmaker, who will abolish Loopers.This was quite enjoyable. Here is the best way to view Time Travel and enjoy the show. Remember when you dreamed, everything in the dream made sense? In a conscious state, of course, these things would not, could not make sense. But treat Time Travel as a dream where everything makes sense and you will be fine. Anyway, I hope the explanation above gives you a good reference for what you are about to see.The entire cast performed well. The stunts and CGI were outstanding. Notables included Emily Blunt as the single mother, Paul Dano as a Gatman (okay a Looper), and Jeff Daniels as Abe, Young Joe's boss. A special shout-out is made for Jeff Daniels, with or without the beard, as he is good as bad guy, someone part of the Mob or a questionable politician. Take your pick.One more shout-out and that is for Cid (Pierce Gagnon), the child of Sara (Emily Blunt) who acted well beyond his years. Kudos.All in all very clever and quite enjoyable.

"A reasonable and stylized movie, although ultimately somewhat forgettable","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - 'Looper' is a sci-fi action thriller starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The plot revolves around the concept of illegal time-travel. The movie is set in the year 2044, where time-travel hasn't been invented yet. But 30 years later, it will have been. It will be immediately made illegal, but the mob of the future still use it for one simple goal; body-disposal. When they need someone gone in the future, they simply send him back, and a 'Looper' in the movie's current time will kill and dispose of the body. Very 'clean'. This plot device is intriguing, but in the end it is rather detached from the ultimate direction of the film.If you have seen the trailer for 'Looper' I must warn you. There is a strange disconnect between the trailer and the actual movie. This had me somewhat confused for a reasonable portion of the movie, as it really wasn't heading in the direction I was anticipating beforehand. This is in no way a fault of the script or director, simply an unfortunate outcome of my preconceived notions of the film.The actual movie had somewhat less action and suspense than I anticipated, opting instead for a more slow and deliberate pace. The whole time- travelling angle of the plot was also less involved than I originally gleaned from the trailer, with it being used pretty much exclusively to set the stage for the story. I felt this was slightly off kilter with the premise of the movie. The slower parts of the movie can actually feel somewhat dull at times, rather than suspenseful, which is what I think the director was going for.There are some very fun aspects of the film though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a younger version of Bruce Willis' character adds a few laughs and plenty of impressive make-up effects. The world in which this story is set is very well thought out and crafted with its own impressive style. This radiates throughout the movie, which truly has its own unique identity. This is brought to life with some impressive acting. Bruce Willis is as great as always, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt really stands his own in the lead role, bringing some impressive Bruce Willis impressions and mannerisms to the table. Emily Blunt also impresses with her depiction of the character 'Sara'. The actor that impressed me most however was the little kid who played 'Cid'. I'd wager he is about 6 years old and he gave one hell of a performance in the rather large role he plays in the film. It was really impressive irrespective of his age, but even more so because of it.'Looper' is the latest in a line of what I call 'Bruce Willis' Sci-Fi adventures'. Examples of previous installments of this are 'The Fifth Element' and 'Surrogates'. It seems Bruce ventures into another sci-fi project every few years, each one with the same basic result; A reasonable movie which is ultimately somewhat forgettable. 'Looper' is no exception, but at least brings a truly unique style to the genre. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It Doesn't Exactly Rewrite History,"Looper is a movie that's been on my radar for quite some time. It's about mafia-types who are involved in time travel for the sake of eliminating unwanted ""garbage,"" and it features both the formidable Bruce Willis and Nightwing himself, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Because I don't have quite as much free time as I used to, I had to skip this one in theaters. When it finally trickled down the DVD/Blu-ray format earlier this week, however, I was all over it.This is the perfect example of a movie that quietly made its way into cinemas without having an overabundance of pomp and circumstance paving the way. I'd taken a fleeting interest in it upon reading about the movie's story line, but it wasn't until a multitude of friends took to Facebook in order to sing its unparalleled praises that I genuinely took interest. And, I have to say, though solidly crafted it is, I found the movie to be a bit of a letdown. Let me explain why.With any time travel flick, one expects there to be plenty of mind- bending timelines that crisscross with one another (heck, they may even congeal into something indecipherable in the final moments, but the goal is to keep the audience playing the ""prediction"" game throughout). While Looper does this, I found it far too easy to foresee how things would play out (this was in stark contrast to 12 Monkeys, Willis' other time travel movie). To delve into the specifics of this would put me at risk of including spoilers in my review, so suffice it to say that, though well written, there was nothing Earth-shattering about our protagonists' concluding revelation. Another point of contention—and one that has been widely discussed, I believe—was the decision to drown JGL in make-up so as to make him resemble a young Willis. At times, it works, but more often than not I found it nearly impossible to not envision the actor with his true face. Would it have been better to simply allow JGL to be, well, himself, and to sparingly use CGI to fill in the awkward transition moments during his character's life? I don't know. Still, I can't ignore the fact that the make-up was more of a distraction than a boon.Actually, I think Looper's greatest strength is its focus on the development of telekinesis as a part of the human genome in the not too distant future. Some of the film's best moments come as a result of this plot point, and I wish a little more focus on this would have been the order of the day.Please don't misunderstand me. Looper is far better than the vast majority of drivel that Hollywood allows to make it past the stages of early drafting, and it makes for perfectly good viewing for anyone who enjoys sci-fi. Just don't expect it to rewrite history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Well done!  A new classic.,"I saw Loopers with the expectation that it would be mediocre. It was anything but. Time travel movies are notoriously paradoxical, but Rian Johnson's screenplay was masterfully written and executed the intricate plot nearly without flaw. I say nearly because I am still genuinely puzzled by a couple of points. The confusion may clear up though with more contemplation and viewings. (I plan on seeing this movie at least a dozen times.) And that the movie is novel and fresh enough to require thought beyond the closing credits is a good thing. See with some who you like talking with; you'll love discussing this movie. The cast is superb with standout work from Blunt, Gordon-Levitt, and Willis. And Daniels carries villainy far while Dano's portrayal will make your skin crawl.

Looper is one of the most creative pieces of storytelling I've seen in a while  because of its very smart and clever concept and character driven core,"Looper begins by introducing us to Joe(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a looper, a man who kills people sent back in time from 30 years in the future. In the future the mob has a hard time killing people so they utilize the outlawed method of time travel to cover their tracks by sending their victims back in time before they exist. Loopers get to live life large as they are paid handsomely and don't have to worry about the interference of the law as they are killing people who do not technically exist. The catch is that loopers will eventually ""close their loop"" by killing older versions of themselves once the mob of the future decides that they are no longer of use to them. Things start to become to get a lot more real for Joe when his friend and fellow looper Seth(Paul Dano) lets his older self get away. Joe tries to cover for Seth by hiding him, but eventually Joe's boss Abe(Jeff Daniels) is able to talk him down and convinces Joe to turn Seth over. Not long after this Joe's older self(Bruce Willis) appears as one of his targets without a hood on which causes Joe to hesitate. Old Joe gets away, but the two eventually reunite in a diner they are both familiar with. In what is possibly one of the strongest scenes in the entire movie, the two confront each other as old Joe tries to convince young Joe to skip town and leave him to work. Eventually the two both lay their cards on the table and a really cool fight ensues. Once the two separate the movie slows down as the movie begins setting up for some truly tough and thought provoking moral dilemmas that will challenge both versions of Joe.Read the full review: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-hu",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Trick being at some point you also get to shoot yourself thus extinguishing your life before you lived it....weird? You bet.

Clever but unpolished,"I really liked the unique premise of time travel used by criminal gangs, the stylish execution and the way that time travel is tied into hard personal choices rather than a gimmick. However, the execution left much to be desired as there are too many lingering questions and plot holes about time travel and the premise, which I won't go into.

Is Joseph Gordon-Levitt everywhere?,"First serious cyberpunk movie I've noticed in a couple of years.

Joseph gordon levitt is in all of them, which is odd, especially in the one where holywood tries to co-opt the bike messenger already fashionable ""subculture"". anyway, the story is set in the midst of the XXIst century, when time travel will soon be invented, but made illegal. organised crimes are using it to drop bodies in the past, when they don't already exist and therefore killed without triggering any legal issue.

Out of the Loop,"The movie had a lot of Buzz coming into the cinema. And I wasn't disappointed when I watched it. Twelve Monkeys remains the best themed time travel movie, but this is a very good Sci-Fi effort that has something original to tell. But you wouldn't expect anything less from the director of Brick. That's why Levitt was on again, but this time with the support of Mr. Bruce Willis.Great casting choices aside (Emily Blunt and others shouldn't go unnoticed), the movie does live with a great story that it tells. Of course the main performances hold it all together (just because it is Science Fiction does not mean, it has to be out of this world). I kinda got a De Niro vibe while watching Gordon Levitt. But I seem to be in the minority there. Then again, it speaks for a movie, if different people can read different things into it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Don't Be Fooled When You See Bruce Willis!,"The thoughts that are in your head after watching this movie, well, they are all over the place. Looper was excellent. A well paced Science Fiction action thriller, but it keeps your mind right where it wants to throughout the whole movie. Looper, if you haven't already read, is about a criminal organization that travels in time to get rid of their targets, these criminals who are told to execute the job, are called Loopers. But one day, Joe, one of the youngest Loopers, is approached by his best friend, who failed to ""close the loop"" meaning killing the target, because the target, was himself, thirty years from now. Joe hides him. And realizes that he cannot help him. Then Joe is asked to close his own loop, and he lets his older self (Bruce Willis) get away. And spirals onto an adventure that challenges Joe's moral and selfish and emotional decisions throughout. Looper challenges revenge, regret, happiness, love, betrayal, and don't think that because Bruce Willis is in it it's all about the guns and violence.

More than a cool sci-fi concept; 'Looper' commits to a real story,"The rules of time travel in fiction can make your head spin. As a writer, you have to be so meticulous in your vision that all the rules of your universe don't collapse upon each other and bring your entire concept crumbling to the ground. Or, like Rian Johnson does in ""Looper,"" you can be so confident in your story and tell it in such compelling fashion that it doesn't matter if the concept is bulletproof or not.""Looper"" envisions a future in which time travel has not been invented, but in 30 years it will be, only it's used exclusively by the mob to erase any trace of a hit. Young, impressionable guys in need of work like Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) have been recruited as Loopers to do this dirty work, but even the Loopers must be kept silent in the future, and so they're sent back in time to be killed by their younger selves, which is called ""closing your loop."" You earn a ton of gold and your freedom for closing your loop, but eventually you'll be sent back in time to be killed by your younger self, hence the loop analogy.Joe keeps his life pretty straight for a Looper. He's stashed part of his earnings so that when he closes his loop he can head to France. At night he goes to the club, drops some eye-drop drug and rendezvouses with a high-end prostitute (Piper Perabo).Suddenly, a lot of the guys are closing their loops, and Joe's confidence is a bit shaken. When he does ultimately see his older self arrive from the future (Bruce Willis), he flinches and lets him get away. He must quickly rectify the situation, or else he'll be killed in order to erase the problem altogether.Time travel, however, is just the tip of the sci-fi iceberg as far as the future world Johnson has built in this film. Genre fans will find themselves highly stimulated by what they see, but at the same time, Johnson elects to slightly upgrade our world instead of give it some futuristic makeover.But more than all that, looking beyond just the vivid context, ""Looper"" runs on strong characters and an organic sense of urgency. It doesn't get lost in sci-fi dialogue explaining how things work or become so driven by its concept that it detracts from creating believable people.The scene in which both Joes confront each other in a diner captures what Johnson does so well, wrapping what would otherwise be heavy-handed sci-fi exposition into a scene with incredible tension. Although Old Joe gives us a lot of important information, the dominant feeling in the scene has more to do with wondering what it would be like to see yourself either older or younger (depending) staring back at you and knowing that you either need to kill yourself or yourself wants to kill you.In that scene, Old Joe makes clear that he has a specific objective while back in time, so young Joe has to figure out how to stop him with his boss (Jeff Daniels) already on his tail. From there, ""Looper"" doesn't let up, and not from an action perspective, but in terms of a compelling narrative. Sci fi doesn't get any better when the characters and the story capture as much of your attention as the shiny environment they're placed, especially when you don't even realize it.What's so unique about the way ""Looper"" uses the time travel device is in two portrayals of the same character. Both versions of Joe feel like completely different people, almost to the point where you have trouble believing they're the same guy, but it just goes to show how much of a difference life experience (years upon years) can make in a person's beliefs and motivations.With proper material, Gordon-Levitt and Willis excel in their roles. JGL nails Willis' speech patterns, but more impressively he gets at the essence of the veteran's famed talent: bringing a sense of vulnerability to a hardened exterior — the sensitive tough guy. Willis too, thanks to the way his character is written, performs better here than in most of his recent films.The outstanding Emily Blunt also deserves credit for her performance, though to explain her would spoil too much of the story's novelty. Gone is the elegant, hilarious Blunt we've mostly seen to this point; Sara is a bold, resilient and headstrong woman who also happens to be extremely lonely, which adds needed complexity.The only weaker point of the script that can't be contributed to either nitpicking the details of the sci-fi framework or how people get conveniently gun-shy, is how Joe completely changes as a person over the course of just a couple short days. At first jaded and completely self- interested, he develops incredible empathy for someone enduring the chaotic life trauma of being both wanted dead and needing to kill your older self.Even though the film's pacing is terrific and Johnson makes the most of every scene, something's missing in the second half that prevents us from staying on the same page with Joe beat for beat. Perhaps, however, it's not what the film doesn't provide, but rather that we're too overstimulated by all the excitement going on to follow along with the film at the more personal, emotional level — until the end, that is.So much of the original science fiction we get today relies so heavily on its gimmick, but ""Looper"" feels like an action crime thriller that instead uses time travel as a device to add complexity. Johnson has crafted a story in which humans would respond to things as humans do, and he uses the sci-fi elements to enhance this, not drive it. It's why ""Looper"" will be looked at as a sci-fi gem for a long time to come.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Reasinably Unique Sci-Fi, Despite Lackluster Effects,","Looper is a good movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is certainly a unique plot that differentiates itself from any other Sci-Fi movie, I found the scenes between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis particularly interesting. Levitt transforms himself in to this role, and the quality of the make up really makes him look like a younger Willis.I did find that the film took place in Sara's house, played by the versatile Emily Blunt, far too much. It made the Science Fiction elements become lost in translation as the intimacy of this secluded area made it feel more like a drama.The effects are the most underwhelming aspect, for today's standards and with a cast like this, I was expecting much more. It was clearly shot on a low budget and it made it seem like these Hollywood actors were film students.There is an eerie. certain discomforting atmosphere in watching two of the same men from different time periods speak to each other, and the chemistry between Levitt and Willis in these moments are the main thing I took away from this film. Thrilling, well acted, albeit flawed, Looper is an enjoyable two hours that is worth the watch if you are looking for a Sci-Fi or Drama, just do not go out of your way to see it.Set in the distant future, a young man is on the run from the mob to avoid his assassination, as well as his future self.Best Performance: Joseph Gordon-Levitt",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Speechless,"I've seen many movies in my life (even though I am still pretty young) but this one, I don't think I'll ever find a word to describe it. It was more than just what it seems like. The beauty in this movie literally took the breath out of me. The actors were fantastic. They delivered an amazing performance. They made all of this, feel so real. I could feel their pain and understand their actions. At one point, Bruce Willis was just being the man who we fell in love with in his action movies which made many people (who have seen him before) laugh. Maybe not out loud, but it sure did put a smile on many faces. One of the thing I also enjoyed, was the wittiness. We have to admit that Rian Johnson is a gifted man for writing a scenario like that one. Everything was perfect. The story flows sweetly even with those jumps in time that might confuse some of us. But since it was written with such a precision, a dazzling imagination and an unparalleled beauty, you will always find a meaning in the end and that sure blows people's mind. What I adored about this film also was that it was of all kind. The action was great, there was a few pretty funny moments, the romance, and I could go on and on. But the one thing that made this movie the best I've ever seen is the final scene. (I will not spoil) I believe that it was one of the best endings ever written. The words Joe said, tell us perfectly how beautiful but dark life can be. And I have to show all my sincere respect for what he did. My heart stopped at those words. I was left speechless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Really interesting plot, little confusing","Story begins... In year 2074 we develop time-travel (woa) and it is illegal. Nice to begin with.Then there are certain ""loopers"" who are assassins for the mob, killing people their bosses send back in time and get some silver for doing this.Very interesting story, not just another time travel movie. What if you saw yourself to be killed, do you want to kill your own self? And is it you because its from the future? Makes you think really hard those time traveling gaps is it working in the main idea..In Terminator movies I kinda laughed for those time-travel things, ""question was, who would come first"" kinda very illogical.This movie didn't have many gabs, at least I didn't notice much. Surely it is confusing jumping from time to time like traveling from country to country and back.So, nice cast, nice directing, funny surprise moments that little cheers up the movie, good plot and hard to direct Im sure. Something still was missing. Ending was little weird and it wasn't really following logic but it didn't matter much.Little too long and character development was unstable, actually there really wasn't much.Still great movie if you like the genre.

"Fun, Thought-Provoking","This is a fun movie, with good acting, an intriguing plot, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a complex story, involving a few different ideas, but it's easy to follow if you're paying even a basic amount of attention. There is action, but that's not the main purpose of the movie, so don't be disappointed when it's not non-stop shooting. It's thought provoking, it makes you think about the details and ""reality"" of time travel, genetics, and future societies. It realistically portrays what that would really feel like yourself. They covered a lot of the more in-depth and personal aspects to time travel. In many ways it's an exploration of the expression ""If I could give advice to my younger self..."" in the sense that we see just how much difference time can affect a person. Our older selves are different people than our younger selves in many ways.This is a movie involving time travel. Time travel is not real. The people who seem to be giving negative reviews on this movie need to remember that. Therefore, there isn't really a ""right"" way to portray it. It's impossible to do this sort of movie, involving these sci-fi aspects, without at least some minor plot holes. You have to suspend disbelief a little bit.And any plot holes or odd plot twists are only on the sci-fi details, not on the overall storyline, where it counts. If you were to make a totally realistic and accurate portrayal of time travel or other sci-fi phenomenons with absolutely no plot holes, it wouldn't be a good story: because those things don't exist.So just relax, and enjoy a thought-provoking and fun sci-fi movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Probably my favorite sci-fi flick of 2012,"After watching this well crafted movie ""Men in Black 3"" came to mind which deals with time travel as well. But this one is way more clever and it goes in a more serious and dramatic direction that will keep you glued to the screen. Because you want to know exactly what is going on and how it's going to go down. Maybe there are few time paradoxes or certain time travel elements that isn't fully connected or doesn't make complete sense, maybe some loopholes. But it's a film that portray time travel in a effectively intriguing and entertaining way. When it's finished there might be a chance the audience might want a bit more to the movie. Maybe a bit more action and chase sequences. But with a movie like this, the action is just something partial. What drives this movie is the clever plot and dialogues. But than again Rian Johnson also directed ""Brick"" which has those elements as well. The idea to this film might not be entirely original but it has enough different elements to make it, it's own film. Plus a lot of ideas has already become movies or written before. So it's way better than a rehash or a remake for sure. From the trailer it seems like it's about a guy that kills people that is sent from the future to the past for money. But when he fails to kill his older self the mafia wants him dead. Thus it's a triple a triple chase movie, but that is only part of the movie. It really does go in a direction I didn't really expect, in a good way. Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and he is good at what he does, except he brings about more emotion in this than usual. But it's usually always a pleasure to see Bruce in action movies, especially if the story is good. Now Bruce plays the older version of the main character named Joe but the real protagonist is the younger Joe. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, now I don't know if it's the make up and everything or Josephs acting, probably both. But he really does pull off the younger version of Bruce Willis from the way he talks to his expressions.

Now his presence with Joseph isn't as strong as in ""The Lookout"" but it's good never the less and a bit intimidating. Anyways if anyone is in the mood for a clever, innovative sci-fi movie with some interesting elements this movie will definitely be worth checking out.

A Nutshell Review: Looper,"In Rian Johnson's vision of the future, time travel becomes a reality, but got immediately outlawed for all the damage it can cause, some of which we'd already know from many science fiction films. But that doesn't stop the mob from harnessing the technology to do its dirty work, especially when it needs to get rid of people without a trace. So those on the mob's hit list got shackled and sent back in time to the year 2014, where their looper employee gets to execute people from the future, and dispose of them. The bounty's some slabs of silver that come with their target, so that makes it quite a lucrative career, with Abe (Jeff Daniels) being the man from the future sent back to look after this hit squad operation.But here's the catch. Should this contractual agreement need to be closed, the future self of the looper gets sent back, and executed. And before you'd think that's a loophole for trouble, it's actually brilliant, because it provides an insurance policy that doesn't exist in any other scenario, and the movie actually takes time to address this suspicion of a paradox. In fact, Johnson takes the time to work any space time continuum paradox to be in the story's favour, which allows one to watch the film at first go without getting all flustered about this inherent aspect of any time travel film, with a very nice touch put in about half hour into the story, where rules get set up, and the parameters drawn in which his universe is set to operate in.This paradox involves someone from the future coming back, and that you'd recognize him/her for the first time as your future self. But for this moment in time to happen in the present, we're really dealing with two separate timelines which now converge. And the film presents all these timelines in a single narrative, nicely edited to allow its Chinese production partners some story telling time that dwells on Bruce Willis' Old Joe in future Shanghai, expanded for Old Joe to have a richer back story since Joe himself has a decent one for the present time, before both Joes converge. For the non-Chinese cut of the film, many of these aspects got unfortunately edited for pacing reasons, so I suppose picking up the DVD/Blu later is quite the no brainer.When the Joes converge, it's really when the narrative shifts gear, with a lot more action since the story now goes off like when the cue ball opens a billiards game. Joe and Old Joe sit down to evaluate their options and to exchange none-too-pleasant pleasantries, with Joe needing to fulfill his end of the contract, but Old Joe adamant in not letting him so, at least not until he gets his revenge on the Rainmaker, which is a Terminator-ish plot line to get rid of an influential messiah like character who's now a child in the present time. To complicate matters, there are three possibles.And while these are action based, it's the subtly treated character arcs on both Joes that made Looper more than just your average science fiction flick, ad gives it soul. There's no clear right or wrong here, only shades of grey, where Old Joe has to find it within himself to turn executioner for the greater good, and young Joe has to turn protector, since he's buckled himself with Emily Blunt's Sara, and her young kid Cid (Pierce Gagnon) to prevent his future self from eventually coming for them. And the best conflict presented, is if should Old Joe succeed in his mission, it's likely the future will change and he would forget about his deceased wife (Qing Xu), since the circumstances of their meeting will inevitably be changed. And this memory is something he fights so hard to want to keep alive.It is these internal conflicts and battling with demons that make Looper the top notch entertainer, where ultimately any sacrifice to change the world, should begin with the steps one will take on one's end. The final third will definitely blow your mind as Johnson had kept a number of aces up his sleeve, to deliver sucker punch after sucker punch where it mattered for the final act. Visual effects wasn't out of this world nor never seen before, but were gelled excellently for the purpose of adding to the narrative, rather than for the sake of. Production values are solid, especially when used to present different timelines, or areas within the futuristic landscapes.Bruce Willis still showed he's kind of kick-ass, and still had it within him to play action hero who ploughs through anyone who dare stand in his way, including his younger self. But the scene stealer is of course Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who through the help of prosthetics to make him facially resemble Willis in his younger days, really nailed it with the nuances and mannerisms that screams Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt was rather rote here, while Paul Dano had a small supporting role primarily used to explain Looper's parameters. Noah Segan's Kid Blue becomes one of the main villains in the film hell bent on proving himself to Abe, whose values are in contrast to the principles held by Joe. And lastly, Pierce Gagnon as the kid who could fit right in to any horror film that deals with demonic possession.Don't miss out on what could possibly be the best science fiction film this year!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A thought-provoking and thrilling sci-fi action film with a dose of originality.,"Looper is an exciting science fiction film which doesn't burst with originality but manages to bring something new to the genre anyway. In addition, it's also a crime film so there's no denying that in parts it's very violent. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, playing the same main character, do an admirable job. It's presented well how a person can change as time passes. Director Rian Johnson wrote a good script so the actors have enough time to develop their characters. Jeff Daniels, in particular, is a standout. His role is relatively minor but he impresses when he explains the high stakes of being a looper. As the film moves along, after an informative but rather dull beginning, the sci-fi elements of the story begin to develop. The action too becomes frequent and entertaining, leading to an impressive ending. The future world of Looper is a mix of the ordinary and the fantastic. Mostly it's ordinary because Johnson tried to present a lived-in and quite possible future. He did an admirable job though it's clear that a sci-fi action film was new territory for him because the film's different elements don't come together as well as they should. Despite this it's a thrilling adventure which will no doubt impress viewers. In conclusion, Looper is another solid effort by Johnson. In my opinion, it's not an instant classic but it's certainly a film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper,"About midway through these genre months, I find myself itching for a little bit of more of a variety with the movies I'm watching. Luckily, Looper was just different enough for me to avoid the mid- month genre fatigue. Director Rian Johnson brings together veteran actor Bruce Willis and emerging star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a team, of sorts in this time travel drama. An interesting look at a future that utilizes time travel, Looper is riddled with sharp dialogue and gritty, dark photography sure to capture the audience's attention.In the future of 2074, time travel is possible and utilized, but forbidden to all, unless you are a Looper. Loopers are hit men who are paid to kill criminals sent to them 30 years in the past. A Looper named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is desperately searching for something of worth in his otherwise miserable drug-fueled life. Just roaming through his life, Joe kills and stashes away his reward hoping for a respite to France in the future. One day, Joe gets the job of his life, literally, when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent to him. The only way to close a loop in this universe is for the 2074 self to be killed by the 2044 self in the past. Joe hesitates, and his future self escapes, determined to kill the boy in the past who will grow to be the man responsible for his wife's death. Realizing he has committed a grave mistake, Joe chases his future self, eventually getting a step ahead of him. Landing on a farm that Joe believes his future self is coming to in search of the boy, Joe finds a single mother and her son on the farm and soon learns there is more to her son than meets the eye. Deciding, selflessly, to protect them, Joe comes face-to-face with his future self, and must make a crucial decision.Dark cinematography was used throughout the film, and it lent itself well to the dark feelings experienced by the Loopers who were simply killing until they killed themselves. The darkness also lends itself well to the extreme isolation that affects everyone in this universe. An unexpected standout in the film was the little boy, Cid played by Pierce Gagnon. A wonderful performance with deep emotions, the child actor shines. Great performances by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt aided by rich dialogue go a long way toward the staying power of this film.Looper is a fun, yet serious film for the sci-fi genre. Complete with action, but not over the top, it was a good submission for the time travel sub-genre. I would recommend this film to sci-fi fans, as well as fans of the two lead actors. We especially see Gordon- Levitt branch out beautifully from the characters he typically portrays. Hopefully, also, we see more of the standout Pierce Gagnon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Brilliant, Willis can't do wrong by me !","I loved this, the story started with a punch, and kept me enthralled led till the very end. I admit early, I love Willis, I don't think he has made a bad film in years, and if he has made any, I can't recall it. He is again brilliant in this. The action scenes are amazingly executed for a man his age.Blunt, well, beautiful, and what an actress, she is completely convincing, and likable to boot. The little boy, well, what an actor, he was perfect, if told what his role would involve prior to seeing this, I'd not have believed someone so young could have been so convincing in this role.If your thinking its another time travel story, it isn't really, it's got a twist on the whole thing, and I'd even maybe go as far to say the time travel is fairly minor in the scheme of things.It's a long film, luckily we saw it in gold class, so it was comfortable, In a standard cinema seat, I might have gotten a bit fidgety as it is long, but I didn't notice the length at all, it was gripping the whole way.It does rate high on gory violence, nothing to bad, but definitely not kids film.Go see this, it's well worth the money.

Enjoyable character study  even if premise is dubious,"Seriously disagree with the many reviews trashing this movie. Yes, the basic premise is idiotic- sending people back in time to be killed, but watching the relationship between Gordon-Levitt and his older self Bruce Willis is loads of fun, Gordon Levitt is becoming the go-to young actor for action flicks (""Shutup, kid"")- he plays the young Bruce stupid: even after there is no reason to kill his older self, he keeps trying as though it's a point of honor. Yes, the paradoxes of time travel are unresolvable- EVERY movie has huge holes- don't let it bother you. It is so entertaining I saw it again 2 days later (very rare)- it helps to understand the convoluted plot- watching one target's fingers and limbs disappear as his younger self is butchered in the past is viscerally chilling, but I missed it the first time.Emily Blunt is solid, sexy, and very credible; and Jeff Daniels has a meaty role as mob kingpin manager of the past.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Even Wikipedia has its Limits,"Beyond the obvious visual pleasure of Emily Blunt in farm-girl chic, there's nothing but incoherence to be found in Rian Johnson's Looper, a movie so chock-full of bewildering nonsense that the viewer needs to loop back to Blunt, or Joseph Gordon-Levitt for the girls. I watched this sci-fier a week ago, and it feels as if I know less now than just after the credits rolled.I went to my best buddy, Wikipedia, to make sense of Looper by reading the plot synopsis. It didn't help. Like the guy who is having his parts snipped off one by one in the movie--and can see the result 30 years in the past or the future or a week from Thursday--every time I try to figure Looper out, there's less there.I'm so frustrated with the time-traveling and the telekinesis and the 30 second steak and eggs and the Chevy running in 2044 and the fact that the movie makes no damned sense at all that I just have to accept that Looper, which looked so interesting in the trailers, is a colossal waste of time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
How would you market this career at a job-fair?,"Rian Johnson's Looper is an intriguing science-fiction film, with a devotion to story and plot that is larger than competitors of its genre within recent years. It elaborates where other films would cop-out and purposely mystify. However, like great science-fiction, it requires significant attention to its patterns, detail, and design - something I underestimated prior to viewing.For that reason alone, perhaps Looper warrants another viewing on my part, just as a refesher. Constant evaluation seems worthless, as it so often does, an a crash course-research job seems oversimplifying. I sort of just want to experience the film again on its own terms before jumping random and arbitrary theories.I'll keep the story relatively basic; we are now in 2044 (the present), where Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) works as a ""looper."" A ""looper"" is responsible for whacking the criminals mob members send from the future, 2074. Joe will wait in an empty field when a man, masked and on his knees, will spawn in thin air like a video game character before shooting the man with a loud, ear-shattering blunderbuss. He'll proceed to dispose of the corpse in a furnace. This whole process exists because, we're told, it's much harder to dispose of a corpse in 2074 America. Apparently, it's much easier to conceal and operate a time-traveling machine (which is illegal, mind you).A looper, inevitably, meet their fate when the mob members eventually spawn their own self thirty years into the future. This is known as ""closing the loop,"" and is feared and unexpected in the career of loopers. Joe finally meets his older self (Bruce Willis), who he recognizes since he lacks the obligatory ""mask over face"" deal, and proceeds to have coffee with him in a diner and a long discussion before discovering his intentions. Later in the film, he meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her younger brother Cid (Pierce Gagnon), two locals living on a farm that wind up getting mixed up in Joe's predicament.A small feature that seems to have gone unnoticed by the public is the terrific makeup job conducted by a team of over twenty specialists who deserve more work in the field. The goal is to make Gordon-Levitt resemble a younger, spryer Bruce Willis, and the result is surprisingly great. Imperfections, however, such as more makeup on the character than in previous scenes, have been dually noted, but posed no distractions for someone who sometimes feels underwhelmed by scenery and makeup effects.Joseph Gordon-Levitt does some powerful work here, further establishing that he long ago assumed the impact and power as a character actor. From sci-fi, to action, to comedy, to drama, etc, it would be an understatement to regard him as just an actor; he's one of the most diverse souls in Hollywood today. Emily Blunt is anything but typical here, assuming a role that allows her to be brash, strong, independent, and something of a role model. Another surprising feature about Looper is its treatment of supporting characters, not simply giving the little ground to walk on. Jeff Daniels is great as Abe, the main boss, and Paul Dano, another terrific character actor who just showed untold potential in For Ellen and Ruby Sparks is Seth, Joe's pal who is fearing the worst after he ""let his loop run"" - meaning he failed to shoot the man after spawning.Like almost all science-fiction films, one can dissect them apart in such an unforgiving way that nothing would be left except for confusion and plot holes. I do not consider in-depth analysis to be a conventional part of my film criticisms, although I feel inclined to question aspects in a more collective manner. For instance, why can't the mob spawn the men directly into the furnace, omitting the danger and inevitable, ""self-inflicted"" murder a looper must commit? Also, I reiterate the question of how hard can it be to dispose of a corpse in 2074, when time-travel equipment can be made seemingly easy to access for an already criminally-run sector of the population? Has the futuristic black market become something of an incalculable empire? Looper does have a tad more explaining to do, but to its credit, its world and concepts aren't as arbitrary or as impossible as they sound. I could suspend most disbelief, much to my surprise. The future it paints isn't so much as flashy as it is attractive, detailed, and practical - like a high-resolution, digital photograph brought to life. Its crisp visuals and slick photography make it all the more captivating to watch and enjoy. One small aesthetic I, too, neglected to mention is the sound. For a science-fiction film, I was stunned at how effective it was at using auditory levels and sound editing. The use of genuine, abrupt sound is perfect when incidents like the first shot of the blunderbuss occur, or when Cid activates his extreme telekinetic powers. The effect is jarring and bombastic in the most stimulating way.Johnson has proved himself to be a storyteller above anything with Looper as his attention and development to a world so close yet so foreign to our current one is an achievement. His writing scarcely falters and his talent as a director rarely does as well. Assisted by only competent talent and terrific uses of smaller aesthetics, Looper is a well-done science fiction endeavor that finally caters to a more demanding, unfairly rewarded demographic. I'd just love to see how the job of a looper would be marketed at a town job-fair.Starring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Pierce Gagnon, Paul Dano, and Jeff Daniels.

One of the best Sci-Fi thrillers I have seen in a while!,"If you have seen the trailers and were a bit skeptical about the movie like me, you are probably still considering this movie. Then I realized how wrong I was when I decided to watch it after 5 years of considering it. This is one of the best Sci-fi thrillers I have ever seen! It is not much of a cliché, the acting is great, and it is an overall interesting and intelligent movie and really does leave you thinking after you watch it. One of the great things about this movie is that it is like Terminator or Robocop and what is so great about that is that it doesn't need a cyborg or lots of cool, intense sequences to make it a classic. Another great perk for this factor about the movie is that if you are not a fan of Sci-Fi films is that you will still enjoy it because of the film's amazing plot and character development. The biggest thing of all that made me want to rate this movie a 10 is because it is a movie like Pulp Fiction, where you can watch it as many times as you want and not know what comes next. I really hope you give this movie a chance because it is a bit underrated and not rally praised as much as it should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Looper is fun to watch and it delivers on expectation,"Looper has got loose ends and loops here and there, but Rian Johnson found a way to make simple a time travel movie without too much time travel back and forth.Looper was written and directed by Rian Johnson who teamed up with producer Ram Bergman, who produced Johnson's previous two films; it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, Levitt was a co-star in the movie Inception which had a story around travelling into the mind of people and Willis himself has had a taste of time travel with his movie 12 Monkeys in 1995.For me the reason I will advise anyone to see this movie will be the intrigue this movie delivers, from a story arc that curves around selfish ambitions. Johnson's version of the future in 2044 is also something you will like to see, with 10 percent of the world possessing the power of tele-kinetics, all morals gone out the window and an economic meltdown the world was in chaos.The story curves around two different times 2044 and 2074, in 2074 time travel is invented but illegal. Due to the fact that everyone is tagged in the future it was nearly impossible to commit murder, so the Mob had to find a way to get rid of people that they didn't want.The mob uses the time travel invention which is illegal to send men they don't want to the past to be killed, the assassins that do the killings are called Loopers.The job of a looper has a twist, after a while the Mob closes the loop on the looper by sending him a man to kill who happens to be himself 30 years from 2044. Now that is where the movie gets tricky. 2044 has two Joes, Young Joe from 2044 (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Old Joe from 2074 (Bruce Willis) which young Joe failed to kill although he tried.Although Looper slacks in the area of the story itself, the character Cid is a little too psycho to be believable but the movie is fun to see.The directing is top notch, the special effects are not so much in the high side and you can boast that you have seen better child actors, but hey! You will enjoy the time spent watching this thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Even with its centrally themed time paradox, Looper is an original and enjoyable science fiction film that relies on logic to dictate the narrative.","If you thought Inception went overboard (pun unintended) with the whole dream within a dream within a dream, don't read any further. But like Inception and Memento before it, Looper is an intricately woven yarn that is very much a thinking man's movie; at least for the most part. Luckily, unlike the aforementioned films, writer-director Rian Johnson doesn't let it get to a point where we smell our own cerebral cortex cooking. Just when you raise a hand to scratch your head, the other hand snaps a finger in triumphant euphoria, as if solving a puzzle only moments before abandoning it.The setup has Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Joe, a mafia assassin in the year 2044. His narration tells us that although time travel is yet to be invented, it exists thirty years in the future. However, its use is condemned by the government but adopted by criminal organizations as a means of ""closing the loop"". This means ending an employee's tenure by sending him to the present, where a younger ""Looper"" waits in an abandoned field with just a loaded shotgun. Loopers are paid handsomely, typically silver bars for each kill. When a Looper receives gold bars it is a cause for immediate celebration, but also means they have thirty years to live as they have just killed their future self thus closing the loop in the future. On one such contract, Joe is faced with killing his future self (Bruce Willis) but hesitates to pull the trigger. This much is known from pre-release trailers. What follows is a diabolical fight for survival where both Joes, though each unrelenting, must find and eliminate ""The Rainmaker"", a person destined to become an ironfisted criminal mastermind responsible for closing all the loops.This is a science-fiction movie that relies heavily on logic, but not necessarily the kind found in The Matrix. It's as simple as basic computer programming, where the outcome of an action depends on a pre-determined set of rules. IF you do this, THEN that will happen; as a paradox, the premise in this film is very similar to the 'Butterfly Effect'— a metaphysical theory where cause and effect play a fundamental role in a nonlinear state of progression. Simply put, Johnson's forte is in telling a story where the end justifies the means. Given the centrally themed time paradox, it becomes all the more profound that however obscure the future may seem, it is the present that determines the outcome of that future. This grain of thought powers the final act where both Joes, each with opposing agendas, work towards preventing a cataclysmic chain of events. As such, a vital plot development is omitted from the trailers, owing to which, some viewers may find that the film begins and ends without cohesion. Without spoiling much I can say that a sub-plot involving genetic mutation takes center stage towards the end.Although I have referred to other movies of similar ilk, I am happy to report that Looper is conceptually original — all the more so when every other recent movie is a sequel or a remake or a remake of a remake. Add to this a solid performance from Gordon-Levitt who has appeared in more interesting films this year than Tom Cruise. As a younger Bruce Willis, it might take a while to get used to his facial prosthetics, but I am willing to wager that Gordon-Levitt watched quite a few of the former's movies to get the swagger right, complete with Willis' iconic smirk and grunt. Willis himself is back in form with a much needed departure from some half-made films he has chosen to merely appear in over the last couple of years. Together they form a great team and amusingly play the same person. A special mention goes to Emily Blunt, who although has more screen time than necessary, makes a refreshing change as a straight-talking, shotgun-wielding Southerner with very little trace of her native British accent. Her character brings in a questionable romantic element, but is also linked to a vital plot development. Finally, kudos to Johnson for a good attempt at skillfully presenting a sci-fi film that also has a film noir look and feel despite its futuristic setting. There are moments when you wish Johnson's script could have used Christopher Nolan's finesse, but that would be asking for too much. À la dual-wielding guns ablaze, Bruce Willis also gets his clichéd moments, but let's just say we would rather see Willis with a gun than a magic wand.This is a recommended movie. You can either watch it now or risk watching it later — by this I mean your future self could be annoyed with your present self for not watching it sooner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Brainless and moronic, it tries to do many things and fails fundamentally at them all.","This film is seriously just bad. At first you're drawn in, the concept threatens to become fascinating; but it simply tumbles into an abysmal joke of a movie that ends with a disgusting cliché. You seriously have to check your brain at the door to even remotely enjoy this film. How it has carried an 8.2 rating here baffles me. Source Code it is not, Inception it is not, Terminator it is not. I really worry about the future of science fiction considering how well this abomination has done. Someone had the gall to call this movie this generations Matrix. Apparently this generation is drastically dumber than mine was! Time travel is a tricky thing to deal with.

"A Unique, Clever Sci-Fi Film. Just about Pefect.","I was really hoping this film would be good, as I love the concept and the story, and I really loved the two leading actors. I have to say I absolutely loved Looper. The two leads were perfect - Joseph Gordon-Levit was fantastic, and I cant wait to see him again soon and Bruce Willis was on his usual top class. I especially loved the directing, the editing also - for example, the opening scene was fantastic, the lack of music was especially memorable. Also, I loved the montage of Old Joe's life near the beginning. The Future design was especially enjoyable too. The design of the city was spot on and the retro 'blunderbusses' guns looked great too. As for the time travel, it was simple enough to get your head around, but not so easy that you didn't have to think about it, which I think is necessary in a Sci-Fi. It's not often I come across a film like this and this is probably one of the best films of the year, probably also in my top ten. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An Annoying Plot Shift Ruins a Could've-Been 10/10 Movie,"Looper starts out great. The plot is fresh and original, the acting is pretty good, Joseph Gordon Levitt looks a hell of a lot like an actual young Bruce Willis, and the movie goes from there, with JGL trying to chase his ""future self"" through the present. This movie is complex, but once you hit Nirvana with the idea, like Inception, you will understand everything.As Levitt chases his future self through the world, he stumbles across a farmhouse, and there lies Emily Blunt. From that point in the movie --a little under halfway-- the plot shifts, and is all about Blunt's son. (I won't spoil what happens anymore).I hated this plot shift as the focus of the movie veered off the side of the road of getting to the intended finale. other than this, the movie isn't half bad.HandHStudios Rating: 7.2/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An Incredibly Solid Action Film & Creative Bit of Sci-Fi,"I am an instant fan of new, creative science fiction when it comes along. We don't get it often but we've gotten a nice resurgence in recent years with Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and Neill Blomkamp (DISTRICT 9). I haven't been lucky enough to catch any of writer/director Rian Johnson's previous movies but there was a lot of positive hype surrounding LOOPER. The trailers hadn't grabbed me and the premise, while interesting, seemed like it could go in a generic direction. But the widespread positive word-of-mouth dragged me in and I'm so glad it did. LOOPER is the latest in well-directed, thought-provoking science fiction. It's set in the year 2044 where most of civilized society is in shambles. Poverty and violence are commonplace, so it's no surprise that many people turn to crime. There is one segment of the criminal world worth notice: the loopers. Loopers are hired guns overseen by a minor mob boss from the future, a future where time travel was invented and instantly outlawed. Some of the larger criminal organizations use it to send their victims to a time where their body can be disposed of without issue. The loopers kill the target, dispose of the body, and collect the rewarduntil their loop is closed. Thirty years in the future, the retired loopers are sent back in time for elimination to remove any trace of their involvement. When Joe, a young looper, is put in the position to close his loop and fails, he becomes a target unless he can track down his older self and kill him.I admit it sounds really confusing to have to try and explain it to someone. This really is one of those movies you just need to watch. Keep in mind, this is a movie about time travel and you can expect paradoxes or plot holes or whatever. It's going to happen, as it does with all of them (yes, even the classic BACK TO THE FUTURE). Just accept it. The time travel element is handled incredibly well and nitpicking is going to do nothing but ruin the experience for you. Even the elder Joe (Bruce Willis) is given a scene in which he basically says it outright: don't worry about the mechanics of it all. That's not where the story lies. The story is about young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the elder Joe (Willis), and the strong woman they encounter on a rural Kansas farm with a little son who is more important to the future than she could ever imagine. That's what I liked most about the story. I walked in expecting a cat-and- mouse chase movie where Joseph Gordon-Levitt spends the entire time chasing down his future self and saving himself from the mob heavies on his trail. Instead, the movie quickly shifts gears when Bruce Willis arrives in the past and discover that his intention isn't just to avoid his own assassination but to change the course events in the future. It becomes so much more than a chase movie and I give it a lot of respect for that alone.I also love that the majority of the effects in this movie were done practically. You wouldn't necessarily know it from looking at it. There was a lot added digitally into the background to improve on the cityscapes and all that, but a lot of the gunfights, TK (telekinetic) effects, and even the hovering motorbikes were all done practically. I love any movie that prefers practical over digital because it feels that much more real. Then there are the makeup effects. Gordon-Levitt was made up to look more like a thirty-year younger version of Bruce Willis and it really works. It's a little off-putting at first to see him with bright blue eyes, but it's crazy how much he was able to emulate Willis's nature and mannerisms. It's an easy sell to accept him as the same person minus thirty additional years of experience and suffering. Emily Blunt is in the movie as Sara, the strong independent mother of a special child. She does a commendable job in the movie, considering the only thing I've seen her in previously was THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT and didn't give her much to work with. As an added bonus, we get Jeff Daniels as mob boss Abe. All of this comes together to create one of the most unique, exciting movies of the year. LOOPER is one that I hope everyone will check out at some point. It's great science fiction without the burden of exhausting tech details or geek culture. It's just an incredibly solid action film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Flawed but interesting concept,It was an interesting film ...but I could never shake the pointlessness of it. The central concept that organised crime can't kill people in the future due to tagging and identification of bodies... So they send them back to a coordinate via time travel in the past where a looper kills them for silver... So why not just set the Time travel coordinates to that of various active volcanoes...

I have to applaud the two leads, Levitt and Bruce Willis for doing an amazing job at playing the same guy. I do feel like the make-up and prosthetic for Levitt were almost too heavy and unneeded. The characters and acting make up for that though and lead for an entertaining movie that will be loved by older sci-fi fans looking for a fresh film that is not a copy of the last 100 films released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Extremely Unique and Thoughtful.,"Thoughtful, Unique, Thrilling, Visually Stunning with a brilliant concept and backed up by Writer-Director Rian Johnson's brilliant work and brilliant acting from the front trio, Looper is definitely a highly thrilling and thoughtful sci-fi movie which ensures entertainment right from the beginning and definitely lives up to the high expectations and in my opinion is one of the best sci-fi movies of the past times highly due to the brilliant work by Rian Johnson and his crew.So The Story written by Rian Johnson himself is showing the year 2074 where dangerous mob's can get their targets eliminated by sending them back to the past through time travel and the killing be done by a Looper, and the story is based upon Joe(Gordon-Levitt) who himself is a Looper and has done lots of killing for some good amounts of money. But One day it all goes wrong where his own Loop or his own older self is to be eliminated by him and the older Joe(Bruce Willis) escapes from him and is on a mission to eliminate the Rainmaker who is responsible for the killings of the Loops. So Now Joe must kill his older self in order to get his life back and get back to being a Looper.Joseph Gordon Levitt is in the lead role in this movie and does so brilliantly well yet again as Joe, and he is really a talented actors suited for these kind of serious roles. He Reminds me of a young Robert De Niro in this movie and sometimes his voice was also identical to De Niro, well he has the capability of becoming as good as De Niro in the future. The Movie is revolving around his character and he does an extremely good job in keeping the audience glued to his character. Bruce Willis too did a very good job as the old Joe, and although i think that the change from Gordon Levitt to Willis was a bit illogical, Willis did a very convincing job nevertheless. Emily Blunt also did a good job in portraying Sara and the acting trio have shined in this movie, and the rest of the crew also did a good job in their respective roles.The Director-Writer Rian Johnson has done a tremendous job in making this movie considering that he also wrote the script for the movie, and the way the movie is set up from the beginning and shown throughout is absolutely brilliant and he explained his story brilliantly and also picked and directed a brilliant acting crew who all did their respective job very well, and also handled his visual crew well as the visual effects in the movie was absolutely top-class. The Story which i think is an original story written by him is absolutely brilliant and unique and time travel was shown so brilliantly and the effects of it too in the story and considering that its his own idea, Johnson did a mind- blowing job with the script and concept of this movie.The Visual Effects of this movie right from the beginning and some of the scenes shown are absolutely mind-blowing stuff and the visual effects crew has done a marvelous job starting from the fighting scenes to the slow-motion one's and considering that its all futuristic stuff, this movie deserves some awards for its visual effects. The Cinematography in this movie too is top-class as the place's and area's shown starting from Kansas to Shanghai and that too in the future are absolutely so realistic and mind-blowing stuff and full credits to the cinematographer Steve Yedlin for his contributions to the film.Finally, I really think that everyone should go for it being or not being a sci-fi movie fan, this is probably the best sci-fi movie after Inception and really deserves a watch and it also ensures full on entertainment and also will keep you mesmerized from the beginning and keep you thinking right till the ending scene.My Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Common sense did not prevail,"This review contains SPOILERS, none of which come even remotely close to the spoilers embedded in this garbled nightmare of a plot.Anyone who considers themselves mildly vexed by plots which are thin, or where characters/people act irrationally, it's unlikely you'll enjoy this movie as it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The salt in the wound is it is actually boring and has minimal action, scarcely any actually.The pretext for the movie is so ludicrous, that you have to actively tell your brain to shut up whilst watching the movie. Why do the mafia use their exclusive access to time travel to assassinate people? They could alter the future in any way they wanted. Surely even they are not so hopped up on goofballs that they didn't realise this potential. Who on earth would send a future self back to be killed by their past self? They had quite a few loopers, don't send them back to 'close their own loop' it's flippin retarded on so many levels. IT MAKES NO SENSE, no one would ever do this, let alone the mob.What ON EARTH was that ending all about. Possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen.1. The Rainmaker became a ruthless gangster because his mother was murdered when he was growing up. 2. His mother was murdered because he became a ruthless gangster, and sent his men to kill Bruce Willis, causing his wife to die and him to go and kill the rainmakers mum. C- At what point was the Rainmaker's mum killed by Bruce Willis? She never would have been, and therefore none of this would have happened.Premise 1- Rainmakers mum dies causes Premise 2- Bruce Willis kills her- therefore it is impossible.It's not interesting, it's stupid. It's not action packed, it's boring. It's not particularly well acted (Bruce Willis and his wife laughable) It bastardises the fascinating concept of time travel into nothing, an irrelevant factor used when it's convenient to give cheap thrills.Such a load of tripe.

If you like these types of movies you'll eat it up!,"'LOOPER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis star in this time travel Sci-Fi action film written and directed by Rian Johnson (who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed crime films 'BRICK', also starring Gordon-Levitt, and 'THE BROTHERS BLOOM'). The story revolves around a future where the mob uses time travel to dispose of bodies and the hit men assigned to do the disposing are called 'loopers'. Gordon-Levitt stars as one such 'looper' and Willis plays his older self, who's sent back for his younger self to get rid of. The film is a pretty fresh and interesting take on the time travel genre and it's excellently crafted by Johnson.The film is set in the year 2044 when the world has fallen in to another economic recession and organized crime has escalated. Mutations causing telekinetic abilities have also appeared in about 10% of the population as well and crime lords have learned that thirty years in the future time travel will be developed and immediately outlawed. This doesn't stop crime rings from taking advantage of it though and they use it to get rid of bodies, by sending victims back in time to be killed (due to new tracking technology making it impossible to secretly dispose of a body). The men hired to do the disposing are called 'loopers' and when their contracts are up their future self is sent back in time for them to kill, leaving them a limited future of only thirty years but also a hefty paycheck to spend living it. When one such looper, Joe (Gordon-Levitt), fails to kill his future self (Willis) and lets him escape he finds himself in a world of trouble and on the run from the mob. He desperately tries to track his older self down while the 'Old Joe' has a plan of his own in extending his life and future happiness.The movie is a lot of fun if you like these types of movies. The directing and visuals are topnotch and the story is unique and clever. If you think about certain plot points for too long though (like every time travel movie) you'll start to see a lot of possible plot holes but they're not important to the enjoyment of the film (if you don't let yourself get caught up in them). Willis and Gordon-Levitt are perfectly cast as older and younger versions of each other and it appears as though there's some great CGI and makeup to make Gordon-Levitt look uncannily like a young Bruce Willis. Emily Blunt also has a nice supporting role as the mother of an especially gifted telekinetic mutant (played eerily by Pierce Gagnon). I also really liked how the film kind of makes the viewer surprisingly shift who their rooting for as who appears to be the good guy and who appears to be somewhat of a bad guy changes unexpectedly. The film is most of all highly entertaining. It's dark and violent and definitely not the most uplifting Sci-Fi film but it's still a lot of fun.

Takes an old idea and moves in an unexpected direction with it.,"Time travel. It has fascinated people for years. What if we were able to control the future through the past. Lots of movies, books, TV shows, etc. have been made about it. And here's the thing.It doesn't exist.And because it doesn't exist, we don't actually fully understand how it works. We all have our theories, but nobody could actually tell you the exact outcome of going back in time and killing baby Hitler. This is important, because I've heard a lot of people saying that their are plot holes because ""Time travel doesn't work that way."" Sure it doesn't. We have no idea how time travel works. And so, movies like this are made, presenting ideas in an artistic format. The characters themselves fully acknowledge that they, people who are living in a time when time travel exists, don't fully understand it.Any movie that dares to tackle time travel will run into a few plot holes. The real sign of how good a movie is is how much the plot holes detract from the viewing experience. In this case.... I'd say none.Now that I've tackled a problem, to the review:A futuristic assassin (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Joe, who kills people sent back in time from when time travel exists one day encounters his future self. As one of his targets. His future self (Bruce Willis) manages to escape and the man hunt begins. What's more, in the future, a powerful person called ""the Rainmaker"" is in total control and actually killed future Joe's wife. Because of this, future Joe sets off to kill the Rainmaker, who is still only a child at this point. Younger Joe gets a hold of one of the possible addresses and stakes out a farm house, occupied by a tough young woman, Sara (Emily Blunt), and her son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon), one of the potential Rainmakers.Obviously, this film takes on some of the Terminator films' vibes. But even though parts of the plot seem familiar, (killing someone who in the future will become evil, future and past meeting, etc.) the movie takes a very different route. Instead of being predictable, the characters and set-up create a maze of possible plot-lines, follows one, and leaves the audience to guess at different outcomes.The absolute best part of this film is the characters. The effort put into writing them, making them all plausible and sympathetic, is wonderful. All of the main characters are fleshed out and feel very real. They follow arcs and grow and change. The acting, which of course is what brings the characters to life, is flawless, even from the young Pierce Gagnon. Child actors can be tricky, but he manages to play a character who is innocent, yet dangerous (a difficult part for anyone) with full believability and intensity. Emily Blunt gives a particularly interesting performance, playing both a tough, strong care-giver and a frightened and alone person. And Bruce Willis (an old favourite) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (younger, but with a similarly impressive career both in front and behind him) play off each other as the same person with two very different mind-sets in a truly delightful way.I've heard some complaints that the movie isn't the one the trailers showed. I, for one, liked this. Trailers have a bit of a blind spot of giving away everything. They tell the whole story within a few moments and make seeing the movie boring. If all the plot twists are in the trailer, then why bother seeing the film? Trailers are there to entice you. And Looper's trailer did.This film is original, interesting, and dynamic. But don't take my word for it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper throws YOU for a loop,"This original screenplay has some elements that are truly unique and inventive, the concept while done before in other movies is really borderline brilliant. That said you may be wondering why all the negative reviews and why I'm only giving it a 6 out of 10 rating. The problem with this one, and in my opinion a fairly big problem is that the theme or plot is difficult to surround. The characters try and set up the premise of the story but it never truly comes clear to the viewer. You'll spend the entire movie trying to figure how, what, and why things happen as they do. I like movies where you are required to think and make assumptions involving characters and plot lines, but this movie just flat out leaves too many blank spots in the story and character development. While the action is good, the acting competent, and there is enough good to sustain your interest right to the bitter end, the flaws are just to big to make this attempt anymore than an average movie with what could of been an exceptional and original idea.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Looper may not always be easy to understand, but it's still worth seeing","Okay, I just saw this time travel movie starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt with my movie theatre-working friend.

I mean, it was a while what that young mother with her pre-teen kid had to do with the plot that was on my mind much of the time. And I'll probably have to watch this again to really understand.

As Joseph Gordon-Levitt goes about his work, one victim arrives at the elimination site without a bag on his face, and he looks extremely familiar. It turns out it's the older version of Joe, played by Bruce Willis!If that blows your mind, you'll love this movie. I saw it in the theaters and was extremely riveted. It's quick, smart, mysterious, and dramatic. With a bit of makeup and quite a bit of studying Bruce's mannerisms and facial expressions, Joe is a perfect replica.

Suspend belief and enjoy the ride,"Shanghai, 2074 - 55 year old Joseph Simmons (Bruce Willis) is sent back 30 years through time travel to be assassinated at the wish of a criminal fraternity which doesn't want the inconvenience of a body in a future when murder is hard to hide. Kansas, 2044 - 25 year old Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a nose made to look like that of Wilis) is the eponymous looper whose job is to kill those sent to him for execution, even if it is his older self (a process known as 'closing the loop'). London, 2012 - I enter the cinema excited to see a movie which has received such tremendous reviews but aware that the plotting is going to hurt my head.Writer and director Rian Johnson has given us a wonderfully inventive narrative, but the trouble with time travel movies is that you struggle to understand all the rules and reconcile all the contradictions and then you realise that, try as you might, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.But suspend belief and enjoy the ride for this is an exciting and well-plotted story that grabs you from the beginning and never stops shaking you up. As well as the two leads (good to see Willis still credible as the hard man after so long and encouraging to see Gordon-Levitt's growing success), there are some good support roles, notably Jeff Daniels playing against type as a vicious criminal overlord and the ever-watchable Emily Blunt eschewing her cut-glass English accent for a passable Kansas one.And then there is that cute kid ((Pierce Gagnon) who may not be quite as innocent as he looks. A particularly enjoyable scene is when Old Joe meets Young Joe in a diner which reminded me a little of when Robert de Niro and Al Pacino meet in a similar setting in ""Heat"".",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
unusual time travel movie,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars with Bruce Willis, Jeff Daniels, and Emily Blunt in ""Looper,"" a 2012 film written and directed by Rian Johnson.Gordon-Levitt plays Joe in the year 2044.

At the end of their run, the looper kills his older self in the future, takes the silver and enjoys 30 years of retirement.All of this happens to Joe. He kills his older self and takes the gold bars (that's the final payoff) and has a good retirement.

In The Loop,"Enjoyable SF effort from emerging auteur Rian Johnson, writer and director of the excellent 'Brick' and the very good (but not excellent) 'Brothers Bloom', 'Looper' is a challenging time-travel yarn, which finds Joseph Gordon-Levitt trying to unpick the tangled plot strands that run through what is a stylish future thriller. The make-up work to alter JGL and make him more Willis-like is remarkably good, and there's a functional matter-of-factness about the technology of the future that makes it easy to accept, a believable near(ish)-future, and the whole thing looks wonderful thanks to DP Steve Yedlin. But 'Looper' is not without issues. Being told more than once not to think about the implications of time travel felt patronising, even when it is the very excellent Jeff Daniels doing the telling - and Mr. J. could have done a lot worse than take a leaf out of the book of the superlative 'Primer' (find it, watch it) and Shane Carruth in that regard. It all goes a bit 'Witness' in the third act, but there is sufficient chemistry between Emily Blunt and JGL that the tension is maintained, and the climax is impactful and highly satisfying. What higher recommendation can there be for Mr. Johnson's abilities than the fact that he has delivered three episodes of the seminal 'Breaking Bad'? We should be awaiting his next project with bated breath.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intelligently exhilarating.,"I enjoy big, silly action flicks as much as the next bloke, but I enjoy big, intelligent action flicks even more. Rian Johnson's third effort behind the camera (after the superb Brick and the disappointing The Brother's Bloom) is a sublime mix of stylised violence, edge-of-seat tension and thought-provoking narrative. There are no easy answers to the questions raised by Johnson's time-travel saga – for example, would you kill a small child if you knew he grew up to be a mass-murderer? – however these challenging themes never stop the film from being utterly exhilarating from start to finish. Whether it's the startling opening scene, the alternate path montage or the heart-in-mouth finale, Looper barely misses a beat thanks to Johnson's brilliant pacing and measured use of various camera techniques, Nathan Johnson's engrossing score and the subtly employed CGI which reaches its zenith during the telekinetic climax. The actors are all on song too; Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels are perfectly cast as a fugitive from the future, a strong-willed mother and a charismatic mob boss respectively, but this is undoubtedly Joseph Gordon-Levitt's show. Playing Willis' younger self, who incidentally is trying to kill his older self (confused yet?), JGL is phenomenal as the arrogant, conflicted protagonist who on the surface is an egotistical prick but over time displays a deeper emotional understanding of how the world works.

The Best Time Travel Film I've Seen in Years,"Looper, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt is set in the year 2044 where time travel has not yet been invented, but 30 years from then it will be. In that future, crime syndicates have gained widespread power, but due to advances in technology, murder and disposal of bodies has become increasingly difficult. The solution they have found to this problem is hiring hit men in the past called Loopers to execute and dispose of the people the mob wants gone; sending them back in time, bound and gagged, to meet with the business end of a Looper's blunderbuss. The story follows Joe, a Looper who is leading an extravagant, but self-destructive life off the considerable paycheck he gets for his particular line of work. However, that all changes when one day the person who is sent to be killed happens to be himself, 30 years from now.Let me just cut right to the chase, Looper is incredible. It's the kind of truly unique, smart, entertaining, well told, and exciting film that reaffirms why we love the movies in the first place. I had been hearing some really high praise for this film so I went in with high expectations yet I was still completely blown away. The film understands its themes, its settings, and its characters, and uses all of these elements to their fullest effect. It never cheats by betraying its own integrity, and because of that is able to craft the best time travel story I've seen in years. Time travel is always a tricky thing to tackle. The very nature of it comes prepackaged with messy paradoxes and inconsistencies, but writer/director Rian Johnson establishes very clearly his rules for time travel in a way that doesn't get bogged down in endless exposition. It trusts is audience to be smart enough to fill in the details and sets up only as much of the mechanics as are necessary for the story. Because of that, though this is the kind of movie that certain types of people will hate (mostly stupid kids on the internet pretending to be smart) because they'll focus on trying to pick out any logic flaws with the plot and utterly miss the point of the narrative. However, despite being based around a plot device as inherently messy and illogical as time travel it establishes its rules firmly and never deviates. If you dig deep enough you're sure to find holes in the plot, but the narrative is absolutely rock solid, and that's what really matters.Every element of this film helps to sell the story. The future in Looper feels like a real place and each scene is full of little details that, while never highlighted, help ground the film and paint a more vivid picture of this world. The film also boasts a slew of excellent performances. Gordon-Levitt and Willis are the obvious standouts, brilliantly playing the same person separated by 30 years of life experience. It's somewhat incredible how they have managed to capture the duality of that relationship; the reality that while you may be the same person in the literal sense, age and experience fundamentally changes who you are. It's an interesting theme and the film handles it masterfully, illustrating how time can change a person's goals, their priorities, and the things they are willing to sacrifice. I do kind of wish, though, that they hadn't given Joseph Gordon-Levitt the Bruce Willis makeup, because at times it can be slightly distracting, and the performances are honestly good enough to sell that these two characters are the same person without the need for makeup. It's a small complaint, but it's about the most I can find fault with in this film. The performances from the secondary characters also shine quite a bit in their own right. Every character feels real and textured, and it all contributes to the reality of this world.The film also impressed me by not taking the obvious route concepts like this tend to take; instead it charts its own unique territory, creating a truly memorable experience. In some alternate universe there's probably a version of this movie that does exactly what you'd expect a film like this to do, and it's probably a solid and entertaining film. However, by taking the story in a direction that is different and unexpected Looper is so much more effective. There were several times during the film where I marveled at the quality of the story telling, taking seemingly throwaway details and later using them to lead to genuinely smart and surprising developments. Nothing in the film is wasted. Expectations are turned on their heads, and just about every time you think you've figured out where the film is going it will either go a different direction or get there in a way that is surprising. Despite this, it still remains absolutely true to itself and every single twist or development has the feeling of unexpected inevitability that is so crucial yet so hard to achieve.Looper is a fantastic film. It masterfully combines action, suspense, genuinely smart twists, and is all grounded by a compelling setting and a strong element of human emotion. It has jumped to the top of my favorite films of the year list, and is arguably one of the best time travel stories I've ever seen. I highly recommend this one. It is an absolute breath of fresh air and the kind of film that makes you fall in love with the movies all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Simliar to the Matrix, this movie catches up slowly, it quite took some time until I got behind the story, and began to understand. Sadly some logical flaws made me stumble as well, a very annoying fact. Of course it is not easy to setup a scene where your future ego interacts with his younger pedant. But as this was a key part, it took away the brilliance which was inherent in the Looper. A little more accuracy would have made this movie a 10 for me.

Too many ingredients in the narrative. 75%,"Not a bad time travel story concerning executioners known as ""loopers"" who kill people sent back in time by criminals. The film is set in the future where, we are told, time travel has not yet been invented. Criminals in the 'loopers'' future need to 'dispose' of people from that future time by sending them back in time as people are so easily identified in the criminals' time that you can't have anonymous corpses then.Of course, the executioners are well compensated for their work. Their biggest payday is earned when they execute their future selves! That is know as ""closing the loop"". They then have 30 years in which to live it up before...they get sent back in time to be eliminated (in order to cover the tracks of their future criminal employers). This, of course, brings many time travel paradoxes into play.Whilst an interesting concept, the biggest drag on this movie is having another genre staple in the mix...telekinesis. Time travel is hard enough to get your head around but the addition of telekinesis strikes me as just naff. The movie could have been improved by tightening it (with the removal of that element).The characters aren't particularly engaging either and they're not sympathetic for the most part. One looper - Joe - is the subject of the movie. His younger self is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his older self is played by Bruce Willis (who has a superior time travel movie to his credit...""12 monkeys""...although his performance in that earlier movie wasn't what was good about it either).Perhaps another detracting element from the film is the logic of time travel...the scenario as I outlined above seems to contradict scientific understanding of the limits of time travel. That understanding was best illustrated in the more brain hurting movie ""Primer"". I've reviewed that movie here and commented on it requiring flowcharts and notes to keep tabs on what is happening. ""Looper"" does pretend to be that complicated (Old Joe mentions the pitfalls of discussing time travel) but isn't. So, aside from seeming to portray an impossible form of time travel, it also seems to become incoherent in other ways too. When Joe has to ""close the loop"" on one occasion, the movie does seem to lapse into ""Groundhog day"" territory (a terrific comedy with some overlapping ideas) but then becomes confusing. I'm guessing that's because of bad story telling rather than any problems with the notion of time travel itself. That scene seems either inooherent or misleading.Anyway, I did like the ending to this movie...even though I'm not sure it followed its own internal logic of what time travel entails!Recommendations:12 monkeysPrimer. You really do need a flowchart and a notepad to keep up!Groundhog day",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Manages to stay afloat even after treading on prohibited territory abandoning the most desirable path.,"I have strong mixed feelings about this movie. Lets have a quick look at what those mixed reactions areWhats Good? Great fusion of genres - mutations, time travel, generic sci-fi and superhero. Popular casting of actors who the audience love to see. Screenplay that holds your attention for most of the runtime. Interesting concept bringing back memories of the Terminator. A terrific performance by Pierce Gagnon as an emotionally volatile kid with a powerful ability. Most of all, it has some powerful moments that touch your heart.Whats Bad? Introduction with a flat storyline that doesn't raise a pulse until the young kid shows up who is the heart and soul of the movie. The gimmick to make Levitt look like Bruce Willis was a farce beyond repair. And Bruce Willis looked so out of place with both his mannerisms and lines until he was given a gun and allowed to go bombastic. It suffers the same fate as most other time travel based stories do - impossible flawed conclusion. Future self meeting the current man can lead to very interesting conversation, this moment was ruined with just more bang bang.Concept: In the future when bodies are impossible to dispose off, criminal gangs make use of the already invented time travel technology to send people back 30 years who they want to get rid off. A 'Looper' waits for the person to arrive, kills them and dispose off the body. A Looper gets well paid but there is a catch. At some point a future self of the Looper will be sent back who is to be killed the same way as any other but comes with a big payday and a retirement. Letting a kill get away is a death warrant.Story: Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper. When his future self (Bruce Willis) comes back, a moment's hesitation allows older Joe to get the best of him. After a few tussles, tracking down etc., older Joe tells the story about a man calling himself The Rainmaker who spells deadly terror in the future taking down all the criminal syndicates and closing down all the loops. He has narrowed down on the Rainmaker's identity who will now be just a kid (Pierce Gagnon) son of Sara (Emily Blunt) and wants to take him down.Movies involving time travel should have some basic elements right for them to work since the concept by itself is flawed anyway. Either the plot has to be extremely complex to take the viewer's mind of the general logics that surrounds it, or overcome it with downright entertainment. Looper falls short on both directions. Levitt's makeup to look like Bruce Willis makes him incapable of conveying the right expressions. No great innovation or awe in the special effects department either. Bruce Willis first few dialogues with Levitt are laughable and can be mistaken for The Expendables. But with some smart screenplay, charismatic Emily Blunt and a performance by Pierce Gagnon that could blow you away.Manages to stay afloat even after treading on prohibited territory abandoning the most desirable path.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Thoughtful, character-driven...","First thing to get out of the way about ""Looper""; time travel is a plot device, and nothing more. The movie is much more about the characters and the implications of their actions. It's kind of a philosophy treatise wrapped up in an engaging action plot.There are multiple holes and inconsistencies in the plot. Honestly, they don't matter. This is a character-driven story, and a rather good one.There's a neat, ""noir-ish"" tone to the movie. There's some exposition in the first half-hour that helps us understand the rules of this universe.

Time loops,"In the distant future time travel will have been invented, but its implication were catastrophic in scale. Thus quickly banned by governments they only function underground, especially as part of crime syndicates utilising the invention to commit murders: people are sent back in time to be then disposed off by special killers called loopers. Controlled by Abe (Jeff Daniels), these renegade contract killers have agreed to their profession with the awareness that in an uncertain future they will have to cap off their future selves for the last golden paycheck. When Joe (a disfigured Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to kill off Old Joe (Bruce Willis) he becomes marked by Abe's foot soldiers. Meanwhile Old Joe aims to avert the rise of the murderous Rainmaker by killing him as a child, thus saving his beloved wife from death.The whole premise is pretty far-fetched, while the implications of time travel are best summarised by Abe: ""This time travel crap, just fries your brain like a egg..."" Best not ask, best not try to logically tie yourself around it and furthermore just avoid searching for plot holes, because you will sure as hell not be disappointed. Internal logic of time travel mechanics or narrative are shady at best, while occasionally falling over itself. A simple example: At the start of the movie we are told that victims are sent back in time, because future technology makes it impossible to hide murders. But this does not stop mafia from killing off Old Joe's wife...Putting those idiosyncrasies away, best stick with the story itself, which... honestly isn't as captivating and innovative as has been claimed. Whereas the movie itself is pretty engrossing, the narrative well strewn, the overall concept fails to juggle the ideas included. When the plot starts becoming somewhat obvious, ""Looper"" lacks enough emotional tension to make it a true classic, and the general lapses make it a vastly inferior movie to ""Brick"", Rian Johnson's breakthrough debut. Action sequences are nicely limited in scale and thus avoid becoming tiresome main events, instead allowing focus on the story (another point for special effects, which compliment the feature without overawing). Internal demons and conflicts with one self take on a whole new meaning, as perspectives of the young and old Joe vary, thus making life priorities diverge. The face-to-face encounter and conflict it causes offered such prolific possiilities to explore, but sadly young and old Joe rarely interact with each other. The potential for contemplative sci-fi was there, but somewhere along the way the possibility of venturing in depth was lost, when the somewhat intriguing, but also distracting, side plot of whether or not killing the child Hitler is justified takes center stage and the concept of self-conflict ends up unrealised. Thus the movie lacks emotional coherency, with dramatic aspects flustering all around and failing to pinpoint the internal turmoil, which is taking place. Some original ideas are floating around, but I personally wasn't in awe, partly due to the awkward focus of attention on Gordon-Lewitt's makeup.The facial characterisation of Joseph Gordon Lewitt was a extreme put-off, so that he would like more like 'a young Bruce Willis', but the end result was irksome and distracting, making him somewhat disfeatured and severely inhibiting his acting capabilities. At best the whole move was pointless, proving a flustering influence on viewing. Nonetheless ""Looper"" was undeniably a joyous adventure with an overall enticing story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Critical-Thinking, Creative, Exciting","This movie is excellent. If you enjoy Sci-Fi, mysterious, action-packed thrillers I highly recommend it for you. Joseph Gordon Levitt has solidified himself as one of the decades most entertaining actors with this film- With help from a perfectly casted Bruce Willis and all around great supporting actors. The TRUE thing that made this movie stand out from others was its creativity. Brian Johnson (The Director & Writer) developed a whole new realm of reality where time travel becomes an issue with people's improper use. The movie like a rope that you keep following through twists and turns, which you later solve with the awesome revelation of the mystery. If you love movies that make you think creatively and cause you're imagination to run ramped, then you MUST check this movie out. Some movies I won't be interested throughout the whole film, however this movie was different. Well done Mr. Johnson. Overall an excellently creative movie which will have you thinking afterwards (:",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Super Looper,"It's not fair to simply call Looper a brainy time-travel movie, because it's so much deeper than that. It's like Inception, only much less convoluted; provocative without being overwrought. It's the odd time- travel movie that understands the limitations inherent in the genre and not only doesn't gloss over them, it embraces them and makes them part of the fun. I found it so engrossing that I actually overthought one element of the story, thinking it meant something when it turned out not to.The year is 2044, and life sucks just about everywhere. Cities are slums. Even cornfields aren't safe from ravaging hobos. It's bleak, like most futures are in the movies. Time travel, we're told, hasn't been invented yet. But by 2074, it will have been. And in 2074, the government is so on top of things that the bleakness of 2044 looks Paradisal by comparison. They outlaw time travel so that only outlaws can time travel. In this case, that would be organized crime. When they want someone to disappear permanently like, they send him back in time to 2044, where an assassin shoots him dead. Much more fun than dumping his body in the Pine Barrens. This erases all trace of the dearly departed. Clean, tidy.The assassins are called Loopers. They don't know who they're shooting. Their prey arrives on a blanket at a particular time and place, head covered in a bag, hands bound. The Looper shoots, turns the victim over, and claims his pay in silver bars, which are big in 2044.Loopers have one standing order: don't let your man get away. Shoot to kill. Even if he's you. And that's the crux of this thriller, when Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds himself face to face with...well, himself. His 2074 self, Old Joe (Bruce Willis). Yup, that's who the mob's sent back. This is known as closing the loop, and it means your contract's been terminated. Oh, you can live your life as long as you want, but you won't be a cold assassin anymore, which kind of stinks. At any rate, there's more to it than just a loop closure. Old Joe promptly escapes his execution and is a man on a mission. He needs to kill someone in 2044 so that they don't become someone bad in 2074. That's a mission we can all get behind, right?Young Joe, for lack of a better distinction, has troubles of his own. First, he isn't supposed to be free, what with his victim getting away (the entire city is looking for him). Second, he's a junkie, hooked on some future drug that you drop into your eyeballs. His own men are looking for him, he needs to find Bruce Willis, and what the heck does all of this have to do with the future, anyway? Man, a whole lot, it turns out, a whole lot.Let me put it this way. At first, you think Old Joe is just on a personal vendetta - which he is. But it's more than that. What he wants to do could make things a heck of a lot better in good ol 2074. But that conflicts with what Young Joe has in mind, which is to finish his job and take off for France (don't ask).The movie is existential. How did Old Joe get in the position of being sent back by the mob? He IS Joe, after all, and the Joe we know seems to have his head on his shoulders. What happens? Bad stuff, apparently. But back to the existentiality of it all. Let's pose a question - if you had a chance to kill a future terrorist, would you? Is the answer an easy one? What if the baby future terrorist wouldn't become said terrorist if certain branches in his life had led to different conclusions? The old time-travel movies make it much simpler: if you see yourself in the future, that screws things up. If old you kills young you, that means you're dead, too. This movie mashes all of that together and strips out the boring parts. That makes for a really intelligent sci-fi thriller. Tough to find.Twists abound. I can't even begin to describe one without giving away another. Heck, Young Joe's not even a really sympathetic character. I mean, he's a nice guy, but the man sells out his friend within the first ten minutes of the movie, so he's not super awesome. Plus did I mention he's a cold-blooded killer? He is. And he is constantly faced with the consequences, ever unreeling, of not only his actions but those of Old Joe and countless other characters. Turns upon turns, a Moebius strip of plot lines.What's really at the center of the movie, the most terrifying aspect, isn't even touched on until the movie's mostly over. You think the blunderbuss that Young Joe has or the Glock that Old Joe procures are bad-ass weapons? There's another one much worse. I'm talking Stephen King worse. Oh yes.Both Gordon-Levitt and Willis (who do resemble each other here) give commanding, top-notch performances. Earnest without being dull; determined without being infallible. Unheroic, except sometimes. They're strongly supported by Jeff Daniels as Gordon-Levitt's boss, Paul Dano as Young Joe's best friend, and Emily Blunt as the mother of a small, strange child.Looper is an awe-inspiring movie, the one that continues to resonate well after the curtain's fallen. What does it mean? Well, it's easier to pinpoint the meaning here than in movies like The Tree of Life and other New-Age nonsense, but it's the kind of movie that wisely leaves questions unanswered. And the last scene is a powerful, poignant, delicious ending. It ain't the best movie in the world (there are some unanswered questions that really should have been answered), but it's damn good among its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good sci-fi film  loses grip towards the end,"""Looper"" is one of the many films to include time travel in its premise, but it adds a very unique twist that is worth a recommendation. The film is set in the future where time travel has been invented but quickly outlawed. The mob uses this a way to completely kill off anyone they want to by using loopers: hit-man in the past who wait for a target to pop up out of thin air and then kill them. The time travel material is very well thought up. They have just about all of the questions covered. Plus it is also nice to see a movie set in the not so distant future that doesn't depict that everyone will be driving flying cars or have robots all over the place. The main story is about what would happen if the person you had to kill was your future self. It is a very neat concept, and for most of the movie it works.Great idea, great acting, and the over all plot was pretty darn good, but I just can't give this movie my full blessing of being great. I guess it just leaves you wanting more closure at the end of the movie. Grant it, not all movies need to end with everything resolved or explained, but I really think they could have done a little better with this one due to how well the rest of the movie was put together. Bruce Willis, although not the main star in this film, really does a great job staying true to what he does best, delivering in the action side of the movie. He was a great casting for this movie, which possible could have something to do with the fact this is not his first movie traveling back in time to meet his former self (The Kid, 2000). . ""Looper"" has to be celebrated for its originality. But towards the later half of the film, it starts to slow down almost too much. The always beautiful Emily Blunt does well with her role, but there's only so much she can do. I have to say that I was quite surprised how the film ended up being. The ending will certainly raise questions with just how good the movie was, which is sad because there really are a lot of great things about it. Being a Bruce Willis fan, it was nice to see him in the macho action hero role, but I felt like there wasn't enough of it. Joseph Gordan-Levitt, who's been a rising star as of late, really gives another great performance in his first big leading role. The film makers really did a great job making him look like Bruce Willis, which really helped make everything flow well. With an open and mind and not to big of expectations I would absolutely recommend seeing this film, but if you don't catch it in the theaters your not missing too much.Check out more of our reviews at www.clutchandmikemovies.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Loops you into the movie!,"I saw Looper after much waiting and pondering, along with an eagerness to enjoy the Willis-Levitt combination. Before watching Looper, I was fresh from watching a series of Joseph Gordon-Levitt movies (Inception, Havoc, 500 Days of Summer, The Dark Knight Returns) and was excitedly looking forward to see him in a different avatar. Also the prospects of Bruce Willis playing the older JGL along with the concept of Time Travel were the other aspects that kindled me to watch this movie as soon as possible.Set in 2044, Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a 'looper', a paid hit man, addicted to drugs, working for a criminal organization from the future (2074) that sends people to him to be exterminated. Joe happily does his job, and collects his reward when suddenly he sees himself from the future (Willis) sent to him. Joe fails, and that leads to a series of cataclysmic events, a lot of new and important characters being introduced, along with some unexpected twists, followed by a tense and exciting climax which is bound to leave audiences with their jaws dropped.The performances are astounding and top notch. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has performed exceedingly well as always and looks like 'The Next Big Thing' in Hollywood. He continues to amaze me movie after movie and is slowly climbing upwards in the list of my favorites. Willis gives another power-packed action-filled performance and you would get to see the typical 'Willis-esque' action scenes here. Emily Blunt has a pivotal role and justifies it well. Little Pierce Gagnon does well too as Cid, a major character in the movie. Honesty and hard work is seen in Rian Johnson's direction, and that combined with amazing cinematography makes this movie incredible. The story is quite interesting too. The camera work is impressive, capturing some trippy moments in the movie quite well.Overall, an exciting and fast-paced movie with an amazing concept, coupled with good performances make this movie a must watch. I give this 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"My god, what is wrong with you people? Mediocre","How many relatives does Bruce Willis have out there? Or if that isn't it, what is the explanation for the popularity of this noisy waste of effort?

And I noticed the cheap effect another reviewer mentioned of cranking up the volume when someone knocks on a door or makes any other sudden sound. A shabby aural technique in a futile attempt to inject excitement and cover the lack of real drama.There is no tension in this movie, though the kung fu speed editing helps disguise the fact for half an hour into the film.

Looper Is Worth The Watch,"(WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS)So this past weekend I watched Looper, a movie that I can say kept me entertained the entire way through. What I thought was the most enjoyable part of the movie was the fact the movie has established its own universe. When I originally saw trailers for this movie I assumed it was happening in 2012, when in fact it takes place in 2044. This allowed them to go past the the ""norm"" and do whatever they wanted. The movie was beautifully shot and the cast was fantastic. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in my opinion were amazing on screen together. The main problems I had with this movies came from some of the logic of time travel. I felt that there were some plot wholes that occurred within the time traveling parts and logic of the movie. However seeing as how most movie involving time travel tend to get plot hole filled and confusing it is best just to leave it alone and not worry about it. (SPOILER AHEAD) Only other bothering part was how Emily Blunt's character decided to out of no where make love to Joseph Gordon Levitt's character. It felt forced and unnecessary.

Strange,"I am a huge fan of time travel in fiction and this movie nails down the critical plot points that form a narrative with great cleanliness. The film has a lot of great characters and develops them fairly well. The characters are carefully well cast for example the lead child, Bruce Willis and Joseph Grodon Levitt. I kinda Personally wanted more from Paul Dano's character, he felt very under utilized. Everything comes together quite nicely in this film but for some reason the filmmakers didn't do too much to keep the audience consistantly entertained. I found the story to have decent pace but it never really reached an awing moment. there is some good visual storytelling but wish it was a bit more exciting. None of the music stood out in anyway. Other than these flaws, the movie is solid enough. It didn't suit me as well as I'd expect but I'd recommend trying it on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
One of the Better Time Travel Movies,"Looper is one of the better time travel movies I've seen. I put Back to the Future at the top of that list and maybe Butterfly Effect then 12 Monkeys. Now, there are other movies with time travel in them although it's not the main focus. X-Men: Days of Future Past, Terminator and T2, for instance, are about time travel in a general sense but the movies aren't built upon the premise of time travel.In the movie Looper time travel is illegal. The mob uses it to do hits. Send the guy back in time to a designated spot, have a guy kill him and dispose of the body. Very clean and no traces. The hit men, or loopers as they're called, get paid handsomely in silver for their hits. If they have to kill their future self, they get paid in gold and live out the rest of their days (up to the point they're sent back) how they like. That is called closing the loop.I mention that part to bring forth the point that all time travel movies have inherent flaws that can't be avoided and this is no different. Even though the concept of time travel is an interesting one and has been toyed with for ages it opens up conundrums. You will quickly see the conundrum that is created in this movie when the older Joe (Bruce Willis) attempts to change the past. But even with that there is enough going on to get lost into without dwelling on the paradoxes of time travel.The movie has some nice action and a terrific overall story. I like the casting because they really pulled this movie off. The characters are good enough to draw you in and make you concerned with the outcome. And you know that anything with Bruce Willis will involve a lot of shooting and high body counts. This movie is no different there but you may just like it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Weird yet original,"The Short: A twisting science fiction thriller with brains, brawn, and originality that doesn't disappoint in the slightest.Looper. Where to begin? Rian Johnson has directed an incredibly quality science fiction film that is truly original. It starkly goes against the grain, focusing on strong characters and an unique premise to drive forward one of the more intense and perplexing sic-fi action films since 2009's incredible genre bender District 9.The first great element of Looper are the characters. Both main characters, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, are complex character studies and are anything but the cut and dry sci-fi heroes (or anti-heroes) we have seen lately from other films (such as the recent Dredd). The true surprise here is kid actor Pierce Gagnon, who no doubt has a bright and versatile acting career ahead of him. Emily Blunt plays a great character as well, both strong willed and independent. The chemistry of all these actors is very strong on screen, and it truly makes for one completely unexpected but incredibly well presented casts that is serious, funny, intriguing, and scary all at the same time.The true, and albeit unexpected, success is the incredible plot. It is told with finesse, executed and told in a manner that is both complex but comprehendible - it puts the latest box-office success films to shame. The time traveling premise is and old story telling feature, but Looper uses the time travel premise very differently and to a great effect - it's both perplexing and entertaining to see where the movie is going to go next. It is no doubt complex, but the way the story is told and presented is ingenious and leaves no one behind.And with all the amazing premise and creativity of Looper, it would be easy to simply let all of the artistic value be a side thought. But Looper goes against the grain even in this area. While being tremendously entertaining, Looper is never short of being artistic - it is directed with attention paid in all departments.With all of the brilliance this film offers, it must stumble somewhere, right? Aside from a mildly cheesy part and a minimalist backdrop (both subjective opinions), Looper is darn near perfect. The only nagging flaw that Looper has is some decidedly understated scenes that, in comparison to the rest of the film, feel low budget. But in context of the plot the cheesiness is explained thoroughly and makes sense, and the intended display of a darker, but much more approachable and realistic future (and a scary one) for a wider range of audiences, Looper delivers.And everything else in-between is just as good. The action is strikingly violent and explosive, but none the less realistic and important to the main character of Joe and his metamorphosis throughout Looper. There is one rather strong scene of innuendo, but again it's used artistically - it's a huge character turning point for Joe and a massive stray away from his current life - one that he so desperately is conflicted to live.In the end, Looper is a redemption story. One of sacrifice, death, life, and choice. It's anything but the cut and dry we have come to know and accept in film lately, and Looper is a refreshing science fiction action that has smarts and character to boot. The only nagging flaw are just a handful of low budget scenes that needed more umph.Despite that single gripe, Looper is without a doubt the best science fiction film since District 9 and most likely the best time traveling movie ever made.Strong Recommendation - 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Good,"Looper got surprisingly excellent reviews, with raves coming out every so often. I finally saw it, and as it stands it's just merely good. It has some really nice directing, and some awesome scenes, but in no way would I consider it a great film. I thought Emily Blunt was easily the MVP and stole a lot of scenes. Levitt's nose was distracting unlike Kidman's in The Hours. Willis was playing, well, Willis like always. I can see why it would get the reviews it did, for being a sort of mainstream sci-fi film like Source Code was when it came out. I just wish it had done a little bit more, and I wish it expanded the character development as well, but it's still recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Generational War Comes to a Head in Smart and Surprising Sci-fi/Noir,"Has the future started yet? I was wondering that yesterday, when I pulled out my iPhone (4 not 5, i'm not that hip), and watched as a tiny blue orb representing me moved from a bus stop to a theatre, where I'd see a movie with a ticket I had purchased out of thin air with my phone. All of this, accomplished with the touch of my finger. Sure, it's not teleporters and laser guns, but the gap between our present, and the expectations older generations had for it, is rapidly closing.Which is probably why science fiction keeps coming back to the few ideas that have always seemed beyond our reach, like time travel. For as insane, probably impossible, as its existence might be, we've gone out of our way to make sure that whoever finds it first can just watch a movie or read a book to figure out which rules were right. It might be as simple as Back to the Future, or as paralyzingly complex as Primer. What makes Rian Johnson's take on the concept, Looper, so fascinating, is that it's interested in the motives behind time travel, not the mechanics.As futuristic assassin Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lay's out matter-of-factly, time travel is a part of life 30 years from now, even if it won't be invented for another 60. Crime lords of the year 2074 maintain a monopoly on the technology, using it to extradite troublemakers from their time to 2044, to be eliminated by low-level triggermen called loopers. A high-ranking transplant from the future, Abe (Jeff Daniels), organizes the hits, and was responsible for setting an orphaned Joe on a path: be at the right place, at the right time, dispose of the anonymous person who appears there, and be rewarded with money, respect, and any number of immediate pleasures.The opening act is like a good piece of pulpy short fiction, showing us what would happen if the noir-influenced world of Johnson's first film, Brick, were left to rust. It's all blown-out windows and busted rain gutters, where the sign outside the local looper gin joint, La Belle Aurore, is written in font you'd find on the cover of any James Ellroy novel. It's a world going to hell slowly enough to not cause a panic, just a creeping sense of dread, but the drapes change every few years so that no one notices that the building is burning down.""Loopers aren't the most forward thinking bunch,"" Joe says of his colleagues, which is as true for him as everyone else (tellingly, the looper weapon of choice, retro blunderbusses, only have a range of 15 feet). As part of his contract, he'll eventually have to kill his future self, sent back in time to the present in order to wipe out any evidence they ever existed. Failing to ""close the loop"" has fatal consequences for both vintages of the Looper, as evidenced by a gut-churning sequence where an older looper on the lam dissolves, bit by bit, as his former self is slowly butchered. Despite his greater awareness of what the world has become, and where it is heading, Joe just uses this knowledge to rationalize his own series of bad, self- interested decisions. If the party's almost over, might as well get yours before the music stops.When Joe screws up the hit on his future self (Bruce Willis), they both become the target, the difference being that Older Joe comes with a mission: find those responsible for sending him back from 2074, and kill them in the past. And just when you think Looper is going to reach for the throttle, Johnson reins it in, and starts to pull the rug out from under you. There are still a number of gritty and violent shootouts ahead, and plenty more time-bending logistics, but instead of turning up to full boil, Looper settles into a slow burn, and his stylish action flick transforms into a sci-fi-infused character study.That two key pieces of the ensemble -a steely farm owner (Emily Blunt) and her gifted son (Pierce Gagnon)- aren't introduced until the midpoint shows the deliberate measures Johnson takes to invest us in a story of a man about as literally at war with himself as possible. Willis, as the world-weary Old Joe, at first seems like the embodiment of all the signposts from the future that young Joe has been ignoring, a living warning of what a life of nihilistic complacency can lead to. Yet Johnson constructs his characters with deep histories- not just backstories, but lifetimes of hard choices and tragedy, made apparent through a line of dialogue or just a look. What becomes clear is that the events of the past aren't what's obdurate, it's the people.With nods to Akira, Twelve Monkeys and even a bit of Superman, Johnson's eclectic tastes are fuelled by just the right amount of the quirk that could overpower many moments of his last film, The Brothers Bloom. And the look recalls another think piece, Tree of Life, only one that backs up the dreamy visuals with some lucid thinking. Well, too a point. The technicals of time travel are mostly elided by Old Joe giving a hand-waving explanation that the exact details are ""cloudy.""This will irk purists and create as much discussion about the story's mechanics as its themes, but it's so, so much more about the latter than the former. When the powerful finale arrives, and three generations of people are forced to make choices about what they want the future to be, it feels relevant, and urgent. If that's not the hallmark of great science fiction, then what is?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Original, exciting, and with a very neat ending, Looper blends Johnson's artistic craft with a tense sci-fi thriller","Looper feels like Rian Johnson's magic trick: if you go hunting for them, you can definitely find flaws, but as you watch it you see exactly the brilliant vision Johnson had for the movie. The premise is phenomenal, blending future dystopia, crime thrills, and time travel in a neat and specific setting. Rather than making time travel ubiquitous or limiting it to just one person, we see how it applies to this specific risky group of crime employees. The vision of the future is very well done but also is presented naturally and not overemphasized. There's some really cool technology, like the nanotech making it hard to kill people, and the cool digital devices and telepathy, but also desolation and poverty. The movie really thrives as we get deeper into the premise, seeing how the life of a looper works and watching the plot of the crime organization unfold. Many moral questions are raised about self-preservation or sacrifice, as well as philosophical implications of time travel and these loops. The performances are great, but the characters feel more like representations of random pawns in this complex game than fully fleshed out humans. The ending is great and brings everything back together - the implications of the loop are clear, the decision of self-sacrifice for the hope that someone can be happy and break a cycle, and the ties that bind people are all laid bare in the climax. This is definitely one that will require deeper thought and could move in its rating, as I absolutely love the premise and direction of the movie, but also see that there may be some flaws in the characters and plot. I'm prone to strongly appreciating a bold, original high concept sci-fi project with great direction, but am not sure if that storytelling and intelligent development of the premise is all there needs to be. Certainly recommend it, and am absolutely stoked for Knives Out later this week.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very unique. Great film.,"I just want it to be known that I created an IMDb account specifically to rate this film. I just got home from the theater where I watched Looper & I must say that it was just as amazing as I thought it was gonna be. It was very unique & it has some very shocking moments. I have never seen a film quite like this. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job portraying the films main character, Joe. (Let me just add that Gordon-Levitt is a very attractive man, even in this movie, where he is barely recognizable.) Although, I will admit that Bruce Willis' acting was a little shotty. (Give him a break, he's getting old.) Over all the movie was outstanding & worth the 10 bucks a ticket & the 7 bucks for a small popcorn.

Good film but some problems prevent it being a classic (some spoilers),"First of all I want to make it clear that in my opinion this is a good film and people should see it. However I don't think it is a 5/5 star film ""the new Matrix"" or whatever, there is too much hyperbole surrounding it.I simply don't think the film is as good as Brick, the previous Johnson/Gordon-Levitt film, and not as good in terms of delivery as Twelve Monkeys.So the positives are great acting, a good premise, a good opening act, some great shots and the future city/society looks pretty convincing ('vagabonds' everywhere, social decline, rampant crime and violence, a drug fueled elite partying it up in strip clubs whilst millions go hungry outside... hey, this maybe is the present?!). Willis is good in the role, and there are some great one liners peppered throughout the film.And I also don't think the time travel premise is the problem. Too many reviewers on IMDb are complaining about the time paradoxes and the plot holes - hold on everyone, it is a time travel movie, they will always have some level of paradox in them because time travel is always paradoxical. Anyone who thinks you can make a 'perfect' time travel movie has yet to show how it can be practically done, since every instance of time travel creates an alternative world anyway. Only the Canadian TV show Continuum really deals with this issue by leaving the question about whether the time travel has already happened ambiguous (i.e. has the future world already been created by the act of traveling back in time, in which case the show can become utterly deterministic since it has 'already happened'). Anyway I digress, don't get too bothered about time travel based plat holes, what stops the movie being a classic is a question of how it was delivered, not its sci fi credentials.For me the movie was not engaging enough for its length. It dragged from the middle onwards because it relocated the action from the gritty, grim dystopian city to a farmhouse which looked like it could have been in a movie from the 1950s. Johnson should have stuck with the tone and pacing of the first half more closely, because then the movie spins off into another film about a boy with powerful psychic abilities and a moral dilemma about whether he will grow up to become the supreme baddie or not. Willis thinks so, Gordon-Levitt believes that we can make our own fate and the child can grow up to be good, but this moral story line is grafted onto the previous one about fighting your future self. That for me was the core of the film, the second act pretty much neglects it in favour of some farmyard based children of the corn/village of the damned action.And the problem was tone, we went from city to countryside, different mood, colours and pacing and it slowed everything down. Willis' quest to kill the boy before he becomes some major baddie was a bad idea, it was a story too far and it meant that it included a load of stuff about telekinesis which is crucial to the plot but was not integrated into the story in any meaningful way. Then it becomes a story about time travel and telekinesis but without exploring one or the other that well.My contribution to how to make the film better would have focused on the time travel aspects a bit more. The most gruesome bit in the film is when they track down another escaped target from the future by carving up his younger self, as they do so the future guys body starts to disappear, his fingers, nose, legs and so on. That was gripping body horror stuff which could have been done effectively at the end. Imagine Willis and Gordon-Levitt squaring off against each other, totally outmatched (like Dekkard and the Replicant at the end of Blade Runner) and the younger version has to break his own fingers or shoot his hand off to stop Willis from killing him - it could have taken place in a disused warehouse or similar dystopian trope. Been done before? Maybe, but the tension between the younger and older version and the cat and mouse game between them could have made a much more impressive story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"This is the first time I am rating a movie with 1 star.I went to see this movie without any special expectations and was extremely disappointed. I wouldn't say much if the movie had several simple (and expected) logical bug that are common in this kind of movie, ... this movie however is way way below acceptable.An extremely stupid story, not even remotely plausible, with extremely unnecessary stupid decisions made by the characters, weird movie moments and of course many many logical faults.This is an insult to our intelligence, I do hope no films like this will be made again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliantly entertaining and original,"Rian Johnson's Looper is one of the most stylish, smart and entertaining sci-fi films of recent memory. An interesting dynamic between Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon- Levitt also work in part to make the film darkly comic at times, while never forgetting the rather serious tone and high stakes.The cinematography is simply spectacular. Long one-take shots right in the action add gripping layers of tension, as well as look pretty damn good. Technically, the film is razor-sharp, with excellent use of colours, brilliant camera work and a realistically gritty dystopian setting, giving the film a Children of Men kind of feel. The action is electrifying and spaced perfectly, giving time to develop story and characters between explosive spurts of endlessly satisfying action.The story is very original and thought-provoking, but also provides my only issue with the film. The inclusion of telekinesis just felt like a gimmick to explain the film's rather quick ending. Looper's plot hinges on a cheap and unexplained gimmick that makes the film's otherwise heartfelt ending feel rushed and somewhat fixed.Overall, Looper is one of the most electrifying, entertaining and clever sci-fi films of the 2010s. The story was well written and easy to follow, despite the prominence of time travel. The result is a truly impressive and riveting experience, even if the ending is, sadly, about as satisfying as Levitt's make-up job",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Enjoyable Action/Sci-Fi Popcorn Flick!,"I had high hopes for looper. Two great leads and from the trailer, a pretty cool (sort of) original plot to work with.I walked out feeling reasonably satisfied with the movie. Were there plot holes? You bet. Time paradoxes?

I liked the brutality in which younger Joe and the other loopers just did their job. I liked the plot involving the Rainmaker and even though it's predictable, it's still enjoyable.I saw this with my brother and he didn't enjoy it so much. He kept on nit picking the paradoxes, how the plot generally did not make sense and how he believed each actor ""phoned in"" their performance. Personally I though they all did an OK job to help the plot move along.I don't know.. I can't explain why I still enjoyed it. Maybe it was because the last movie I saw was the Expendables 2, and this was like the Shawshank Redemption in comparison.

Time-Twisted Yet Familiar,"Rian Johnson's Looper stands out for its intriguing concept and solid performances, particularly from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis. The film's premise, which revolves around time travel and the moral dilemmas it introduces, is engaging and adds a unique twist to the sci-fi genre. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of the younger version of Willis' character is impressive, and the dynamic between the two actors provides much of the film's emotional depth.The enjoyment factor in Looper is undeniable. The film successfully balances action with thought-provoking themes, creating a tension-filled narrative that keeps viewers invested. The futuristic setting and the ethical quandaries of time travel make for a compelling watch, and there are several standout sequences that effectively blend suspense and drama.However, Looper isn't without its flaws. One of the more notable issues is the de-aging of Gordon-Levitt to resemble Willis, which can be jarring and occasionally pulls viewers out of the experience. While the film attempts to address this through makeup and digital effects, it doesn't always achieve the seamless integration hoped for.Additionally, while the concept is fresh, the execution can feel a bit conventional and predictable at times. The plot follows some familiar sci-fi tropes and the twists, though well-placed, might not come as a complete surprise. The narrative doesn't quite break new ground in terms of originality, and at times, it feels like it's adhering to established genre norms rather than pushing the envelope.Overall, Looper is a solid film that offers a blend of exciting action and thought-provoking sci-fi elements. The performances and concept are strong, and it's an enjoyable watch for fans of the genre. However, its predictability and some technical hiccups slightly detract from what could have been a more groundbreaking experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Movie Told In A Snail-Paced Way!,"So, the actors have acted well. Joesph over-acted, no doubt. Emily Blunt is sexy as she was in TDWP. Bruce is hands down, awesome!

An in-depth review of Looper,"Looper is the latest work of Rian Johnson. It's always good when the director writes the film as he has a much better idea of how he would want it to be portrayed. Looper is a brilliant piece of film and Johnson really pulled it out of the bag. The idea of the story is very simple but when you begin to put in all the complications we see in the film, it's a different story all together. Let me also say this, the plot and 'idea' of this film e.g. Time Travel sounds quite cheesy, but this film is anything but cheesy. It's fast paced, action-packed and NOT FOR CHILDREN – this film is extremely violent and gory and has content that could disturb and upset children including drug use, alcohol, sexual references and at points, extreme amounts of blood.The basic idea to the film is this: In 2042, time travel hasn't been invented, but 30 years in the future it will have been. So when somebody needs killing in the future, the mob zap them back 30 years for someone, like Joseph Simmonds, to kill. Strapped to the back of the victim are solid gold or silver bars which are the looper's payment for killing the person and disposing of the body. This film would be pretty cut and dry if it stuck to this but obviously, it's not going to.To check out the full article go to: http://www.teknue.com/reviews/film- review-looper-2012/999",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A fine addition to the sci-fi genre,"What would you do if an older version of yourself appeared from the future one day and told you to follow his orders?! Well that's one scenario posed in Looper, a wonderful science fiction film about time- travel and gangsters, starring Bruce Willis, who clearly did not get enough of travelling through time in 12 Monkeys. Trying to summarise the plot into mere words is actually quite a challenge, but here goes:Our main character Joseph Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper, that is, somebody who kills people sent to him from the future by a gang, and disposes of the body in his present time, meaning they cannot be traced, as technically, they have not been born yet (kind of like the story in Terminator) . One thing leads to another and soon Joseph finds himself being told to execute himself, i.e an older version of himself from the future (Willis). Willis tries to convince his younger self to follow destiny and do what he says, but will his younger self listen or end up killing his older self? Confusion pretty much sums it up. Add in a few gangsters and mass gun fights, and you end up with a pretty good film.Nevertheless, the film actually presents the time quantum physics plot in a clear manner, and after seeing some intelligent/absurd ideas being depicted (cut a message on yourself, and your older version will see the message on their subsequent body!), the film is ultimately about destiny and regret, would you change your own destiny if you had the chance? Would you kill somebody to make your own future better? A pretty deep film that slightly lost it's way in the second half of the film, when the action switches to a massive farm (featuring Emily Blunt) and loses its pace, but does actually feature the greatest acting performance by a 10 year old I have ever seen.

Wow,"Truly excellent.I'm sure there are plot holes and I'm sure there are weaknesses but it is rare that a film like this comes along.Pretty much anything with Joseph Gordon-Levitt is going to be great (see; ""Hesher"" 2010) and I love Bruce Willis so I was really excited about this film.It has everything; action, story, love-stuff, scary bad-ass kid, great acting, shocks, guns, witty dialogue...I can't even be bothered trying to remember any critiques. I usually put a few in for authenticity but too many fantastic scenes keep coming back to me.The violence was sometimes a bit shocking right from the opening scene but it wasn't gratuitous. If you shot someone in real life, I'm sure the person wouldn't daintily fall to the ground with glitter pouring out of the bullet hole so no complaints from me there.There were times when the script became more serious then slapstick then comedic then violent and this occasionally jarred a bit but I decided I ultimately liked this because some films get stale part way through because it's the same thing over and over but with ""Looper"", I never got bored and each scene offered something different. Sometimes we have funny moments in life and sometimes we get serious so this is more true to real life than films that stay deadly serious all the way through to attain the ""serious film"" tag.I don't often give films 10/10 (think I've done it once, not sure) but this deserves it.

Right way to do time travel,"Rian Johnson May not have been the best possibly choice for Star Wars, but when it comes to indie movies, he's always been successful.Looper is a well made movie with lots of homage to other amazing time travel films.

"Second-hand action scenes prevent it from being a masterpiece, but Rian Johnson's film is appreciatively clever and packed with intricate details.","The biggest strike counting against ""Looper"" is that its director, Rian Johnson, is not yet much of an action specialist. And although this new movie has been raved up and appraised for its admittedly clever and intricate ideas involving time travel, the bits and pieces consisting of shootouts, brutal beatings, and a little boy whose temper tantrums result in telepathic explosions are a big part of what Mr. Johnson hopes to accomplish. Now the action scenes are not horrible, but they are not particularly exciting either. Mr. Johnson stages his misc en scene in awkward places, instructs his actors to move too slowly, and the camera is frequently searching for carnage it cannot find—usually because the low-key lighting is too heavy for it to see anything. There is even a scene where a truck gets flipped forward and we just barely see part of the vehicle in a subsequent wide-shot before it disappears off the edge of the screen. Maybe it was staged to come out like that, but I think the filmmakers just got lucky.So that's the regrettable news: ""Looper"" is not the masterpiece I hoped it to be. The good news, however, is that its story is appreciatively clever and very detailed. Mr. Johnson, who composed the original screenplay, has devised a setup that Christopher Nolan would probably appreciate. Time travel does not merely exist in his world; it has elaborately detailed limits and restrictions. The story gets off on the right foot with its protagonist (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, an actor I never get tired of seeing) telling us how it all works. Because he exists in the present and the people he's hired to murder and teleported to him from the future, we cannot see the actual time travel process, but he's been informed of how it works and he shares his knowledge with us. Going back to Christopher Nolan, ""Looper"" reminded me of ""Inception"" and how in that movie, Leonardo DiCaprio filled in the blanks. This is appropriate, since ""Looper"" wants to be a little edgier than just a simplistic, corny action exploitation picture.Save for a completely unneeded flash-forward sequence (in which we see how Mr. Gordon-Leavitt grows up to be a weary-looking Bruce Willis), the movie is subtle and restrained in detailing the future. It stays in the present, and when a man-to-be-murdered is transported into the present, there is no ostentatious, glowing special effects. No bright flashes, no streaks of computer-generated lights. Just a cleverly utilized jump cut accompanied with a subtle whooshing sound effect.Some people are destined to be angered, and some have, by the portrayal of a child in this picture. In short, the little boy featured in this movie is blessed with a gift. He's like John Connor from James Cameron's ""Terminator"" movies, except he is destined for bad things instead of saving the world. In regards to the young actor's performance, I was not all that taken with Pierce Gagnon's dialogue delivery, but was utterly stunned by his stunning use of expressions. When this kid puts on a frown, he looks genuinely scary. Even if he did not have mind powers strong enough to detonate a house or rip a man to shreds, you would not want to be caught near him. The only fault to come out of this is that it begins to contradict what Rian Johnson's screenplay would like us to resonate with. Without giving away too much of the plot's third act, the movie tries to make a point that a person's companionship during childhood—the people he or she grows up under—will determine his future. All fine, except this kid is portrayed as so temperament prone and so psychologically unstable that I found it hard to believe that anybody, even a teary-eyed Emily Blunt, could ever reshape his future.All of the performances are generally good. Mr. Gordon-Leavitt, playing Bruce Willis's younger self, is exceptionally effective. The make-up applied to heighten his resemblance to Mr. Willis is a good starting point, but he also mimics the expressions and idiosyncratic tendencies: the drawl in the voice, the lifting of the eyebrows while maintain a squint, and so on. Mr. Willis is his usual self, and it is nice to see him tackling the role of a morally weaker man afraid not for his life, but somebody else's. Emily Blunt, no stranger to praise from me, is also strong in her role.Had ""Looper"" made some tweaks to its third act and Mr. Johnson had recruited some expertise to assist him in coordinating the action scenes, it probably would have reached the heights of excellence it has strived for. But as it is, it is a perfectly fine movie worth seeing and I did enjoy it more on the second viewing. Rian Johnson does have a lot of imagination and cleverness and to complain that his nice, perfectly good movie is not a masterpiece—considering this is still very early in his career—does seem a little silly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Rian Johnson...I love you,"Rian Johnson...he's extremely talented, and he definitely proves it with Looper, a mixture of sci-fi/1970s brutality.

But what makes this film profound is the story you think you know (based on the trailers). Let me tell you now, this film is not about a looper trying to kill his future self.

"All over the place, but a more than entertaining sci-fi film","Fast paced, incredibly entertaining, but at times contrived, Looper doesn't make the greatest execution of its interesting concept, but does enough to make it a more than enjoyable film. All the actors in the film both feel and look brilliantly casted, with Bruce Willis surprisingly taking the cake for the best of them. Joseph Gordon Levitt also provides a rather good performance as well as Emily Blunt. The film's script does at times seem to go all over the place, and though the film tonally feels the same, by the time you're over with the film, you can't help but wonder how you got there from where you started. The film is actually quite visually impressive for a futuristic sci-fi film, with its remarkably small budget, it makes use of it quite well. The film itself is very fascinating, knowing almost expertly how and when to slow down, and how to tell the messy story it knows it may be proceeding with. In the end, Looper has its fair share of flaws, but it provides for an interesting take on time travel that we haven't seen before- even if it doesn't execute them as much as you may hope. It's performances are great, and it is ferociously entertaining, and will certainly be a memorable experience to all who have a chance to watch it.

Dazzling,"There's a fundamental problem with time-travel that many have fallen victim to - too much physics and you leave the audience cold and befuddled; too many action sequences and emotion goes out the window. The real trick of making a truly great time-travel movie is finding the perfect balance between the two and in my opinion only two films have struck this difficult chord - Back to the Future and Twelve Monkeys (which also starred Bruce Willis). Well, now you can add Looper to that.Set in Kansas, in 2044, the story centres on Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - he's an assassin or 'looper' who's hired by a criminal organisation to kill targets sent back from a future where time-travel has been outlawed. However, during one particular contract, Joe is shocked to see that his latest target is his older self...One of the most brilliant things about Looper is its awareness of the headaches that too many paradoxes can induce. In a wonderful moment of dialogue, writer/director Rian Johnson basically tells the audience not to worry about the inner machinations of the genre's logic, ""This time- travel crap fries your brain like an egg"", says Jeff Daniels' Mafia man Abe. But importantly, the place of the heart is not forgotten and the film succeeds on an emotional level just as well as it does on a technical one; which is quite a feat when your main character is cold-hearted and selfish killer.And speaking of Mr. Gordon-Levitt, he delivers his best performance yet, portraying Joe with maturity, depth and nuance. And no, the make- up was not distracting. Best of all, he does not imitate Bruce Willis, but instead plays the kind of young man who would grow up to be the Bruce Willis we all know. Willis gives his best piece of acting in years, trading the action hero smirk for touches of melancholia that pay off dividends. All this is exemplified in a diner- set scene between the two Joes which shows just how good these two actors really are.Emily Blunt does a completely convincing job as being more than just 'the female character'. Solid support also comes from the reliable Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano, while Noah Segsn is impressive and attention-grabbing as Kid Blue.The film is also Johnson's best. After seeing (and loving) the John Hughes meets Raymond Chandler-isms of Brick and the mishandled The Brothers Bloom (Gordon-Levitt and Segan were in both), I was interested to see where he'd go next, and frankly, he has outdone himself with Looper. No better is this seen than in a bravura montage which shows how JGL becomes Bruce Willis; it's poignant, violent, dazzling and tender.While there are flaws - some plot holes and a predictable final twist - as an overall piece, the film's positives massively outweigh its negatives, as far and few between they may be. It's easily one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Novel sci-fi action flick; not perfect, but very gripping","In the far future, time travel is invented, but outlawed, and used only by criminal elements of society. However, in the far future, the underworld has a difficult time getting rid of bodies, which are tracked efficiently by the Government. So they come up with a creative way of disposing bodies. They send an operative, Abe, back in time (by a few decades) to monitor a group of hit men called loopers. Loopers are contractually obliged to receive masked victims from the future; they lie in wait at a predetermined hour, rifles cocked and ready to shoot. In front of them, the victim suddenly appears; the looper then shoots him down, wrap up the body and cremate him, leaving no trace.The loopers are monitored actively by the 'Gat Men', who work under Abe to ensure that the Loopers stick to their contract. The loopers are paid princely sums, but accept an expiration date for their services in a unique way; one day, in the far future, his own self would be blindfolded and sent back in time to be executed. The looper is supposed to kill his older self, an act they call 'closing the loop'. (How that closes the loop is beyond me.) Once they execute themselves, they are retired from service with a heavy gold retirement package.The protagonist is Joe Simmons, who has been a looper for a long time. He faces his own future self, but is overpowered. Joe begins a hunt for his older self.Fast paced, novel, and gripping, Looper is a strong entertainer. I've always enjoyed Gordon Levitt's performances, and Bruce Willis, playing Gordon's older self, gives a strong performance himself. The story is well drafted, the action sequences are well done, and the story for the Rainman character is masterfully molded in the background.However, while I enjoyed the movie, it has its own flaws. My friends raved about the movie and heralded it as groundbreaking. I don't think I would go that far. The time travel rules established in the movie are clumsy at best. The truly great time travel movies generally stick to their own rules and make sense in some manner. Here, it seems to have superficial thought at best. The future self is affected by the actions done on the current person. In one sequence, the older self is trying to flee, but the Gat men are actively torturing the current self as this happens. They wound the person, and the older self gets a corresponding scar; they cut off limbs and the future self physically changes accordingly. This was a wonderfully horrific sequence, and built on to a gripping tension, but it just doesn't make sense. If such drastic changes are made, then the entire future life has to be affected... in this case, the implication is that the guy's future doesn't change at all even through something drastic as amputation.But if you can stop your thoughts from frowning at the logical inconsistencies, the Looper is a strong entertainer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Intriguing and enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously,"Writer/director Rian Johnson's third feature (""Brick,"" ""The Brothers Bloom"") is another mashup, of sorts, in a season full of genre hybrids. On the face of it, ""Looper"" brands itself as a time travel tale smack dab in the classic science fiction tradition of films like ""The Butterfly Effect"" (in which Ashton Kutcher goes back to the past to change the present), ""The Jacket"" (in which Adrien Brody goes into the future to change the present), and ""Donnie Darko"" (in which Jake Gyllenhaal, well, we're never quite sure where he goes or why, but he looks good doing it). Of course, there's the iconic (and quite dark for its era) ""The Time Machine"" and the (much lighter) ""Back to the Future"" franchise, both of which send the protagonists forward or backward in time to escape an unexciting and, possibly, dangerous present.""Looper's"" premise (laid out in the opening narration) is that time travel has been, or will be, invented at some point in the future. Bad guys can, thus, be sent back in time to be exterminated in the present, thereby eliminating them before they can get to be the bad guys they are to become. ""Loopers"" are the assassins in the present (well, 2044) who've been given the lucrative assignment of preemptively eliminating these to-be-bad guys (from 2074, follow?). As it always has been, and always will be, ethics are trumped by dollars. It's a tough job but somebody has to do it. As the movie opens, we see ""Joe"" (the always-dependable Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as the somebody in the process of carrying out this mission as future felons pop into view, only to be blown away seconds later in the middle of a cornfield. A Field of Nightmares, as it were. But Bruce Willis appears and, as he is wont to do, throws a major monkey wrench into the production and the story barrels off from there.Rian Johnson's project benefits from a stellar cast, including Emily Blunt, Paul Dano. Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, and Jeff Daniels, all turning in intriguing performances that confound at every turn. Look for little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, a Damien/Omen meets Haley Joel Osment's ""I see dead people"" Cole as a sweet but creepy kid who steals every scene he's in, no easy task in this sea of veteran talent.Cinematographer Steve Yedlin (who also shot Johnson's previous features) maintains a consistent style throughout, making the present day settings somewhat indistinguishable from the future, adding to the delightful confusion of the audience. The music is never obtrusive as composer Nathan Johnson's original score serves the narrative without being showy. The pace is on par with the typical thriller, as editor Bob Ducsay ensures that the action flows at a steady rate without extended periods of introspection, as the filmmakers foil every attempt on the viewer's part to calculate the machinations and solve the riddles appearing on screen.Sci-fi morphs into action-adventure and psychological thriller as the viewer attempts to fit the puzzle pieces together. The identity of many of the characters, present and future, is a mystery -- and, as it turns out, that's really the point of it. There's plenty of eye candy, to be sure, but figuring out who's who and what they're really doing occupies most of the brain throughout ""Looper."" Johnson had a choice here. One option was to make the narrative so confounding that, a la ""Inception,"" people would be scratching their heads afterward, at the risk of them becoming disgusted at what they view as self-indulgence on the part of the filmmakers. The other option was to push the movie ever so slightly in that direction but, with a bit of humor and well placed tongue-in-cheek, not take itself so seriously as to annoy the audience into writing it off as a lost two hours (and it is long at 118 minutes). ""Looper"" walks a fine line between the two but, in the end, is more feast than famine, putting it in the category of films that must be seen again to be appreciated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant scifi crime thriller,"Disclaimer first- i am a sucker for time travel movies. Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger's T101 strode on the screen from the distant future in 1984's The Terminator, the fascinating possibilities and impossibilities arising out of this technology has fueled billions of dollars worth sci-fi imagination. Part sci-fi and part gangster flick, Rian Johnson's Looper is easily the best original, non remake time- travel movie in decades- there i have said it.Mostly set in Kansas with a bit of China and Europe thrown in, Looper takes place in two time streams- 2044 and 2074. Time travel has been discovered by 2074 but declared illegal- only the mob has access to it and they use it rather creatively to settle scores. It is very difficult to kill someone in 2074 due to body tagging etc so the mob effectively uses time travel to send their enemies 30 years in the past to be blasted to bits by the Loopers, a group of assassins working in the past for the future crime-lords. Complex? And after a certain point, the 2074 version of a Looper is sent to the 2044 version of himself to be executed. Thus closing the loop and retiring the assassin. More complex? Fear not, that is about it- if the effectiveness of any scifi movie is measured by its ability to take up a seemingly ludicrous idea and get the audience involved without questioning its logic, then Looper is well and truly a blast, just like the blunderbuss used by the Loopers.Joe Simmons, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is working as a looper dispatching enemies of his - leads the high life, has a stripper girlfriend and looking forward to his retirement in Paris. One fine day, he is faced with his own future self, played by the now ubiquitous Bruce Willis, as his target- he hesitates and sparks a chain of events that will determine his future existence in this world, along with ramifications for the crime syndicates in the future. Gordon Levitt has played the side character in numerous hits and he still may not have the charisma to carry a film on his own yet, but in Looper he takes on a far more challenging role- sheds his boyish charm to take up an action hero role. The amount of makeup they have put on him to make him look like a younger Bruce Willis makes him almost unrecognizable from his usual self. Speaking of Willis- no one, i repeat, no one in the industry still shoots off a gun with more malevolent joy than Bruce. He is super as a tortured assassin from the future, pining away for his murdered wife, willing to kill children to right his wrongs, and he still looks bad-ass enough to take down 20 man single-handedly, like 25 years ago in Die Hard. Emily Blunt as the mother of a child to whom there is more than meets the eye, and Jeff Daniels as the 2044 gang leader put in excellent performances too.Director Rian Johnson deserves tons of accolades- he has made a stylish action movie, with creativity, originality and energy, and at the same time it is thought provoking, affecting. This movie is not about overpowering effects, though the ones that are there are pretty awesome- it is more about people, and he gets us to care for each of them, whether the telekinetic child Cid, or the unstable killer in Kid Blue. There are scenes of gruesome violence that appear poetically along with sequences that intentionally slow down the narrative for the audience to absorb the essence. There are shades of classics such as Terminator and Bladerunner along with Ron Howard's gangster epic, Road to Perdition, but all put together, Looper is one brilliant scifi crime drama thriller that is a must watch for scifi fans- 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Major disappointment,"This film was a major disappointment. The trailer is promising.The idea is interesting, and the quality of picture is good. Bruce Willis is in it so you would expect a decent action film. So I went to check it out. The beginning was alright, action, everything makes sense. But then, in the middle of the movie it changes from action film to a boring not making any sense drama. It's like the director forgot what movie he was making and started making something else. Bruce Willis's character kills kids randomly, who the heck came up with that idea? At some point while the movie was still going I wanted to leave the cinema, it was that bad. Don't get dazzled by the trailer and don't go watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Loopy great fun!,"I just had to buy Looper when I heard all the hype surrounding it. I thought I was in luck when a friend lent me his ""friend's"" pirate copy, which is something I've never actually done before and will probably never do again in the future because the quality was what I like to call, ""floppy"". Bad sound, pixelated picture, I couldn't watch such a visual treat like Looper on that kind of quality! So I hunted Ebay and found a dangerously cheap copy, and I'm very glad that I did. Whilst Looper isn't the greatest sci-fi film ever made, like some people keep proclaiming, it certainly is a solid, entertaining and gripping adventure with a very original idea. Now, the first 45 minutes or so did lose me slightly in certain areas with its mind-bending premise of time-travel (which still doesn't entirely make sense), but if you just go with it then you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.Now, I don't completely understand how killing your own future self would not effectively kill you, but like I said, just go with it. It's a clever idea and one I haven't seen the likes of. Of course the film is set in the future so we get all the futuristic clichés of hover-bikes and weird tall buildings (we'll have to wait until 2044 arrives, to see just how accurate everything is) but at its core, the world isn't much different to how it is now. We're introduced to our hero, a drug-addicted murderer that some how remains likable throughout. The first hour of Looper acts like a rollicking sci-fi actioner as we're introduced to the idea of loopers and get to see what happens when things get out of hand.We all know that Bruce Willis comes back as Joseph's future self and silly old Joe lets him go! What I really liked here was that a certain sort of human element was introduced, which proved that Looper has heart as well as brain (almost like a Christopher Nolan film). We see Joseph age up into Bruce and he falls in love with a Chinese woman young enough to be his daughter (but we'll look over that) and I won't spoil the rest of it, but it certainly helps us feel some emotion for Bruce's character as we know what he's been through. There's also a great scene where Joseph and Bruce talk in a diner (reminded me of Heat) and Joseph is quite keen to shoot him. It's suspenseful stuff!For me, the film hit its stride when Joseph meets Emily Blunt at a nice farmhouse and we hear of Bruce's heart-breaking master plan. The film completely changes pace from rollicking sci-fi action to a more gentle, yet no less thrilling, pace. Now, this will probably upset/anger sci-fi action fans, but it adds a lot of emotion to the film and a strong human element. These parts were gripping, touching and very clever. There were some brilliantly tense scenes as well as some rather wonderful special effects which I won't spoil for you. The finale was compelling and very exciting with a clever and almost inspiring ending.Looper isn't as good as Inception. In fact, it isn't even a patch on Inception's mind-blowing brilliance, but it is a fun and entertaining ride with a lot of heart and brain. Needless to say that I really enjoyed every minute of it and I'm not into the sci-fi genre. The action was also really well shot, with no annoying shake or constant cutaways which made it all the more intense. The directing was often very impressive. I especially liked the crabbing camera motion! In the end, Looper is really worth seeing and also has good replay value. Don't go expecting Inception though!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Average/Good Experienc,"The carachters are solid, good acting all the way through. General atmosphere is quite tense I must say. Murders, torture, fights are plenty but they are putted together with a stylish sense, images and sounds are designed to shock through the movie, at various moments (not a full non stop rate).Besides this, I would not develop or argue the plot(s), as this review is more for peoples who have not seen it yet than to expose my theory about this or that impossible facts. All in one I found the story to be believable.My disappointment and reason to note this movie just with a 6, is the general rhythm. It's quite inconsistent, not really flowing, and the ""emotional"", sincere moments here to develop the psychology of the characters are a bit unconviencing to my opinion.Not bad in general, felt a bit bored after1h but the ending took eventually things right.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Well-moulded time travel flick,"IT has been a while since we've seen a time travel movie, and even longer since we've seen a good one. In the year 2074, when the Mob wants to ""take care"" of somebody, the target is sent 30 years back in the past, where a stylish hired gun, known as a ""looper"", waits to pull the trigger. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a looper making his way through the ropes, is one day hit with a huge surprise when his future self, older Joe (Bruce Willis), is sent back to catch a bullet in the chest. Older Joe escapes and it is now up to Joe to track him down, kill him and make it right with the Mob. You know this much from watching the trailer, and to be honest, this is about a quarter of the plot. The time travel aspect of the movie is also handled really well, where it is explained but kept vague, and actually gets the audience thinking throughout the movie. The future in the year 2044 is portrayed well in the movie. Cars don't fly, but there are bikes that hover along the ground, people ingest drugs through eye drops, they are paid in silver and gold bars: just subtle differences without your average expectations of the future. It starts off sleek and smart with a strong pace, but kind of fades in the middle. However, this really isn't such a bad thing. It gives time for characters to mature, for their backstories to unfold and their relationships to build. If you were looking for big action shoot-outs and trucks exploding, you might be disappointed. The action scenes are good, with a few shoot-outs and a chase here and there, but ultimately, it is the plot, dialogue and stand-out acting (particularly by Gordon-Levitt) that really drives Looper. There is also a strong female character in Sara, played by Emily Blunt, who isn't too hard on the eyes. Without spoiling anything, Looper goes in directions audiences wouldn't expect. It is a futurist movie, and if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, you have to let yourself be taken over by the science fiction aspect. This could have been a simple premise where ""good guy"" has to track down and kill ""bad guy"", but the plot has layers. It has themes of cause and effect and dives deeper than your average popcorn-munching CGI fest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"If you don't mind some loopholes *cough* and are into sci-fi and time travel with a twist, then you'll enjoy this movie.","The concept is good and the setting of the tone for this story is awesome, you'll be engaged from start to finish. The pacing is pretty satisfying, I was never bored, just when I thought things would slow down a bit, the movie shakes things up.Now the prosthetics on Joseph Gordon Levitt, bothered me a bit, but not because they were bad, but because people wouldn't believe me when I told them that was actually Joseph Gordon Levitt, I had to make them sit through some credits for them to see I was not crazy. But some comments were funny, like, ""who is this actor, I've never seen him before!"". But it was fine, together with the makeup they made it work.Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis in full action glory and Emily Blunt was the perfect mix of badass and soft.Now if you look at this movie too critically you'll find a bunch of loopholes that don't make any sense and would throw the entire movie to the ground, especially in the last act, but don't dwell on that too much, this movie is truly entertaining and interesting in everything they bring to the time travel genre and if you enjoy movies like ""Terminator"" then you'll definitely enjoy this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Unexpected Ending, so so Story","I have high expectation with Looper. When I read about the review, wow, looks fab one! About time travel, assassin. One I should have not missed. Looper told us about the 'future assassin' called looper, who killed people from the past. The bad guy sent to the future, where the looper exist. The head's villain covered, when they arrived, the looper instantly shoot them on the chest. As the payment, the silver bar could be found inside the villain's clothes. If the looper get golden bars, means they killed their selves because the contract had cut. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was one of the top achievers looper. He always on time, kill the villain, take the silver bar and switched the bar with money. At night he's having fun and tipsy.One day he was shocked with a loud knock in his door. Seth (Paul Dano) beg him to hid him from the others looper. He did the worst sin that a looper can do, let the villain escape. Seth was realize he's going to kill her future self. He told Seth in the future there is the big villain called the 'Rainmaker'. He was going to kill all loopers. Joe hid Seth but at last revealed it because his boss threatened him would take his silver bar saving. One day Joe felt something wrong, because the villain that should killed by Joe, didn't come on time. After some time, the villain come, hit Joe with his body, till Joe fall, and his cover head overt. That withstand Joe pull the trigger, the villain's eyes! Why it just look familiar and resembles like mine? Wondered him. Knowing Joe stand still, that old guy attacked Joe once again till he faint. Joe awake and find his way to meet his old one, his future one, Old Joe(OJ) (Bruce Willis). OJ asked Joe's help, as he wanted to eliminated the rainmaker, which is in Joe era still a kid. OJ was so hurt because they kill his lovely wife. Joe rejected and said, he should kill him now, and do the right thing. Eventually he agreed to help OJ. OJ only had series of number, he had no idea what is that, but that was the only one direction about Rainmaker. OJ find out the location of the rainmaker. He ordered Joe to go one location, while he will go to the others two locations.Joe arrived in old farm. During his journey he's got shoot. He met Sara (Emily Blunt), a single mother with one kid. She's is a strong woman, and always brought a gun everywhere. As they talked, accidentally Sara saw Joe's paper which was written that serial number. Sara shocked and asked how he found out about that? who are you? Evidently that was her son's social number and birth date, Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Was he 'Rainmaker'?The ending was unexpected.

Loopy,"The time travel genre is nothing new to movies. It's been done brilliantly (The Terminator/Back to the Future/12 Monkeys) and not so well (Timeline/Freejack/Time After Time). Even still, it's a story arc that offers so much potential for imaginative plots, filmmakers continue to come back to it again and again. Which is fine, providing it's done with some panache. Looper is yet another addition to that long traveled path to the time travel well and with a cool sounding premise, promises the same kind of dizzying concepts and brain muddling story arcs. At least that's what you expect. That it falls a bit short is really a surprise. And a shame.Upon release, critics were literally creaming themselves and foaming at the mouth over this movie. There simply wasn't enough descriptive expletives in the dictionary to summarize how amazing this movie was meant to be. It was also not uncommon to hear it being compared with such esteemed company as The Matrix and Inception. While it's not as good as the former, and not as clever as the latter, it's still an okay – if unremarkable - watch. Basically, take one-third Terminator, add a touch of 12 Monkeys and mix in some Carrie, and the result is Looper. And if that sounds a bit on the loopy side, that's because it is.In the future, there is time travel, but as it's banned, the only people using it are criminals. They send back ex-colleagues and other targets to be executed in the past by 'Loopers' – specialist executioners who incinerate the future garbage. Literally. So when a Looper called 'Joe' (Gordon Levitt – in makeup) gets his latest victim, he's in for a huge shock when he discovers it's himself. Or rather an older version of himself (Bruce Willis). And so begins a sometimes interesting, though occasionally confusing chase/hunt as the younger Joe tries to zero in on his older self.On the plus side, this has lots of really good ideas and interesting concepts in it: the younger version of Joe can send messages to his older self by cutting his instructions in his flesh; memories are simultaneously created and rendered vague by the actions of the younger iteration; and in one scene another older Looper - who escaped death earlier - starts to literally fall apart as his younger version systematically loses limbs though surgery performed by the bad guys who are financing all the Loopers. It's a scene that is slightly reminiscent of the Black Knight's demise in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, though much more grueling and shocking. Also, the makeup on Gordon Levitt is quite subtle and very effective: you actually believe both him and Bruce are the same person, albeit from different places in time. The future world looks unique enough without being completely alien and unfamiliar to us. So where does it all go wrong? About half way throughFor a movie with such an intriguing premise, promising every manner of head spinning older assassin against his younger self interactions, along with the customary shootouts and all the ensuing paradoxes resulting from traveling through time, this takes an abrupt turn that is so left-field you'll feel you stumbled into a different movie It's almost like writer-director Rian Johnson ran out of plot after breezing through the first half and said: ""Where else can I take this I know: a farm where  etc"" This sudden turn is so out of sync, as to feel it doesn't belong in this movie. The clue is in one of the movie references mentioned above. It is a shame because it's fifty-per cent a very good movie.The cast are very good too: Gordon Levitt doe a really good job as a younger Bruce, while Bruce himself starts off sympathetic but gradually changes into something that is both ruthless and quite monstrous. Emily Blunt also does good work as gun-toting farm owner. So if they're all that good, then where does this go wrong? Obviously, this movie probably looked brilliant on paper, but after execution, is decidedly lacking. What you're expecting is not what you get – and not necessarily in a good way. You think you're going to get something dazzling - something with the intricacies of the brilliant Spanish time travel movie Timecrimes; but what you actually get – at least for half of it - could easily be a standalone, and pretty pedestrian horror movie. Again, you wonder: why wasn't somebody standing at Johnson's typewriter with a cattle prod, telling him to come up with something better?There's a lot of inconsistencies too: without being overly specific, stuff is done in this movie that makes no sense when you think about it after wards (heck, even the central premise makes no sense – surely the criminals would be using time travel for something more ambitious than to just bump people off?). Also, there is a central antagonist that is meant to play such a huge part in ruining older Joe's life, older Joe wants to hunt him down; yet we never actually get around to meeting this evil doer, only a different, more vulnerable version of him.Inconsistencies aside, you're left with a movie that somehow misses the mark despite the groundwork being laid for something really special. It's not as action packed and visionary as The Matrix, and not as clever as Inception. Maybe it's the type of movie that could get better on a re-watch – i.e., once you're familiar with the direction it ends up going, it might actually be possible to end up liking it for what it is – but as a first time viewing, the movie falls a bit flat and that's entirely a legacy of the final half. Want some advice? Go watch Timecrimes instead.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
The most original Sci-Fi film I've seen this year.,"While Hollywood has taken a beating in terms of rehashes and remakes; some really good like ""Dredd 3d"" and of course the Nolan Batman films as well as several others worth mentioning, they're are of course a few gems that are original in concept and narrative. ""Looper"" the latest Sci-Fi film from director Riam Johnson is such a refreshing and original concept that I couldn't help but be immersed in it's well-constructed and thrillingly acted atmosphere.The premise is something I've never seen on paper before and no doubt I was confused as the well-written plot unfolded on screen. Many of the ideas presented in ""Looper"" are very unheard of and I for one was caught up in the film while trying to pick up things as it went along. I'm looking forward to a second and third viewing in order to fully understand and appreciate it's complex plot with many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.But the best parts of this film is the plot and characters. Oodles of character development, which is very important for a film, is prevalent hear with personal relationships, revelations; everything you want in a film and more. Since this is an action film, the action scenes are well done as well as the special effects, which are thankfully not numerous as seen in other films, but the complement, rather than overwhelm the film which lets the audience concentrate more on the story. Some say that the pacing was a little too slow; I tend to disagree as any film with this richness deserves to be savored at a methodical pace and thankfully ""Looper"" gives me that and more. I'd choose this film over Expendables 2 anything as that film is, pardon the pun ""expendable"".Acting wise everyone does a good job with the wonderful material they are given with. With high-calibre actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels, every scene they are in(especially the diner scene) they chew it up with irony and delivery.I had a really good time with ""Looper"". A film that is so original that it's complex and confusing(in a good way)plot definitely demands repeat viewings and rewards you for doing so. Challenging and intriguing, ""Looper"" is one of the best Sci-Fi films of the year and also the most well-written and acted.

Wow - actually pretty good,"I've seen so many films now, half of them I manage to turn off around the half hour mark. Sometimes I think I've seen every different monster and every different car chase. Then something like Looper comes along and restores my faith in Hollywood.It's about time travel. Therefore you can look up on the internet message boards threads about the major plot holes with the mechanics of time travel in general. They use words like 'paradox' and things like that. Basically, they're saying that the movie doesn't work scientifically. Well, if put to the test, it probably doesn't. But then nor does any time travel movie. So, if you can suspend your disbelief and like some slick sci-fi action, you should enjoy this.In the future, they time travel. And those crafty futuristic criminals are only sending their 'hit' victims back in time to be executed and disposed of (by assassins called 'Loopers'). This prevents the future authorities from ever linking the future criminals to their murders. Clever, huh? Well, nearly. Because Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of those Loopers and his 'victim' sent back in time for him to neatly kill and dispose of, is only him! Or rather Bruce Willis, who is apparently what Joseph Gordon-Levitt will look like in about forty years time. But, Bruce Willis has no intention of just taking the traditional bullet to the head. He has his own agenda. And it involves escape and killing many people along the way. Why? You'll have to watch the film to find out.It's well written. Special acting points to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for mimicking all of Bruce's little quirks and mannerisms in order to portray his younger incarnation. Plus full marks for finding a really dark and menacing kid who flits between sweet and psychotic (I think this is how young Anakin Skywalker should have been cast in Episode I, but never mind - too late now).Basically, Looper is a lot of well-written, well-performed mind-bending time travelling fun. Yes, it may have some plot holes if you really want to dig deep enough, but there's so much good here, it well and truly overshadows the bad.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An amazing movie with a perfunctory ending!,"The story is about the future when the time traveling is available but it's only used in secret by the biggest criminal organizations. It sounds logical that the time traveling would be illegal but there was a rule that everyone should closed their loops and I wasn't really convinced about it.It's a story of an old man who has nothing else to lose and wants to save his wife's life by going back in time and he decides to do anything necessary no matter how cruel it would be.There are many scenes that the old man is confronting his younger self and both sides hate each other as much as possible.In such movies, there is always a battle between a good guy and a villain but in this movie you cannot distinguish it. One of the most interesting things about this story is that you cannot prognosticate what comes next.The story was really fascinating and I just don't understand why it had to end that way.

The main character is momentarily nonplussed when his future self (Old Brucie) is sent back for slaughter leading to (both their) getaways from the 2044 baddies. The emphasis shifts slightly from time travel to telekinesis – obviously embracing 12 Monkeys, Source Code and even Children Of The Corn. It's a bloody two-dimensional chase, with even a motive for the ultimately pointless murder of two innocent children sympathetically portrayed and glossed over. The cgi cartoonery department were overused here too, what with suspended objects monetary or animate floating around – but Inception did it better. Also if a baddie from the future was chopped up in 2044 his 2074 self wouldn't be seen to fall apart dramatically limb by limb surely? By the end no matter how tender hearted the story has got you don't feel that interested in any of the characters, even to speculating how they obviously thought time could be changed just for themselves and no one else. Didn't any of them see Joan Collins in the original Star Trek for the logic to be explained simply? And on.Engrossing, always interesting, well made and a current-time passer, thoughtful only don't think about it too much. And no, I don't want the 2 hours back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A lot of loopholes (no pun intended), but still pretty entertaining","""Looper"" is a science fiction film about assassins who kill people sent from the future. It is the middle of the 21st Century and time travel has not been invented yet. It was though twenty years from the film's present and in the process got outlawed. Since then, the only people who accessed the technology was the underworld and they would send the ones to be killed to the past as if they never existed. The assassins who kill these targets of the future are known as ""loopers"". Joe (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a looper and the film centres around his last assignment which is to kill his older self (played by Bruce Willis). As you can imagine, a film with such a plot line would have a lot of holes in it that it couldn't avoid, but the great thing about this film is that it distracts it's audience from that with exemplary camera-work, an Oscar-worthy screenplay, riveting editing and realistic acting (considering the circumstances) to create one of the best films of the year. Directed by Rian Johnson, the film is one of the most innovative pieces of the year and has put it's young Director as one of the film- makers to look out for in the future. Joseph Gordon Levitt seems to grow with every role he gets and is really evolving into an actor who it seems will be around for some time to come and he gives his career's best performance (IMO). He does so by grasping the roots of his character with an exemplary understanding of his motives which results into one of the most measured and realistic performances of the year. His role reminded me a lot of Gosling's driver but even though it was not as powerful, it played with similar character aspects with a more chaotic interpretation as was required. He is well supported by Emily Blunt, Jeff Bridges and Bruce Willis who goes back to his roots that made him popular but with an angle which was far more different than the people he has been known to portray. There is also a great cameo by the criminally overlooked Paul Dano as well. Willis' performance, however, was the surprise of the film even though it was not as unexpected as his turn in Sixth Sense. His walk through familiar territory was done with motives which could easily have been transformed into something cheesy but he managed to do that by balancing his darkness that proved the catalyst for his passion. The other great performance is given by another actor who I should not mention because to do so would spoil it for people who have not seen it. All in all, ""Looper"" is definitely one of the best films of the year and it is a movie which will have you hanging on to your seats till it ends. It does have a lot of holes in it which you are bound to expect from a film which deals with such a unique vision on the time-travel context.The fact that it makes you overlook them with it's quality film-making is a testament to Rian Johnson and the production built around to tell such a complex tale by using the basic fundamentals of story-telling is what made it mind blowing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nice Saturday night movie,"For starters I enjoy the type of movies that star Bruce Willis so my opinion is a little biased. That being said, the main reason I went to see this movie is because of the time travel aspect. This is a very complicated subject and I was very interesting as to how they where going to incorporate this and solve ""the problem"".And it started out very good, the story was very plausible and the moral dilemma that comes with being a looper gave you enough to think about. Up until this point I really though this movie was going to be a ""9"" for sure. However Then it changed and the story became less and less plausible and the plot wasn't as strong as I would have liked.***SPOILERS FROM HERE***The point where it went wrong was when they introduced TK (telekinesis), This didn't add anything to the story. Of course they had to think of a way to make the ""rainmaker"" figure exceptional and very strong I personally just thought this just was not the way to go. It felt like they where blending two different stories into one.second point was the plot, as I said the time travel subject is very complicated so if you start thinking about the plot you start to see the error because when he commits suicide in the past then his older self will never come to exist. This will then lead to him never meeting his older self which in turn will lead to him never being in the situation that he has to kill himself. And this would create a loop where still in 50% of the ""time"" the world is ruled by the ""rainmaker"". Personally I would have liked an ending that he would have killed ""cid"" and then just stood there for a few moments then cut to the other child (where he got caught by kid blue) and then see all kinds of metal items floating around that kid and fade to black.In sum, a very intriguing movie, very good acting and the resemblance between Bruce Willis and his younger self was very striking. So if you don't over think/analyze every movie you watch you will be enjoying this movie a lot!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

The most unique sci-fi film I've watched in recent times.,"Looper is basically a story about time travel. Joe(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper in the present day. His job is to kill people who come from the future, who are sent by evil companies to close the loop on them. However Joe's world turns upside down when he has to close the loop on himself that is, Old Joe(Bruce Willis). However Joe hesitates & Older Joe escapes. Now, it's up to him to find Old Joe & kill him because, the company that hired him led by Abe(Jeff Daniels) & which consists of Seth(Paul Dano) & Kid Blue(Noah Segan) are hot on both the Joes' trail. Joe seeks the help of Sara(Emily Blunt) & her son Cid(Pearce Gagnon) to track down his older counterpart. Old Joe's only aim is to rescue his wife(Qing Xu). This is the synopsis of the movie.First off, Looper is a brilliant film, visually. The special effects are outstanding. The story is engaging & has many twists and turns leading to the epic conclusion that this film has. A note on the performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Joe. In fact the viewer has a hard time believing that Joe is not a younger Bruce Willis. Gordon-Levitt has delivered such a convincing performance! Bruce Willis is superb as Old Joe. Willis' portrayal is more mature and the character hates himself for all the mistakes that he had committed in the past. Emily Blunt is great as Sara. Pearce Gagnon is mind blowing as Cid. The supporting actors namely, Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, Noah Segan & Qing Xu are spectacular as Abe, Seth, Kid Blue & Old Joe's wife respectively. All in all, Looper is a must watch for sci-fi fans and pretty much everyone who loves action movies. The film is both time & money well spent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"'Looper' starts as sci-fi, progresses as action, and ends in drama.","That's the problem. Everything jammed together in two hours beyond the director's ability. Plot is super messy. Any work with a time loop should be extra careful with plot development to maintain organization and flow. However, the base understanding of the main character's universe is not shared with the audience, thus making it more confusing. Additionally, so many leaps of logic and so many unproved, unexplained, and unsolved details. They do not bother the viewers when the movie is confident enough to grab their full attention. However, that's not the case for 'Looper'. Artistically, I can observe a few creative approaches to camera angle and images & colors. Various camera angles and movements make continuous action sequences less boring. 360 camera rotation rather than shot-by-shot adds dynamics and wider scope. The setting and image amplify dreamy and solitary vibes. They are based on the future but give out an old and vintage atmosphere at the same time, thus avoiding being tacky.* AND WHO the heck did Gordon-Levitt's make-up? What happened to his eyebrows because they are so unnatural and distracting the whole time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Reminded Me of ""The Terminator""","""Looper"" is a futuristic movie set in 2074. A crime organization sends people they want to dispose of thirty years into the past, where a hired killer called a ""looper"" shoots them from behind. Joe (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) is one such looper. One day, he was sent his future self (Bruce Willis) to kill. Old Joe escapes being shot by Young Joe, and from there Old Joe plots to kill the future mob boss (called ""The Rainmaker"") while he was still a little boy named Cid. This was to prevent a future event where the Rainmaker kills Joe's wife. However, Young Joe gets finds Cid first and gets close with his mom Sara (Emily Blunt). How will Young Joe and Old Joe resolve this conflict of interest?Honestly, did we not already see the concept of killing a person before he matures back in the 80s with ""The Terminator""? Cid's mother was also even named Sara -- shades of Sarah Connor in ""Terminator"" isn't it? This future Rainmaker wasn't helpless though, as he had remarkable powers of his own. Are they asking us to also believe that super power mutations will be the order of the day in the future?It is very easy to like this movie if you just glide over all of the time travel improbabilities. The whole concept is so violent and sort of illogical, yet JGL and Bruce Willis make it all look so cool. I have never seen Emily Blunt look so tough before. These three lead actors and the child actor who played Cid (Pierce Gagnon) make the film work really well, despite the inherent limitations of this sort of story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
This Film Will Make You Think and Feel In a Way You Will Never See Coming,"Looper,wow! I'm writing this less than an hour after seeing the film, and the emotions rushing throughout my mind are nothing short of intriguing. This movie will make you want to instantly see it again. To be completely honest, I have to see this movie again, for a number of reasons. The first reason, is that this movie is daring, and I love that about it; it experiments with obscure camera angles and a number of changes in the plot, as well as the progression of the story. Kim Newman, from ""Empire"" described this movie absolutely perfectly. She said, ""Looper isn't perfect, but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz: it has a brain, courage and a heart."" The first part is key, ""Looper isn't perfect."" Nothing is perfect and no movie is, they come close, and sometimes too close to call, but still, nothing is perfect. Thats the beauty of film, and the genius of this film. It knows that it cannot be perfect, so it decides to experiment, and push the audiences buttons. For the first few minutes, one cannot help but marvel at the beauty, as well as the scope of it. Each scene is shot perfectly, and in theaters gives the viewer quite the rush. You may think you know what your getting into, but you have no idea, and I refuse to spoil it, it would be unfair to the reader to be robbed of such an experience. Not only is the cinematography spectacular, the acting is some of the best I've seen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is nothing short of amazing, and the rest of the cast does a pretty damn good job, if I do say so myself. For me, the best part about this film was the emotion. There were scenes that made me shiver, at how horrifying they were, and at how much feeling the actor was radiating. In short, if you haven't scene this film, go see it, I refuse to take no for an answer. If you have, go see it again, I definitely will be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Not Bladerunner,"This film has had a lot of good reviews 8.5/10 on here Yes the story is original the actors well cast Bruce Willis in the line up certainly gives it a good pedigree and Emily Blunt adds a touch of natural beauty to the screen. I am a fan of the Sci-Fi Genre so i do understand that what appeals to one will not appeal to another. I thought the film was rather slow to start but it was rather cleverly introducing all the characters central to the plot, their lifestyles values etc The time travel background certainly gave the scriptwriters a lot of freedom to ply their ideas. For me i give this 7/10 the cinematography is riveting and all the scenes are incredible.There is an atmosphere generated here that draws you into the plot. I do not want to give any of the plot away here but i shall summarize this review by adding please go and watch this film but do do expect to see a classic such as Bladerunner or Inception or the first Matrix Great film though if you are a Sci Fi Buff if you are not not think twice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very Original Sci-Fi Film!,"Looper is one of the best original sci-fi films I have seen in years. It's a complicated film because it will bend your mind and is very conceptual. In short, you may have to use your brain here. This film has time travel as it's main point, but I like how the film makes new use of it. Over the course of the film, the plot may get complicated but wen all is said and done, everything gets straightened out.Rian Johnson's film takes place in the near future when time travel has been invented. In the year 2074, going through time has been banned except by the most ruthless criminal organizations. In 2044, there are people like Joe called ""loopers"" who are tasked with executing people from the future. But when Joe's future self gets sent back for extermination, things may get a little hairy.Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are very good as older and younger Joe. I thought Levitt does a good job impersonating the mannerisms of Willis and perhaps the use of prosthetics worked. Emily Blunt also manages to do well and adds emotion to her character.Overall, a high-concept movie, but a very good one at that. It has a tough screenplay but it is very smart and engaging. There is no shortage of action and this will keep you on your feet expecting more things to happen. I also liked the concept of telekinesis and it made the film a bit more interesting. A very solid sci-fi film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Contains some interesting ideas but not enough confidence to pull it off,"'LOOPER' was directed by Rian Johnson and stars Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. ​In a future society, time- travel exists, but it's only available to those with the means to pay for it on the black market. When the mob wants to eliminate someone, it sends the target into the past, where a hit man known as a looper lies in wait to finish the job. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one such hired gun, and he does his job well -- until the day his bosses decide to ""close the loop"" and send Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) back in time to be killed.This movie is not bad. It's not good. It etches more towards good than bad but that doesn't make it good. It's not average. It's not above or below average. I don't know what to label this movie as. Some ideas and concepts presented are intriguing and, given some time to develop, could make an interesting TV series or something of the like. Levitt was fantastic at mimicking Bruce Willis and I commend him for that. Willis was also great and the pair both provided a very interesting and unique performance of the same character. If this movie had been given maybe another 2 weeks in the writing room, I think it would've worked much better. I don't dislike it and I don't like it. I give it a six because it leans more towards the good but that doesn't make it good. That sounds very confusing but it does kind of make sense.The movie does hold some very interesting concepts which could be explored more with prequels, a sequel or a TV series. But they just had too many new ideas that they had to cram into the run time. This bloats the movie for me by about 30 minutes. They cram in a stupid amount of exposition at the beginning and that really should have been cut entirely, and then sprinkle it throughout the film instead of a tiny 30 minute gap. I think I like the ending but I am unsure of it. More time on the script would have benefited the movie much more I am sure.As previously stated, Levitt and Willis are both excellent in their joint role as Joe. Emily Blunt was awesome as Sara and shows real, genuine desperation and an urge to care for her child. That kid was creepy as hell but was excellent nonetheless.It is well shot, lit and edited. No complaints as far as standard scenes go. I do, however, have some complaints surrounding the way action was handled in this movie. Granted it isn't an action movie and thus I don't expect perfection but if you choose to include it, make it watchable.This movie is hard to recommend. I think I will say you should watch it once, ponder on the interesting questions raised and then never see it again. I see very little(if any) rewatch value and seeing it more than once would probably make my head bleed. That's my recommendation for this film. I'll rate it 6 Creepy A$$ Looking Kids out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It was the best of Time & the worst of Time,"Imagine if James Ellroy, Raymond Chandler or James M.Cain had written a sci-fi movie then we'd have the 1st half of ""Looper"". Now imagine if Terence Malick had written & directed a sci-fi movie then we'd have the 2nd hour of ""Looper"".The first hour is sci-fi noir almost as visionary as ""Bladerunner"". It is sharp, nasty, thrilling, brutal & inventive. Rian Johnson does such a great job with cracking dialog, cracking visuals & sharp cuts that it almost kills me to say that when this movie goes out to pasture it just about ""buys the farm"".""The Departed"" died when Nicholson's character croaked. This film almost dies when it goes into a field of bad dreams. Its pacing completely changes. A head rush becomes a marathon.The performances are well above par. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can carry a film as he proves here. (His work in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" had surprising gravitas.) Bruce is Bruce. The make-up didn't distract me one bit due to the acting. To say that Jeff Daniels is under-appreciated has become a cliché.I give this movie a 11/10 for the 1st hour & a 5/10 for its 2nd hour.

I Thoroughly Enjoyed LOOPER,"Despite seeing the previews, reading several reviews, and basically knowing beforehand what LOOPER's all about, I have to say that it still took me by surprise in many ways. Really fine acting, script, and cinematography bring about an immediate realism, which is especially important in a film set in the future with numerous science fictional/fantastic elements. I'm distractible and often downright dense but still followed the important points of what's going on here. LOOPER is definitely NOT one of those films that just tries to befuddle us with supposedly brilliant BS. It's one that you can watch again and again, always picking up something new in the way of hints, nuances, and details of plot.There are a few plot holes, which is almost inevitable in a film about time paradoxes, i.e., if time travel ever becomes a reality, will it be possible to go back and change what's already occurred? A few other little imperfections here and there, but it's a film that's good enough to where something is gained even from the blemishes. This is true of anything, I suppose, but if you watch LOOPER expecting it to be good, the various anachronisms and illogicalities shouldn't be too glaring. On the other hand, if you watch it in a really critical frame of mind, on the look-out for defects, said defects may be all too evident.The near future (2044) setting is well-done: A lot of interesting technology, but nothing too ""out there."" It's also interesting to see how Kansas City might look 30 years from now. LOOPER will obviously resonate with many science fiction aficionados, and even many who generally hate this genre will find themselves making an exception here.This is one of Bruce Willis's finest performances. Emily Blunt as Sara is outstanding both actress and character-wise. Last but far from least, Pierce Gagnon as 5-year-old Cid is simply hypnotic and virtually steals the show whenever he's in it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Great Sci-Fi Movie with a Intelligent Story,"Great Sci-Fi movie, in a dystopian near future (2044) where in the future of this future criminals are sent to be killed and theirs bodies dispatched in the past (the present one, where the film begins) through a time machine, which is banned in the future and is considered illegal. The executioners are called Loopers, and receive payments in silver bars, attached in the victims bodies.Everything is well, until the Loopers start having completed their cycles (ie 30 years after, they are sent from the future to be killed, and so the evidences about the crimes are gone), in a increasing frequency...The film uses almost no special effects, has several action scenes, and the film sets use suburban environments, with the classic future of marginalized people, and vehicles in most scenes that have implementations, but are our current ones with low-cost technologies, with a nice retro look. Some devices in the movie are nice future versions of the ones we have, like glass-like cellphones and holographic computers.The performances are very good, especially for a boy who appears later in the film (Pierce Gagnon, only 05 years old), and that surprise yourself! The other performances are good, especially of Bruce Willis, but the protagonist, Joseph Gordon-Levitt I didn't found so good, perhaps because he was trying to imitate the way Bruce Willis is acting (of his version of 30 years in the future).The script is very interesting and has some twists and scenes in the future that explain the past and vice versa, but nothing as complex in Inception or Memento - from the middle of the movie things start to be interesting and the film's ending is very surprising and interesting.Briefly is a great sci-fi, with a very smart script and solid performances in a credible future.

Rian Johnson's storytelling abilities proceed. A strong and refreshing sci-fi thriller.,"One of those examples of how the choice of a specific director is essential for a screenplay's success. Truth is, if ""Looper"" had gone to someone else's hands, it could have probably lost itself in the dust of the genre's usual clichés.In a time where Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" still slams its weight, Rian Johnson delivers us an alternative story, refreshing from what has been done lately. It's not just about the meticulous plot where all the pieces seem to fit almost naturally, it's the easiness of how it flows to the screen, in a way that immediately introduces the viewer into the movie's rhythm. Even if it's a piece of sci-fi action, Johnson prefers to focus himself on the storytelling instead of blasting around with visual effects. This is really clear in its style, specially in ""Brick"", his modern homage to the ""cinéma noir"", and where he collects all the points - that's why the film shines more than recent others.Other good aspects: the beautiful photography and the numerous ""slow-motion"" plans, always without forcing too much. Joseph Gordon-Levitt show us once again why he is one of the most interesting actors around, as he can, quite so hauntingly, appropriate Bruce Willis' way of acting and put it into his own performance, in order to enhance the two of them's similarity.Strange mixing between Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"".

Looper (2012),"Another awesome brain frying science fiction creative and stunningly done. Emotional, action packed and perfectly executed.Overall - 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Simple and satisfying with a very human heart,"On the face of it, Rian Johnson's thriller Looper, utilises many conventional visual signifiers of recent science fiction films, with a high concept idea at its centre. But unlike the many other dystopian future films, it doesn't get held back by the importance of the technology within the world it creates. Set in Kansas in 2044, the opening scene sees Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) standing alone in a wheat field with a blanket spread out a distance in front of him. Appearing instantaneously is a kneeling figure with his head covered in cloth, and Joe shoots. Like many other genre films, Looper has a reliance on narration from its main character, a necessity of complex narrative, but it is an important element, and one which further exacerbates Johnson's passion for film noir (as seen in his debut high school noir, Brick in 2005).Thirty years in the future, time travel has been invented. For unexplained reasons, this technology has been outlawed, but is being used exclusively by crime syndicate's who are using people like Joe to assassinate people they send back in time. Joe, like the other loopers he works with are narcissistic, taking recreational drugs, simply living in the moment, with no apparent concern for the future, and particularly with the world they inhabit. A looper will eventually be retired, but once a looper is no longer required, this is known as closing the loop. What this involves is their future selves being sent back in time to be killed by his younger self. In a quirk of control, a being known as the Rainmaker, is attempting to put a stop to loopers altogether by closing all the loops. Panicking when confronted with the unclothed face of his future self (Bruce Willis), young Joe is knocked aside, and old Joe escapes the find the Rainmaker as a child, and stop the death of his future wife.Whilst many other time travel films become often convoluted in their complexities of paradox, Looper manages to disregard the codes of science fiction paradoxicals and presents a refreshing layer of humanity. In a pivotal scene, when young and older Joe occupy the same time and space, they meet in their favourite diner - ordering the same meal - and older Joe complains at his younger self at his attitude towards life (I'm pretty sure we would all participate in this diatribe presented with the same context, to tell your younger self: ""You're a d**k""). Whilst the young Joe has no future outlook, future Joe has an image to cling to, specifically the woman who will eventually save his life. It's a scene fraught with tension and high chances of danger for the character(s), and one that has a bit of a poke at the concepts of time travel paradox. In fact, when quizzed about the possibility of changing the future by acting differently, old Joe bursts into anger, a character and a script knowingly telling the audience who will dissect time travel contradictions to essentially f**k off.What ensues is a customary chase narrative, with the twist that Joe chases his older self - the younger is also being hunted by other loopers, as his inability to close the loop leans that he has to be eliminated. The hunt for the young Rainmaker leads to the farm of Sara (Emily Blunt) and her young son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon). The fact that young and old Joe share the same time/space, leads to a nice touch, where new experiences of the young Joe, reverberate in the memory of the elder. With this complex central concept, it would be easy for the script to become over elaborate, but Johnson keeps the plot simple, making it an incredibly satisfying narrative, that is intelligent, but does not over-intellectualise the themes.Gordon-Levitt's performance is unsurpassed, he manages to possess the mannerisms of Willis without poor impersonation. Just one look of the face and his eyes and mouth (particularly) have this perfect essence of Willis. It's a big little film, that brings themes of addiction, paranoia, and the idea that in our youth, we inevitably make bad choices and often damage ourselves for in-the-moment selfishness. Johnson clearly has been influenced by Philip K. Dick, and even some of Blade Runner's (1982) visual tricks are utilised here. But whilst Dickian aesthetics dictate the overbearing corporation of government, Looper has a very human heart, which is illustrated in the relationship (new to old Joe) with the farmer and her son, and provides one of the most beautiful and convincing climax's in sci-fi cinema in some time. So therefore, Looper presents a very persuasive image of a future where society has collapsed and the highest paying job seems to be a hit-man, it also shows that even the most self centred of people, the types who would risk the lives of others for money (ahem), can be moved by the idea and realisation of humanistic beauty, and the innocence of love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Why do people hate on this movie,This film was amazing in my opinion one of the best movies I've ever seen people complain at this for unoriginality which is untrue this is about as original as your going to get for these days. I thought the acting was terrific except for the rainmaker. The concept of an economically downfallen America and the time travel and the loppers and the drugs and time travel were awesome. Some movie mistakes a tiny bit flawed but this film in my opinion was better then most of the 2012 films I've seen this year. Now this film is one of the reasons why Joseph Gordon Levitt in my opinion a brilliant actor and maybe one day some Oscar nominations. This film was put together beautifully and for the people who think this film was all about Joe chasing Older Joey it's not because that plot is basically Cat and Mouse. This film is more than that Older Joe wants the younger Joe to go through his way of life. That's all I have to say and if you read this thank you for reading my first review.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Something new,"There was this little genre film I saw fairly recently called The Caller. It centered on a young woman who moves into a new apartment and begins receiving frightening phone calls from a woman searching for someone. As the film builds towards a truly unique and shocking conclusion you discover that the film is dabbling in the whole time travel sub genre although very different films Looper reminded me of that film. This film centers on a group of specialized assassins living in the year 2044. Like the most believable films set in the future not much differentiates the times accept some nice touches here and there futuristic architecture, flying motorcycles, new laws etc. Getting back to the assassins they specialize in assassinating people delivered to them from a criminal futuristic organization so they can dispose of the body. Soon after we learn that eventually their future selves are sent back to them to erase evidence of what they've done and they are paid a large wage and given 30 years. But when a young man played by the ever so talented Joseph Gordon Levitt runs into his future self he hesitates for a moment and his future self played by Bruce Willis escapes. Thus setting the stage for a barrage of unexpected twists and a surprisingly emotionally resonant storyline. What's great about this film is how unique the feel of it is. It's hard to really describe it but it really feels like something new altogether. Unfortunately the film isn't flawless there are some questionable directorial choices although some great questions are brought up not all of them are answered effectively. There is a load of unnecessary characters that aren't fully developed and the film is a little cheesy in its action sequences. It is most successful in it's smaller moments like the one in which the two versions share a conversation over breakfast, a soft love story is explored as well as the relationship between a mother and her child. Levitt is solid in the lead and Emily Blunt is an unexpected surprise delivering a character i never though she would take on. Bruce Willis is less successful as the older version of Joe and the usually likable Piper Perabo is given so little to do besides an awkward topless scene it makes you wonder why she signed on for it. Still all in all the film is pretty solid and most of all it just feels really fresh a blessing in a cinematic market saturated with countless remakes and sequels. It may not be perfect but there is more than enough here to merit a more than solid recommendation.Plus the whole tk subplot although hammy had some really cool culminations. Good stuff. 3.5/5",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

House of cards,"I really had a hard time getting through the first half of this movie. I tried to tell my brain not to think, but I just couldn't go ""dumb enough"". I almost felt like having to bite down on a stick it was so painful.I mean the movie goes against everything we know about the laws of time and physics. Which in itself wouldn't be a problem (who can tell if what science knows now is completely right?) The problem is that even with the rewriting of the laws of time they still couldn't create a plot that would hold true.But the biggest mistake they made is that they only tell you at about 45 minutes in that you have to forget everything about time and space to get your head around this movie. Had I known that I might have had less difficulty getting through the beginning.If you as a movie writer dare rewrite the laws of nature, you'd better make damn sure that your story is plausible in your fictional universe.Sadly that is not the case here. There are so many huge plot holes I lost count. The only reason I'm not going to write any examples is because they would contain spoilers.But after getting through the first hour of the movie it starts to become fairly enjoyable even though the ending again contradicts their own theory.

A frustratingly good ride,"A frustratingly good ride, it could've been an exceptionally good film. So much of this sci-fi, time travel film is excellent. The performances, the styling, the concept are all really very good.

The fact that it takes so long to get to that part of the story is one of it's main faults. The film's set up is intriguing and stylish and interesting, it just drops the pace and interest a little too much in the 2nd third and throughout the film there is a completely unnecessary sub-plot involving an inept baddie that just highlights what a fantastic film it could've been, had his character and story been reduced or removed all together.Still a great ride and good film though, it just could've been a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Cool story and great acting but had too much unnecessary stuff.,"Honestly, the ending was what had the most impact for me. The build- up took too long and I felt that half the movie was spent by characters murmuring between each other. It didn't help that my friends were loud, but I couldn't hear the dialogue for quite a lot of the film — and the TV volume was at 100%. But the thing is even when I didn't hear what was said, I still understood what was going on, which goes to show that they had a lot of unnecessary dialogue that just slowed the pace of the movie down.Another thing that I feel was unnecessary was the blood. The action scenes were pretty good but some were overkill (and unrealistic) with unnecessary blood spraying.Apart from that, the story and plots were pretty cool. The acting as well was great, Pierce Gagnon gave me the chills. Joseph Gordon- Levitt was great as always, though it was a bit unnerving to see his face altered to look like a younger Bruce Willis. Willis' acting was pretty average, I wasn't very focused on him.Overall the film was good but could have been much better if they cut a lot of the dialogue and maybe added some more futuristic gadgets and stuff.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Not ""this year's Matrix"" and thankfully doesn't fry your brain like an egg","Wow. Just come away from the cinema and my mind is buzzing with this film. Not so much my brain is 'fried like an egg' but my mind has been taken out for a 10K run and told to do fifty press-ups. This film is an exercise in intelligence, clever script, direction and plot. It was billed at ""this year's Matrix,"" but this is not the case. However, I don't see this as a bad thing as to me the Matrix was all about the SFX, shock and awe; remember the first time you saw it? Or Terminator 2? The SFX blew you away. Here it's the plot, the characters, the writing and the direction which is foremost. More on a par with Inception (another Gordon-Levitt film, notice). The Director Rian Johnson pulled all the strings of a great movie together without resorting to the whole film being obviously CGI - SFX were subtle so the movement of the characters, the realism of the action rang truer. The long shots of the futuristic city were clearly CGI but that was fine, most of the ""real"" action seemed not to be. It was good. Not detracting anything from Johnson (who also wrote the film) but it had Philip K Dick overtones for me, and a bit of Harry Bates.Jeff Daniels was lovely as ever, Bruce Willis didn't play Bruce Willis so much and I really enjoyed him in this. There was one time I expected him to say Yippee Kay-ay but he didn't. More power to him. He played with a lot of emotion in this and you did root for him. Probably one of the best things I've seen him in. Gordon-Levitt should get props for doing such an amazing impression of Willis - it's like he's channeling him! The prosthesis/make up to make him look more like Willis (or some CGI?) is quite disturbing but effective and incredibly well done. Emily Blunt was feisty, convincing, and jolly good in this rather physical role - really great. But the star of the piece and special mention needs to be made for child-actor (soon to be super star I predict) Pierce Gagnon. Never seen him before but even Dakota Fanning would get a run for her money with this little thespian - and not a precocious, child ""actor"" sign or fakery in sight; you'd have thought he was doing all this for real. He was superb. Worth seeing the film just for him, and I'll never look at a child having a tantrum quite the same again! Wonderfully, Hollywood didn't get a look in at the end - was there a cliff hanger, wasn't there? Who knows. Brilliant. In short an incredible-watching, engrossing and exciting film. Tender, humorous, nerve-wracking, exciting, shocking and clever in equal parts.To sum up, Bruce Willis not playing Bruce Willis, Gordon-Levitt playing Bruce Willis and a young kid acting the pants of everybody!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"a smart idea, but not well executed!","Rian Johnson's third feature, the second one stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the leading role, after his career debut detective-noir BRICK (2005, 6/10), however his second film THE BROTHERS BLOOM (2008, 6/10) has lost its traction with both the audience and the critics, in spite of a scale-up budget and cast.I saw this film in the local multiplex, and my expectation had been drastically kindled thanks to its great reviews in its domestic reign (especially after a season mainly consists of summer leftovers and studio's substandard cranked-outs), although I'm no big fan of Rian's past work, and consider him as the next Christopher Nolan might spoil him through excessive enthusiasm (also, to juxtapose this time-travel vehicle with the monolithically staggering INCEPTION, 2010, 9/10 is not such a grounded idea at all).The milieu of a dystopian future with a darker and more desolate vantage view is not a novel gambit it the Sci-Fi genre, the film also is wanting the budget to exhibit its ambitious future world, basically the film hinges on a quite groundbreaking caveat, the requisite existence of ""the loopers"", which is a somewhat moot point (it's rather difficult to be convinced the future criminals will make such a big fuss to illegally dispose the dead bodies with the omnipotent time machine, which triggers another more pertinent point, why not kill first, transfer later?), so all of these unsolved questions have kind of deglamorized the film per se.But honestly speaking, if one can drop the feeble premise, the film is potently entertaining, especially in the latter part, when all the Sci-Fi stunts turns into a supernatural thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has slowly but firmly established his own fan base and although almost ruined by the ridiculous make-up (I don't buy the resemblance of him and Bruce Willis no matter what 30 years could alter a person), all he needs is a meaty role to send him into the upper stratum as like Christian Bale or Joaquin Phoenix. Emily Blunt gives an impressively gritty performance with her southern American accent (for me it's rather disparate from her usual comfort zone, but I am no American, so I don't have the say whether it is accurate or not), a hard-bitten motherhood is always a rite-of-passage for young actresses when they (infinitely) reach 30. Paul Dano is technically wasted in the film, so are Rian's old buddies Jeff Daniels, Noah Segan is too goofy to be taken seriously. An unexpected discovery is the young boy Pierce Gagnon, a big bravo for him to nail the most demanding work in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

But this time I must admit that Looper, almost hit the spot. One thing I really don't like in this movie is not well balanced pace...after pretty fast introduction and even faster plot, we are dropped in very slow and inconclusive scenes in the house at corn field, after what we experience culmination of slow and fast picture stream scenes, that's very confusing.

One of the Best Time Travel Thriller Dramas,"30 September 2012. Its hard not to find similarities between this movie and Bruce Willis' previous time travel cult classic, 12 Monkeys (1995) or even if one thinks of The Terminator (1984). There's really no fascinating character like Brad Pitt's Jeffery Goines as in 12 Monkey's, so that acting even though its solid isn't so much the focus as the direction by Rian Johnson who presents the audience with both a cerebral, action, family drama fusion genre. The director goes out of his way to use extended shots with scenes that seem to go on for minutes in order to impregnate them with emotional resonance. And the futuristic set design while perhaps a little heavy handed in the beginning and not too original at first, quickly transforms into its own future vision that nicely captures a vibrant yet understated backdrop to the rest of the movie. And then there is the not so quite brashness of a low self-esteemed looper hotshot who seems to had an obsession to prove himself, that isn't quit in sync with the rest of the movie and perhaps the most unnecessarily used and weakest character.What makes this time travel movie stand out is the intense emotional connections that both the older Joe (played by Bruce Willis) experiences in the future and the younger Joe (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experiences in this movie and the difficult universal themes that each character must face. This is not a two-dimensional movie and the director seems to go to great lengths to establish a backstory and character with conflicting feelings (even the brash looper hotshot). There are emotional elements of The Butterfly Effect (2004) along with even the haunting emotional twist as in The Time Machine (1960) or The Final Countdown (1980) as well as a more graphic action elements than Time After Time (1979) or Time Cop (1994). In some ways, the ending has the same emotional impact as Idaho Transfer (1973) starring Peter Fonda.Overall, this movie is an elevated layered sci fi movie with a conscience that portrays universal themes that offer no real clear cut answers between personal dreams and personal sacrifice, something each of us must discover our own answers in our own way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Very bad movie. please give it a miss,The worst movie I've ever seen...And definitely not a action and certainly not a thriller....The plot is very weak. Not worth wasting your money on watching this movie. In my opinion burn the negative of this movie. Awful Movie.A real disappointment. And the concept of time travel was badly conceived. This movie is more of a romantic movie than the story of a man facing his future self. Didn't expect this from Bruce Willis. And the telekinesis thing was bullsh*t. And the movie moves pretty slow. I mean it takes about 30 mins to reveal what the plot is all about. And the worst thing is the lack of action. There is non hand to hand combat which was really disappointing. And there is just a 2 minute scene of Willis shooting people which ended as soon as it started. All in all the movie is so bad that you'd rather sleep at home all day.

Time travelling film that never loses the plot.,"I'm sure if I'd been paying more attention I would have heard more about Looper before this week but I haven't and I didn't so when I checked out a couple of reviews mid-week it literally was the first I'd heard about Rian Johnson's latest film. With unison all the reviews I read said it was a good film, most saying excellent and one or two saying good but confusing. I normally leave it a week before going to the cinema to watch a new film to give the screens a chance to calm down but with universally strong reviews I made an exception and I'm seriously glad I did.I'm not going to go into the premise of the film too much, you can get that elsewhere, I just want to highlight how tight and well written the film is and definitely not confusing for anyone that enjoys sci-fi. I liked Johnson's first film of note, Brick (also with Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but to pull off such a feat with a time travelling themed movie, is something Johnson deserves the utmost credit for. Time travelling plots can get confusing fast but Looper works, borrowing from Terminator but still with more than enough for the film to stand on its own merit.I do get a feel of Nolan about Johnson's work but that's not to take anything away from him at all. People who are at the top of their game are bound to have some similarities between them. The balance between thoughtfulness, depth of character, attention to detail and action is almost perfect and the last film I saw that managed this four way brilliance was in my opinion, The Dark Knight.Willis is Willis, Gordon-Levitt does an excellent job of being Willis, Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels are also good and a special mention goes to Pierce Gagnon who plays creepy kid so well.In a year of quite a few highly anticipated, big hitting, action sci-fi movie releases, Looper is the best so far, hands down.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A film where all the men are bad,The main characters are all assassins and deeply unpleasant so who cares if they live or die. Apparently nobody noticed that when it came out and not many now. Not a promising idea. It's put together in a way that is supposed to make it look clever but basically it's about evil people who kill other people and then try to avoid getting killed when their time comes. Van Damme did it better.At one point it turns into a revenge movie because the assassin has a soft spot for his wife and sets about killing 3 children as part of his plan but he feels sorry about it. Poor thing. Ridiculous. Meanwhile his younger self inexplicably develops a soft spot for the evil child who will make the world a worse place.When it turns into the hunter and the hunted it could be any similar movie. Same stuff. Entirely conventional Hollywood plot but with some sci fi twists.The anti-hero does a a far far better thing that he has ever done as redemption.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
In and Out of the Loop,"This film is recommended.The fundamental things apply as time goes by and by and by in the intriguing futuristic sci-fi fantasy known as Looper. It has strong special effects, a well-constructed script, and a cast of actors who spring into action whenever needed. The film doesn't always stay on course, but it usually piques one's interest with its intelligent screenplay.The year is 2074, but we almost immediately loop back to the past, circa 2044. That year is the drop-off point of human recycling as the mob uses their hit-men to take out its human garbage, leaving no evidence of any murders in their present day dimension. This is time- travel with an evil twist as we meet one of a group of specialized assassins known as loopers: Joe ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) is ready to dispatch another transported victim. The body count of his victims grows as does his reputation and his wages. One slight glitch in the life of any looper: The job has a short shelf life, and every looper will automatically be forced into retirement. There will be a day in their future where the looper will be hired to execute himself, that is, an older prototype of himself. And that day eventually arrives when Joe discovers his designated target is a 30 year older version of himself ( Bruce Willis ). To kill or not to kill? The cat and mouse chase begins.Director / writer Rian Johnson takes his clever premise and keeps his mind games in motion throughout most of his film until he begins to introduce some sub-plots and characters that become close reminders of other sci-fi predecessors, particularly the plot line to The Terminator mixed with an old Twilight Zone episode starring a young Billy Mumy. Until that point, the film is a fresh and original diversion. At the midway point, it begins to lose some of its energy.Still, the lead actors have enough chemistry between them to fully engage the movie-going audience with enough action and thought-provoking situations, even if the film, begins to lose interest in their initial relationship taking them on separate paths to solve their dilemmas and adding some unnecessary complications in the process.It is the actors' relationship that makes Looper more fascinating than it really is. In fact, Gordon-Levitt wears some prosthetic make-up throughout the film to resemble some of Willis' physical traits. The actor also imitates some of his quirks and line delivery to try to make a direct connection to his older character. It's an interesting concept and works most of the time. ( The make-up, however, does not always succeed and, in some scenes, becomes a distraction, with Gordon-Levitt not even resembling the character he is playing. His facial appearance seems overworked and unintentionally disconcerting in a few key scenes, but even then, the make-up, at least, looks real. ) Willis plays on his strength as the sage action hero with very few words to impart, but he handles his guns well. His quieter scenes actually show off his range as one of our more underrated actors.Both Emily Blunt who plays Sara, a tough survivor type with a temperamental tyke at her side and Jeff Daniels as Abe, a notorious mob boss who enjoys his menace and his power, give ample support and use their acting skills to breathe some depth into their stereotypical roles of good and evil.So Looper is a relatively entertaining movie that tries to deal with larger issues like changing one's own destiny or the effect of time continuum relationships, but ultimately, Looper seems more comfortable just being a solid action flix, sacrificing its sci-fi origins in exchange for shoot-em-up thrills, leaving the film's more absorbing prospects lost somewhere in time.

Looper - Brilliantly Original,"Thankfully there are enough intelligent people to outweigh all of the idiots on here. IMDb used to be the place for cinephiles but that's changed over the last few years. Regardless don't all of the idiots stop you from seeing this film. I will forewarn you that it is a bit more challenging to follow and will make you think. So you're simply looking for a good action shoot em up it may not satisfy you. If you're looking for a sci-fi film on par with movies like Blade Runner get in line. Personally I'm a huge film of Rian Johnson. He pulls no punches. His stories are incredibly well written with a high attention to detail. And this movie is his best to date. Joseph Gordon Levitt is his usual brilliant self in here. Bruce Willis does well and finally isn't ""dying hard"". I think one thread said it best if you focus on the time travel you miss the point.Ultimately this film is about presenting a complicated moral dilemma within an action/sci-fi context. The protagonist has decide to go from selfish to selfless. A change that doesn't happen easily or quickly. And it makes you question how far would you go to preserve your own happiness. Would you kill anyone, even children? It explores people's desire to do absolutely anything to preserve their own life purely out of selfish desire of self preservation. The film definitely challenges the viewer several times as to what is right or wrong and at what point those things intersect or change places.The moral dilemma aside the sci-fi portions are excellent. I like that the film is anchored and believable as a not too distant future. Aside from time travel everything is rather believable. Watch closely to see that all vehicles have been converted to electric or alternative fuel cars with these big black ugly conversion kits on all the older cars. A brilliant touch of detail and very realistic since if that is the direction all cars go to chances are old vehicles will continue to exist but will need converted. There are also solar panels roughly attached to many vehicles. Aside from that the vaguely dystopian look of the world but not overly futuristic look is made so well and so believably.Lastly as an action film it's great. Nothing gratuitous. Good characters, good action scenes, believable action, no one leaping buildings, etc.A lot of people just don't get how brilliant this film is. Thankfully the critics do, hence why they're critics and a majority of the idiots on here are not. Even people in the theater behind us said, ""Really?"" and ""That was lame."" Which is staggering. This is definitely more of a moral dilemma film with a strong sci-fi and action element. If you want pure action go see some crappy Die Hard film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Excellent: 9.5,"Too often now, science fiction means a futuristic setting populated by millions of computer-generated pixels, with storytelling taking second fiddle to visuals. Rian Johnson, however, knows how to tell a story, and this shows in every second of his newest flick, Looper, a smart, time-traveling action film that embraces the inherent impossibilities of time travel and uses them to tell a surprisingly compelling tale This film is something else. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Joe, a hit man for the 2070s mob who kills his victims by ambushing them after they travel backwards thirty years in time to 2044. Of course, this all changes when his future self (Bruce Willis) arrives from the future, looking for the infant version of a future tyrant called the Rainmaker. More than this, I will not reveal, as the way the story and dialogue unfold deserve to be left unspoiled for any potential viewer. A very cool dilemma, though, is explored in the event in the film of ""closing the loop."" If Old Joe came back from the future, doesn't that mean that he's already experienced these events? Never mind. As he says in a restaurant, ""I don't want to talk about time travel. We'd be here for hours drawing diagrams with straws."" And that they would. But somehow, the screenplay almost manages to avoid the idea of time paradoxes altogether, but remains complex enough to allow viewers to figure out the story as it goes along. Very few films can keep you guessing the whole way through, but Looper pulls it off effortlessly. Unfortunately, there's really not too much to say about this film without going into the story, but it is filled with colorful characters, high-octane action, and one of the smartest sci-fi scripts ever written. If you're a fan of smart science fiction, you owe it to yourself to see this film. There's really not much like it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Because the future is a place where they invented time travel, but made it illegal. Also, the future is a place where it is almost impossible to dispose of a body – although when we see it done, it does not seem such a big deal Anyway, given this bizarre premises we are also explained that loopers are so called because after an indeterminate number of years in the profession, they must close the loop by killing their older self, shipped back from 30 years in the future.At this stage, whatever effort one made to suspend disbelief comes crashing down. Since they already know that in 30 years they will be executed (by themselves), why these loopers do not try to eliminate the mob king who is systematically ordering their executions? Why do they accept passively to be shipped back to the past with a sack over their head? If this is a serious logical flaw (and there are many others, pointed out by several reviewers), worse is to come, in the shape of a TK obnoxious child, who derails completely the script into an additional dimension of implausibility.So far we were dealing with ruthless criminals who have no problem shooting, torturing and burning bodies, but suddenly women and children are off-limits. This ""honour among thieves"" is a well-beloved cliché in mainstream movies, but it is an absurd illusion. In real life, cold-blooded killers kill anybody - women and children included - because they are unsympathetic to all human beings, not just to other adult males. Selective lack of empathy is absurd – and so is this movie. Finally, we have the delusional notion that ""love can cure anything"". Unfortunately, there are no reported cases of paranoid-schizophrenic cured by mummy's love....One cannot expect much logic in a movie about time travel, but even low expectations are too high for this mess. The only partial saving grace is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays convincingly a despicable character.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Johnson's best movie,"A little obsessed with violence and execution, but still a challenging and thoughtful plot full of characters that you can't forget. One of Bruce Willis's best since 12 Monkeys.

Best sci-fi film of 2012,"Over the years there have been many 'high-concept' sci-fi films to hit our screens, some brilliant but many mediocre. Looper fits the former category, and will in the years to come sit along the likes of The Matrix and Inception.Essentially, the film concerns a titular 'looper' named Joe, whose job is to execute people sent back from the future by criminal organisations. One day, Joe witnesses his future self being sent back, who escapes. In order to protect his life from his employers, Joe must hunt down and kill his former self, who has big plans of his own.Looper has the huge potential to turn into just another shoot-em-up action flick, but luckily the action isn't the primary focus, though when it is present, it is executed well. The film utilises interesting cinematography techniques to give its action scenes a distinct art-house feel, and doesn't go over the top in this sense.Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been repeatedly proving himself as a formidable actor who is willing to tackle difficult roles. Though I wasn't entirely convinced by his makeup, he was flawlessly able to manipulate Bruce Willis' voice and mannerisms. The character Joe himself is likable, with his younger self being motivated by money yet not lacking his humanity. Alternatively, Bruce Willis' performance is reminiscent of his previous portrayal in 12 Monkeys, a similar time-travel film, with his Old Joe being a man tormented by the past and desperate to change it in order to affect the future.It was also interesting seeing Emily Blunt in a role unique to her previous performances, this time as an independent farmer who is haunted by her past treatment of her young son. Here parallels can be drawn between her and Old Joe, both of the individuals being defined and motivated by the past.As with any decent sci-fi films, there are multiple twists and turns in regards to the plot, and this enhances the audience's experience, with the film actually requiring its audience to think as opposed to sitting back and absorbing the action. The concept of time-travel assassinations is interesting enough, though other plot devices such as telekinesis and themes such as redemption are made present, once again enhancing the experience.If I had one complaint, it would be the execution of the conclusion, rather than the conclusion of the plot itself, which I thought was excellent. I'm trying to not reveal too much here, but although the final twist or plot device is delivered brilliantly, the film finishes abruptly after.Through its interesting cinematography techniques and equally thought-provoking concept and plot line, Looper reveals itself as a much welcome addition to the science fiction film genre. Rian Johnson's direction and script, coupled with brilliant performances from the three main leads places the film at the top of this year's sci-fi films, if not the top of this year's films in general.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Super Looper,"One has to applaud Joseph Gordon-Levitt's success in shedding off his goofy character from the 90s hit show, 3rd Rock from the Sun and transforming himself in to a viable A-lister! By placing himself amidst established stars in high profile films such as Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, Levitt forced audiences to take note. Simultaneously he picked movies like 50/50 and 500 days of summer which highlighted his range and ability.In Looper, Levitt continues with the same formula as he stands with icon, Bruce Willis while playing a bounty hunter of sorts in this time travelling Sci-Fi Thriller. Willis leaves his mark with his performance while Levitt continues to deliver and shape a blossoming career. Emily Blunt rounds out the cast and compliments her co-stars well.Director and writer Rian Johnson brings an entertaining feature which cleverly unravels keeping the audience glued all the way till the credits roll. Looper is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"This is a good movie, not a great movie","Luckily, I managed to get into the cinemas for Looper before the run ended. A month since it released, and it still seems to be going strong. That privilege is reserved not for the big movies, but the big movies. And, ever since it got onto the radar, Rian Johnson's thriller was always referred to as one of those big movies. So I finally got my tickets and took my seat, and prepared for the big movie.By now, you've probably seen the movie and know what it's about. But if you don't, Looper is a time-travel thriller set in the not-so-distant future. In this present, hit men – known as loopers – assassinate men who have been transported back from the future by underworld gangsters. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of those loopers, but everything starts to go wrong when his next hit is himself (Bruce Willis).The plot is absolutely brilliant, it really is. Original, inventive, and provides so much scope for some amazing storytelling. Add to that a stellar cast, which also includes Jeff Daniels and Emma Blunt, and you've got a recipe for success. All the publicity about Looper seemed to suggest that this was going to be this generation's The Matrix.So it really annoys me that I was so disappointed. I wanted to love this movie, I wanted to be blown away the way I was when I watched Inception for the first time. Perhaps it was my fault for placing too much faith in it but, whatever it was, the movie disappointed me.I think that the movie just did not live up to the potential that amazing concept could offer. The idea of a man needing to kill his own future self is extremely exciting, but the novelty wore off very quickly. That's partly due to the fact that, like we see so often nowadays, Bruce Willis just wasn't that great. For the film to work, both Levitt and Willis needed to deliver, and the veteran messed up. As a result, I ended up not believing in what he was trying to do.Levitt, on the other hand, is really good. He's fast becoming one of my favourite actors, and he gives another strong performance. A lot was made about his prosthetic face, and rightfully so. His whole complexion is different and, while he doesn't really look like Bruce Willis, he does a decent job of acting like him. Emma Blunt, too, is excellent, and is probably the real emotional heart of the film (even more so than the two men).But it's probably her character that antagonised me the most. She's an integral part of the second half of the movie, where the entire plot is turned on its head. It should have been a brilliant twist; instead, I was left scratching my head a little and wondering what happened to my time travel thriller. The new plot twist plays out very predictably, and ends even more predictably.There is still a lot to like about Looper; it's a great view on what our future could be like, and there are some brilliant performances from the supporting cast (Paul Dano and Garret Dillahunt come to mind). Action scenes, even some of the more emotional scenes, are good. This is still a good movie, don't get me wrong. What disappoints me is that the film takes too many twists and turns, with the badly-executed twists cancelling out the better ones; leaving you with a somewhat anticlimactic end.Rian Johnson is still a director to pay attention to, and Looper is still a watchable movie. Maybe the hype killed it for me. Maybe if I watch it again in a year's time, my opinion will have changed. But for now, I write this as a disappointed film fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"This movie is slick, intense, and well acted. It has an interesting concept, and the basis for a classic future-noir. Instead it has two disjointed story elements, messily pasted together to stretch the movie to the two-hour mark. The initial concept of time travel, and its implications of meeting your future self, are entirely thrown away to stage a series of well crafted, action set pieces, complete with a blaring electronic soundtrack, and lots of shooting. The pace never lets up, the movie is an adrenaline rush from start to finish.But it is also a wasted opportunity. Aside from the distracting CGI involved in morphing our lead actors' faces together, the movie looks great, a combination of film noir and western designs spruce up the speculative future. The production design, including costumes recalls Blade Runner.The story is a messy pasting of confusing plot elements all thrown in to make you forget how ultimately pointless this exercise was. And when it degenerates into an action chase filled with throbbing music flashing guns, all is lost.Half an hour too long, unfocused, and in the end nothing more than an action movie that dreams of being Inception. A wasted disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
RaTKiN's Movie Rants: LOOPER,"""I don't want to talk about time travel, because if we start talking about it then we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws."" - Old Joe (Bruce Willis) -In 2044, time travel has not yet been invented. But thirty years from then, it will have been. However, time travel will be outlawed right away. Only crime syndicates will actually use the technology for a very specific purpose. It will be absolutely impossible to kill anyone in 2074 due to advanced tracking/tagging technology, so they'll instead send their victims thirty years into the past for them to be killed on the spot in 2044 by the titular ""loopers"". These are people in 2044 that are aware of this mind-boggling scheme, and are hired as assassins by the syndicates in 2074. Sh*t starts hitting the fan when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sees his older self (Bruce Willis) being spawned in front of him and fails to kill him...You probably already knew this movie involves time travel, even mimicking some elements seen in The Terminator at a certain point, but as Bruce Willis' and Jeff Daniels' characters so aptly mention, it doesn't want to linger on the specifics of it (and I will follow the movie's example in this review). It also doesn't try to overly explore its futuristic setting. The world is depicted as a dystopian high-tech/low-life place, without focusing too much on it.All this means the movie offers no foolproof explanation for its own time travel logic, and you WILL be left with a lot of questions and theories that might just fry your brain. Writer-director Rian Johnson instead asks his viewers to bear with its logic, just like he did in a way with his quirky high school film noir Brick(2005). Your enjoyment of Looper will depend heavily on your willingness to do so.On the other hand, this approach prevents the movie from being riddled with too much physics lingo and actually frees up screen time for plot and character development. This was clearly a thoughtful and deliberate choice by Rian Johnson, for which I sincerely wish to applaud him. In short, the ideas about time travel do form the premise of the film, but they are NOT what Looper is about. Instead, they are used as a tool in order to raise some interesting questions in regard to the main character Joe and the (differing) choices his younger and older self make. Old Joe will have experienced certain life-altering and character-changing events, while young Joe is obviously unaware of them or has no emotional connection to them. In this sense, the movie is a time-spanning character study of two film noir anti-heroes who are basically the same and yet simultaneously very different.In other words, when Looper's end credits roll you will realize the story has gone in a completely different direction than the one it started out with. (I really can't go any deeper into this, as it would spoil a lot of the surprise for you.) In fact, the plot swings out into all kinds of unpredictable directions throughout the entire movie. This unwillingness to provide some form of ""easy"" narrative grip to the audience might make some very nervous indeed. Others will revel in its unpredictability and be mesmerized by its many surprising shifts. Again, your willingness to go with the flow will be decisive for your enjoyment of the film.Stylistically, Looper had more of a neo-noir than a futuristic cyberpunk vibe to it, at least that's how I experienced it. It's beautifully shot and for most of the time doesn't intend to distract from the film's content. It's certainly no case of style over substance. The movie's pacing is also more akin to a typical film noir, than to an action-packed science fiction blockbuster. There is certainly some great action, but it is used rather sparsely and only when it matters most.The acting was very good overall and remains credible and convincing throughout. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is made to look like a younger version of Bruce Willis through the use of make-up prosthetics, expertly crafted by Kazuhiro Tsuji. It is never ever apparent Joseph is wearing any. It seems like the character is played by an actor we haven't seen before, but kind of looks like both Joseph and Bruce. It's never ridiculous and it never distracts. Joseph even manages to give his character a certain Bruce Willis vibe, which is then (almost uncannily) mirrored by The Bruce himself. It's a great duo of characters that don't seem to know how to behave to one another. Emily Blunt portrays a likable supporting character, convincingly shifting between ""I'ma whoop yo ass if you don't behave!"" to a sweet young mother acting out of a sense of responsibility and love.However, one character literally made me smile from ear to ear at times because of his performance. Pierce Gagnon, who plays the absolutely intriguing and intelligent Cid, has to be one of the best child-actors I have ever witnessed on screen. He does so well, it actually sometimes feels as if his character is an adult trapped in an 8 year old's body. Whenever he stares into someone's eyes, you would swear he can pierce their soul and read their inner thoughts. I won't spoil anything, but know this reviewer got goosebumps several times because of the way this character is written AND performed. Really stunning stuff!It's an original and refreshing movie with a premise that will make you think, and then without constantly shoving all sorts of (meta)physical mumbo-jumbo down your throat, but instead focusing on character, will lead into an ending that will make you feel. If you are willing to take its internal logic on time travel for granted, you will probably enjoy Looper.8/10 !",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"A decent sci-fi thriller, but not so special","Well, at least I am puzzled why this movie has earned so much worldwide and why even critics have praised it to the skies... Of course, the actors are known and good (starting with Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Emily Blunt; although the most brilliant performances were Pierce Gagnon as Cid and Paul Dano as Seth), but the topics of time traveling, telekinesis and loyalty and greed among hit men have been exploited widely before. The pace is also uneven, at times too fast, then too slow (especially in the country house) and full of reasoning on human and past issues.Thus, Looper is okay for killing 1h 45 minutes, but do not expect a state-of-the-art or conceptional experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Something original,"""Looper"" looked like an exciting film too me. There's time travelling (Love a bit off that when its done right) Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-levitt, Emily Blunt. What's not too like? The answer. Not much.Don't go expecting a lot off action because Bruce Willis is in this though. This is truly Joseph Gordon-levitt's Show, and he once again proves himself too be a tremendous actor. When I first heard he'd be playing a young Willis I thought this just wouldn't work. But he pulls it off. Through his facial expressions and make up you do believe him too be a young Bruce Willis. He nails some off Willis' mannerisms in a way that was sometimes even funny too me.Gordon-levitt's performance is not the best part off ""Looper"" though. That would be its story. ""Loopers"" out-there plot is original, intriguing and almost ingenious. I was wanting too see it all the way through too the end, and (Unlike most movies) had no idea what was coming next. I don't know if ""Looper"" is everyone's cup of tea. Some might find it a bit bla bla bla, and it starts getting a bit too silly toward the end.

closing your loop,"Riian Johnson's Looper is 2012's most original sci-fi film that boasts strong performances, old-school action, a distinctive style and a compelling story. It's certainly refreshing to find a movie that subverts our expectation, especially in the realm of sci-fi, a genre that can so easily flounder.The year is 2079, time travel hasn't yet been invented but in the near future it will be, becoming highly illegal and only used by the mob, who send men from the future to be killed in the past by Loopers. In order for the mob to receive no loose ends, Loopers are tasked with eliminating their future selves, without question. This is where we are presented with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Joe, who fails to kill Bruce Willis, Joe from the future. Time-travel is put to the side to present a character piece between the dualities of this personage. Instead of lamenting on the intricacies on the frustrating concept of time-travel, Riian Johnson offers a brilliant script serving as both a Neo-noir and a classic western narrative, hiding behind the mask of sci-fi. Both Willis and Gordon-Levitt bring fantastic performances, especially on Gordon-Levitt's part, who so uncannily impersonates Willis that the prosthetic nose was ridiculously unnecessary. They are supported by an equally fantastic Emily Blunt, portraying both the strong and vulnerable side of a mother not in control of her son (that kid is going places) and a scene-stealing Jeff Daniels.Riian Johnson has crafted a wildly creative, utterly original and bold film with Looper, despite a few shortcomings with the time-travel concept, establishing himself as a director to be sought after.

Looper Review by Heavy Metal Mouth,"Looper is the third release from director Rian Johnson, known to audiences previously as the man behind Brick (in which he first collaborated with Joseph Gordon Levitt) and The Brothers Bloom. Both of Johnson's previous films had warm receptions, but Looper comes on the back of particular hype in the film world, the reasons for this likely being the general acclaim Looper has received following advance screenings, Levitt's recently increased status following The Dark Knight Rises and also the fact that Summer 2012 noticeably failed to produce a standout Science Fiction thriller- or at least one that audiences could agree on, with movies like Prometheus receiving mixed reviews and Totall Recall falling flat on it's face. So the timing of Looper seems excellent, but does it live up to the anticipation?Well, fortunately the hype is very much to believed as Looper is without a doubt the best sci-fi film of the year and a real treat for fans of the genre. The story follows Gordon Levitt as Joe Simmons, an assassin or 'looper' who is paid by criminal organisations from the future to murder and dispose of bodies. This is all made possible by the invention of time travel in 2074, and so victims are sent thirty years into the past where they are taken out by loopers such as Joe. When Joe is confronted by his future self (Bruce Willis), he fails to prevent him from escaping. Old Joe is hellbent on destroying the loop and keeping himself in the present, and attempts to warn Young Joe of a destructive leader in 2074 who rules the city, but Young Joe is only concerned with killing his future self, as failure to do so will result in death by his current employers who are hunting Joe as he chases his older form.While this may sound like a lot to take in, the film is relatively straight-forward and will not pose any problems for audiences who are in fear of getting lost in the plot. In fact, Johnson chooses to focus more on emotional depth and character development over a complicated plot structure, in contrast to recent sci-fi classics, and Looper benefits hugely from this. Old Joe has cleaned up his act and is desperate to explain to Young Joe that he is deeply in love with his future wife, and while at first Young Joe refuses to comprehend this idea, hi mind is soon changed following his encounter with lonely wife Sara (Emily Blut) and her troubled, yet strangely gifted son Cid (Pierce Gagnon), as he hides out at their barn while attempting to escape the mob.The romantic angle of the story is unusual for this type of film, and yet it works perfectly, tying in well with the pace of the 118 minute running time, and it never feels as though it is interrupting the overall plot. There are also some fun comedic moments which help to lighten the tone, but make no mistake, this is an action film and there are plenty of explosive scenes to take from this that ensure it stands up to comparisons to films such as The Matrix and Inception. Another huge strength that Looper boasts is in it's excellent casting, and while the leading duo of Gordon Levitt and Willis are their reliable selves, the standout performance of the film is Pierce Gagnon as a young, confused child, who possesses powers he does not understand and cannot control. Gagnon effortlessly steals every scene he is in with an exceptionally creepy performance that will be remembered for years to come.In conclusion, Looper delivers on it's promise with it's intelligent, thought-provoking script and stylish direction. The comparisons have been justified; Looper is a stone cold sci-fi classic and demands to be seen. A serious contender for film of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Fun, but there wasn't enough thought put into its premise","The third film from the director of Brick and The Brothers Bloom. This is Johnson's first big Hollywood film, and I had a hope he would make a revolutionary science-fiction picture that would blow every summer blockbuster out of the water. Alas, that's not how it's gone down, but Looper is certainly a fun sci-fi thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a mob hit-man known as a Looper, whose job it is to whack victims sent back from 30 years in the future (why this has to be done is hastily and unsatisfactorily explained by JGL in voice-over). Every looper knows that one day he will have to kill the future version of himself, for which deed he will be compensated enough to live comfortably for the rest of his life. When it's JGL's turn, though, his future self, played by Bruce Willis, gets the better of him and escapes, and the mob is after them both. Time travel is one of the hardest science-fiction concepts to deal with, but there are just a handful of great time travel stories. I don't think this is one of them. For as smart as Johnson came off with Brick and The Brothers Bloom, the time travel premise seems like it should be far smarter. But whenever they try to explain the concept, the characters always say something like ""it's cloudy"" or ""it's hazy."" Johnson's superior visual sense isn't much present here, either. It's a well directed film, for sure, but it's nothing amazing. With all of my complaints, I will say, even if I was disappointed, I was entertained. It's a fun picture. I just wish it weren't directed by Rian Johnson. Acting honors go to Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels. Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis are both fine, though I did think that JGL was a little busy trying to impersonate Willis.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"A Violent, Smart, Sometimes Funny Time Travel Tale","Looper was one of my most anticipated movies when I first heard about it. Bruce Willis and Joseph-Gordon Levitt in a time travel movie where they're the same person? Sold! The story is about Joe (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), a looper (who is a hit-man for the mob who send undesirables back in time to get a bullet in the head) who one day has a target that is revealed to be an older version of him played by Bruce Willis. From there on (without going into spoilers)the story involves Telekinesis, romance, and time travel.The acting is top notch with JGL's character Joe being a confident, yet somewhat cold to others that shows a more emotional side of him. Bruce Willis is also great as the older version of Joe showing the same charisma of younger Joe but with a more elder view on life. The supporting characters are also great, notably Paul Dano and Jeff Daniels.The movie is paced very well and has a pretty good script with the dialogue having a somewhat noir feel to it which I love and the time travel aspects are pretty well thought out for the most part. The action is very stylized and sometimes really bloody and brutal but necessary as it takes a toll on the characters (figuratively and literally). However the movie does find some humor with interactions between Joe and older Joe and probably on of the best montages I have ever seen.But with all time travel movies, the plot holes of time travel and it's rules get in the way and sometimes make a simple solution seem impossible. However this is a small thing and the movie is one of the greatest time travel movie made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

"Clever concept, solid script, awesome special effects, fantastic characters","It is rare to find a film so rich in so many qualities. This film is most certainly not your average sci-fi doctor who crap. This is obviously a very well thought through, well written film which a lot of effort has been put into.Despite the time travel idea being highly confusing at times and sometimes does not even fit, it is very well laid out and explained, giving the most normally-confused-by-the-time-travel- stuff viewer an easy way to follow it. One flaw I did notice however is the fact that the the time travel idea does not always consistent, for example when Old Joe tells his younger self that his future is to turn out the same way his own way, despite the fact that Old Joe would have been in a different position to his younger self when he was that age (if that makes sense). This is only due to the fact that the writers had to work around certain things for the end result to be clever and thought provoking.Despite the main theme of the film revolving around time-travel, the main essence of the film comes from the relationship between the certain characters, and how those relationships affect the ongoing ones around them. The strong acting supports these characters and especially a strong performance from a boy who plays a very sinister and almost terrifying child, since you are told who he is to become in the future, and you can picture who he is to be by the strong powers and emotions he possesses.Besides the concept and characters, the main feature of the film you fill pick up on is the stunning visuals and the intense violence.This film is possibly one of the best I have ever seen.

His way of smiling is a little bit more naive than he usually does in other movies and that was just the same smile as that of Joseph.The story itself is so so to me.

Willis is pretty much the same in movies these days so I can't rate his acting. Just chalk it up to Bruce Willis being...Bruce Willis. I'm not a fan of Emily Blunt but she was good here and her accent was flawless. Jeff Daniels was so-so. I felt he had an important role to play in the story but he was just relegated to being a goon, and a pointless goon at that.While there are questions about the plot and the time travel and the idea of a looper in general it's not enough to deter your experience.

Bruce Willis Is The Terminator,"I didn't have high expectations for Looper. I hated the title, for one. The trailer didn't impress me either. But I really like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis and didn't know Jeff Daniels was in it too (and he was fantastic in this even though he wasn't in it much)and considering my mom was let down today because the rest of the family bailed out on going to the Titanic museum, why not take her to a movie? The movie centers on Joe (Levitt) who is a Looper who works for a crime organization where hit men brings their victims to a time machine, send them back in time, and then he would shoot them, incinerate the bodies so there are no traces of them, and then they are wiped clean of anyone ever finding out. That's a pretty cool concept. If one happens to get away, their in big trouble. Well his future self (Willis) gets away and Joe is being hunted down by Daniels and his men.The sequence of events are fascinating. Apparently Willis has a backstory involving his dead wife and feels that if he finds the Rainmaker (who is creating loop holes) and kills him, he can save his wife from dying. So he has to go around and kill these kids that are linked to a number that supposedly means they were born on the same day and in the same hospital. Joe is trying to stop him, or himself, or whatever, and it becomes a pretty deep, involving film.It is a little weird. I'm not a big future movie fanatic as very seldom am I ever won over by futuristic films (see In Time). The stuff involving this kid with super powers was very weird, and some romance scene out of nowhere was pretty weird too.Despite that, the action was good and I enjoyed watching Gordon and Willis play off each other. I don't regret seeing this film but don't find myself rushing to buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray. If you like these actors, see it. It wasn't a boring movie, that's for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but not great","Good, but not great.Very interesting plot, Inception-like in its complexity. However, less than full use is made of the ingenious concepts in the plot and the movie flounders in sentimentality towards the end. Ending is not entirely satisfactory.Solid performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. JG-L's performance is a bit off-putting though, due to the weird facial modifications. The idea was to make him look like a young Bruce Willis, but it doesn't work. If anything, it's like the producers grafted Daniel Craig's face onto JG-L's body.

Looper Review,"Looper(2012) Starring: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, Jeff Daniels, Pierce Gagnon, XU Qing, Tracie Thomas, Frank Brennan, Garret Dillahunt, Nick Gomez, Mark Hester, Jon Eyez, Kevin Sitwell, Thirl Haston, James Landry Hébert, Kenneth Brown Jr., Cody Wood, Adam Boyer, Jeff Chase, Ritchie Montgomery, David Jensen, Kamden Beauchamp, Josh Perry, David Joseph Martinez, Wayne Dehart, Ian Patrick, Craig Johnson, Robert Harvey, and Sylvia Jefferies Written&Directed By: Rian Johnson Review HUNTED BY YOUR FUTURE, HAUNTED BY YOUR PAST Man it's been a long time since I've seen a Bruce Willis action movie, I think. Anyway Looper sounds like a female lead film, now that I think about it, come on you know it does and it would be a comedy. But maybe someday someone make a film of what i'm talking about, where chicks loop their tounges. The actual film is about a Looper(men who are hired by future Mafia to kill men with a bag over their head)who gets the one thing all Looper's dread the Loop cut. Where the Looper is sent their future self to kill. But once he meets his future self(played by Bruce Willis) he's told by Bruce Willis Looper that he's here to kill the rainmaker(the new crime boss from the future cutting off all Looper's.) He meets a woman named by Emily Blunt and from there things start to escalate. When I first saw the trailer in 2012 I thought looked good but I never saw it. Thank goodness because the pacing was kind of actually no not kind of but really freaking awful in the first 30 minutes. But once it starts booming and the plot starts running it's course it becomes a fun and eventful film. Another thing that was hard to get into was character, not that it lacked character development but the only that I could get into was Emily Blunt's character Sarah and her son SID(the future Rainmaker). Especially SID I really wanted to know more about him and maybe about his father. He forms a friendship with the Looper Joe and believes he's there to protect him and his mother. The camera shots in this film are great. When it gets to exciting sequences it can get slow but then start booming in a fast-paced motion which I really enjoyed when it was on. I think that Looper is a great piece of original material taking an old concept such as time-travel and making it something very dramatic again. I'm going to give Looper a four out of five.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

best science fiction thriller since the sixth sense,"without a doubt a great movie, actually one of the best science fiction thrillers i've seen in the last few years. its different(something you grasp in the very first seconds of it), unlike Hollywood movies focuses on the plot(even with a complicated theme like time travel), keeps you on your toes(its a bit long but you don't feel time passes)and with a big twist. the story line is very well presented. both willis and gordon-levitt play very well and so does almost all the actors. the movie is intense, a little bit dark maybe but there is no doll moment,. i strongly recommend. a rare chance to enjoy a movie not ""just like the rest of them""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Bruce Willis is in it - what could possibly go wrong?,"Absolutely not what I expected and all the better for it. All the comparisons with Blade Runner, Star Wars etc make no sense at all. I went in expecting lots of CGI, vehicle chases and so and thankfully I got only a modicum of each. No one whacked me over the head with a set piece that was so loud and filmed so close up and in blur-o-vision that it made no sense whatsoever. No one told me there was a 3D version and I had to see that. No one told me I had to see three and a half prequels to fully understand it.Instead I got a good old-fashioned film with a story, dialogue and not everything explained to me in scene one for fear that I might be an idiot. That is not to say that the story itself, the science or the time travel made any sense whatsoever. You just have to go with it. If you can't buy it then don't bother going. We all think we know how time travel works, paradoxes, altering a tiny bit of the past changing a huge chunk of the future blah, blah, blah. In truth we don't know – half of what we know we've learned from other books and films and the other half is based on our limited understanding of physics. I'm pretty sure the ""science"" in this film is wrong but your guess is as good as mine. I like the approach which says – we really don't know so we'll do it this way and not worry about complex explanations.It's not going to change your life and I really don't believe you'll be remembering this 20 years in the future like you remember the old classics like Blade Runner. (Unless and until the studios find a way travelling back in time and changing your memories of what you saw – they could wipe out all the classics and just leave you thinking their usual product was genius. I digress, but I do have an idea for a screenplay!) It's fun and you'll probably enjoy it unless you are a physics maven or unless your expectation of the ratio of explosions to story have been irretrievably warped by recent films",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Two hours of fun,"An entertaining movie to say the least. It's main asset is it's originality. Time travel is not shown as something to explore the past or future, but as a tool. Very different from others film handling the subject.Also great is the way the future (2044) is depicted. No flying cars, robots and whatnot, but a world similar to ours with a slight dystopian twist.The acting is good but sometimes a bit too stereotypical/over the top for my taste.It may not be a modern masterpiece, but Looper will definitely entertain you for two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
New standard in action movie storytelling,"There are two easy ways to tell whether the movie is good or not. Firstly, you should ask how many times during the showing you have been distracted from the storyline and the action. Good movie, quite obviously, will easily manage to grasp your attention from the start to the very end. Secondly, after watching a good movie one always realizes how crappy the other movies recently watched were.Looper passes both tests so easily, that you start to wonder what other people in the industry are doing at the moment. The storyline is absolutely impeccable in terms of the interest it generates. Tens of questions and unknowns thrown at you every five minutes; action unfolds unbelievably quickly and seemingly spirals out of the control, yet taken under control so beautifully and gracefully that Inception plot will look like an amateur's work. Smart game about one-way time travel paid off, numerous tricks and treats are hidden inside the plot, and the final logical loop closes only with the final frames of the movie.And, as per the second test, the movie does indeed make you wonder why this quality of plot is so rare these days. Go back to other action movies of the season: Spider Man had glossy NY but did not have story line; The Dark Knight was hellishly boring first hour and a half; Bourne lacked turns and felt like unsalted butter; Expendables were second-hand. Looper, as any good movie, raised the standards. It feels embarrassing to talk about other action movies mentioned in light of the new evidence: action movie as a genre is alive and well, and I can only say ""More of that, please"". This kind of excitement about the tightly twisted storyline occurred to me last time only after Inception, yet this is far more superior and smarter. It forces you to try to find answers yourself, rather than sit and wait for them to get delivered.The storyline is not good enough alone, of course – the cast made this film happen. Bruce Willis, by the way, does not make much of the magic this time, he just smiles with his trademark smile and looks with his trademark look, which is of course awesome on its own. But it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who shines. He is absolutely brilliant; he delivers fantastic performance with ease and enjoyment. He manages to eclipse the performance of Bruce Willis, and that says a lot.This movie is a breath of fresh air after the immense mediocrity of recent showings. It plays with you, it challenges, it inspires. There are several action movies to follow this year, but they better learn from Looper as how things should be done. Totally brilliant, easily one of the best movies this year. Must see.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Twist your brain round this,"Set in the mid 21st century, Looper are a group of hit men who kill victims who are sent back from the future. Hired by mobs from the future, the Loopers are run by Abe (Jeff Daniels) who is sent back to look after things in the present (past?). One of these loopers is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who learns that one by one, all the loopers are being sent back to be killed off. Loops are being closed off and if they fail to kill their future selves then a hit is order to kill either the present Looper or the future Looper.As Joe fails to kill his future self (Bruce Willis), his future self tries to change the course of time and the future, while the younger Joe just wants to live out his life and will do so even if it means killing his future self. The plot opens up to show how and why the future Joe wants to eradicate the mysterious crime boss The Rainmaker. He believes that killing him while he is young will allow him to live the life he has lived....you following?What the film does is give you two protagonist and you are never quite sure who to root for. Is it the older self who has learnt from his mistakes or is it the young Joe who is yet to learn from it. As the story unfolds the young Joe comes across one of the three possible targets that could be the potential young Rainmaker and sets out to protect him and his mother (Emily Blunt) from the older Joe. One has knowledge of the future and his own life whilst the other is living in the present doing what he believes to be right. It's a conflict which continues for both Joes' to struggle with as well as for the viewer.A film that does well in creating an emotional response, the main characters provide an interesting emotional arch and has more depth to them than you would normally expect from these types of films. Emily Blunt character and her son gives the film it's change in pace. It starts up fast and frenetic and slows to a more meditative and reflect tone as characters become aware of their destiny and how some things are impossible to change.A sci-fi film with plenty of intelligence, it never relies heavily on special effects or set pieces to provide entertainment. It feels very usual to see how little action is on show and more on the character development side of things. It does borrow from plots of other great sci-fi like the Terminator but it isn't as straight forward as that. It's like having the choice in going back to kill Hitler as a child knowing what he would do but having the strength to kill an innocent young human being with little or no evil in them yet.A complex and interesting film brimming with ideas, with a standout performance from new comer Pierce Gagnon as the potential future crime lord. A kid so young not being out done by established actors on screen. Most may find the make up on young Joe a little distracting but nevertheless it is a passable resemblances to Bruce Willis.A thoroughly entertaining film with a strong and complex narrative which will lead you to think about it for days on end as you try to work out it's convoluted plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Johnson's scenes of action sometimes stumble, but the devilishly smart script turns ""Looper"" into an exciting, dizzying journey.","""Looper"" is the first wide release by writer-director Rian Johnson (""The Brothers Bloom""), an under-the-radar genius who cast Gordon-Levitt in the 2005 cult movie ""Brick."" Returning to favor, the actor performs Joe under an elaborate but almost invisible makeup by Kazuhiro Tsuji, who subtly reshapes his face toward Willis-ness.It's an incomplete impact, but the canny performance of Gordon-Levitt helps, especially when the Joes face off at a dinner (over the same steak and egg plates).The comparatively low-budget ""Looper"" will inevitably make comparisons with the outsize ""Inception"" by Christopher Nolan (also with Gordon-Levitt), but it's a funnier, rougher (and much shorter) film.

Looper-An excellent movie,"I will not go into the synopsis as I am sure there are multiple ones prior to my review, but I will say that the premise is original-criminal organizations run the future world and to get rid of problem persons, they send them back in a newly developed time machine to be killed-and then they never exist-problem solved!! Not quite as occasionally a person will escape, and the ""Loopers"" own neck goes on the line then. I am normally excellent at guessing plots and endings, but this movie kept me going and guessing right up until the last 10 minutes-when I started to have pieces of the plot fall into place, as is intended obviously. The ending with a twist(or several)is superb-will there be a Looper 2?That is the question. All in all, according to the KiwiMIke666sta Movie Guide 2012, I rate it a bloody good movie well worth watching and even owning-and that I ONLY ever do for damn good movies!!! Nice shotgun blasts and not too bad a violence.I am a fan of graphic and extreme everything legal and consensual and heterosexual.I see these reviews are censored even-which is disappointing really, considering that maybe every movie over an M should have to be over a certain age to even use the site, let alone read a review, in my opinion anyway. 666",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Fantastic movie.,"Such a surprising cinematic experience. I was apprehensive before watching because most movies dealing with time travel completely butcher it and make the movie seem more silly than anything. Thankfully, Looper did a very good job with it. They didn't try to explain anything about the science of it, which I was fine with, but I felt that they nailed the concept. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did an amazing job, not only acting but as portraying a young Bruce Willis. Obviously the make-up department deserves credit for the look but JGL mastered all of the mannerisms and the style of talking. Very impressive performance on his behalf. And I love Emily Blunt so her being in the film is a nice bonus, plus it's nice to see her take on a slightly different role from her typical typecast. The only negative in the film, in my opinion, was the telekinesis element. I thought it was a really silly aspect of the film and didn't need to be in there at all. The Rainmaker, could've easily been portrayed to be a genius child, not a borderline superhuman. That's really the only part of the film that was mediocre. Looper is definitely a movie that I think most people would enjoy. Some will probably find it challenging to follow but those that follow it well will surely consider it entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

I also liked Emily Blunt as Sara, Jeff Daniels as Abe and the young Pierce Gagnon as Cid. Although it did many things right I did feel it was a little unevenly paced in places. It seemed to get a little bogged down in the dialogue which slowed it down a little too much a couple of times.

"Original concept, interesting dilemmas that lead to difficult decisions. Very good overall.","Action/fantasy movie. Another film that focuses on time, but with its own special and unique script. In the future it is possible to travel through time but it becomes illegal and is used only by criminal gangs. One of the reasons is that it's no longer impossible to dispose of bodies without getting caught. So they use the time machines to send their victims in the past, with their hands tied and hooded, so that the fellow executioners of the past can execute them on the spot. Except these hitmen, the loopers, have made a deal. They will be paid for all their contracts, but at some point they will have to exterminate themselves from the future so that their bosses leave no trace in the future. And that's how moral dilemmas begin. Could a paid killer annihilate his future self knowing that he is ending his own life in 30 years from that day? Also, someone from the future could kill a small child knowing that in the future with his powerful telekinetic powers he would be a great fear for everyone, control all mobsters and even more kill his wife? A battle with his future self will have to give, but also with his current self, in order to find a way out in this loop. Generally a pretty good action movie with good effects, directing and acting with once again very good Bruce Willis, but mainly with a special and original script that differentiates it from other films.

Time Travel For Dummies!,"Directed by Rian Johnson, Looper, stars Joseph Gordon Levitt & Bruce Willis in the lead along with Emily Blunt. It is without doubt one of the best sci-fi movies this year. The one thing I loved about Looper is the unconventional attention to the plot. Unlike other sci-fi movies you are not welcome to JUST beefy visuals and eye-candy which diverts your attention away from the plot. There's not much 'sci-fi bling' in Looper, instead you are greeted to brilliant writing and awesome dialogues. From the very first scene the plot manages to cling on to you and immerses you.Don't be alarmed when I say its all story and less action, there's plenty of action sequences and rather meaty ones at that. Once again though these sequences invests more emotionally in you than just being set-piece moments and adrenaline rushes that you forget once you leave the movies. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's constant narration of the things he end up doing kept things slick like noir-pulp. His makeup to resemble Bruce Willis was totally uncalled for. It's not the Joseph we've seen in his recent flicks, literally! But you end up buying it anyway. And even with those layers of prosthetics and cosmetics you have to give it to Joseph to portray a believable young Bruce Willis. And about Bruce Willis, he had some good scenes as well as some mediocre ones which felt like he'd warped from his Die Hard days. Emily Blunt kinda stole some limelight from the male leads, her character was well written and arrayed with an abundance of emotions.Another thing I loved is the comprehensible accounting of time travel and events linked to it. Usually when time travel is involved you need to rack up your brains (*cough* LOST *cough*) but here in Looper everything is explained as simple and pleasantly plausible. There are plot holes of course but none that's too tangible and never the ones breaking your discernment of the over-all plot. The loopholes in Looper have been covered up subtly and to some extent giving justifications to each and every time-travel jargon. It could be just lame and just some words strung together but that actually saves the causalities that arises from time travel.Apart from all this Looper has some pacing issues towards the 3rd act. One moment I felt I was thrown in a time-jumping mob war and the next I was thrown amidst a supernatural-family-drama. An absence of an enjoyable soundtrack also takes away some brownie points.Rian Johnson's signature style has been smeared all over Looper. A bit of 'Brothers Bloom' and 'Brick' could be seen throughout the movie. I found it stylish, cool and totally plot-oriented. Rian proves that a time-travel movie need not be convoluted nor ambiguous, or laid with brain-teasers that keeps you thinking after you leave the movie theater. Looper is quite an entertainer and one of the better made time-travel movies ever made, something you could watch and drive home without burdening your brain asking 'how come', 'why this' and 'why that.'",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Almost a cult classic, but ultimately forgetful","Looper approaches the condition of a cult classic, but doesn't really get there. Technically it is perfect: it's sober, solid, with great camera work, beautiful pictures and amazing editing. It is humble, and doesn't try to impose you its quality, not forcing you to like it, and that is a great attitude. The plot is very well written and interesting, even if some plot-holes common to time-travel themed movies may appear. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job impersonating a young Bruce Willis. Even his face's expressions are equal. Bruce Willis himself is also great, as great as any script allows him to be. It really is everything you could ask for a quality thriller movie with a sci-fi touch. The thing is, in this genre, you could expect a more breathtaking and ambitious touch, which means, although being everything a good thriller needs to be, Looper is not an unforgettable movie, one that astonishes you and makes you wondering for a long time. It is forgettable, but undoubtedly amazingly well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
An idea went terribly wrong!,"So went for this flick coz I found the trailer interesting. I really like sci-fi genre and the last movie in this genre I saw was 'In Time', which was very entertaining. Looper was not that much fun.I felt the director's execution was not up to the mark. Firstly the movie has no action scenes if you expect so. The 2nd half of the screenplay is very slow, gloomy and totally idiotic. The movie actually has 2 plots, 1)time travel and 2) the dangers of toddlers with uncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately, neither of these plots are well executed and so it ruins the whole movie.The climax defies all logics and the time travel has big a goof up and you end up thinking, how can the director can be so stupid! The lead cast was OK in the whole act. The whole premise of the film is never explained satisfactorily. Looper is a dismal train wreck of ideas with great potential.

Greatly performed by primarily Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis,"This is a very interesting story, and that is the main thing in this, the story and the way it is told.

Loopers are people that in the present or near present is at the right time at the right place to kill the individuals send back, fairly simple concept.The story and the way it loops and unfold is very interesting, it tells an almost linear story, but jumps a few times, just like a dream or dejavu. There are small hints and lines that unfolds and in total creates the entire picture of the things that happen in the past will affect the future, for better or worse.This is a great sci-fi and action movie, it is greatly performed by primarily Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, but also Emily Blunt has an interesting part and performs it well.

Is it all about logic?,"Another Bruce Willis movie, The Sixth Sense has introduced an unexpected stunning final which puzzled the audience. Showing people that what they thought is wrong or the truth is not about what they thought in the final, became a popular method in Hollywood since then, which is launched successfully in some of the films with solid structures, ornamented with smart screenplays which were logical and unpredictable. The Sixth Sense was an unsuccessful example with regards to logical issues, because the main character did not comprehend for a sufficiently long time that he's dead even he interacted with people long enough who did not even see or hear him once. However The Sixth Sense was a huge success not because it's fully rational but its power of evoking astonishment.Looper is i think another unsuccessful example of films full of illogical events, though it's not promising a puzzling final scene. One might list dozens of unreasonable scenes which we witnessed while watching the movie and flush out.But how can we say that reason is the only factor for viewers to judge a movie? In nearly all of the action movies, we see the actors jumping, falling, running, fighting like a supernatural creatures. They see,hear, think everything, shoot every enemy at once with precision, they get wounded but never die! Sometimes, they rob a bank or kill on their own tens of guys right in the city center but never get caught or shot. If every scene was designed to be hundred percent true, would they still be amusing?So, if you leave the obsession of perfect realism, you may enjoy the interesting aspects of this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A very good action movie with a premise that makes little sense,"I really enjoyed this movie. I was interested right from the beginning and it kept up for most of the film, (except the ending, which was a little too melodramatic), but there were a few things that hindered 'Looper'.I'm not a fan of information given to the audience without allowing them time to figure things out by themselves, and Looper does do exactly that for the first fifteen minutes through voice over. I understand that casual action film-lovers do not always enjoy thinking while watching movies, but giving the audience the opportunity to work out just what a 'Looper' is and what 'closing your loop means' by reading expressions on character's faces and listening to them talk to each other about these things would have sat better with me.Despite the premise having a number of holes, it was nothing that ruined the plot. Instead of wading down in working out exactly how time-travel works (as Bruce Willis' character succinctly puts: 'We would be here all day making diagrams with straws'), the film focuses on a great story. I found the tension slowly rising throughout most of the film and there were a number of interesting surprises that kept this film separated from other recent sci-fi action flicks. The idea of a telekinetic 'virus' infecting a small percentage of the population is not simply there to strengthen the near-future society, but instead plays a pivotal role in the plot towards the end of the film.As I mentioned before, things did get a bit too melodramatic near the end. I was emotionally invested in the well-developed characters for the first three quarters of the film, so I don't really understand why the writers felt the need to write a pretty drawn out 'touchy' scene that actually decreased my sympathy for what was going on.Despite the ending, I thought this was a very good sci-fi movie",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

You see, you can't kill someone in the future, it's too easy to track. These killers are well paid until they have to ""close the loop"", kill their older selves, that is. One of these killers voluntarily goes to the past because the bad guys killed his wife. And we have gone full circle. If it's so difficult to kill people, why did they kill his wife? Then the whole film is about younger self tracking older self, which makes no sense at all, unless younger self would still do all the wrong choices older self did in order for him to exist.Bottom line: a well done movie, but a flawed one. The feel of it is gritty and shows a sort of desperation in the future, something that is great to behold. However the premise is crap and it doesn't get any better from there. Close-ups of Emily Blunt and Piper Perabo in her undies didn't save the film either, nor did the small child that was possibly the best actor of them all. In the end, the film can only be average, even if it is not the average type of movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Messed up story. So messed up and incomprehensible that I gave up in trying to understand it. Going nowhere.,"This movie is trying so hard to be special and smart that it totally misses the point.Starts out promising and bleak and violent. And although I didnt understand the beginning of the story either I was still hoping for some comprehensible plot turn. It didnt come.Any good? The actors are good. The photography is good. The mood is violent and bleak at first, which is quite daunting.The bad: the writing. Fire the writer and then exile the writer to an uninhabitable planet.

Magnificent,"Wonderful, magnificent, extraordinary, amazing and thrilling are some of the words that describe this well made film. I must admit that when I saw the trailer it didn't make me want to see the movie but when I saw that the movie was receiving so many positive reviews I had to risk. And it was the best option I have ever made, it surprised a lot, I was not expecting to be this good but I can see that we can trust the director Rian Johnson because he has a passion for films that most of directors don't have. All the actors portrayed so well their parts it was astounding. For me this film truly is a certain winner, I liked everything on it, and I expect that Rian continues to do films so improving has this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Fricking AWESOME!,"A Time-Travel movie with Willis and Gordon-Levitt playing the same character? Sign me up!!When i first saw the trailer for Looper, i was instantly intrigued, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, an assassin known as a Looper, The year is 2042 and time travel hast been invented yet, but in 30years it will have been! When the mob from the future wants to get rid of someone, they send that person back 30 years to a location where Joe would be waiting gun in hand, to take them out and dispose of the body. Everything is going well, until one 'Job' is sent back and Joe realises it is his future self (played by Willis).The younger Joe is living well, he is paid handsomely for the work he does, and it seems as a result has become addicted to some kind of futuristic drug that he drops into his eyes regularly through the film. The older Joe has a stronger maturity to him, and seems to despise his younger self, wondering how he could've been so arrogant and stupid!The strengths in this movie are in the performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The way he mimics a young Bruce Willis (from Die Hard era) is fantastic! I've always been a fan of Willis and his performance in this movie is great, in a way he is the 'bad guy' of the story, but you always have a sense that he has good intentions behind his actions.Emily Blunt played her part, but i wasn't overly impressed, however child actor Pierce Gagnon who plays her little boy was creepy as hell and was very good in this movie. Talking of which, his character of Cid plays a massive part in the story. The trailer did very well to cover another pivotal point to the story all revolving around this little boy.My favourite thing about this film is that it is Original. It isn't a remake, or adaption of a book. It is a simple, well laid out, great action packed Sci-Fi Blockbuster. It kept me guessing right up until the credits and even then i was talking about it long after with my friends. Looper is confident time-travel movie that fills in all its own continuity holes, it packs an emotional punch and never gives away what is going to happen next!Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper,"At the start this reminded me a little of ""Jumper"" (2008) as it delivers a cleverly crafted idea of how murder might look in the 22nd century. It's the ruthless ""Joe"" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is in the employ of the mob and is routinely and lucratively waiting for their troublemakers to be sent back a few decades in time so he can eliminate them and leave no modern day traces of the crime. The snag with this operation for the ""looper"" is, though, that sooner or later they themselves have to get rubbed out and so as they age, they (now Bruce Willis) have to anticipate that they will be attacked. It's Bruce who has well prepared for this eventuality and manages to thwart the attempts of his younger self - thanks to some well placed gold bars - and that leaves them both playing a deadly game of cat and mouse so as not to earn the enmity of their maniacal boss (Jeff Daniels). This is one of my favourite time travel action movies with an on form action hero in Willis looking like he is enjoying himself being chased by his own heroin addicted alter-ego, and each time the story resets it does so with additional information about not just these characters but also of the world that they are indirectly helping to create in the future. This helps stop this becoming a repetitive recycling of events and the arrival of the young ""Sara"" (Emily Blunt) and her own son (Pierce Gagnon) who has his own form of superpower adds a familial dynamic to the mystery that augments rather clutters up the mystery. There are visual effects but they are used sparingly, and despite a slight dry spell in the middle whilst the story seems to recalibrate a little, it's held together well by two stars who enter into the spirit of the things and by a plot that's eerily realistic (in a ""Dr. Who"" sort of fashion). It's not perfect, but it is quirky, imaginative and I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Awesome film,"Got to be as far as I am concerned at least, the most interesting and satisfying sci-fi film that I have seen in years. Okay, there are plot elements and devices that have been used many times before. Even just having Bruce Willis in the film reminded me somewhat of Twelve Monkeys given the time travel connections, but what really set this film apart from anything that has recently preceded it was that the narrative was strong, and the characters, particularly the younger and older versions of Joe were well drawn out characters with flaws, but just enough likability to keep us rooting for them. Johnson has delivered another really cool film to add to the list of really cool films that he has already made. I wonder, seriously if there is a more interesting and fresh director out there at the moment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"What is the perfect crime? I don't know if killing men sent from the future, and therefore unidentifiable, qualifies, but it's certainly close. Of course, if you should screw up somehow, those same people would know immediately. What then?It's 2044, and while time travel has yet to be invented, those in the future use it to their advantage by sending individuals who threaten their business interests back to that time where they can be eliminated by men awaiting their arrival. The men who execute these unfortunate individuals are known as loopers. Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) is one such man. Simmons (Gordon- Leavitt) is in the employ of a mafia boss in Kansas City who he calls Abe (played by Jeff Daniels). Abe (Daniels) was sent back in time to manage the organization's hired guns as well as their other illicit operations as only someone from the future is uniquely equipped to do. When loopers have outlived their usefulness, they are sent back to be executed their younger self who receive payment in the form of gold rather than the customary silver. This is referred to as ""closing your loop"". In his spare time, Joe abuses drugs, maintains an intimate relationship with a showgirl named Suzie (played by Piper Perabo), frequents a club owned by his employer and is studying French to prepare for his eventual retirement in France. Things start going awry when Seth (Joe's friend and a fellow looper played by Paul Dano) is confronted with the task of closing his loop and fails. His superiors are more than a little displeased by this and so Seth goes to Joe, hoping his friend will hide him. Eventually, Seth is found, maimed, and his now disfigured older self is executed. This is after Seth and Joe both learn that a crime boss known only as The Rainmaker is behind the recent rash of closing loops. As Joe resumes his usual routine, he too is given the task of closing his loop when his older self (portrayed by Bruce Willis) appears before him. Joe's younger self cuts a message into his arm so that he can discuss the situation with his older self. Old Joe (Willis) confirms that The Rainmaker exists and is closing loops, in addition to killing the woman Joe would eventually marry. Both Joes are attacked by men working for their employer and flee, neither intending to do anything other than the task they set out to. Old Joe's being to kill The Rainmaker's younger self, young Joe's being to close his loop.Obviously, this is a very complicated story. It's made even more so by characters I haven't mentioned yet. One of them played by the always talented Emily Blunt, the other by child actor and relative newcomer Pierce Gagnon. That said, I found it surprisingly good and highly entertaining. The complicated and paradoxical nature of sending someone back in time to be executed by their younger self as well as other questions about time travel are complicated and that is dealt with by a rather humorous line and then never brought up again. Thankfully. The story is gripping, the performances top-notch, and the conclusion leaves the audience wanting more and wondering what's next. This is a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Decent Enough,"I was at least entertained and intrigued. It wasn't a powerful film or insightful or thought provoking, but it was interesting, at the very least. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt is surprisingly turning out to be a good leading male in these ""action"" films, even though he's a bit small in stature and typically known for playing the quirky, lovable goofball. I do use the word ""action"" lightly since this wasn't really an action film. JGL kind of has the Keanu Reeves look without any of the actual stunts or breaking a sweat, he mostly just carries a big gun. The movie is watchable. I like the original concept of the film. Though, the entire concept of this film is impossible. That's the problem with time travel, none of this film would have happened if they changed the past. It just doesn't work that way and you don't have to be a rocket scientist about time travel to figure that out. A little disappointing that they made an entire film with a star like Bruce Willis and didn't try to delicately hide the fact that the entire concept of the film...would never happen if they actually changed those events. That's a pretty big oversight but I'm willing to still give it a halfway decent score 'cause it was at least a 7 on entertaining and engagement but not exactly riveting. You'd be better off to see the time travel one with Jake Gylenhal. That was a really good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Without a doubt one of the most stupid films I've ever seen.,"It was really, really awful, and I can't for the life of me understand why it's so highly rated. Nothing made sense. Nothing was thought through. Plot holes everywhere, story couldn't make up its mind about what it wanted to be, the future world was incredibly poorly realised and practically not even visible apart from insignificant, out-of-place elements such as hoverbikes and tiny, transparent cellphones.The worst of it all, however, is the complete idiocy of how time travel worked. Apparently in the future you can't dispose of bodies, so you have to send them back 30 years (yeah, 30 - not back before the beginning of human civilization or anything, which would have been easier) to be killed and disposed of by someone there. Why send them back alive instead of killing them there and just sending the body back? We aren't told, so we're forced to suspend even more of our disbelief and assume you can't KILL anyone in the future, despite that not being what we're told. But then why are people in the future threatening each other with guns? What are they going to do if the target doesn't comply? Not to mention that later in the film they DO in fact shoot someone in the future, completely ruining the already terrible plot device that you can't kill there.Why is everyone using civil war era firearms prone to jamming, when there are plenty of high tech weapons around in both eras? Must be some sort of honour or fashion thing among the loopers, right? Nope, Old Joe has no problem grabbing a couple of P90's at one point, which he of course drops after a few seconds of use, to go back to his trusty six shooter that already failed him once.Oh, and without spoiling the story: If someone is coming to kill you and those you love, and you know that person can't track you but just knows where you are now, what do you do? If you answered ""leave that place"", you are smarter than any of the characters in this film.|Slight spoiler|: The entire premise of the film is that character X is evil and must be stopped, because X is killing off the loopers. But the loopers are murderers - yet not a single person wonders if X may be doing a good thing by getting rid of them. No, we're supposed to accept it as obvious that someone getting rid of hired killers is evil.These are just what I can remember off the top of my head, but not ten minutes went by during the film where my palm didn't come into contact with my forehead over some stupid, pointless or completely self-refuting brain fart. I've never seen anything pretending to be intelligent fail so hard at it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper..runs too many circles and delivers nothing,"Hollywood is known for its original premises and smart plots especially in the sci-fi genre. Looper is clearly not one of them. An intriguing setting is put to waste by a nonsensical plot that takes too long getting to a rather underwhelming result. Plain and simple..avoid Looper in this week's movie watch list. I know its a sci-fi movie and gems like Inception and Minority Report come to mind but put them aside. Looper is not even a patch on them.Looper starts off well. The movie has quite an odd title but you get to understand exactly why its so, quite early in the movie. The rather unique premise is aided by some no-nonsense explaining within the first few scenes of the movie by the protagonist narrating in voice-over. So far..so very good. But that's just it. That's where it ends. Its as if after this even the director was scratching his head – okay so now what. Where do I take it from here..and I doubt he got any good answers.After that, the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride tonowhere and by the end of it all you are just desperate to see the ending credits. The only somewhat saving grace, comes rather late in the movie and even that is pretty underwhelming, considering what you've already enduredAs for the performances, well those are pretty decent. Joseph Gordon Levitt looks funny (I guess that's required for his character) but delivers well. Bruce Willis is in a strange role and doesn't have much to do. Kids have a lot to do in this movie and one particular kid is rather impressive. Emily Blunt also does justice to her role – no complaints there.I, for one, am scratching my head on how the established reviewing fraternity have given this movie a generous 4 stars. Perhaps they didn't understand the plot or maybe they understood it a little too well – either way I was rather dejected with what was offered. I fail to see how this could be seen as brilliant and thought-provoking. Its original and creative yes but then so were Wanted, Jumper and the like..we all know how those turned out.So don't get swayed by all the critical acclaim. As I was reading somewhere its been a long time since a good sci-fi movie with a decent plot came out. As soon as they saw Looper they've jumped to the conclusion that this is it. Well its not..the wait for that still continues.If you still wanna go for this movie and have your head running around in circles, its entirely your call..I've warned you all I couldTo read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Fight your present, face your past, forget your future..?","As always when it comes to time travel themed movies it inevitably raises a few questions regarding the applied theories, and I guess there are different ways to approach the matter. The way I see it there's the ""Back to the Future way"" which is sort of a tongue-in-cheek approach, and there's the ""Terminator way"" which is more of an absolute-truth approach. ""Looper"" does however try to move focus away from the time travel theory babble and instead concentrate on the storytelling. Normally I'd enjoy a story digging into the complexity and paradoxes of time travel, but in this case this strategy works to the movie's advantage, at least to some extent. It's like the movie makers are saying: ""We're not supposed to understand this anyway"", so it's tempting to just leave it at that. I'm initially convinced of the theories' irrelevance.The film's main character is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who works for the mafia as a Looper. Loopers execute people sent back from the future by the mob, as a way of disposing people without detection. Joe is seemingly living an enjoyable life consisting of money, parties, girls, drugs, and some assassinations every now and then. The movie has a nice style to it. Music, editing and pace occasionally make it feel almost like a sixties or seventies movie, but in a smooth and not very obvious fashion. The narrator voice also gives it a noir touch which suits this story well, although as time progresses the movie goes through something of a transformation when it comes to tone and feel, and it doesn't quite end in the same manner it started.I've lately grown fond of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor, although this might not be his strongest performance so far. Casting in general is fine but not outstanding. Pierce Gagnon is however absolutely brilliant in his role, and I hope to see much more of him in the future.Anyway, one day Joe find himself aiming a gun at his thirty years older counterpart and things take a turn for the worse. Young Joe (Gordon- Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) engage in pursuing different possible timelines, i.e. different possible eventualities. This is what I liked the most about the movie - the fact that the story is driven not by the standard good guy-bad guy dispute, but rather the conflict of interest between the two Joes, who essentially are one and the same person. It's exciting to think you know exactly what's going to happen because of old Joe's spent life and memories, and at the same time not knowing anything about forthcoming events because of young Joe's persistence to control his present life. Paradoxically this is also the biggest problem with ""Looper"". Since it avoids to establish some sort of rules of how time travel in the film's reality works, it's hard sometimes to understand why events play out the way they do, how the present affects the future, etc. I appreciate the different style of the movie and its attempt to uncomplicate the time travel business in favor of the story's depth, but I can't help but feeling this is also an attempt to cover up possible plot holes. When it comes down to it there are certain things you have to explain when making a movie of this sort, and you can't really get away from that. All in all this is an interesting story told in an unusual and inspiring way, but it partially fails to explain itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Very good film, interesting. Better than ""In time"", almost good as ""12 Monkeys"", not as good as ""Matrix""","Interesting how this film has many negative reviews, not exactly sure why? Maybe because people don't follow the movie very well, or simply the whole ""time travel story"" is just to complicated for them? I remember couple of years ago when I was in the cinema watching great film ""Lord of the rings, part 1, the fellowship..."" one guy was talking why ""we can't see the faces of Saurons riders, they are black, this is a big mistake"" What can you say after that?:) So, this movies is very, very good, I would rate it 7.7. Decent plot, decent acting, tempo great from beginning till end, great effects. Some parts of the film (especially the kid Rainman part) and the whole farm house part of the movie are masterpieces. Some characters could be better---I won't discuss too much about flaws...it is just great SF action movie, better than let's say ""In time"", almost as good as ""12 monkeys"", not as good as ""Matrix""...If you follow SF, you'll know what I'm talking about.

"Confusing, intricate, pacey","This clever and intricate movie borrows a theme from TERMINATOR and gives it an inventive twist. It's set in 2042 USA, which looks just as depressed as 2012 USA - apart from a few new not-too-futuristic flying machines. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, one of a group of secret hit men whose job it is to dispatch people sent back from 2072 where killing has been outlawed (o brave new world!). Joe's mission takes a curious turn when his future self (Bruce Willis) is sent back for 'processing'. Old Joe sets out to find - and eliminate - the Rainmaker, his future nemesis. Young Joe has to try and protect both the present and the future.The quest of the Joes brings them to a remote farm where Sara (Emily Blunt) is raising mysterious kid Cid who has some spooky telekinetic skills. A bunch of thugs are also in pursuit make sure the mission is accomplished - if it was made clear which future these guys were from, I missed it!I'm not sure the time-play in this storyline completely holds together. It's as intricate as, say, INCEPTION or even MEMENTO. But there's great pace and tension, the CGI is clever without being overdone, and the actors treat this far-fetched scenario with a seriousness it may not merit. And it has a very satisfying climax.LOOPER is a lot better than most of this summer's mega-budget blockbusters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Cleverly-Written Script and Strong Performances,"Looper is a sci-fi, time-traveling movie starring Joseph Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis. For short, this is an awesome movie with superb performances and a very delicate- written script. For an time- traveling movie, it is hard to explain the script and not have flaws among the story; however, Looper accomplishes all of the issues turning it a cleverly- written movie.Though in some scenes, Looper looks like an action film; however, it's not. Looper actually spends more time explaining the story thoroughly than having bunch of action sequences which can be unnecessary at times. To me, I prefer think more about the story, or even mind-bending, rather than watching a mindless popcorn flick. I'm not saying that Looper is not an action film, it has enough action scenes, but you can see that the director concentrates more on its story, which is a well-made choice. The ending scene is kind of a plot twist and I liked how it ended it. Not gonna spoil it.The two lead actors are awesome in the movie. Joseph Gordon- Levitt playing a looper who deals with the bodies of criminals sent from the future, and Bruce Willis plays the older Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I love the interaction between the two lead actors and it's actually very interesting of how you dealing with yourself. In some times, Levitt and Willis actually look very alike. There is a kid who wasn't mentioned in the trailer and will appear in the third act. He is very talented and will be a rising star.Looper is definitely worth watching, if you want to have a great time thinking about the story. With a clever and original story, and great performances, Looper stands out from other time-traveling movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Multi-faceted,"Unique story, combining dystopian sci-fi with a bit of the supernatural, and a crime/gangster theme. Although not overloaded with effects, when they happen, they are somewhat mind-blowing. Acting is solid from the whole cast, they all felt genuine to me, but It's the story and how it progresses to a complex twist that carries the weight of this film. The emotionally tense moments are really well done, and the soundtrack is also excellent. Nice variety and well-placed. This film is like an amalgam of ideas revolving around each other. It's a weighty film, and should hold your attention by both it's uniqueness and intensity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A consistent grower with an aborted ending,"""Looper"" is a movie that convinces from several points of view.It has a rather intriguing science-fiction story line that is quite well used in here and not over-employed. This means that the film is still down to earth and doesn't include too many technical details or other stuff. If you want this kind of film, you should watch Star Trek.The film includes a lot of moral questioning and provokes many philosophical thoughts of what is right and wrong.The story itself is not too complicated but filled with tension to keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.The acting is very solid in this film and especially Bruce Willis plays one of his best roles in the last years and not only the superficial die hard guy with sick humour that he usually incarnates.The film is filled with a few great action scenes and a couple of stunning special effects but they are very decently used as the main focus remains on the acting and the story.The movie has also a few shocking moments you wouldn't expect that give especially the character incarnated by Bruce Willis a lot of depth.Overall, there is not much wrong with this movie but there are still a couple of things I've disliked about it.As this movie is mostly free from the usual stereotypes, it is sad that one stereotype had to be included in this which is a love story towards the second half of the film that adds nothing at all to the main plot and seems only to be included to follow the norms and please a larger crowd.Another critical point is the ending that is quite controversial. Some people adored it, others literally hated it. I disliked the ending but not that much because of its content but because it comes very abrupt. The tension raises continuously in the film and when you fell ready for a stunning showdown, the whole thing gets suddenly aborted which left me a little bit frustrated after all. I'm somewhat hoping for a director's cut or additional scenes when this will be released on DVD and BluRay but I'm not sure if this may ever happen.In the end, the positive points are though way more numerous than the negative aspects of this film. The movie is not a masterpiece but clearly one of the best cinema flicks of the year. This one here is definitely worth a watch for anyone who likes Hollywood cinema.By the way, it's a quite refreshing idea to see Bruce Willis' character retiring from his dangerous job to get into the big city life of Shanghai where he ends up with a tough Chinese lady that somewhat transmits an irresistible charm. These few scenes made me laugh a lot and had a very sympathetic touch in my humble opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"Time travel can be confusing, but let Gordon-Levitt & Willis worry about that; you get to sit back & enjoy a great movie","Time travel is confusing. Once you think you may have a grasp on it and have ironed out the 'what-ifs', a new paradox will pop up and collapse your argument which was a house of cards anyways. There are too many holes, and especially plot holes, when you try to rationally reason through what it means to travel through time and change the past. Once time travel is invented, hasn't it always been invented then? If you go back in time and change something, will you just disappear because your specific future no longer exists?Looper sidesteps this whole enigma by having old Joe (Bruce Willis) tell his younger self that there is no use trying to figure it all out; it will just confuse you. This one statement immediately smooths out the conversation he is having with young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the audience's mental gymnastics, and while still leaving them right there in front of you, chooses to ignore the Grand Canyon sized plot holes. If you spend enough time with a pen and a sheet of paper, you will most likely identify a dozen or so glaring issues with jumping back through time, but where is the fun in that? With Looper, it is enough to recognize you have a creative story to watch and gifted actors to watch carry it out.The year is 2044, not so far in the future to imagine teleportation and interstellar flight, but far enough to dream up new technology, weapons, and illicit drugs. 2044 is quite similar to today's reality, but its every day norms and today's extreme edges magnified by 1000. There are hover motorcycles, currency is literally based on gold and silver, and the drug all the kids are using is administered through eyedrops and appears to have the effects as cocaine. There is also some glaring income inequality, you either have money or you do not; there is no middle class. The city landscape shows thousands of people living on the sidewalks and sometimes in the middle of the street. If someone steals from you, it looks like you are allowed to pull out your personal shotgun and teach them a severe lesson.Young Joe is a looper. At a specific time and always in the same place, the edge of a corn field, a hooded person will appear out of nowhere and all Joe has to do is immediately pull the trigger on his weapon and get rid of the body. These unfortunate souls are being sent back through time from 30 years in the future where time travel is illegal; therefore, it has morphed into a black market time travel system run by the mob. Young Joe is paid handsomely to do these simple tasks and spends the rest of his day and most of the night going to a club to drink, dance, take drugs, and spend time with Suzie (Piper Perabo), his favorite lady of the evening.There are rules to follow though. Since the system is run by the mob, breaking the rules is frowned upon. I will not go into the rules because young Joe does a good job explaining to you what they are. In his film noir, gravelly voice, which is trying to match a young Bruce Willis in style, Joe opens the movie and brings you up to speed on what has been happening with the time travel business and his specific spot on the food chain. He has looper friends with Seth (Paul Dano) as his closest one and he gets called in to see the boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels), from time to time. Other than that, young Joe is really running his own loop with his day job and his nightly activities.Old Joe effectively ends that routine as soon as he pops into the corn field out of thin air. One would think that young Joe would have some questions or would want to cut his older self some slack, but no such luck. Young Joe enjoys his current situation and is in no frame of mind to have it messed with, even if it is a version of him doing the interrupting. Old Joe is on a quest to change the past and does not seem too pleased to run into his former self either. These two are the same man, but they certainly are different people. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really the leading man here because Willis is in more of a supporting role and has noticeably less screen time; however, Bruce still gets top billing on the poster and in the credits. I wonder if that chafes Gordon-Levitt?Both Gordon-Levitt and Willis are very good here. On one hand, they are playing the same person and must try and match each other's facial ticks and mannerisms, but on the other hand, Gordon-Levitt is playing a kid against Willis's older and yes, wiser, character. Another supporting character is Sara (Emily Blunt) but I leave it to you to discover her role. Sara is saddled with most of the slower scenes in the middle which drag on a bit, but it's good to take a break from Joe, both young and old, after awhile. Looper was written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) who should be commended for sitting down and puzzling through what must have been a very arduous screenplay.You will not understand the physics of how everything works in Looper (probably because the physics actually don't work), but you don't have to. Let young and old Joe worry about that. You just get the pleasure of sitting back and enjoying an original, thought-provoking, and well made sci-fi, action thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Saving an inevitable future is intriguing...,"The crime lords of the future have discovered a new method of eliminating their victims. Time travel, although banned in that future, is used to send someone back by 30 years where a hired assassin shoots him at the designated place and time. These assassins are 'Loopers' and their job pays them a lot of silver bars. Occasionally, the mob will decide to close the loop in order to secure itself, which means that the Looper will be sent his future self as a target. Sometimes, the shock of seeing his future self is enough to distract the Looper and before he knows it, he has lost his target and now the mob has a bounty on his head.Joe (joseph Gordon Levitt) is one such Looper whose future self refuses to get shot upon arrival on the present day. With the closure of his loop in jeopardy, Joe makes a run for it to explore the possibilities of himself and his future self to co-exist at the same time. He finds shelter in a farmhouse where Sara and her son Sid live. Older Joe (Bruce Willis) lost his wife to the attacking mob men who were directed by the Rainmaker. He manages to escape to the intriguing time and place in front of his Looper self in the past. While his escape puts the lives of both the Joes in jeopardy, they are individually determined to survive and find a way to co-exist in the same period. But older Joe's vengeful plan is to seek out the child who will grow up to be the Rainmaker, the one responsible for his wife's death and prevent the tragedy by killing him. Both the Joes are at the crossroads of this plot while the threat of the mob finding them is ever lurking.Bruce Willis has been in similar shoes before. Intriguing stories and calmly aggressive characters are not new to him and he pulls off being Joe quite comfortably. Although, we would have preferred to see more of him in Looper. That's also because Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not a convincing lead actor. His calmness more often tends to portray boredom. His range of emotions, stature, dialogue delivery fall short of what it needs to be of a leading man; especially when his older self is Bruce Willis. That perhaps is the most disappointing feature of Looper. Emily Blunt as Sara, does a fine job of depicting varied emotions, appears protective as well as aggressive with an aura of being vulnerable at the same time. She also does a great job with her country accent that certainly de-glamorizes her.From kinetic powers to time travel, director Rian Johnson adds scientific elements to make the plot even more intriguing than it already was. The shocking revelation at the end isn't completely unexpected but yet leaves us reeling for the conclusion. Avoiding dramatic and lengthy character focused scenes, Johnson sticks to the screenplay that just keeps the story moving on to the next chapter However, there are parts when we haven't seen older Joe for almost 30 mins while his focus on young Joe and Sara's relationship does seem to drag. A little more of Bruce Willis' older Joe would've added some powerful acting and dialogue to an otherwise dull and weak performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He failed to impress in the shoes of Commissioner Gordon's chosen aide in 'The Dark Knight Rises' and now, Looper. It is yet, an intriguing watch and an interesting take on time travel's utility. It questions the sympathetic human mind on one hand with the desire to save your loved one on the other. When an inevitable future that will turn bad is being made in front of you, how can you change its direction? The Looper will have to take a decisive shot.7.63 on a scale of 1-10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Best film of 2012.,"Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt join forces and tackle the sci-fi genre after Inception and Die Hard. Very interesting story mixed with sci-fi action, along with Bruce Willis's humor and Levitt's charm. So far, the most interesting film of 2012. Not too far ahead of The Dark Knight Rises, which to be honest was kind of disappointing, but still good. This film takes us on something not yet seen.In the year 2074, outlawed time traveling will be used by the mafia to send people they want dead back to the year 2044, where they are killed by hired assassins called ""loopers"". They do this for the mafia until their older selves are sent back and are killed by them, called ""closing the loop"". Joseph Gordon Levitt, a looper who is very happy with his job, encounters his old self, (Bruce Willis) who gets the drop on him, causing him to go on a hunt in order to close his loop.Some may call it another typical time travel story, but I disagree completely. I think it brings a fresh intake on sci-fi action. Doesn't get very confusing like most time traveling films, and manages to keep you interested with the story and characters all the way. You even stay connected with Bruce Willis as the antagonist, which is hard to do.Film, (unlike others) doesn't get carried away with CGI and go full blown in your face visuals. It stays par and only uses visuals when it absolutely needs to. Manages to keep the story interesting, even when things calm down. I stayed interested every second. Not a moment of the film seemed slow or out of place. Some might fine the time traveling making no sense, but that's if you think about it too much. So ignore that and you got a heck of a ride.This film is one of the first decent sci-fi films that have been released in a while. Great story, great characters, and a great cast. Willis and Levitt make a great pair together. Definitely worth watching. Better the second time for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Smart Sci-fi,"Just a straight up good science fiction movie with heart. This isn't your typical explosion and laser filled action movie.Saw this for the second time recently after seeing it in theatres upon its initial release and it is even better than I remember.People have issues with the time travel aspect, Rian made a smart choice of not diving into the minutia of what works and why it does and how it alters things etc etc. Which in my very trivial opinion is smart because fans and critics would terrorize the logic.The plot is pretty good, a couple small things that can be seen as holes / make you scratch your head.All performances are done well, nothing distracting or bad. Even the young boy does a great job.If you're a fan of sci-fi that makes you think a bit more this is a solid watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Sliding Doors with Guns.,"Let's get this straight. Looper is not, as many say, ""the Matrix of the 21st Century"" it's ""Sliding Doors with Guns."".It's a clever attempt to play with the concept of 'what might have been' on a very grand scale (although, interestingly, not, as I was expecting, on a mind boggling scale).It's a big movie but it's not one that, had it failed, would bring the studio to its knees and I kind of liked that. Clocking in at $30,000 ain't really that big a deal.It's set in 2047 in a now ragged USA with China having taken ascendancy in the world. I liked the fact that director and writer Rian Johnson (Brick) doesn't turn it into Blade Runner but adds a few neat sci-fi tricks (like flying motorbikes). Loopers are ""disposal men"" of their future selves who are sent back from 2077 for, well disposal,. They are called Loopers because the film is all about time loops. 2044's Loopers are disposed of 30 years hence (and they know it) by themselves hence ""Closing the Loop"", but occasionally it goes wrong such as here where Joe (our Hero played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to close the loop on himself (Old Joe played by Bruce Willis). But it all goes Pete Tong and so we now have two Joe's on the go.Young Cid (a remarkable performance by 5 year old Pierce Gagnon) has Telekinetic powers and a temper that makes Linda Blair look merely snippy in The Exorcist. He's the son of love interest (Sara) - played well by Emily Blunt) and he appears to be the key to the loops.I could go on but won't because there's a lot of detail to consume and there's 300 odd reviews here that will tell you all you need to know about the detail.Suffice to say it all pans out cleverly; the various loops are closed in perhaps unexpected ways and we are left with a movie that is clever, well acted, slick and genuinely original.It's a definite recommendation. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper Short Review,"It's been a year since I saw this once as a blind buy of buying Blu-Rays, As soon as I watched it, this film blew me away. The cast were amazing even the child actor did well in this film, Bruce Willis was fine while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt did a fantastic job. The plot was interesting, even if a lot of it are plot holes, but the way it was executed was damn good. The score was meh, the action in this were alright but I don't really care about those just story alone was just creative and again executed well. The director, in Rian Johnson, did a fantastic job in directing this fun thrilling sci-fi film. The negatives outweighs it's negative and I recommend you yo watch this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Time travelling assassins run out of luck,"Joe is a Looper. In the future when you want to disappear a body, back it goes in time to a desolate field in the deep mid-west to Joe and his blunderbuss. There he will blow a hole in the hapless rube before taking the pay strapped to their back.And the pay is good but the price, as Joe finds, is even higher. When Joe fails to end his own future self a tsunami of organised criminality comes after him.The film is clever and walks the fine line between standard fare and wrapping itself in its own smugness. The performances are touching at times and brutal in others. There are themes that get explored here for the first time in mainstream cinema that had all 6'10"" of me wincing in a way I haven't experienced since Old Boy and the live octopus. The film asks the question 'What would you do to save the one you love?' The answers are extremes that creep up on you and the characters slowly as they are cut free of their own time.It is genuinely original and there are elements you don't expect at. However fans of the new Sci-Fi wave will recognise a Deus ex Machina when they see one and while it does not flag you down in the first act, it certainly wolf whistles.The film has more in common with another Willis vehicle, the trippy and ultimately circular 12 Monkeys than it does with the other summer Sci-Fi fare (please avoid Total Recall I beg you!). While it works and works well it could have been more. The bite of the Looper's cruelty is panned away from too often and the potential horrors of the future are only referenced in passing. This denies the audience the chance to really connect with the choice that has to be made.In all a cerebral film that will certainly keep the conversation going past the starter on date night.If you are still discussing it with your dessert I would respectfully suggest you were not paying close enough attention.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
"""This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg"". Rian Johnson really make a point with this phrase!","For how long did the world had a good science-fiction film? Well, Nolan's ""Inception"" is a masterpiece and technically speaking it is a sci-fi. Then in 2012 Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" came and it was despised by the public. But it was never easy to make a good sci-fi film, because it always approached over the years many different tones and genres (""Alien""-Horror, ""Star Wars""-Fantasy, ""Blade Runner""-Action and Philosophy). And then Rian Johnson, director-screenwriter from the school thriller ""Brick"" and the ""comedy"" ""The Bloom Brothers"", with ""Looper"" not only made the best sci-fi of 2012 but also one of the best of its kind.""Looper"" is located at the future in 2044 where time travel has not been invented. But it will be in the year of 2074 and will start to be used by the most dangerous criminal minds in the world. Where when they want to get rid of a rival or someone, they send that person back in time where will be eliminated by assassins called ""Loopers"" which from each death they will be rewarded with silver or gold, because technically speaking the death never happened. One of these Loopers is called Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young selfish that drug-acted that have fun all night after another job well done. One day when he is about to close another job, he discovers that his new target it is his older-self (Bruce Willis). When Joe is about to ""Kill-himself"" the Old Joe manages to escape, and if any Looper let his target escape he also will be hunted down and killed. Now Joe has to find his older self and kill him avoiding his own death. But Joe barely knows the dark secrets that his older self from the future brings.What Rian Johnson made so special in Looper? Mainly because while ""Looper"" can be quite original and unique. Johnson builds a credible and even possible future with poverty and corruption reigning (and also most of the population still use cars and only some use flying motorbikes). Also managing to join several clichés of time travel films from ""The Terminator"" to ""12 Monkeys"". That is, a possible frightening and terrifying future with a big twist in the film.Not just clichés of time travel that Rian Johnson brings to Looper, but as I said before, science-fiction has always had many different genres and Rian Johnson knows that. Putting in the movie good old fashioned action (bloody violent and awesome as hell), but also dramatic moments when Joe meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). And also elements of Western with the Loopers (bounty-killers using revolvers and weird-awesome shotguns). Along with dark and violent moments, especially when Old Joe starts to show his true motives.All this comes with a superb screenplay written by Johnson himself. The writing seems a mixture of Michael Mann with Tarantino and Joss Whedon. This means, long but never get boring well-paced dialogs, raising in them several different topics related to the history and making all characters relevant in the story. Speaking of characters, all of them are very well built and are part of the great genius that Johnson put in the movie. Mainly because there is no good vs. evil here, Joe shows to be really selfish in various situations, and the Old Joe shows several reasons for what he is doing.But what they all have in common is fantastic performances: since Emily Blunt (great) to Paul Dano (which unfortunately barely appears in the film); Bruce Willis finally after a time with horrible action movies (except for ""Red"") showing that he can be a excellent actor; Levitt.....well I don't even know if that's Joseph Gordon – Levitt. Or Rian Johnson has a time machine and he went in the past and asked Bruce Willis in his 30s to act in the film, or that is an excellent blend of makeup and contact lenses or a MAGNIFICENT performance from Levitt.""Looper"" is succeeds not only for its great originality, but also by the use of various genres and tones that science fiction films always approached by mixing together clichés of previous films. All thanks to a superb script, great direction and excellent cast, with a great genius since the beginning to the ""mind blowing"" end, ""Looper"" it was not only one of the best films of 2012 but it can be one of the best sci - fi movies ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Nothing special but enjoyable enough while it lasted,"There are other reviews here, so I'll get to the point:People are calling this film ""intelligent"", yet what could have made it truly so is if Bruce's character - at a certain point - seized the reins and became himself, The Rainmaker. Damn, that would have been awesome: changed future, butt kicked, boxes ticked.Instead, we were unfortunately ""treated"" to yet another ridiculous time paradox making up the plot. Oh, Bruce, don't you realise that you could have ORDERED the kick-arse yet happy ending?Hopefully, those who have seen the film know what I'm referring to, and those who haven't aren't going to complain about a ""spoiler"", albeit, in another time paradox, viewers will only comprehend the alluded to comment on having seen the whole film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

A Riveting Journey Through Time and Emotion,"""Looper"" definitely makes it into my top 10 time travel movies of all time. Sitting down with that typical sci-fi expectation, I was utterly engrossed by the end, finding myself both emotionally and thoughtfully immersed. The past-future conflict between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis offers a truly impressive narrative. Particularly, Gordon-Levitt's imitation of Willis was a joy to watch.The film, overall, mixes the concept of time travel with deep themes like fate, regret, and self-sacrifice. Emily Blunt's performance elevates the film to another level, and the visual effects and atmosphere are just as compelling; the dystopian future outlook not only captivates but also prompts a period of reflection.Of course, there were a few points that puzzled me, especially regarding the mechanics of time travel. At times, I couldn't help but wonder, ""How did that happen?"" But overall, ""Looper"" is a perfect pick for those seeking a mind-bending film.Therefore, I give ""Looper"" an 8/10. It entertains, provokes thought, and offers a story worth pondering for days. If you're a sci-fi fan and haven't seen it yet, I definitely recommend giving it a go.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Everything I wanted,"Looper is exactly the movie you are looking for. Great actors, great plot, great movie. The plot turns and twines throughout the movie and is brilliantly done. Joesph Gordon-Levitt is phenomenal along with a typically stellar Bruce Willis performance.
The only goof I noticed within the acting is Emily Blunts hit and miss country accent. She had a strong and noticeable accent in her first interaction with Joesph, but it faded as the movie went on. Incredibly minimal hatreds toward this film all together though.

"Incredibly crafted, mind-bending thriller","This was my favourite film of 2012. It is a gripping sci-fi thriller, with superb performances and carefully crafted plot that keeps you guessing right until the mind-blowing climax, and yet retains a real warmth and humanity. Essentially it isn't about the special effects and mind- bending notions of time travel. It asks a fundamental question: is evil inherent? And if it isn't, what would you do to stop it appearing?The pace is incredible, with the intricately woven plot carefully unfolded piece by piece so that we are continually surprised, but never confused. Rian Johnson gives the age old notion of time travel new life by introducing innovative ideas such as torturing a young Paul Dano in order to torment his fugitive future self.Add to this an array of pitch-perfect performances and you're on to a winner. I'll admit that Joseph-Gordon Levitt makes a visually unconvincing young Bruce Willis, in spite of the painstaking prosthetics (which I found pretty distracting), but no one can deny that he gives a cracking performance as Joe the Looper - a hit man hired to bump off the enemies of the 'bad guys' who are sent back from the future. Bruce himself does what he does best, while Emily Blunt gives the performance of her career as a guilt-ridden young mother determined to do right by her son. Pierce Gagnon is terrifyingly convincing as Blunt's son Cid, displaying a maturity far beyond his years with a performance that rivals Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense.People who want to pick holes in the theory and logistics of time-travel are missing the point of this film. I found the explanations utterly believable, but what really got to me were the characters and performances. It is a taught, intelligent piece of film-making in which every element is perfectly crafted so as to enhance the whole without drawing attention to itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
A time-travelling loop-the-loop,"Writer-director Rian Johnson's sci-fi action film is complex and original but not necessarily clever, and only marginally entertaining. Upholding the script's integrity is discarded in favour of maintaining its crowd-pleaser status.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a mob killer known as a 'Looper', who takes out the trash from the future by shooting them in the present (2044). Time-travel rules have to be broken when his latest target – his future self – escapes at the point of execution. Bruce Willis plays the older Joe. He evades his younger self every time Execution day arrives, as he intends to find The Rainmaker, a mythical Looper who kills his wife in the future.Instead of explaining his impressive concepts, Johnson resorts to the easy cliché of making his characters ignorant of their own world. The closest we come to time-travel exposition is a line by Looper manager Jeff Daniels, 'It fries your brain like an egg', or better still Willis's line, 'I don't wanna talk all that time travel crap; we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws'. Those are funny lines, but when you stop chuckling you know you've been had.Gordon-Levitt is easily upstaged by the doyen of action cinema. With intense make-up he looks nothing like a younger Willis, and his characterisation is even less convincing. He doesn't have the presence of prolific actor, and yet he is one. Paul Dano has a small role as a fellow Looper, which he quivers through as is his custom. Emily Blunt convinces as the independent farm girl whose precocious toddler, Cid is key to the plot.I figured out the twist long before the reveal. It is so obvious, that I thought it was dramatic irony, where the audience is intentionally privy to something the characters aren't. I can't prove this of course, but be in no hurry to find out for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Tarantino meets twelve monkeys,"Refreshing take on the time travel action theme that doesn't collapse under it's own explosions or studio management. The future doesn't seem to far with everyone driving around in pathetic little shopping cars that already start to pop up in the present. It's little details like this and everybody being paid in silver and gold that bring the movie closer to home than some would like to.Then there is the subtle play with themes like morality, free will, relationships, attachments and greed. O, and the mobster that clearly uses his brain and is bored and has seen it all (because he's from the future). Magnificent role played by Jeff Daniels.Without giving anything away it's a must see for people that enjoy the way Travolta picks up a gun from the trunk of a car mono logging about foot massages to Bruce Willis in his delirium while traveling trough time in Twelve monkeys.

Two movies in one - Looper Review,"Looper is a movie about time travel, hitmen, telekinetic powers and a farm...AnywayThe movie starts out explaining it's concept in a very exciting and really smart way. In the year of 2074, criminals and mobs uses time travel to send back there targets thirty years in time. Hitmen, or so called Loopers, then kills the guy sent back in time and gets paid. 
Our main hero(ish) Joe, played excellently by Joseph Gordon Levitt, is a looper with high hopes of life. A man who studies french and has dreams of one day going to France. 
This all changes when Joe himself get sent back from the future... to get killed by himself...
This is called closing the loop, in which the mob in the future send back the hitman himself so that he can end his own life, in the future. He get's a big fat reward and can go on about his ways. 
I won't spoil anything but, things aren't exactly that easy for Joe.From a movie perspective this is a great one. The premiss is fantastic and the acting is great, all around the board. The crown is taken by Pierce Gagnon tough, a child actor who really kills it.The movie starts out with fast paced editing and some great shots of a futuristic society in which we get thrown into. The dialogue is funny, riveting and very smart written by the o-so great Rian Johnsson.But. The movie lacks in one key element. Pace. 
The pace in the movie completely drops towards the middle of the second act and the movie changes it's story fundamentally. It feels like your'e watching a different movie. Not a bad one, but not a fantastic one either. 
This is kind of a shame, because the first half is so good, and sets off so many exciting ways to move the story forwards. Rian choose to write his story this way and he went for it.All and all this is a great movie wheigehed down a bit by its second to third act, but still manages to finish quite strong. 
I would recommend this movie to everyone. See it. Just don't have to much expectations over what it's gonna be. Otherwise, you might get kind of disappointed.TOTAL SCORE:8**/10*= MEANS HOW MUCH POTENTIAL THE MOVIE HAD, HOW HIGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN RATED.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

This feels very original, is packed with fantastic action and complex themes, and challenges the viewer in many ways.

Back to the Looper,"I believe I saw this movie maybe once before, a year or so after it came out. I remember it being good, always hear things about how great it was and yet it never quite stuck with me.

Now, watching it, I feel like Looper doesn't get quite enough credit for what it is. This is a brilliant movie, well acted, the lore is creative and interesting, the world is fascinating and built expertly within the constraints of the film's runtime. I'm oddly surprised that there haven't been sequels, prequels and spin-offs to this world but I also feel that's likely for the best.This feels like a modern sci-fi classic.

A future classic,"'Looper' is a sci-fi time-travel film which follows an assassin on the run after failing to kill his future self. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tries to kill his future self (Bruce Willis) in order to survive the present.The acting is great overall; no one lets down the film here. Willis is good enough here but I wouldn't say it is his best performance; he still suits the role however and was a good choice. Gordon-Levitt was fantastic and has proved with this and 'The Dark Knight Rises' that he can perform well in action roles. However, the prosthetics on his face made it a bit difficult to judge his performance as they cover half of his face. There have been plenty of films where people have played the younger version of the same character in the same movie and have not had the same bone structure. Of course basic aspects of appearance such as eye colour have to be sorted but Gordon-Levitt's make-up was distracting throughout the first half of the film, so much so that the plot was nearly overshadowed!The plot is really clever; it's a bit tricky to get your head around but it has been explained well. Of course, you will spend the next few days trying to figure out whether or not everything does indeed tie together in the end but they do explain it well and there are no massive plot holes. Supporting characters such as those played by Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels were written really well and performed by great actors. Even Paul Dano's small character was a great inclusion in the film despite only being there for ten minutes. There are some really shocking moments in this film and some grizzly scenes too but nothing unnecessary and they do not have a negative impact on the plot or the picture as a whole.Overall, this is a really great film which will hopefully be regarded as a classic one day amongst sci-fi and film lovers alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"

Deal with it.But now we've got that out the way, this is an exciting, interesting, well-acted, thoughtfully written film that mixes drama, sci-fi and action without getting muddled. This isn't one of those films that starts with an interesting premise and then fumbles the execution (like Surrogates, for example). You really care for all the characters. Looks gorgeous, too.Yet to see Emily Blunt or Joseph Gordon-Levitt turn in a bad performance. And I like Bruce Willis and I don't care what you say. The only weak link, I thought, was Jeff Daniels - too bumbling, and not sinister enough for a mob boss.And while I'm on this, why don't we see Paul Dano in more films?yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Did they cast Willis because he has experience time travelling?,"Excuse my little title joke, I just find funny how certain people seem to have different roles with an apparently non-skill based point. Don't get me wrong, he does a good job here, it's just simply curiosity. Like Reaves an cyberpunk roles, for example (does he have a cyberpunk look or something?).Anyway, I found this movie entertaining enough. It has some obvious flaws (some of them what-the-hell level), although it tries to make sense as much as possible (even when, compared to this movie, Back to the Future's time travel plot and physics seem to have been written by Stephen Hawkings).If we ignore those little things, Looper becomes a very enjoyable movie, with a nice mix of scifi and supernatural (let's call the ""TK"" that). The future has been presented is an overall credible way, and it has things in it that deviate a bit from the norm, which makes the movie look a bit refreshing in that aspect. We'll also find more typical futuristic gadgets (like the flying bikes), which are a nice touch and give the film some sort of classic scifi feeling without making it look outdated.Even though a couple of things throughout the film can be a bit predictable, I was positively surprised when more twists than expected showed up, and was glad to be wrong about certain predictions I had in my mind.Alas, not a bad movie for both scifi fans and people who want to watch an average thriller.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Supernatural action epic!,Rian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt reunite and once again team up to create another fantastic film. Another great performance from Bruce Willis and this is one of the last films where his heart still looks in it. I remember seeing this back in theaters but really had forgotten how truly unique and awesome this film is. Years later i still find this story pretty spell binding being about time travel we've seen it all just about while Looper does a great job at paving its own way. Loved the shift halfway from badass Looper hitman story to supernatural like thriller that becomes more of a mystery the more you think you've got it all figured out. Even with a rewatch i still can't help but feel ill-prepared for the wild twist at the end for a satisfying conclusion.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Looper pulls you in quite well.,"Looper is a great movie. It takes the concept of time-travel, throws away all the romanticized ideas (about time-travel) movies have used in the past. And gives you something that is fresh.Forget about all the reviews that are critical regarding the logic of some events. Time-travel is not exact science if you know what I mean. The movie presents a concept, it is fantastic, it is fiction, it has great acting and it pulls everything together.In terms of movie that brings to you a new story, I would rate this very close to the league that movies like Memento, Big Fish, The machinist, The fountain, Prestige, Inception.etc belong to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
solid sci-fi flick,"Entertaining film, though maybe not as cutting edge as some may have suggested. However a worthwhile watch, and a decent storyline. Looper is worth checking out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
It is well worth seeing,"Actually this movie is rather good. It could have higher marks and more exciting reviews. But it doesn't.It is not ""12 monkeys"", or ""Die Hard"". It will not start new genre. And most probably you will not buy it to add to home collection.For one time movie this one has all it needs: it has it's fun moments, and really sad ones. Willis and Gordon-Levitt do perform quite well. And supporting cast is great.What I mostly disliked were other two key characters. That you will not see in trailers. And I really didn't like the final.But you may disagree after watching. So I emphasize it once more: this movie is well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"I've never been a big sci-fi Fan until I watched this movie. This movie opened the doors for me to watch all types of Sci-fi movies from Star Wars and so on. Great directing, writing and of course acting. If by chance you too are not into Sci-fi movies give this movie ta chance, you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
movie hallucination,"Memories that fade and disappear, feelings that rise out of nothingness. Disconnected parts of ourself. Overwhelmed by the narcotic power of movies; the essence of flickering lights. Falling down the rabbit hole, chasing your own shadow; a you you can no longer understand. Frame by frame our mind constructs a coherent whole with a singular inevitable direction, meaning. Escape your fate, feel it changing; the exhilaration of freedom, the danger of it.The above fragments are what came to me after watching this film.Looper is an action movie with a sci-fi plot revolving around hit men who kill people sent back from the future. The concept here is that one of these hit men has to kill an older version of himself and once he knows this he can alter the future and the past by knowing what is going to happen to him in the future.Obviously, Looper refers to the 'Back to the Future' trilogy but here it becomes a metaphor for life and the soul; something almost spiritualistic.It's pointless to cite all the cinematic references in Looper, the point of the film is to draw on a whole language of cinema and through the mastery of the language renew it.Looper is a mind-blowing experience - unless you get too fussy about plot logic and miss the point - it's the kind of rare movie that can call itself an instant classic. The camera-work, the acting, the music, the editing, the script; everything is brilliant.This is a truly original and surprising work which functions on several levels: a genre film, an essay on artistic influence and memory, a cubist work on redemption and remorse...At heart Looper is a fantasy; a heroic-fantasy and an artistic puzzle. Inception and Source Code have both recently covered similar territory with flawed or cursed characters immersed in a dream-logic and written as a narcotic form of mythomania.As an experience Looper is thrilling, unsettling and sublime. It is also great fun; Hugo Cabret was also a similar experience although on the surface very different, Hugo Cabret dealt with a time machine from the past; the lost films of Méliès and their destruction by the coming of a new future. In Looper the future threatens the past with its self-awareness, is this a comment on the future of cinema? If Looper is the future of cinema then we're all safe.At the end of Kurosawa's Rashomon a baby is left in the hands of a stranger, the question posed was 'can we trust our fellow man?' Looper poses a similar question but goes further and asks, 'can we trust ourselves?' can we believe in ourselves, even if we know we've made mistakes in the past can we change things for the better, make a better future, is there hope for humanity? This philosophical ambition and weight elevates the nature of the film itself and makes the difference between pure entertainment and art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi"
